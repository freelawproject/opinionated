R. technician, medical student, or unlicensed foreign medical school graduate acting as first assistant surgeon. On January 8, 1976 a proposed Board rule concerning certain requirements during major surgery was published in the <em>New Jersey Register. </em>Appellants applied to this court for an injunction to enjoin Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>promulgation of the proposed rule. That motion was denied. In response to numerous objections the Board withdrew the proposed rule and proposed instead a substantially revised rule on the subject. The revised rule was approved by the Medical Society of New Jersey and the New Jersey Hospital Association, and thereafter, on August 19, 1976, it was adopted by the Board and is now <em>N. J. A. C. </em>13:35-7.1. Appellants then moved before us for an order permitting review of the Board\u2019s new rule and directing the Board to supplement the record on appeal to include the documents received by the Board in response to its published notices of proposed rule-making. We granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">At oral argument on these appeals counsel stipulated that the October 6, 1975 \u201ccease and desist\u201d decision of the State Board of Medical Examiners is no longer in effect, having been superseded by the now governing rule, <em>N. J. A. C. </em>13:35-7.1. In the circumstances it appears that the October 6, 1975 administrative action of the Board no longer has any impact upon the hospitals involved and that there is no justiciable controversy between the hospitals and the Board in regard to that action. The appeals from the October 6, 1975 decision of the Board have thus become moot and are, accordingly, dismissed. We now proceed to a determination of the validity of the new rule, as embodied in <em>N. J. A. C. </em>13:35-7.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Appellants now contend that (a) \u201c[t]he Board has no statutory power to promulgate the rule in question\u201d; (b) \u201c[t]he rule is void for vagueness\u201d; (c) \u201c[t]he rule is invalid because it is inconsistent with the provisions of the Medical Practice Act\u201d, and (d) \u201c[t]he rule is void as patently arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable, substantively and procedurally.\u201d We find no merit in any of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\"><em>N. J. A. C. </em>13:35-7.1 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">\n<em>Major Surgery</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-8\">(a) Major surgical procedures are those with a hazard to the life, health, or welfare of a patient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>(b) In accordance with the provisions of the Medical Practice Act, N.

It shall be the responsibility of each medical staff to promulgate appropriate rules and regulations in this regard and the medical staff and hospital board of trustees shall assure compliance by the individual physicians.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">(c) A duly qualified surgeon, duly qualified assistant physician, and duly qualified resident shall be determined <em>by </em>the hospital credentials committee in conjunction with the chairman or ehief of the appropriate department or division consistent with the requirements of the Medical Practice Act, N. J. S.

A. 45:9-26, and N. <em>J. S. </em>A. 45:9-27.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Appellants contend that the State Board of Medical Examiners \u201cis limited to licensing practitioners of medicine, disciplining licensed practitioners through revocation and suspension proceedings, and prosecuting others for statutory violations.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We discern no such limitation in the Medical Practice Act. The Board was established by an act entitled \u201cAn act to regulate the practice of medicine and surgery, to license physicians and surgeons, and to punish persons violating the provisions thereof,\u201d <em>L. </em>1894, c. 306, now <em>N. J. S. A. </em>45 :9-1, <em>et seq. </em>\u201c[T]he state has the right to regulate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>practice of medicine,\u201d <em>Black v. MacMahon, </em>130 <em>N. J. L. </em>323, 324-325 (Sup. Ct. 1943), aff\u2019d o.b. 132 <em>N. J. L. </em>171 (E. &amp; A. 1944), and exercises that right through its administrative agency, the State Board of Medical Examiners. Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-4\">[The Board] * * * shall make and adopt all necessary rules, regulations and bylaws not inconsistent with the laws of the State or of the United States, whereby to perform the duties and to transact the business required under the provisions of this article (section 45:9-1 et seq.).

S. A. </em>45:9-22]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">While <em>N. J. S. A. </em>45:9-2 confers upon the board rule-making powers in general terms, \u201call powers and duties incidental and necessary to make such legislation effective are included by implication.\u201d 2A <em>Sutherland, Statutory Construction </em>(4 ed., Sands, 1973), \u00a7 55.04 at 384. See particularly, <em>In matter of suspension and revocation of permit of Carfred, Inc., t/a Heller Pharmacy, etc., </em>73 <em>N. J. </em>\u2014 (1977), wherein Chief Justice Hughes, after referring to holdings in a number of cases in other jurisdictions, including <em>Kansas State Bd. of Healing Arts v. Foote, </em>200 <em>Kan. </em>447, 436 <em>P. </em>2d 828 (Sup. Ct. 1968), and <em>State ex rel. Lentine </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number><em>v. State Bd. of Health, </em>334 <em>Mo. 220, </em>65 <em>S. W. </em>2d 943 (Sup. Ct. 1933), as well as holdings in several New Jersey eases, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-5\">Where, as here, the task of the regulatory agency is \u201cto protect the health and welfare of members of the public\u201d by assuring that all licensed practitioners are qualified, competent and honest, the grant of implied powers is particularly important. [\u2014 N. J. at \u2014 ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">In <em>Kansas State Bd. of Healing Arts v. Foote, supra, </em>the Supreme Court of Kansas pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">The whole purpose and tenor of the healing arts act is the protection of the public against unprofessional, improper, unauthorized and unqualified practice of the healing arts. The goal is to secure to the people the services of competent, trustworthy practitioners. The act seeks to do this through licensure. * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">* * * \u2756 * sp *:\u00ab *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-9\">* * Considering the entire policy expressed in the act, we believe the legislature, by enumerating certain acts and classifying them as unprofessional conduct, did not thereby intend to exclude all other acts or conduct in the practice of the healing arts which by common understanding render the holder of a license unfit to practice. It would indeed be difficult, not to say impractical, in carrying out the purpose of the act, for the legislature to list each and every specific act or course of conduct which might constitute such unprofessional conduct of a disqualifying nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-10\">[436 <em>P. </em>2d at 833]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">Similarly, in <em>Lentine, supra, </em>the Supreme Court of Missouri noted that by particularizing certain acts the Legislature did not intend</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-12\"><em>* </em>* * to thereby exclude all other acts or conduct affecting the practice of medicine and the moral conduct of the physician, in that connection, which by common opinion and fair judgment are found to be in their very nature unprofessional and dishonorable, as grounds or cause for revocation of a license. Rather upon a showing of any of the things enumerated the board of health, and the court upon review, is not called upon in its sound discretion to determine whether such conduct is such as in common judgment is deemed unprofessional and dishonorable, for the statute has expressly declared it so to be. It would not be practicable to the carrying out of the wholesome purpose of the statute to undertake to catalogue, list, or specify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>each, and every act or course of conduct which would, or under what circumstances, constitute bad moral character or unprofessional and dishonorable conduct, and we do not think the Legislature intended to do so. [65 <em>S. W. </em>2d at 950]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">In the circumstances we agree basically with the assessment made by the Attorney General in his supplemental brief submitted on behalf of the respondents on the appeals that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">The regulation contemplates the situation in which the unlicensed assistant will be called upon to actually physically assist with the surgical procedure and in an emergency, to take the place of the surgeon in charge, should complications, or personal disability occur. The proposed regulation is consistent with the Board\u2019s basic duty and exclusive authority to ensure that patients at all times, and in every possible situation be under the care of a qualified licensed physician who is subject to all of the other licensing criteria and disciplinary provisions of the Medical Practice Act and the rules of the Board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Uothing in the regulation impinges upon the surgeon\u2019s exercise of his judgment or application of his skills in performing an operation. Rather, it is designed to insure the availability of competent surgical judgment and skills to the patient throughout the surgical procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">We are, accordingly, satisfied that the rule in question falls entirely within the ambit of the statutory powers and duties, express and implied, of the State Board of Medical Examiners to regulate the practice of medicine and surgery and secure to the people the services of competent, qualified practitioners of these healing arts. See <em>State Bd. of Medical Examiners v. Warren </em>Hospital, 102 <em>N. J. Super. </em>407, 415 (Cty. D. Ct. 1968), aff\u2019d 104 <em>N. J. Super. </em>409 (App. Div. 1969), certif. den. 54 <em>N. J. </em>100 (1969). In the circumstances the reasonableness of the rule is apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">We find no substance in appellants\u2019 claim that the rule, <em>N. J. A. C. </em>13:35-7.1, is inconsistent with that part of the Medical Practice Act which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>The prohibitory provisions of this chapter shall not apply to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">k. A podiatrist, professional nurse, or a registered physical therapist, masseur, while operating in each particular case under the specific direction of a regularly licensed physician or surgeon. <em>* </em>* * <em>[N. J. S. A. </em>45:9-21(k)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Clearly, -the quoted provision does not authorize or sanction any of the designated persons to act as a first assistant surgeon in the performance of major surgery. Eather, it implicitly requires that such persons, in order to claim in a given instance exemption from the prohibitions of the Medical Practice Act, act only within the sphere of their particular professional competence and then only \u201cunder the specific direction of a regularly licensed physician or surgeon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Additionally, it is obvious that <em>N. J. S. A. </em>45:9-21 (k) is inapplicable here for another reason. By its terms it relates solely to persons functioning \u201cunder the specific direction of a regularly licensed physician or surgeon.\u201d We note that one of the purposes of <em>N. J. A. C. </em>13:35-7.1 is to insure that a qualified physician is immediately available should the primary surgeon become suddenly incapacitated. In that eventuality one could hardly expect any \u201cspecific direction\u201d from the primary surgeon. It would be expected that the assistant complete the operation on his or her own.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">Finally, we conclude that the rule is not impermissibly vague. What was said in regard to a municipal ordinance in <em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 <em>U. S. </em>104, 92 <em>S. Ct. </em>2294, 33 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 222 (1972), is equally applicable here, viz:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-10\">Condemned to the use of words, we can never expeet mathematical certainty from our language. The words of the Rockford ordinance are marked by \u201cflexibility and reasonable breadth, rather than meticulous specificity,\u201d Esteban v. Central Missouri State College, 415 F. 2d 1077, 1088 (CA8 1969) (Blackmun, J.), cert. denied, 398 U. S. 965, 90 S. Ct. 2169, 26 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1970), but we think it is clear what the ordinance as a whole prohibits. [408 <em>U. S. </em>at 110, 92 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 2300, 33 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d at 228-229]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Designed to protect the public health, safety and welfare, the rule under review forbids performance of \u201cany major surgical procedure\u201d except by \u201ca duly qualified surgeon with a duly qualified assisting physician, or a duly qualified surgical resident in a training program approved by the Educational Council of the American Medical Association or the American Osteopathic Association, except in matters of dire emergency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">The term \u201cqualified\u201d obviously means fit to perform the particular operation involved. The phrase \u201cmajor surgical procedure\u201d is defined in the rule as one \u201cwith a hazard to the life, health or welfare of a patient.\u201d A major operative procedure is one \u201cinvolving grave risk,\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>(unabridged, 1971) at 1363. See also, <em>Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary </em>(Unabridged Lawyers\u2019 Edition 1961), at 1449, defining major surgery as \u201coperative s[urgery] in which the operation itself is hazardous.\u201d These terms are undoubtedly generally understood by physicians, surgeons and hospitals throughout the State. And the term \u201cappropriate\u201d as used in paragraph (c) of the rule to designate the kind of \u201crules and regulations\u201d to be promulgated by \u201ceach medical staff,\u201d is to be given its ordinary meaning, <em>i. e., </em>\u201cspecially suitable,\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>at 106. Those affected by the rule are, from the language used, given fair notice of the prohibited conduct. The charge that it is \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d has not been sustained. See <em>Parker v. Levy, </em>417 <em>U. S. </em>733, 755-756, 94 <em>S. Ct. </em>2547, 2561, 41 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 439, 457 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The State Board of Medical Examiners properly exercised its rule-making authority in promulgating its rule on \u201cMajor Surgery.\u201d We find no legal infirmity in that rule. <em>N. J. A. C. </em>13:35-7.1 is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Accordingly, the appeals herein are dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b617-8\"> The other two appeals are those by Rancocas Valley Hospital (A-686-75) and Underwood-Memorial Hospital (A\u2014 864\u201475). Each of these is disposed of in accordance with our opinion herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b617-9\">The four hospitals involved in the appeals and five others.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b617-10\">The nine referred to above and one other.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Appellants add that \u201cThe Legislature empowered the Board to determine who is qualified to practice medicine. But, except for specific statutory categories (none of which pertain here) the Legislature did not see fit to dictate through the Medical Practice Act how medicine should be practiced by licensed physicians.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
