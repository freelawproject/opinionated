Appellant contends that a prison disciplinary committee\u2019s decision in 1976 that he forfeit 141 days of extra good time must be vacated in light of a subsequently issued regulation that prohibits the forfeiture of extra good time as a disciplinary measure. 28 CFR \u00a7 523.17(q). The question presented is a legal one, <em>viz., </em>whether this regulation is to be applied retroactively. Being a question of law, we review <em>de novo. United States v. Launder, </em>743 F.2d 686, 688-89 (CA9 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-29\">There are essentially two types of good time credit. Statutory good time is awarded an inmate for good conduct, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4161, while extra good time rewards an inmate for prison industrial employment or for \u201cperforming exceptionally meritorious service or ... duties of outstanding importance in connection with institutional operations.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4162. Federal prison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>officials were traditionally authorized to punish recalcitrant inmates by imposing forfeitures of both statutory and extra good time prior to the issuance of 28 CFR \u00a7 523.17(q). <em>See </em>Federal Prison System Policy Statement 5270.2 at paragraph 9(d)(5) (1975). Neither Congress nor the courts recognized the distinction between statutory and extra good time for punishment purposes before promulgation of 28 CFR \u00a7 523.17(q), and both types of good time were equally forfeitable. <em>See, e.g., </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4165 (\u201cIf during the term of imprisonment a prisoner commits any offense or violates the rules of the institution, all or any part of his earned good time may be forfeited.\u201d). <em>Accord, Seawell v. Rauch, </em>536 F.2d 1283, 1284 (CA9 1976) (per cu-riam).</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-4\">Beyond question, 28 CFR \u00a7 523.-17(q) clearly represents the creation of a right to be free from forfeiture of extra good time, which forfeiture the statutes, case law, and prison regulations formerly allowed. Because the regulation creates a new right, it must be deemed to apply prospectively only, in the absence of any showing of a contrary intent. <em>Greene v. United States, </em>376 U.S. 149, 160, 84 S.Ct. 615, 621, 11 L.Ed.2d 576 (1964) (statutes and regulations). <em>Cf. Nelson v. Serwold, </em>687 F.2d 278, 284 (CA9 1982) (statutes). Appellant\u2019s forfeiture having occurred three years prior to the promulgation of 28 CFR \u00a7 523.17(q), the district court properly rejected his claim. AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
