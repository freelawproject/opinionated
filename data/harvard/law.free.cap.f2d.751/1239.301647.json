Car-man, Judge, granting the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> AAEI-TAG seeks, <em>inter alia, </em>a declaratory judgment that actions taken by the Government pursuant to certain international agreements regulating trade in textile products are void for alleged statutory, administrative and constitutional defects. The Government presses its argument, rejected by Judge Carman, that the CIT lacked jurisdiction over AAEI-TAG\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm the decision of the court below as to jurisdiction and standing, as well as the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AjJz\">A. <em>The Regulatory Scheme.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1327-5\">At the root of the scheme by which the United States regulates international trade in textiles is section 204 of the Agriculture Act of 1956, as amended, 70 Stat. 188, 200, codified at 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1854 (1982). In relevant portion, that statute states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1327-6\">The President may, whenever he determines such action appropriate, negotiate with representatives of foreign governments in an effort to obtain agreements limiting the export from such countries and the importation into the United States of any agricultural commodity or product manufactured therefrom or textiles or textile products, and the President is authorized to issue regulations governing the entry or withdrawal from warehouse of any such commodity, product, textiles, or textile products to carry out such agreements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1327-7\">Section 204 also authorizes the President to issue regulations governing trade in textiles with nations not covered by any agreement, so as to protect the textile trade program which the agreements establish.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-8\">The stem of the Government\u2019s system for regulating the textile trade is the Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles (commonly, the \u201cMultifiber Arrangement\u201d or \u201cMFA\u201d), December 20, 1973, 25 U.S.T. 1001, T.I.A.S. No. 7840. The purpose of the MFA, as announced in its Preamble, is to negate \u201cthe tendency for an unsatisfactory situation to exist in world trade in textile products ... to the detriment of countries participating in trade in textile products, whether as importers or exporters, or both.\u201d Specifically, the MFA includes provisions for \u201cspecial practical co-operation ... with the aim of eliminating difficulties that exist in this field.\u201d <em>Id., </em>art. 1 \u00b6 1. There are provisions for gradual elimination of restrictions in the textile trade. <em>Id., </em>art. 2. Parties to the MFA may impose quotas, however, in conjunction with a request for consultations with other parties, upon a determination that imports \u201care causing market disruption as defined in Annex A.\u201d <em>Id., </em>art. 3, \u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-14\">Annex A, thus referred to in article 3, declares that a determination that the potential for market disruption exists should \u201cbe based on the existence of serious damage to domestic producers or actual threat thereof.\u201d The Annex lists certain factors which bear on a determination of market disruption, and requires that these factors be considered.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Following a determination of market disruption and a call for consultations, the parties may agree on measures to rectify the market disruption; but, if they cannot agree, the importing country may take certain unilateral protective actions. <em>Id., </em>art. 3, \u00b6 5. This procedure is subject to review by the Textile Surveillance Body, an international organization created within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). <em>Id. </em>art. 3, \u00b6 5(iii); art. 10, \u00b6 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-15\">The MFA, in an effort to \u201celiminate real risks of market disruption (as defined in Annex A),\u201d also encourages parties to enter into <em>bilateral </em>textile trade agreements the terms of which should be consistent with the MFA. <em>Id., </em>art. 4, \u00b6 2. Under this provision, the United States has entered into bilateral agreements with other parties to the MFA and with nonparties. Typical of the latter, and of special concern in the present case, is the Agreement Relating to Cotton, Wool and Manmade Fiber Textiles and Textile Products, Sept. 17, 1980, between the United States and the People\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>Republic of China (P.R.C.), 32 U.S.T. 2071, T.I.A.S. No. 9820. This agreement with the P.R.C. sets forth quantitative limits on exports of different categories of textiles and textile products to the United States; categories not specifically covered fall within a residuary provision. In particular, the agreement establishes a consultation mechanism tied to the market disruption standard of the MFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-4\">In the United States, the President has delegated all of his authority under section 204 to administrative agencies, the most important of which (for the purposes of this case) is the Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA). <em>See, </em>Exec. Order No. 11,651, 37 Fed.Reg. 4699 (1972), as amended, reprinted following 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1854 (1984 Supp.). CITA has the authority under section 204 to (1) negotiate bilateral agreements, (2) to carry through the consultation mechanism described above, (3) to implement all resulting agreements, and (4) to order unilateral imposition of quotas in accordance with the provisions of the MFA and bilateral arrangements. AAEI-TAG challenges CITA\u2019s actions with regard to the second and fourth of these functions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-5\">B. <em>AAEI-TAG\u2019s Complaint.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-6\">The gist of AAEI-TAG\u2019s complaint is that CITA has requested consultations and unilaterally instituted quotas without a proper finding of \u201cmarket disruption,\u201d as required by the MFA and the bilateral agreements.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> AAEI-TAG claims that CITA has improperly requested consultations or undertaken unilateral actions on 75 occasions between 1980 and 1982.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Of particular concern to AAEI-TAG, as evidenced by the detailed treatment in its complaint, is the unilateral imposition of quotas on Chinese textile imports lower than those established by the U.S.-P.R.C. agreement. AAEI-TAG alleges that CITA\u2019s actions have irreparably harmed its members through additional costs, delays, embargoes, and disruption of orders subject to irrevocable letters of credit. CITA\u2019s actions are challenged on several grounds, the most important of which are that CITA: (1) acted arbitrarily and capriciously; (2) exceeded the scope of its statutory authority under section 204; and (3) violated the rulemaking provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (1982). AAEI-TAG also includes a constitutional due process argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-12\">In support of its first argument, AAEITAG points to a Department of Commerce solicitation which sought assistance in collecting data on the United States apparel market.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The solicitation states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1328-13\">There is a critical need for such data. At present, there is a lack of sufficient and timely apparel production, sales, consumption, and price data. This information is necessary to identify and substantiate market disruption____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1328-14\">Presently, OTEXA [the Commerce Department office responsible for providing CITA with administrative support] uses current import data and production data that range from 12 to 24 months old.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AU1S\">AAEI-TAG points to this \u201cadmission\u201d by the Government, and asserts that CITA\u2019s actions are not based on a proper determination of market disruption as required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>the MFA and bilateral agreements. The resulting requests for consultation and unilateral imposition of import restrictions are, according to AAEI-TAG, arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-4\">AAEI-TAG bases its argument as to statutory authority on its interpretation of section 204 which views that provision as having granted the President two separate powers. The first authorizes the President (through CITA) to negotiate with foreign governments in an effort to obtain agreements limiting textile imports into the United States. AAEI-TAG concedes that the President has full discretion in this area, since Congress called for such negotiations \u201cwhenever he [the President] deems appropriate.\u201d The second authorization in section 204 allows the President to issue regulations governing textile trade \u201cto carry out any such agreement.\u201d The argument runs that Congress, by using the phrase \u201cto carry out,\u201d intended to authorize only such regulations which properly implement the very agreements the President has negotiated. In a corollary argument, AAEI-TAG contends that Congress intended to incorporate the terms of the agreements into the statute, and that, by violating the strict terms of the agreement, CITA exceeded its statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-5\">With regard to the procedure CITA employs, AAEI-TAG claims that CITA\u2019s requests for consultations and the unilateral impositions of quotas are administrative actions subject to the notice and comment provisions of the APA. Moreover, according to AAEI-TAG, denial of an opportunity to be heard prior to imposition of quotas violates the importers\u2019 due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-12\">C. <em>Opinion of the Court of International Trade.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1329-13\">Judge Carman first rejected the Government\u2019s objections to the CIT\u2019s jurisdiction. That objection centers on whether AAEITAG\u2019s claim was brought before the CIT under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(a), which requires exhaustion of administrative remedies in the Customs Service prior to an action in the CIT, or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(i), which does not.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Judge Carman noted that \u201ca denied protest [by the Customs Service] is not an absolute precondition to the Court of International Trade\u2019s exercise of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d To distinguish between those instances in which a protest is necessary and when it is not, the court looked to our predecessor court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States Cane Sugar Refiners\u2019 Association v. Block, </em>683 F.2d 399, 402 n. 5 (CCPA 1982), in which the CCPA stated that the CIT has jurisdiction under \u00a7 1581(i), prior to the exhaustion of administrative remedies, in cases \u201cinvolving the potential for immediate injury and irreparable harm to an industry and a substantial impact on the national economy.\u201d Judge Carman distinguished another case, <em>Uniroyal, Inc. v. United States, </em>687 F.2d 467, 471 (CCPA 1982), as having involved merchandise already brought into the United States; in that situation, the court ruled that the im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>porter was required to exhaust all avenues of protest with the Customs Service and appeal under \u00a7 1581(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-4\">On the merits of AAEI-TAG\u2019s claim, the CIT ruled that \u201cthe court must, at a minimum scrutinize the statute and the actions taken under it to determine if the scope of the delegation [from Congress to the President] was exceeded.\u201d The court then held that section 204 conveyed to the President an extraordinarily broad (though constitutionally sound) measure of discretion, and that CITA\u2019s actions, if rationally related to the statutory purpose, must be upheld. CITA\u2019s challenged actions were decided to be within that delegated authority. Moreover, the CIT determined that \u201cTo the extent ... that plaintiff contests CITA\u2019s findings of market disruption and inquiries into its reasoning, such claims are beyond judicial scrutiny.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-6\">JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-7\">The Government strongly pursues its contention that the CIT lacked jurisdiction over this case. That issue translates into the question whether a party challenging an import restriction imposed by CITA must attempt to import a textile product, have the Customs Service deny entry, protest the decision within Customs, and then, following denial of the protest, bring an action in the CIT under \u00a7 1581(a), <em>supra; </em>or whether a prospective importer (prior to attempting an import) may challenge CITA\u2019s actions in the CIT under \u00a7 1581(i), <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-8\">Section 1581(i) provides in terms that the CIT \u201cshall have <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction over <em>any </em>civil action ... that arises out of <em>any law </em>of the United States providing for \u2014 ... (3) embargoes or other <em>quantitative restrictions </em>... or (4) <em>administration and enforcement </em>with respect to matters referred to in [paragraph 3].\u201d (Emphasis added.) On the face of the statute, AAEI-TAG\u2019S claim fits squarely. Section 204 is a law providing for quantitative restrictions on textiles. AAEI-TAG objects to CITA\u2019s administration and enforcement of the quotas established under the authority of section 204, as described in Part I B., <em>supra. </em>Even if one chooses a restrictive interpretation of the broad terms Congress employed in paragraphs 3 and 4 of \u00a7 1581(i), this case meets the literal language of that additional jurisdictional provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-13\">The legislative history confirms this conclusion. Prior to promulgation of the present version of \u00a7 1581 in the Customs Court Act of 1980, Pub.L. No. 96-417, 94 Stat. 1728, the jurisdiction of the Customs Court (now the CIT) was limited to the review of the Customs Service\u2019s denial of protests concerning the exclusion, classification, or valuation of imported merchandise. The Customs Court\u2019s jurisdiction was \u201cexclusive\u201d; in fact, the statute providing for federal question jurisdiction over importation matters in the district courts specifically denied the district courts concurrent jurisdiction with the Customs Court over international trade matters.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This seemingly simple division of jurisdiction soon created a problem: since the Customs Court had jurisdiction only after Customs\u2019 denial of a protest, and since the federal question statute denied the district courts jurisdiction only over those matters in which the Customs Service had jurisdiction, could a prospective importer challenge in district court a Customs Service regulation prior to actual importation (and, therefore, prior to a protest)?</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-14\">The cases on this issue in the courts of appeals were not uniform.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In <em>Sneaker Circus, Inc. v. Carter, </em>566 F.2d 396 (2d Cir.1977), the Second Circuit ruled that the district court had jurisdiction over a case in which a prospective importer challenged Customs Service regulations promulgated pursuant to international agreements. The court reasoned that these agreements would be enforced abroad, restricting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>opportunity for an importer to attempt to bring in merchandise beyond the agreements\u2019 terms. Since in that situation the Customs Service would never have the opportunity to consider a protest, the Customs Court could never obtain jurisdiction, and the district courts had jurisdiction under the federal question statute. 566 F.2d at 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-4\">The District of Columbia Circuit reached an opposite result in <em>Consumers Union of the United States, Inc. v. Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements, </em>561 F.2d 872 (1977) <em>(per </em>curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 933, 98 S.Ct. 1509, 55 L.Ed.2d 531 (1978). Consumers Union challenged CITA\u2019s import restrictions prior to any attempt to import merchandise beyond CITA\u2019s ceilings. That court of appeals ruled that the district court lacked jurisdiction: \u201cHere ... if anyone wishes to challenge the Committee\u2019s actions, he can do so as other challenges of that nature are made, <em>i.e., </em>as an importer ... bringing textiles into the United States.\u201d 561 F.2d at 874. Contrary to the Second Circuit\u2019s opinion, the court ruled that judicial review of CITA\u2019s actions could be had only in the Customs Court following the denial of a protest by the Customs Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-5\">In the Customs Court Act, Congress specifically sought to resolve the confusion between the district courts\u2019 and the then Customs Court\u2019s jurisdictions. S.Rep. No. 466, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 4-5; H.Rep. No. 1235, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 29-30 (1980), <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 3729, 3741. The Senate Report clearly states the intended effect of the new statute, and its reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1331-6\">Because the statutes defining the jurisdiction of the Customs Court are so intricate and because international trade problems have become so complex, it has become increasingly more difficult to determine, in advance, whether or not a particular case falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Customs Court and is therefore excluded from the jurisdiction of the district courts. The result has been demonstrated by the fact that a significant number of civil actions have been initiated in the district courts only to be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. See, for example, ... <em>Consumers Union of United States, Inc. v. Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements, [supra </em>]____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1331-8\">... The amended bill attempts to solve this problem by clarifying the existing jurisdictional statutes relating to the United States Customs Court and by <em>expanding the jurisdiction of the Court </em>to include any civil actions involving im- . ports and a statute, constitutional provision, treaty, executive agreement or executive order which is directly and substantially concerned with international trade.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1331-9\">S.Rep. No. 466, <em>supra, </em>at 4-5 (emphasis added). The House Report, though not so direct, is to the same effect: \u201cThe dismissal of these actions after great expenditures of time and resources, has produced frustration on the part of litigants and the courts. H.R. 7540 will resolve this problem by defining the demarcation between the Court of International Trade and the federal district courts____\u201d H.Rep. No. 1235, <em>supra, </em>at 30, U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Admin. News 1980, p. 3741.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-11\">The main thrust of the Senate Report seems to us to be that Congress intended to put aside the <em>Consumers Union </em>rationale <em>and </em>to expand the jurisdiction of the CIT. The objective of the addition of \u00a7 1581(i) was to make it clear that the CIT was to be <em>the </em>forum, and that prospective importers challenging Customs Service regulations imposing import restrictions need not attempt to import merchandise, file a protest and then contest the administrative denial of the protest in the CIT under \u00a7 1581(a). <em>See, Sneakers Circus, supra. </em>The decision to <em>clarify </em>and <em>expand </em>the jurisdiction of the CIT \u2014 rather than to clarify the jurisdiction of the district courts\u2014 as a means for resolving the jurisdictional problem indicates that Congress intended plaintiffs in appellants\u2019 shoes to bring their cases in the CIT rather than in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>Similarly, the House Report stresses the legislative purpose of clarifying the boundary between the CIT\u2019s and district courts\u2019 jurisdiction. If those challenging import restrictions must exhaust their remedies with the Customs Service, as the Government urges here, CIT jurisdiction will then arise under \u00a7 1581(a). Little scope, if any, would remain for \u00a7 1581(i). If anything were left of that new provision, it would be exceedingly narrow and of indeterminate and inconclusive impact. This result is plainly contrary to Congress\u2019 purpose in enacting \u00a7 1581(i) \u2014 to establish clear rules and to center international trade litigation in the CIT. We refuse to create a jurisdictional morass when Congress exerted its efforts to remove one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-4\">The decisions relied upon below support this conclusion. In <em>U.S. Cane Sugar, supra, </em>the plaintiff objected to quotas on sugar imports. The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals noted that, absent \u00a7 1581(i), the case would have gone to the district courts; the court concluded that jurisdiction under \u00a7 1581(i) was appropriate and found relief under \u00a7 1581(a) to be \u201cmanifestly inadequate.\u201d 683 F.2d at 402 n. 5. In <em>Uniroyal, supra, </em>on the other hand, the importer had already entered the goods in this country, and the goods were subject to redelivery (a situation quite different from the plight of a prospective importer who faces quantitative import restrictions). The court there held only that \u00a7 1581(i) could not be used where \u00a7 1581(a) was already completely available. The present case falls squarely within the <em>U.S. Cane Sugar </em>rule, and the CIT properly considered the substance of AAEI-TAG\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1332-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-6\">STANDING</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-7\">The Government also disputes here, as it did in the CIT, AAEI-TAG\u2019s standing to bring this suit. As Judge Carman correctly held, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2631(i) declares that an action under \u00a7 1581(i) \u201cmay be commenced in the [CIT] by any person adversely affected by agency action within the meaning of section 702 of Title 5\u201d; and AAEI-TAG represents persons having a direct interest in purchasing the textile and apparel products now involved (and with contractual relationships based thereon), who will be injured by the quantitative restraint under attack. That is sufficient under the law. <em>Cf. Florsheim Shoe Company v. United States, </em>744 F.2d 787, 790-92 (Fed.Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-12\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-13\">MERITS</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-14\">AAEI-TAG\u2019s arguments on the merits divide into three separate areas of inquiry, and we shape our discussion accordingly. AAEI-TAG first claims that CITA failed to abide by its statutory authority when it requested consultations or imposed unilateral quotas on textile imports. Second, it is charged that CITA acted arbitrarily in that it failed to lay the proper factual foundation for a determination of market disruption as required by the MFA and the bilateral agreements. The third objection to CITA\u2019s actions is that the agency violated AAEI-TAG\u2019s members\u2019 statutory and constitutional rights to have notice of the proposed actions and an opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-15\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-16\">The core of AAEI-TAG\u2019s first argument is that CITA\u2019s imposition of import restrictions must, under section 204, be carefully crafted \u201cto carry out\u201d \u2014 in the sense of \u201cexecuting\u201d \u2014 the international agreements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>into which the United States has entered. AAEI-TAG insists that the phrase \u201cto carry out\u201d means \u201cto implement\u201d or \u201cto put into execution.\u201d The conclusion follows, according to AAEI-TAG, that CITA must follow explicitly the terms of the international agreements; otherwise, CITA has failed \u201cto carry out\u201d the agreements, and CITA\u2019s actions are beyond the scope of its congressionally delegated authority. By using the phrase \u201cto carry out,\u201d AAEITAG specifically asserts, Congress intended to incorporate the terms of any agreements concluded pursuant to section 204 into that statute itself.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1333-4\">We are not persuaded, however, that the statutory phrase \u201cto carry out\u201d has the narrow meaning which AAEI-TAG ascribes to it. That Congress authorized the President to implement the textile trade agreements by regulation does not imply that Congress restricted the President\u2019s discretion in this regard by requiring him to implement the agreements in the particular manner seen by appellant. On the contrary, the beginning of Section 204 says that the President \u201cmay, whenever he determines such action appropriate\u201d \u2014 and that preamble covers, not only negotiation with foreign representatives, but also the issuance of regulations \u201cto carry out\u201d the negotiated agreements. That is a broad grant of authority to the President in the international field in which congressional delegations are normally given a broad construction. <em>South Puerto Rico Sugar Co. Trading Corp. v. United States, </em>167 Ct.Cl. 236, 334 F.2d 622, 632 (Ct.Cl.1964). Of course, the President\u2019s regulations must pertain to the general subject of the agreements, or else the President (absent another statutory authorization) has invaded a field granted by the Constitution to Congress. The statute itself, however, imposes no restrictions on the President\u2019s administration of the textile trade program. There are no procedural requirements nor limitations. We find no basis, either within section 204 itself, the overall statutory scheme, or the legislative history, to add more to the statute than meets the eye. All that is needed is that the President\u2019s action be relevant to the enforcement of some existing textile agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-7\">AAEI-TAG argues that, in a situation comparable to this, courts have viewed international agreements as incorporated into a statute, and have construed them together. The cases AAEI-TAG cites are clearly inapposite. For example, in <em>United States v. Star Industries, Inc., </em>462 F.2d 557, 59 CCPA 159 <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 1076, 93 S.Ct. 678, 34 L.Ed.2d 663 (1972), the court upheld a presidential proclamation revising the Tariff Schedules of the United States, issued pursuant to the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The court considered the effect of the GATT on the President\u2019s authority; it did so, however, because the statute required the President to maintain \u201cdue regard for the international obligations of the United States.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1882(c) (1982). The court concluded that, under the terms of the proclamation, \u201cthe legislative intent to take strong measures against those who maintain unreasonable import restrictions was upheld, and at the same time we did not breach our international obligations.\u201d 462 F.2d at 564. In another case AAEI-TAG cites, <em>China Liquor Distribution Co. v. United States, </em>343 F.2d 1005, 52 CCPA 1 (1964), the relevant statute explicitly stated that nothing therein should apply if inconsistent with the United States\u2019 treaty obligations. The present statute, which involves no provision confin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>ing its scope to the terms of an international arrangement, differs sharply from these other laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-4\">We accentuate, again, that legislation conferring upon the President discretion to regulate foreign commerce invokes, and is reinforced and augmented by, the President\u2019s constitutional power to oversee the political side of foreign affairs. \u201cIn the intercourse of nations, changes in economic relationships have many an important political corollary.\u201d <em>South Puerto Rico Sugar Co. Trading Corp. v. United States, supra, </em>334 F.2d at 630. In the area of international trade, \u201cintimately involved in foreign affairs,\u201d \u201ccongressional authorizations of presidential power should be given a broad construction and not \u2018hemmed in\u2019 or \u2018cabined, cribbed, confined\u2019 by anxious judicial blinders.\u201d <em>Florsheim Shoe Co. v. United States, </em>744 F.2d 787, 793 (Fed.Cir. 1984), <em>quoting South Puerto Rico Sugar, supra, </em>334 F.2d at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-6\">AAEI-TAG contends that CITA\u2019s regulations, even if authorized, are not based on a sufficient factual foundation, and are, therefore, arbitrary and capricious. We are pointed toward the Commerce Department\u2019s solicitation requesting better information on textile trade, and are told that the Government has thereby conceded that it cannot meet the requirements of the MFA or the bilateral agreements that an accurate determination of market disruption precede any action to lower the quotas. This argument, too, must fail. We note, first of all, that AAEI-TAG rests on the slimmest of bases when it contends that a request for <em>better </em>information means that the Government\u2019s past market evaluations are inadequate. In addition, it is very doubtful that the agreements confer any private right of action even on adversely affected importers. Those agreements are between separate governments, and the relevant portions of the agreements refer to the \u201cbelief\u201d or \u201cview\u201d or \u201copinion\u201d of the governments themselves (in this instance, the United States). This is not the type of language investing private parties with individual rights; the whole thrust, rather, is to leave these matters within the countries\u2019 own processes of international negotiation and decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-8\">Most importantly, AAEI-TAG\u2019s suggestion that we review CITA\u2019s determinations that market disruption exists leads us into a field on which the judiciary is normally forbidden to tread. In a great case in this area, <em>United States v. Curtiss-Wright Corp., </em>299 U.S. 304, 57 S.Ct. 216, 81 L.Ed. 255 (1986), Congress had authorized the President to restrict exports of arms to South America if the President determined that such a restriction would advance the cause of peace. The President issued a proclamation announcing a restriction in accordance with Congress\u2019 resolution. Curtiss-Wright contended that the President\u2019s finding did not suffice to trigger his authority under the resolution. The Supreme Court responded: \u201cThere is no suggestion that the resolution is fatally uncertain or indefinite; and a finding which follows its language, as this finding does, cannot well be challenged as insufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331, 57 S.Ct. at 226. We recently dealt in <em>Florsheim Shoe, supra, </em>744 F.2d at 795-96, with an international trade issue very similar to the present one, and reiterated that \u201cOnce it is determined, as we have just done, that the President\u2019s exercise of his authority ... was within his constitutionally delegated power, there is no further role for the CIT or for this court____ The President\u2019s findings of fact and the motivations for his actions are not subject to review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-11\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-12\">AAEI-TAG\u2019s procedural argument hinges on section 4 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (1982), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1334-13\">(c) General notice of proposed rule making shall be published in the Federal Register, unless persons subject thereto are named and either personally served or have actual notice thereof in accordance with law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>The section further requires that, after notice, the agency must receive comments from interested parties. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(d). AAEI-TAG claims that CITA violated these notice-and-comment requirements, and its actions are, therefore, void.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1335-4\">The Government counters with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(a), which excludes agency action from the notice-and-comment provision \u201cto the extent that there is involved \u2014 (1) a military <em>or foreign affairs function </em>of the United States.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The only two cases to consider the impact of the APA on regulations issued under the authority of section 204 have held that the notice-and-comment procedure is unnecessary on the basis of the foreign affairs exemption. <em>Consumers Union v. CITA, </em>Civil Action No. 74-968 (D.D.C.1975), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>561 F.2d 872, <em>supra; Mast Industries, Inc. v. Regan, </em>18 Cust.B. &amp; Dec. No. 44 at 139, 596 F.Supp. 1567 (CIT 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-5\">We agree that CITA\u2019s imposition of quotas is exempt from the APA by virtue of \u00a7 553(a)(1). The purpose of the exemption was to allow more cautious and sensitive consideration of those matters which \u201cso affect relations with other Governments that, for example, public rule-making provisions would provoke definitely undesirable international consequences.\u201d H.Rep. No. 1980, 69th Cong., 2d Sess. 23 (1946); <em>see also, </em>S.Rep. No. 752, 69th Cong., 1st Sess. 13 (1945). Prior disclosure of the Government\u2019s intention to trigger the agreements\u2019 consultation provisions or to impose stricter import restrictions would \u201cprovoke definitely undesirable international consequences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-6\">First, prior announcement of CITA\u2019s intention to impose stricter quotas pending consultations creates an incentive for foreign interests and American importers to increase artificially the amount of trade in textiles prior to a final administrative determination. American importers would want to increase inventories in the face of the prospect that foreign supplies could drop below current levels. Foreign manufacturers would have a great incentive to dump (in the literal and technical senses of the word) as much merchandise as possible into the United States, since the quotas CITA imposes are based on the levels of trade in the preceding months.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The expansion in American imports between the date of notice and date of the final rule would exacerbate the market disruption which led CITA to act in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-10\">Second, as discussed in Part IV A and B, <em>supra, </em>CITA\u2019s authority derives in part from the President\u2019s foreign affairs power. The President may use his authority under section 204, through CITA, as a part of his overall foreign policy. The timing of an announcement of new consultations or quotas may be linked intimately with the Government\u2019s overall political agenda concerning relations with another country. Were we to require that CITA provide notice thirty days before they take affect, the President\u2019s power to conduct foreign policy would plainly be hampered. This is a result that should not be countenanced absent the clearest of indications from Congress. <em>See Yassini v. Crosland, </em>618 F.2d 1356, 1361 (9th Cir.1980) (Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service regulation \u201cdesigned to further the policy expressed in the Presidential directive [concerning the Government\u2019s response to the hostage crisis in Iran]\u201d exempt from notice-and-comment provision of the APA).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-4\">AAEI-TAG\u2019s due process claim likewise has no merit. A prerequisite for due process protection is some interest worthy of protecting; \u201cWe must look to see if the interest is within the [Constitution\u2019s] protection of liberty and property.\u201d <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 571, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). A protectable interest must be more than a \u201cunilateral expectation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 577, 92 S.Ct. at 2709. Those seeking constitutional protection under the due process clause must point to a \u201clegitimate claim of entitlement\u201d prior to any consideration of the Government\u2019s constitutional obligations. <em>Arnett v. Kennedy, </em>416 U.S. 134, 167, 94 S.Ct. 1633, 1650, 40 L.Ed.2d 15 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-5\">The importers represented by AAEI-TAG cannot do so. We have already held that no statute or international agreement gives them a proprietary interest. There is no other basis for entitlement. \u2022 CITA has not taken from them any merchandise which they have already purchased. CITA has merely limited the amounts which the importers can purchase in the future. The mere subjective expectation of a future business transaction does not rise to the level of an interest worthy of constitutional protection. <em>Perry v. Sinderman, </em>408 U.S. 593, 603, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 2700, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972). No one has a protectable interest to engage in international trade. <em>Norwegian Nitrogen Products Co. v. United States, </em>288 U.S. 294, 53 S.Ct. 350, 77 L.Ed. 796 (1933); <em>Yoshida International, supra, </em>526 F.2d at 580. Absent such an interest, AAEI-TAG\u2019s due process argument must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-6\">For these reasons, the decision of the Court of International Trade is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1326-10\">. AAEI-TAG is a trade association representing domestic importers and retailers of textile and apparel products. The American Fiber/Textile/Apparel Coalition, an association of trade organizations and unions involved in the textile and apparel industry in this country, intervened below on behalf of the Government, and has filed a brief in this court. Hilaturas Lerma, S.A., intervened as plaintiff below, but has not participated in this appeal.

The Government also contests AAEI-TAG\u2019s standing to bring this suit. <em>See </em>Part III. <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1327-9\">. MFA, Annex A, \u00b6 I states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1327-10\">The determination of a situation of \"market disruption\u201d ... shall be based on the existence of serious damage to domestic producers or actual threat thereof ____ The existence of damage shall be determined on the basis of an examination of the appropriate factors having a bearing on the evolution of the state of the industry in question such as: turnover, market share, profits, export performance, employment, volume of disruptive and other imports, production, utilization of capacity, productivity and investments.

Community Nutrition Institute, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2450, 81 L.Ed.2d 270 (1984) turns on the specific structure of that particular Act (Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937) and its own statutory objectives.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1333-5\">. AAEI-TAG supports this position by noting that the executive branch has no inherent authority to impose restraints on imports, and may do so only if so empowered by Congress. <em>See, United States v. Yoshida International, Inc., </em>526 F.2d 560, 63 CCPA 15 (1975); <em>Consumers Union of the United States, Inc. v.

AAEI-TAG then infers that vigorous judicial review is appropriate to insure that the President stays within these statutory bounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1335-7\">. The Government concedes, for purposes of this appeal, that CITA\u2019s activities constitute rule-making under the APA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1335-8\">. Under Annex B of the MFA, import restraints may not be less than the level of actual imports during the twelve month period ending two months prior to the month of the consultation request.
