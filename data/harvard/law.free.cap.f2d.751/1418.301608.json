EDWARDS.</p>\n<author id=\"b1504-26\">HARRY T. EDWARDS, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1504-27\">This case presents the question whether a mine operator violates section 105(c)(1) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1419\">*1419</page-number>1977 (\u201cMine Act\u201d or the \u201cAct\u201d) when it refuses to allow nonemployee representatives of coal miners to monitor safety training programs on mine property. Section 105(c)(1) prohibits mine operators from discriminating against or otherwise interfering with the exercise of the statutory rights of any miner or representative of miners. Our review of the Mine Act and its legislative history reveals no statutory right of nonemployee representatives to monitor on-site training classes. Consequently, we affirm the decision of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission that respondent Martin County Coal Corp. (\u201cMartin\u201d) did not violate section 105(c)(1) when it refused to permit petitioner Council of the Southern Mountains (the \u201cCouncil\u201d) to attend training sessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-4\">We recognize that the petitioner has raised an important question concerning whether miners\u2019 representatives can effectively exercise rights granted them by the Act and its implementing regulations without a concomitant right to monitor safety training classes. The appropriate way to resolve this issue, however, is for the Council to petition the Secretary of Labor (the \u201cSecretary\u201d) for a rulemaking. In this instance it is clear that Congress intended for the Secretary, not the courts, to elaborate the statute and to develop means to effectuate its purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"a0u-dedup-0\">A. <em>The Mine Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1505-6\">In 1977, Congress combined protection for all miners previously covered under two separate statutes, the Federal Metal and Nonmetallic Mine Safety Act of 1966,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and assigned its administration to the Department of Labor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Secretary of Labor was given the responsibility of promulgating mandatory health and safety standards,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> while an independent adjudicatory entity, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (\u201cFMSHRC\u201d or the \u201cCommission\u201d), was established to settle, in the first instance, disputes arising under the new Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1505-14\">This legislation was, in large part, a response to the history of frequent and tragic mining disasters occurring in the United States, such as those at Sunshine Silver Mine, Buffalo Creek, and Blacksville in 1972, at Scotia in 1976, and at Tower City in 1977. In Congress, there was a widely held belief that many mining deaths could have been avoided if the miners had been adequately trained in emergency safety techniques. At the Sunshine Mine, for example, ninety-one miners died of asphyxiation either because they did not know how to use self-rescuers or because of the failure of mine management to provide a secondary escape route. At the Blacksville mine, miners were trapped when a piece of equipment caught fire, and then died because those at the scene of the fire had not been adequately trained in emergency procedures.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1505-15\">In an effort to curb mining tragedies, Congress required in section 115<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the 1977 Act that all miners receive regular and adequate health and safety training. This section compels mine operators to im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1420\">*1420</page-number>plement training programs which have been approved by the Secretary. It specifies, <em>inter alia, </em>subjects of instruction and the minimum number of hours of requisite training for miners of different experience levels, and instructs the Secretary to promulgate more detailed regulations regarding these programs.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1506-4\">Congress further recognized that if its national mine safety and health program was to be truly effective, miners and their representatives must play an active part in enforcing the Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In order to promote miner and representative participation, section 105(c)(1) of the Act protects both miners and their representatives from discharge or any other form of interference or discrimination because of the exercise of a statutory right afforded by the Act,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1421\">*1421</page-number>eluding rights related to safety training.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1507-4\">Congress enumerated certain statutory rights which miners\u2019 representatives acquired under the Act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> For example, a miners\u2019 representative can obtain an immediate federal inspection of a mine when she or he has reasonable grounds to believe that there has been a violation of the Act or of a mandatory health and safety standard,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> including a violation of training program standards. A miners\u2019 representative also has the right to accompany the Secretary or the Secretary\u2019s representative on specified inspections of the mine.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Act allows interested persons, including representatives, to inspect certificates of miners\u2019 completion of mandatory training programs at the mine site.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However, Congress did not expressly provide for the on-site monitoring of training programs. Rather, Congress left the details of designing and supervising the training programs to the Secretary of Labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-5\">B. <em>History of this Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"AOHz\">The Council describes itself as a grassroots citizen\u2019s organization which, since 1913, has worked to improve health and safety conditions in the Appalachian coal mines.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The petitioner is registered with the Mine Safety and Health Administration (\u201cMSHA\u201d) as the representative,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> for purposes of the Act,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> of miners at the Martin County Coal mines 1-C and 1-S in Martin County, Kentucky. As the miners\u2019 representative, the Council has taken an active interest in the development and implementation of safety training programs at these mines. At issue here is the Council\u2019s desire to monitor training classes at Martin to ensure that miners receive adequate safety instruction as mandated by the Mine Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-14\">It is unnecessary to review in detail the somewhat complicated history of the Council\u2019s requests of Martin that it be allowed to monitor safety training classes.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> It suffices to note here that Martin repeatedly refused permission for the Council to enter mine property for that purpose<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and that, as a consequence, the Council initiated the instant proceeding, alleging that this refusal constituted interference with its exercise of a right granted by the Act, in violation of section 105(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-15\">The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cAU\u201d) who first heard the case ruled in the Council\u2019s favor. His interpretation of section 115 led him \u201cto find that nonemployee miners\u2019 representatives ... have an implied right\u201d to observe safety instruction.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The AU considered the requirement in section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1422\">*1422</page-number>115(a)(1) that miners be instructed in their statutory rights and in those of their representatives, and also the indication in section 115(b) that training may sometimes be conducted at a location other than the normal place of work, and from these provisions he inferred a statutory right of representatives to monitor safety instruction.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> On this basis, the AU held that Martin violated section 105(c)(1) of the Act by refusing to allow the Council to monitor training sessions.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1508-4\">On discretionary review, the FMSHRC reversed the AU.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Observing that \u201c[n]either the Mine Act nor its legislative history \u2014nor, for that matter, the Secretary\u2019s extensive regulations implementing section 115 of the Act \u2014 refers to a right of miners\u2019 representatives to monitor training classes,\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> the Commission held that Martin\u2019s refusal to allow the Council to monitor safety instruction did not violate section 105(c)(1) of the Act. The Council appeals the FMSHRC\u2019s decision to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1508-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b1508-6\">A mine operator does not violate section 105(c)(1) unless it discriminates against or otherwise interferes with the exercise of the statutory rights of miners or their representatives.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> It is clear, therefore, that unless the Council has a statutory right to enter mine property for the purpose of monitoring safety instruction, Martin\u2019s refusal to accede to the Council\u2019s demands for access cannot violate section 105(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1508-15\">Our review of the statute and its legislative history, like the Commission\u2019s, yields no indication that Congress intended to confer such a right on miners\u2019 representatives. Section 115 requires mine operators to offer their miners adequate safety and health training and commands the Secretary to promptly promulgate regulations concerning these training programs. As the Commission held, this portion of the statute does not compel \u201ca monitoring right for non-employee miners\u2019 representatives on mine property,\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> nor does any other section of the Act. Although the legislative history demonstrates a strong congressional concern over the problem of poorly trained miners,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> it contains no suggestion that Congress considered the monitoring issue.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Consequently, we are constrained to hold that the Mine Act does not provide non-employee miners\u2019 representatives with a statutory right to monitor on-site safety training and, therefore, that Martin County Coal did not violate section 105(c)(1) by refusing to allow the Council to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1423\">*1423</page-number>observe safety instruction conducted on mine property.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1509-4\">In its briefs and at oral argument, the petitioner contended that other explicit rights given to miners\u2019 representatives by the Act and the training program regulations issued by the Secretary,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> such as a representative\u2019s right under section 103(g) to request a federal mine inspection when she or he has reasonable grounds to believe that an operator has violated training program standards, cannot be exercised effectively without a corresponding right to monitor training classes. This argument raises an important and wholly legitimate concern, for it is surely possible that representatives cannot adequately fulfill their statutory functions and serve the interests of miners without a right to observe training sessions. Nevertheless, there is no reasonable way for the court to assess this issue on the record at hand. In our view, the proper method of resolving this issue is for the Council to petition the Secretary for appropriate rulemaking.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> It is clear from section 115(a) that Congress intended that the Secretary, not the courts, articulate the specific details regarding the development, implementation, and supervision of safety training programs. Moreover, the Secretary is better able, given his expertise concerning mine operations and his ability to gather evidence, to work out the minutiae of a monitoring right \u2014 such as who has access, when, for how long, and under what conditions-\u2022than is an appellate court, especially in this case, given the very limited factual record that is before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1509-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1509-8\">Neither the Mine Act nor its legislative history reveal any congressional intent to confer upon nonemployee miners\u2019 representatives a statutory right to monitor on mine property the safety training programs required by section 115 of the Act. We therefore affirm the FMSHRC\u2019s decision that Martin County Coal did not violate section 105(c)(1) of the Mine Act when it refused to allow the Council to observe its safety instruction classes. The Council\u2019s argument that it cannot effectively exercise its explicit statutory and regulatory rights without a concomitant monitoring right must be addressed to the Secretary of Labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1509-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1505-7\">.
