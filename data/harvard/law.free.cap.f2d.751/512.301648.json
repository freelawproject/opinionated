NEWMAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b626-27\">Prior to 1976 courts generally permitted income tax deductions for expenses related to the maintenance of a home office if the office was merely \u201cappropriate and helpful\u201d to the taxpayer\u2019s business. Recognizing the potential for abuse inherent in this standard, Congress curtailed the availability of the home-office deduction in the Tax Reform Act of 1976, Pub.L. No. 94-455, \u00a7 601(a), 90 Stat. 1520, 1569-72 (codified at 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 280A (1982)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As applied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>educators, this provision has been viewed by the Internal Revenue Service, often with the approval of the Tax Court, as creating virtually an absolute rule against deducting expenses associated with the maintenance of an office in one\u2019s home.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Without returning to the \u201cappropriate and helpful\u201d standard, we conclude that the new provision, though strict, creates a test that can be met by educators and that the factual findings made by the Tax Court in this case involving a college professor establish his entitlement to a home-office deduction, despite the Tax Court\u2019s contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">David J. Weissman and Anne M. Weiss-man <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appeal from a judgment of the United States Tax Court (Perry Shields, <em>Judge) </em>upholding the Commissioner of Internal Revenue\u2019s determination of a deficiency in their joint 1976 income tax return. <em>Weissman v. Commissioner, </em>47 T.C.M. (CCH) 520 (1983). The finding of deficiency resulted from the disallowance of the Weiss-mans\u2019 deduction of $1,540 of rent and expenses allocable to that portion of their apartment used as an office. The Tax Court agreed with the Commissioner that appellants failed to meet the requirements of section 280A of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cCode\u201d), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 280A (1982). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The Tax Court made numerous findings concerning Professor Weissman\u2019s duties and work locations. During 1976 Professor Weissman was employed as an associate professor of philosophy at City College of the City University of New York (\u201cCity College\u201d). In addition to teaching, meeting with students, and grading examinations, Professor Weissman \u201cwas required to do an unspecified amount of research and writing in his field in order to retain his teaching position.\u201d 47 T.C.M. (CCH) at 521. Under the University bylaws a candidate for promotion to associate professor must possess a record of significant scholarly achievement in his field, and, as the Tax Court found, \u201c[a]t City College, as in other university communities, scholarly achievement is usually measured by research, writing and publication in one\u2019s field.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-16\">Professor Weissman worked between 64 and 75 hours each week, but spent only 20% of this time at the City College campus. He spent the remaining 80% of his working hours at the office in his apartment, where he did the bulk of his research and writing. The results of these efforts included several articles and two books on philosophy. His home office consisted of two rooms and a connecting bathroom in his ten-room apartment. The Tax Court found that he used his home office \u201cexclusively for research and writing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-17\">Although City College provided Professor Weissman with an office on campus, he was obliged to share the space with several other professors. The office contained several desks, chairs, and filing cabinets, but no typewriter. Moreover, as the Tax Court found, it was \u201cnot a safe place to leave teaching, writing, or research materials and equipment.\u201d The City College library was available to Professor Weissman from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. on weekdays, but it did not afford him any private space in which to work.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">To qualify for a home-office deduction, a taxpayer must show that the office in his residence \u201cis exclusively used on a regular basis\u201d as his \u201cprincipal place of business.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 280A(c)(l) (1982). An employee, such as Professor Weissman, must also demonstrate that the office is maintained \u201cfor the convenience of his employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The fact that Professor Weissman used his home office exclusively and on a regular basis for employment-related activities is not disputed. Therefore we turn first to the issue whether the Tax Court correctly concluded that City College was Professor Weissman\u2019s principal place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">In identifying a taxpayer\u2019s principal place of business, the Tax Court often seeks to ascertain the \u201cfocal point\u201d of his business activities. <em>Jackson v. Commissioner, </em>76 T.C. 696, 700 (1981); <em>Baie v. Commissioner, </em>74 T.C. 105, 109 (1980). While this may be helpful in many cases, when a taxpayer\u2019s occupation involves two very distinct yet related activities, such as practice and performance, <em>see Drucker v. Commissioner, </em>715 F.2d 67 (2d Cir.1983), or writing and teaching, the \u201cfocal point\u201d approach creates a risk of shifting attention to the place where a taxpayer\u2019s work is more visible, instead of the place where the dominant portion of his work is accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">In the case of educators, the focal point approach does not always adequately distinguish between individuals with very different employment activities. No doubt many college professors spend most of their working hours teaching or engaging in teaching-related activities such as preparing for classes, meeting with students, and grading examinations and papers. Some college professors, however, spend the major share of their working hours researching and writing. Both types of employee have earned the designation \u201cprofessor,\u201d but the title should not obscure the differences between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">In this case, the Tax Court focused too much on Professor Weissman\u2019s title and too little on his activities. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-11\">The focal point of petitioner\u2019s activities as a professor would normally be the college where he teaches. We have uniformly held that the focal point of those who teach (at both college and secondary school levels) is the educational institution rather than the home office. While research and writing was an important part of petitioner\u2019s duties as an associate professor, it does not shift the focal point of his job away from City College where he taught, met with students, graded examinations, and prepared lectures. This is so even though petitioner spent more time each week doing research and writing at home than he spent in teaching and related activities at the college.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeI\"><em>Weissman v. Commissioner, supra, </em>47 T.C.M. (CCH) at 522 (footnotes omitted). To the extent that the Tax Court found City College to be the focal point of Professor Weissman\u2019s employment activities simply because he taught courses there, it erred as a matter of law by failing to consider all aspects of his activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-12\">A college professor\u2019s principal place of business is not necessarily the college at which he teaches any more than a musician\u2019s principal place of business is necessarily the concert hall at which he performs. <em>See Drucker v. Commissioner, supra, </em>715 F.2d at 69 (\u201cBoth in time and in importance, home practice was the \u2018focal point\u2019 of the appellant musicians\u2019 employment-related activities.\u201d). <em>Drucker </em>teaches that in each case the determination of a taxpayer\u2019s principal place of business depends on the nature of his business activities, the attributes of the space in which such activities can be conducted, and the practical necessity of using a home office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>to carry out such activities.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Drucker </em>the taxpayers were musicians who spent the majority of their employment-related hours practicing for performances. They required quiet space in order to benefit from their practice sessions, and, as a practical matter, it was necessary for them to practice at home because no adequate space was provided by their employer. Here the taxpayer is a college professor who spends the majority of his employment-related time \u2014 80% of it \u2014 researching and writing. He needs a place to read, think, and write without interruption, and it is necessary for him to work at home because his shared, unsafe office does not provide the privacy needed to undertake sustained scholarly research and writing. Though the City College library is available for research, it affords Professor Weiss-man no working space in which his research materials may be set aside or where he may use his.typewriter. The lack of a <em>private </em>on-campus office makes Professor Weissman\u2019s home office a practical necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Contrary to the Commissioner\u2019s contention, the new statute does not single out college professors and deny them the opportunity to qualify for the home-office deduction. Appellee cites a passage of the legislative history of section 280A in which the House Ways and Means Committee criticizes the former \u201cappropriate and helpful\u201d standard for judging home-office deductions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-13\">Thus, expenses otherwise considered nondeductible personal, living, and family expenses might be converted into deductible business expenses simply because, under the facts of the particular case, it was appropriate and helpful to perform some portion of the taxpayer\u2019s business in his personal residence. For example, if a university professor, who is provided an office by his employer, uses a den or some other room in his residence for the purpose of grading papers, preparing examinations or preparing classroom notes, an allocable portion of certain expenses might be claimed as a deduction even though only minor incremental expenses were incurred in order to perform these activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-14\">H.R.Rep. No. 94-658, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 160 (1976), <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2897, 3054. Read in context, this passage merely reflects Congress\u2019 general concern that the home office be used exclusively for business purposes, and, in the case of an employee, that such use be for the convenience of his employer. As the explanatory section that immediately follows this passage notes, \u201cThe use of a portion of a dwelling unit for both personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>purposes and for the carrying on of a trade or business does not meet the exclusive use test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 161, 1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 3054. Thus, the House Report\u2019s use of a college professor in this example demonstrates a concern that casual or occasional business use of a home office must not transform personal expenses into deductible expenses; it does not deny the home-office deduction to educators who meet the requirements of section 280A.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">The Tax Court\u2019s own factual findings show that Professor Weissman\u2019s home office was his principal place of business. The Tax Court recognized that scholarly research and writing were conditions of Professor Weissman\u2019s continued employment by City College and that he pursued these activities in his home office an average of 80% of each working week. In some circumstances the fact that a professor spends a majority of his working time in his home office will not overcome the presumption that an educator\u2019s principal place of business is the college at which he teaches, <em>see Weightman v. Commissioner, </em>45 T.C.M. (CCH) 167 (1982); <em>Moskovit v. Commissioner, </em>44 T.C.M. (CCH) 859 (1982), <em>aff'd by unpublished opinion </em>(10th Cir, Oct. 19, 1983); <em>Storzer v. Commissioner, </em>44 T.C.M. (CCH) 100 (1982); <em>Strasser v. Commissioner, </em>42 T.C.M. (CCH) 1125 (1981); <em>Weightman v. Commissioner, </em>42 T.C.M. (CCH) 104 (1981). But here not only was the home office the site of most of the taxpayer\u2019s work, its use was necessitated by lack of suitable working space on the campus.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Because Professor Weissman is an employee he must also establish that he maintains his home office for the convenience of his employer. The convenience-of-the-employer test is normally invoked to determine whether to exclude from taxable income the value of fringe benefits provided to employees by their employer. <em>See, e.g., Commissioner v. Kowalski, </em>434 U.S. 77, 84-90, 98 S.Ct. 315, 319-322, 54 L.Ed.2d 252 (1977); <em>Adams v. United States, </em>218 Ct.Cl. 322, 585 F.2d 1060, 1064-65 (1978). Perhaps for this reason the cases have not fully developed the meaning of the phrase, \u201cfor the convenience of his employer,\u201d when a deduction rather than an exclusion from income is at issue. The standard by which the convenience-of-the-employer test was judged in <em>Drucker </em>derives from the congressional intention to prevent the conversion of nondeductible personal expenses into deductible business expenses: \u201cBecause the [employer] provided appellants with no space for the essential task of private practice, the maintenance of residential space exclusively for such purpose was an expense almost entirely additional to nondeductible personal living expenses.\u201d 715 F.2d at 70. For this reason, and because the expenses were not \u201c \u2018purely a matter of personal convenience, comfort, or economy,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Sharon v. Commissioner, </em>66 T.C. 515, 523 (1976)), but were a business necessity, we held that the appellants in <em>Drucker </em>had satisfied the convenience-of-the-employer test. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">When the <em>Drucker </em>standard is applied to this case, it becomes clear that Professor Weissman has also satisfied the convenience-of-the-employer test. The cost of maintaining his home office was almost entirely additional to nondeductible personal living expenses because it was used exclusively for employment-related activities and because such use was necessary as a practical matter if Professor Weissman was faithfully to perform his employment duties. This practical necessity negates any claim that the office was used as a matter of personal convenience rather than for the convenience of the employer. <em>Cf. Commissioner v. Kowalski, supra, </em>434 U.S. at 88, 98 S.Ct. at 321. The Commissioner attempts to distinguish <em>Drucker </em>on the ground that the employer there provided <em>no </em>space for practice, while here the employer provided some space, <em>i.e., </em>a shared office and the library. <em>Drucker </em>is not so easily distinguished, however, for there, as here, the relevant fact is that the employer provided no <em>suitable </em>space for engaging in necessary employment-related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>activities. Although City College has provided some space to Professor Weissman, it has not provided space in which he can effectively carry out his employment duties. The maintenance of a home office was not a personal preference of the employee; it spared the employer the cost of providing a suitable private office and thereby served the convenience of the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">This conclusion is not altered by the Commissioner\u2019s argument that \u201cmost of Weissman\u2019s research activity was not geared to his employer\u2019s job specifications, but, rather, was conducted for the purpose of increasing his own prestige and establishing his professional reputation in hopes of obtaining a more lucrative position.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Brief at 13. Though the Commissioner may not be persuaded, we see no reason to doubt that research and writing are essential aspects of the activity a college philosophy professor undertakes to enhance his classroom performance. In any event, the Tax Court found that engaging in research and writing was one of Professor Weissman\u2019s employment duties. Expenses incurred to satisfy an employment obligation do not become nondeductible simply because they improve an employee\u2019s value not only to his current employer but also to prospective employers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Tax Court is reversed and the case remanded for entry of judgment rejecting the claimed deficiency.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b626-17\">. Section 280A of the Internal Revenue Code provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-18\">(a) General Rule</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-19\">Except as otherwise provided in this section, in the case of a taxpayer who is an individual or an S corporation, no deduction otherwise allowable under this chapter shall be allowed with respect to the use of a dwelling unit which is used by the taxpayer during the taxable year as a residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-29\">(c)(1) Certain business use Subsection (a) shall not apply to any item to the extent such item is allocable to a portion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>of the dwelling unit which is <em>exclusively used on a regular basis </em>\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">(A) [as] <em>the principal place of business </em>for any trade or business of the taxpayer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\">In the case of an employee, the preceding sentence shall apply only if the exclusive use referred to in the preceding sentence is <em>for the convenience of his employer.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b627-12\">. <em>See, e.g., Bilenas v.

Mrs. Weissman is a party to this appeal solely because she filed a joint tax return with her husband.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b627-19\">. The Tax Court noted that the assistant chairman of the philosophy department conceded that <em>some </em>of Professor Weissman\u2019s research could have been performed in the City College library. This was relied upon to contradict the testimony of the departmental chairman that Professor Weissman\u2019s home office was required as a condition of his employment. While we accept all the Tax Court\u2019s subsidiary factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>findings (and conclude that they establish the taxpayers\u2019 claim), we note that even the testimony of the assistant chairman implies that most of Professor Weissman\u2019s research could not be done at the library.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b629-6\">. This standard is not unlike that set forth in the proposed regulations for implementation of section 280A. These proposed regulations provide, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">(3) <em>Determination of principal place of business. </em>When a taxpayer engages in a single trade or business at more than one location, it is necessary to determine the taxpayer\u2019s principal place of business for that trade or business in light of all the facts and circumstances. Among the facts and circumstances to be taken into account in making this determination are the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-8\">(i) The portion of the total income from the business which is attributable to activities at each location;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-9\">(ii) The amount of time spent in activities related to that business at each location; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-10\">(iii) The facilities available to the taxpayer at each location for purposes of that business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.280A-2(b)(3) (proposed), <em>reprinted at </em>48 Fed.Reg. 33324 (daily ed. July 21, 1983). When applied to the instant case, these factors weigh in favor of permitting the home-office deduction. Because Professor Weissman is paid a salary that is not dependent upon the ratio of teaching to writing, the portion of his total income attributable to each activity, and thus to each location, is the same as the amount of time he works at each activity. Thus, both factor (i) and factor (ii) give an 80% weight to the home office as Professor Weissman\u2019s principal place of business. Factor (iii) results in almost the same calculation since the facilities at City College for teaching and meeting with students are adequate, but the facilities for research -and writing are, with limited exceptions, not suitable. Appellee\u2019s argument that factor (i) cuts against the deduction because Profess\u00f3n'Weiss-man derived no royalty income from the writing he did in his home office is misdirected. It fails to recognize that his research and writing were not claimed to constitute a separate trade or business, but were part of his duties as a professor and therefore part of the reason he was paid a salary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b631-8\">. Appellee\u2019s argument that business expenses cannot be deducted if they result in personal benefits overlooks the fact that many other deductible expenses undoubtedly have the effect of personally benefitting the taxpayer who incurs the expense. Perhaps the most obvious example is the provision for the deduction of expenses for meals and lodging while away from home on business. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162(a)(2) (\u00cd982); <em>see </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.162-2(a) (1984). If meals and lodging constitute legitimate business expenses, they are deductible despite the fact that the taxpayer may eat a much more sumptuous meal or stay in more luxurious accommodations than he would have in the absence of a business justification for the expense. Much the same can be said about deductible educational expenses. Those expenses that are necessary to maintain or improve one\u2019s skills for a particular job are deductible, despite the personal benefits derived, as long as they are not undertaken to qualify the taxpayer for a new occupation. <em>See </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.162 \u2014 5(a)(1) (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b631-7\">KELLEHER, District Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ANa\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"AvR\">The factual findings of the Tax Court fully support the conclusion that Professor Weissman failed to establish his entitlement to a deduction of his home office expenses. I agree with the Tax Court and the Commissioner that appellant failed to prove the requirements of Section 280A of the Code, 26 U.S.C. (1982), that his home office was the focal point of his business activities. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">There is no denying that the facilities provided to Weissman by City College were of a humble nature, inadequately serving some of his needs as a researcher-writer. Yet Weissman\u2019s responsibilities at CCNY included more than just research and writing; he taught classes, met with students, graded exams, prepared lectures, and kept abreast with current events in philosophy through publications available in the library. Weissman was employed by CCNY primarily <em>to teach. </em>The fact that he devoted the majority of his working hours to research and writing is incidental to the employment for which he was compensated and against which he seeks a tax deduction. Even though Weissman spent the majority of his time doing research and writing at home, the \u201cfocal point\u201d of his job clearly was CCNY.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">The Tax Court found on supportive evidence that the \u201cfocal point\u201d of Weissman\u2019s business activities was CCNY. <em>Weissman v. Commissioner, </em>47 T.C.M. (CCH) 520, 522 (1983). The Tax Court\u2019s determination is factual, and can be disturbed on appeal only if it is clearly erroneous. <em>Roemer v. Board of Public Works, </em>426 U.S. 736, 758, 96 S.Ct. 2337, 2350, 49 L.Ed.2d 179 (1976); <em>Commissioner v. Duberstein, </em>363 U.S. 278, 289, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 1198, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The Tax Court has uniformly held that the focal point of college and secondary school professors is the educational institution, and attached facilities, rather than the home office. <em>See Weightman v. Commissioner, </em>45 T.C.M. (CCH) 167 (1982); <em>Moskovit v. Commissioner, </em>44 T.C.M. (CCH) 859 (1982), <em>aff'd by unpublished opinion, </em>(10th Cir. October 19, 1983); <em>Storzer v. Commissioner, </em>44 T.C.M. (CCH) 100 (1982); <em>Strasser v. Commissioner, </em>42 T.C.M. (CCH) 1125 (1981); <em>Weightman v. Commissioner, </em>42 T.C.M. (CCH) 104 (1981). The majority opinion implicitly asserts that the Tax Court applied these decisions in a rigid, formalistic manner to Weissman\u2019s situation. A closer inspection of a sampler of these cases, however, belies such a-contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">For example, in <em>Weightman v. Commissioner, </em>42 T.C.M. 104 (1981), the taxpayer taught at Lehman College in the Bronx, New York City. He shared his office with two other educators in a building not open on the weekends. He had limited telephone access, no typewriter, and was constantly subject to the threat of burglary and assault. It was not safe to leave any belongings in his office, nor for him to stay at the college after dark. The taxpayer used a portion of his apartment exclusively and regularly for business purposes. Additionally, the taxpayer alleged that his home research activities were more important than his teaching. The Tax Court ruled, however, that he was employed as a teacher, not as a researcher. Consequently, the Tax Court decided that the taxpayer\u2019s principal place of business was the school, and not his home office. <em>Id. </em>at 108-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">In <em>Storzer v. Commissioner, supra, </em>petitioner was supplied with an on-campus staff room; a small office space crammed with six desks and seven other academics, no typewriters, and no privacy. Further, the taxpayer was not provided with a library carrel or similar cubbyhole to perform research. Petitioner used a home office as his exclusive research and writing station. The taxpayer\u2019s contention that he spent more time in his home office fell on an unsympathetic court. Rather, the Tax Court held that Section 280A prohibited the deduction of Storzer\u2019s home office expenses. <em>Id. </em>at 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">Weissman\u2019s situation was no more egregious than either case discussed above. The Tax Court\u2019s application of its interpretation of these cases to Weissman was sound and reasonable. As such, I have not found the Tax Court\u2019s holding to be factually deficient. The ruling that CCNY was Weissman\u2019s principal place of business, in my view, was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s reading of <em>Drucker v. Commissioner, </em>715 F.2d 67 (2d Cir.1983). There, the Court determined that the principal place of business of Metropolitan Opera musicians was their home practice area. These musicians were offered <em>\u201cno </em>space for the essential task of private practice____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70 (emphasis in original). A musician must practice; he must have a suitable situs to harmonize the sounds his instrument emits. As a famous pianist once noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-13\">If I don\u2019t practice for one day, I know it; if I don\u2019t practice for two days, the critics know it; if I don\u2019t practice for three days, the audience knows it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-14\">E. Mach, <em>Great Pianists Speak for Themselves </em>(1980), <em>quoted in Drucker v. Commissioner, </em>715 F.2d 67, 68 (2d Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-15\">In <em>Drucker </em>the Metropolitan musicians had no space to practice for their performance. Clearly, practice was essential to acceptable and compensable performance. Without their home practice facilities <em>Drucker </em>musicians would not have been able to refine and perfect the skills required to acceptable performances of the Metropolitan Opera. The <em>Drucker </em>court determined that the focal points of the musicians\u2019 employment related activities were their home practice studios. <em>Id. </em>at 69. The Court specifically limited this holding, however, and found this \u201cto be the rare situation in which an employee\u2019s principal place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>of business is not that of his employer.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The work related activities of a college professor does not present any such \u201crare situation.\u201d Weissman was provided with on-campus accommodations to facilitate his teaching of philosophy. His office and the college library were sufficient stations for the acceptable and compensable performance of his job. He should not be allowed to deduct the expenses he incurred while using his home office.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">I am disturbed by the breadth of the majority opinion. The Court established no restraints or limitations to its conclusions. Rather, it opens the door to an endless array of Section 280A cases; to all sorts of \u201ccreative\u201d deductions of home office expenses. Inevitably, this Court will face a barrage of deduction claims, not unlike those of Professor Weissman. It is not the province of this Court to engage in a fact finding process and thereupon reverse the Tax Court\u2019s findings merely upon a disputable difference as to the correctness of such findings. To do so is a violation of the permissible standard of review by this Court. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
