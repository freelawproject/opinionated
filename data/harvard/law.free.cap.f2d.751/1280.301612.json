(Beneux). Port Norris argues that the Commission granted Beneux authority to transport general commodities in bulk form without the requisite eviden-tiary showing by Beneux that it was fit, willing, and able to provide such services. For the reasons discussed below, we remand the Commission\u2019s order with directions to impose a bulk restriction on Beneux\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-20\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-21\">Beneux filed an application with the Commission in February 1983 requesting authority to transport general commodities throughout the continental United States. Appendix (App.) at 1-35. Under the Commission\u2019s classification system, authority to transport general commodities includes the right to transport bulk commodities,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> household goods, and explosives unless specifically excepted from the grant. Beneux\u2019s application excepted household goods and explosives, but not bulk commodities. Beneux held existing certificates authorizing it to engage in operations in 48 states, including five certificates authorizing it to transport general commodities radially.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> By its application, Beneux sought to round out its fragmented authority. With general commodities authority, it could lessen or eliminate deadhead mileage by seeking backhaul loads.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>Beneux\u2019s application consisted of the standard application form, the verified statement of its president, two exhibits setting forth its existing authorities, and the statements of three supporting shippers. The application indicated that Beneux operated seventy diesel tractors and seventy-five high-cube trailers equipped with refrigeration units. Beneux stated that it had the financial ability to acquire additional equipment to meet the needs of its shippers and the expertise to move any type of commodity throughout the United States. The supporting shippers were Seneca Foods Corporation (desiring transportation of foodstuffs, materials, equipment, and supplies used in the manufacturing and distribution of foodstuffs), Coleco Industries, Inc. (plastic games and toys), and National Spinning Co., Inc.' (yarn wool and synthetic fiber yarns).</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-4\">Port Norris, a common carrier specializing in the transportation of bulk commodities, filed a protest to Beneux\u2019s application in March 1983. App. at 36-64. It argued that granting Beneux\u2019s application would adversely affect Port Norris\u2019s operations to an extent contrary to the public interest and that Beneux had failed to satisfy the statutory requirements for a grant of unrestricted general commodities authority. Port Norris sought either a complete denial of the application or a bulk restriction. Be-neux responded to Port Norris\u2019s protest by requesting that the Commission amend Be-neux\u2019s application to include a restriction against bulk commodities. App. at 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-5\">In June 1983, the Commission\u2019s Review Board<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> granted Beneux\u2019s application without any bulk restriction. App. at 66-70. Port Norris appealed, and the Commission, Division 1, affirmed the Review Board\u2019s decision. App. at 84. In August 1983, the Commission granted Beneux a certificate of public convenience and necessity to operate as a common carrier transporting general commodities with no bulk restriction. App. at 86-87. Port Norris petitioned this</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-8\">court for review pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2321, 2342(5) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-9\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"aaj-dedup-2\">A. <em>Legal Framework</em></p>\n<p id=\"AbSd\">The scope of our review of a Commission order granting a certificate of public convenience and necessity to a motor common carrier is defined by the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, 94 Stat. 793 (1980) (codified at scattered sections of 49 U.S.C.- (1982)) [the MCA], and the Administrative Procedure Act. The MCA requires the Commission to determine whether an applicant has shown that it is \u201cfit, willing, and able to provide the transportation to be authorized by the certificate\u201d and that the service proposed will be \u201cresponsive to a public demand or need.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10922(b)(1)(A), (B) (1982). Under the Administrative Procedure Act, the Commission\u2019s decision to grant the authority \u201cmay not be \u2018arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\u2019 and must be supported \u2018by substantial evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Port Norris Express Co. v. ICC, </em>746 F.2d 69, 71 (D.C.Cir.1984) (quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 706(2)(A), (E) (1982)). The \u201c \u2018substantial evidence examination looks to whether the record, taken as a whole, contains such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration v. ICC, </em>733 F.2d 105, 110 (D.C.Cir.1984) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-10\">The case law unequivocably establishes that under the MCA an applicant for unrestricted general commodities authority has the burden of establishing that it is fit, willing, and able to provide <em>all </em>of the transportation to be authorized by the certificate \u2014 including bulk services. In <em>American Trucking Association v. ICC, </em>659 F.2d 452 (5th Cir.1981), <em>enforced by mandamus, </em>669 F.2d 957 (5th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1022, 103 S.Ct. 1272, 75 L.Ed.2d 493 (1983) <em>[ATA </em>], the Fifth Circuit rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>the Commission\u2019s decision to eliminate all bulk restrictions from authorities to transport general commodities.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In doing so, the court held that an applicant for general commodities authority must demonstrate specifically that it is fit, willing, and able to provide bulk transportation services, <em>ATA, </em>659 F.2d at 473. In <em>Port Norris Express Co. v. ICC, </em>687 F.2d 803, 811 (3d Cir.1982) <em>[Port </em>Norris-Dennis], the Third Circuit adopted the Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis and vacated the Commission\u2019s order granting an applicant general commodities authority because the \u201crecord ... [could not] support a finding that [the applicant] was willing to carry commodities in bulk.\u201d In <em>Port Norris Express Co. v. ICC, </em>729 F.2d 204, 208 (3d Cir.1984) <em>[Port </em>Norris-Alien], the Third Circuit stated specifically that the Commission may not issue an unrestricted general commodities certificate \u201cunless there is record evidence of the applicant\u2019s present intent and willingness to haul bulk ... [and] record evidence that the applicant has or intends to acquire the necessary equipment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-5\">Recent cases dealing with grants of <em>specific </em>commodities authority have reaffirmed the <em>ATA </em>and <em>Port Norris-Dennis </em>holdings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Port Norris-Alien, </em>729 F.2d 204 (3d Cir.1984), <em>Steere Tank Lines, Inc. v. ICC, </em>736 F.2d 1094 (5th Cir.1984) <em>[Steere-C.D.B.], </em>and <em>Erickson Transport Corp. v. ICC, </em>737 F.2d 775 (8th Cir.1984) <em>[Erickson-L &amp; L\\ </em>the Third, Fifth, and Eighth Circuits, respectively, rejected the Commission\u2019s policy of refusing to include bulk restrictions on grants of specific commodities authority. Each court emphasized that the Commission may not grant an applicant bulk authority unless there is substantial evidence that the applicant is fit, willing, and able to provide bulk services. <em>See Port Norris-Alien, </em>729 F.2d at 208; <em>Steere-C.D.B., </em>736 F.2d at 1096; <em>Erickson-L &amp; L, </em>737 F.2d at 778. We recently applied \u201csubstantially the same reasoning,\u201d <em>Port Norris Express Co. v. ICC, </em>746 F.2d 69, 73 (D.C.Cir.1984) <em>[Port Norris-</em>D-X]|, in holding that the Commission may not grant authority to transport specific commodities in bulk unless the applicant provides evidence of public need for bulk services.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Port Norris-D-X, </em>we rejected \u201cthe use of an evidentiary inference to satisfy the clear requirements of the [MCA].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72. Although the Commission may make reasonable inferences in determining whether applicants have met the statutory requirements, those inferences must be supported by \u201cdirect evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73. Specifically, where a certificate includes bulk authority, \u201c[s]ome direct evidence on bulk service is required.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Absent such evidence, a certificate granting general commodities authority must contain a bulk restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-10\">B. <em>The Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1369-11\">Beneux\u2019s application \u2014 including the shipper support statements \u2014 made no mention of bulk transportation or bulk commodities, nor did it show that it operated any bulk equipment or facilities. The Commission nevertheless determined that Beneux was fit, willing, and able to transport bulk commodities by resorting to inferences drawn from the application and a \u201creview of Commission records.\u201d App. at 66. The Commission contends in this appeal that its determinations are supported by the \u201cdoctrine of representative evidence.\u201d Brief for Respondents at 16. Under that \u201cdoctrine,\u201d the Commission argues, \u201cthere was enough evidence to support a Commission <em>inference ... </em>that Beneux was fit to trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>port general commodities in bulk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). As we discuss below, we find the Commission\u2019s argument unpersuasive because there was not substantial evidence that Beneux was either fit or willing to transport bulk commodities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-4\">1. Fitness</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-5\">Beneux included in its application a list of five certificates that authorized it to transport general commodities. App. at 25. The Commission found that two of those certificates did not contain bulk restrictions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> From that fact, the Commission inferred that Beneux had \u201cbeen found fit in other proceedings to handle bulk traffic.\u201d App. at 68. It is entirely possible, given the Commission\u2019s opposition to bulk restrictions, that the prior proceedings involved no separate finding that Beneux was fit to handle bulk commodities. Moreover, even if those proceedings did involve such a finding, the record in <em>this </em>case does not contain any facts supporting the Commission\u2019s inference. We therefore reject the Commission\u2019s inference as unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-6\">The Commission argues that our holding in <em>B.J. McAdams, Inc. v. ICC, </em>698 F.2d 498 (D.C.Cir.1983), supports its conclusion that based on Beneux\u2019s existing authority it was fit to transport general commodities in bulk. The Commission granted the applicant in that restriction removal proceeding <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> broadened territorial authority. Competing carriers argued that the applicant was not fit to operate under not only the enlarged authority, but the original grant as well. In rejecting petitioners\u2019 challenge, we held that \u201cthe ICC may assume, for the purposes of [a] <em>restriction removal proceeding, </em>that the applicant is fit to operate under the authority previously granted to it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 503 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1370-11\">The Commission recognizes that <em>B.J. McAdams </em>did not involve an application for a new certificate but argues that the principle expressed in that case should apply equally here since Beneux was \u201cin substance, simply seeking an incremental territorial expansion of its already broad general commodities authority. Brief for Respondents at 18 n. 6. We agree that the scope of an applicant\u2019s existing authority may be relevant in determining whether it is fit to provide the services requested in its application for a new certificate. If the new certificate includes bulk authority, however, there must be direct evidence in the record showing that the applicant either provides bulk service under existing authority, <em>see, e.g., Port Norris Express Co. v. ICC, </em>697 F.2d 497 F.2d (3d Cir.1982) <em>[Port Norris-Allied </em>] (applicant specifically requested bulk authority, submitted evidence that it provided intrastate bulk services under existing authority, and that it had bulk equipment), and <em>Provost Cartage Inc. v. ICC, </em>686 F.2d 221 (5th Cir.1982) (applicant specifically requested bulk authority, under existing certificates it had transported over 1000 bulk commodities, and it had bulk vehicles and facilities), or that the Commission determined in prior proceedings that the applicant is fit, willing, and able specifically to provide bulk service.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1370-12\">The record before us contains no such evidence, notwithstanding the Review Board\u2019s conclusory statement that Beneux \u201chas the capacity to transport certain bulk commodities like resin solutions and flammable liquid and/or petroleum products.\u201d App. at 66. Each of those commodities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>may move in either non-bulk or bulk form.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s argument that they \u201ctypically move in bulk form,\u201d Brief for Respondents at 17, is in itself an indication that the Review Board\u2019s finding on bulk capacity was an inference, not a factual determination. Indeed, the Commission conceded at oral argument that nothing in the record indicates that Beneux has ever transported any bulk commodities. In the absence of any evidence supporting the Commission\u2019s inference, we are unable to conclude that the record, taken as a whole, is adequate to support its conclusion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1371-6\">The Review Board also stated that Beneux \u201coperates equipment which is conducive to handling bulk shipments.\u201d App. at 68. The only record evidence relating to equipment demonstrates that Beneux operates seventy-five van-type trailers equipped with refrigeration units. Because such vans are not bulk transportation equipment,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> we reject the Commission\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-7\">Although an applicant need not possess bulk equipment at the time of application, <em>Steere-C.D.B., </em>736 F.2d at 1096, the applicant still must provide some evidence of its intent or willingness to acquire such equipment. <em>Id. </em>The Commission argues that Beneux\u2019s statements that it has the expertise to move any type of commodity and that it is willing and able to acquire additional equipment to meet shipper demands satisfy this evidentiary requirement. The Commission would infer from Beneux\u2019s statements the willingness to acquire bulk equipment to meet a shipper\u2019s request for bulk services. That such a request would be made, moreover, requires a further inference because not one of the three supporting shippers mentioned any need for bulk service. Once again, we cannot accept the Commission\u2019s position because it is based entirely on inferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-4\">2. <em>Willingness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1371-11\">Even if the record supported the Commission\u2019s determination that Beneux was fit to transport bulk commodities, we are still compelled to remand because there is not substantial evidence in the record to show that Beneux was willing to provide bulk services under the new certificate. The Commission contends that Beneux\u2019s initial application combined with its expertise and willingness to acquire additional equipment is sufficient evidence of willingness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-12\">Beneux did not seek a bulk restriction in its initial application. \u201cWhatever slight evidence of willingness,\u201d <em>Port Norris-Dennis, </em>687 F.2d at 812, that fact provides, however, fades into oblivion upon an examination of the record as a whole. The Commission can point to no language in Beneux\u2019s application that shows any interest in bulk authority. <em>See Erickson-L &amp; L, </em>737 F.2d at 777-78; <em>Port Norris-Dennis, </em>687 F.2d at 812. Moreover, as discussed above, Beneux\u2019s general statements concerning its expertise and willingness to acquire additional equipment are insufficient absent \u201csome direct evidence on bulk service.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Port Norris-D-X, </em>746 F.2d at 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-13\">Furthermore, Beneux requested that the Commission amend its application to include a bulk restriction. The Commission rejected the proposed amendment on the grounds that it was \u201cpresumably ... an attempt merely to eliminate opposition,\u201d and therefore not in the public interest. App. at 84. Even if we agreed with the Commission, the record still lacks substantial evidence that would support a finding that Beneux was willing to transport bulk commodities. By rejecting Beneux\u2019s amendment, the Commission merely ignored evidence rebutting its inference of willingness. As we pointed out above, that inference is not supported by substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>evidence, so even unrebutted it does not satisfy the statutory requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-4\">On the other hand, the lack of any direct evidence of willingness rebuts the Commission\u2019s presumption that the proposed amendment was \u201can attempt merely to eliminate opposition.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The circumstances of this case therefore suggest that Beneux\u2019s requested amendment \u201cwas not prompted by a desire to settle litigation with a protesting carrier, but rather by a genuine lack of interest in bulk hauling.\u201d <em>Port Norris-Alien, </em>729 F.2d at 210. Thus, considering the record as a whole, including Beneux\u2019s requested amendment, the Commission\u2019s determination that Beneux was willing to transport bulk commodities is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-6\">It should be clear by now that we will continue to insist that the Commission perform its duty in determining whether applicants have met the requirements of section 10922(b)(1). As we stated in <em>Port Norris-D-X, </em>746 F.2d at 73, \u201c[i]f the various circuits have misapprehended what appears to be the plain meaning of [the MCA], then Congress can easily correct the error. Until such time, it seems very little to ask that an applicant present some bare minimum of direct evidence\u201d that it is fit, willing, and able to transport commodities in bulk before it is granted authority to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-7\">For these reasons, we remand this proceeding to the Commission with instructions to revise Beneux\u2019s certificate so as to exclude authority to transport commodities in bulk.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1367-13\">. Bulk service is the transportation of fungible commodities that can be poured, scooped, or shoveled, and which generally are of such size that they cannot be handled piece by piece. The term \"in bulk\u201d commonly refers to a loose mass that is poured or thrown into a vessel or vehicle without regard to order, and which is restrained during transportation only by the sides of the carrying vessel. <em>Steere Tank Lines, Inc. v. ICC, </em>666 F.2d 255, 257-58 n. 3 (5th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1025, 103 S.Ct. 1264, 75 L.Ed.2d 499 (1983).

Radial authority, also known as facilities authority, is \"authority to travel to and from a hub.\u201d <em>RTC Transportation, Inc. v.

Port Norris does not challenge the Commission\u2019s finding that granting Beneux unrestricted general commodities authority was responsive to a public need. Accordingly, we do not address that issue. We do note for the purposes of discussing the Commission\u2019s fit, willing, and able determination, however, that none of the supporting shippers mentioned a need for bulk service. As we point out below, the lack of any indication of need for bulk service undercuts the Commission\u2019s inferences that Beneux was fit and willing to provide such service.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1369-6\">. The Commission views bulk restrictions as inconsistent with the purposes of the MCA. Following passage of the MCA it issued rules and policy statements consistent with that view. Those rules and policy statements were the subject of review in <em>ATA.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1369-7\"><em>. </em>We are aware of no authority departing from the evidentiary requirement set forth in <em>ATA </em>and <em>Port Norris-Dennis. </em>Apparently, however, the Commission either does not fully comprehend or it does not fully accept this well-established requirement. Although it correctly acknowledges that an applicant has the burden of establishing a prima facie case of fitness and need with respect to the transportation to be provided under the certificate, Brief for Respondents at 15, it immediately dismisses as \u201cill-conceived\u201d Port Norris\u2019s argument that \"Beneux had to demonstrate separately that it was fit specifically to transport general commodities in bulk form.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under <em>ATA, Port Norris-Dennis, </em>and their progeny, that was precisely Be-neux\u2019s burden under its initial application for general commodities authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1369-13\">. Although <em>Port Norris-D-X </em>involved the public need prong of \u00a7 10922(b)(1), we explicitly recognized that our reasoning applies equally to the fit, willing, and able prong. <em>Port Norris-D-X, </em>746 F.2d at 73.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1370-7\">. The Commission states in its brief that none of Beneux's five general commodities certificates contained bulk restrictions. Brief for Respondents at 16. The record, however, includes a finding that only two of the certificates contained no bulk restrictions. Appendix (App.) at 66. Although it has no effect on our holding, we rely on the record, not the brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1370-8\">. The MCA provides for two types of proceedings, both intended to replace narrow, highly specific certificates with broader authority. Restriction removal proceedings deal with the removal of operating restrictions from existing certificates. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10922(h). New certificate proceedings deal with applications for entirely new certificates. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10922(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1370-9\">. In <em>B.J.

If the Commission relies on a prior determination, it must include in the record of the new certificate proceedings the <em>facts </em>which formed the basis for that determination. The burden this places on the Commission is slight, and it prevents situations like that before us in which there is no way to determine from the record whether the prior proceedings involved any findings at all relating to the fit, willing, and able requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1371-8\">. <em>Cf.

If the Commission based its conclusion on an inference that because Beneux had the capacity to transport the specified commodities in non-bulk, it therefore had the capacity to transport those same commodities in bulk form, that inference is foreclosed by <em>Port Norris-Alien, Steere-C.D.B., </em>and <em>Erickson-L &amp; L.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1371-10\">. The Commission essentially concedes this point by not even attempting to rebut the petitioner\u2019s argument, Brief for Petitioner at 16, that Beneux operates no bulk equipment. <em>See also Erickson-L &amp; L, </em>737 F.2d at 776 n. 2 (vans not suitable to carry bulk commodities); <em>Steere C.D.B., </em>736 F.2d at 1095 (non-bulk applicant operated all \"van-type\" vehicles); <em>RTC Transportation, Inc. v. ICC, </em>731 F.2d 1497, 1499-1500 (11th Cir.1984) (contrasting bulk equipment with vans).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1371-15\">. <em>Cf. Port Norris-Alien, </em>729 F.2d at 211 (\"Construing the application in light of the shipper support statements requesting bulk service, ... we believe that [the applicant] may fairly be said to have applied for bulk as well as non-bulk authority, and that [the applicant] was therefore \u2018willing\u2019 to provide bulk service.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1372-11\">.

ICC, </em>746 F.2d 69 (D.C.Cir.1984) <em>[Port Norris-DX\\ </em>attacked the use of representative evidence to show public need, and the majority in this case would extend that holding as well to the fitness and willingness prongs of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10922(b)(1), 94 Stat. 793 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-12\">In this case, the familiar Port Norris Express Company (Port Norris) petitions this court to vacate an order of the Commission granting motor common carrier authority to David Beneux Produce &amp; Trucking, Inc. (Beneux) to transport general commodities without a bulk restriction. Port Norris responded to Beneux\u2019s application to the Commission by filing a protest, arguing that broadening Beneux\u2019s authority would adversely affect Port Norris\u2019 operation and thus would naturally be contrary to the public interest, and sought either a complete denial of the application or an amendment to Beneux\u2019s application to include a restriction against bulk commodities. After an appeal from Division I, the Commission granted Beneux a certificate with no bulk restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-13\">While the seeds of the majority\u2019s opinion were sown in dicta in <em>Port Norris-D-X, </em>at 73, it still rests uneasily along side earlier decisions of this court. <em>B.J. McAdams, Inc. v. ICC, </em>698 F.2d 498 (D.C.Cir.1983) for example held that the ICC may assume, for the purposes of a restriction removal proceeding, that the applicant is fit to operate under the authority previously granted to it. <em>Id. </em>at 503. This case, however, involves a rounding out of authority difficult to distinguish in substance from the facts of <em>B.J. McAdams. B.J. McAdams </em>involved the lifting of an <em>area </em>restriction, while the rounded out authority in this case would also have allowed Beneux to operate in a broader area. J.A. 10-11. To allow the Commission to infer fitness in one procedural setting, but not another, where there is little perceptible difference in the actual expansion of authority requested, elevates form over substance. Moreover, the requirement that \u201c[i]f the Commission relies on a prior determination, it must include in the record of the new certificate proceedings the facts which formed the basis for that determination,\u201d see Majority Opinion at 1285 n. 14, is entirely unprecedented. Such a rule in effect prohibits the Commission from relying on prior determinations at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-14\">The majority opinion will also, like <em>Port Norris-D-X, </em>lay the foundation for a conflict among the circuits. Two of the circuit court decisions relied on in <em>Port Norris-D-X </em>did not foreclose the Commission from adopting rules providing for the issuance of specified commodity authority that is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>restricted against bulk transportation. <em>Port Norris Express Co. v. ICC, </em>729 F.2d 204, 208 n. 1 (3d Cir.1984) <em>(Port Norris-Al</em>len); <em>Steere Tank Lines, Inc. v. ICC, </em>736 F.2d 1094, 1097 (5th Cir.1984). With this prompting, the Commission undertook in July, 1984 two rulemaking proceedings to consider when it is appropriate to include or exclude bulk restrictions on various specific commodity licenses. See <em>Acceptable Forms of Request for Operating Authority, </em>Ex Parte No. 55 (Sub-No. 43A) and <em>Removal of Restrictions From Authorities of Motor Carriers of Property, </em>Ex Parte No. MC-142 (Sub-No. 1), 49 Fed.Reg. 27182 (July 2, 1984). The factual record developed in those proceedings may indicate no significant dissimilarities between bulk and nonbulk transportation of particular commodity groups. For these commodities, inferences as to need, fitness, and willingness to transport in bulk from authority to transport in non-bulk would be completely reasonable. By laying down a broad rule that would effectively preclude the Commission from applying in future cases evidence developed in the pending rule-making, the majority prevents the Commission from furthering the purposes of the 1980 Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The inability to make reasonable inferences will unnecessarily encumber the Commission, which must pass on many thousands of applications each year. <em>See </em>Interstate Commerce Commission 1983 Annual Report at 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-5\">The majority also unjustifiably dismisses the Commission\u2019s argument that Beneux\u2019s statements that it has the expertise to move any type of commodity, and that it was willing to acquire any equipment to do so, satisfies the requirement that an applicant provide some evidence of its intent or willingness to transport in bulk. The majority reasons that Beneux\u2019s statement of willingness to acquire any equipment implies willingness to acquire bulk equipment only if there is direct evidence of need for bulk service in the supporting shipper\u2019s statements. This does not make sense. By \u201cany equipment,\u201d the applicant should be taken to mean just that, including bulk equipment. Requiring direct evidence of <em>need </em>before the Commission can take an applicant\u2019s statement of <em>willingness </em>at face value places a gratuitous obstacle in the way the Commission\u2019s fulfilling its mandate in the 1980 Act to broaden categories of property authorized by carriers\u2019 certificates. Moreover, this case represents just the sort of circumstances under which the Commission may ignore restrictive amendments. <em>See Port Norris-Alien, </em>729 F.2d at 210. Faced with the opposition of a constant litigant, the applicant simply asked for a restrictive amendment. For the above reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1373-6\">. In <em>Port Norris Express Co., Inc. v.
