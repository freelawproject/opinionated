She alleged that she had become disabled as a result of a back injury sustained in February, 1977. She is currently 63 years old and was 56 at the time of the onset of her alleged disability. She was born and raised in Mexico where she received an education through the third grade. She speaks Spanish, and is only marginally capable of reading, writing, and speaking English.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-10\">After a hearing, an administrative law judge found Valencia not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act and denied both benefit applications. The Appeals Council denied Valencia\u2019s request for review of the administrative law judge\u2019s decision. The Appeals Council decision constituted the final decision of the Secretary. Valencia then brought suit in federal district court, claiming the Appeals Council erred in denying her request for review. Upon the recommendation of a magistrate, the district court granted summary judgment against Valencia. This appeal timely followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1170-13\">I. DETERMINING \u201cDISABILITY\u201d UNDER THE ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-14\">Claimants are \u201cdisabled\u201d within the meaning of the Social Security Act if a medically determinable physical or mental impairment prevents them from engaging in \u201csubstantial gainful activity.\u201d <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A) (1982). The statute further elaborates upon this definition, requiring a showing that the claimant\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXFP\">physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy, regardless of whether such work exists in the immediate area in which he lives, or whether a specific job vacancy exists for him, or whether he would be hired if he applied for work. For purposes of the preceding sentence (with respect to any individual), \u201cwork which exists in the national economy\u201d means work which exists in significant numbers either in the region where such individual lives or in several regions of the country.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1170-15\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-16\">In 1978, the Secretary of Health and Human Services promulgated regulations implementing this statutory definition. <em>See </em>43 Fed.Reg. 55,349 (1978) (codified as amended at 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P (1984)). Unless the impairment is identified by the regulations as conclusively \u201cdisabling,\u201d the Secretary must determine whether the claimant retains the ability to perform either his former work or other less demanding employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>With the exception of the relatively small number of cases in which an individual\u2019s impairment is classified as per se \u201cdisabling,\u201d the Secretary must first ascertain whether the applicant can engage in his former work. If he can, he is not entitled to disability benefits. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404. 1520(e) (1984). In determining whether an applicant can perform his former work, the Secretary compares his physical and mental capabilities (\u201cresidual functional capacity\u201d) with the physical and mental demands of his pasfojobs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1171-4\">If the claimant is found unable to engage in his former work, the Secretary must then determine whether, considering the factors which Congress has identified as relevant \u2014 the applicant\u2019s physical ability, age, education, and <em>work experience, </em>he is able to perform less demanding work. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(f) (1984). As part of the 1978 regulations, the Secretary developed a matrix of medical-vocational guidelines in an effort to improve both the uniformity and efficiency of this determination. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 2 (1984). The guidelines consist of a series of tables which in most cases direct a conclusion of disability or nondisability depending upon the relationship of the four variables which Congress has identified. <em>See Stone v. Heckler, </em>722 F.2d 464, 468 (9th Cir.1983). (citing <em>Heckler v. Campbell, </em>461 U.S. 458, 462, 103 S.Ct. 1952, 1955, 76 L.Ed.2d 66 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-5\">II. THE ADMINISTRATIVE FINDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"AmN-\">The administrative law judge concluded that Valencia was not disabled, finding that her alleged impairments did not prevent her from meeting the mental and physical demands of her previous occupations. The administrative law judge classified her past relevant work as \u201cmedium\u201d grade in exer-tional effort. He found that Valencia retained the ability to engage in \u201cmedium\u201d work and thus concluded that she was not disabled under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-10\">Before the Appeals Council Valencia contended that the administrative law judge erred in concluding that she retained the capacity to perform \u201cmedium\u201d work. However, the Appeals Council did not address that question when it denied her request for review. Instead, it noted that she had past relevant work which could be classified as \u201clight\u201d and found that because Valencia retained the ability to engage in \u201clight\u201d work she was not \u201cdisabled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-11\">Thus, both the administrative law judge and the Appeals Council found Valencia able to perform her past relevant work. As a result, neither proceeded to step two, the application of the medical-vocational factors incorporated in the grids, in order to determine whether Valencia could engage in other forms of less demanding employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-12\">We conclude that the Appeals Council erred in finding that Valencia had past relevant work which was \u201clight.\u201d Rather, the administrative law judge correctly classified Valencia\u2019s past relevant work as \u201cmedium\u201d grade. We further find, however, that the administrative law judge\u2019s conclusion that Valencia retained the ability to engage in \u201cmedium\u201d work is not supported by substantial evidence. We therefore conclude that both the administrative law judge and the Appeals Council erred in finding Valencia capable of engaging in her past work. As a result, the resolution of Valencia\u2019s disability claim ne<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>cessitates an application of the grids in order to determine whether she can perform other less demanding work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-4\">III. VALENCIA\u2019S \u201cPAST RELEVANT WORK\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-5\">During the ten years she was in the United States prior to her injury, Valencia worked for eight years as a kitchen helper at various nursing homes and for two years as an agricultural laborer. As a kitchen helper, Valencia performed numerous functions, including cooking and preparing food, washing dishes, and carrying food trays to patients. These various tasks frequently involved the lifting and carrying of heavy industrial-size kitchenware. In her two years as an agricultural laborer, Valencia also performed various tasks, including hoeing and harvesting tomatoes, harvesting cherries, and sorting tomatoes at a machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-6\">The administrative law judge classified both Valencia\u2019s job as a kitchen helper and her job as an agricultural laborer as \u201cmedium\u201d grade in exertional effort. The Appeals Council \u201cnoted,\u201d however, that some of Valencia\u2019s \u201cpast relevant work\u201d could be classified as \u201clight.\u201d Since it concluded that Valencia could still perform \u201clight\u201d work, it denied her request for review. The Appeals Council failed, however, to specify what past relevant work it classified as \u201clight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-7\">The government contends that the unexpressed finding of the Appeals Council was that tomato sorting, one of the many tasks Valencia performed during her employment as a farm worker, constituted the past relevant work. It further asserts that tomato sorting should be classified as \u201clight\u201d work.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, the government concludes, the Appeals Council properly found that Valencia\u2019s past relevant work included light work. We think the government correctly explains the rationale for the Appeals Council\u2019s conclusion. However, we find that conclusion to be based on an error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-11\">Valencia\u2019s sorting of tomatoes may not properly be regarded as \u201cpast relevant work.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Valencia sorted tomatoes as one of many tasks she performed at the various farms where she was employed as an agricultural laborer. Indeed, the evidence reflects that even during the one six-week period when the majority of her time was spent sorting tomatoes, Valencia also performed the other tasks customarily performed by agricultural workers, including hoeing and harvesting the fields.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-12\">Every occupation consists of a myriad of tasks, each involving different degrees of physical exertion. To classify an applicant\u2019s \u201cpast relevant work\u201d according to the least demanding function of the claimant\u2019s past occupations is contrary to the letter and spirit of the Social Security Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-13\">As previously noted, both the Social Security Act and the Secretary\u2019s regulations provide that disability determinations are to be made according to a two-step process. First, it must be determined whether the applicant can perform his \u201cprevious work.\u201d If not, the Secretary must then determine whether the claimant can engage in other, less demanding, work which exists in the national economy. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A) (1982). It is at the second step of the process that the Secretary is authorized to consider the four factors, including \u201cwork experience,\u201d incorporated in the grids. <em>Id.; see also, </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(f) (1984). Thus, the statute and regulations direct the Secretary to first determine whether a disability claimant can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>perform his past job or occupation <em>before </em>examining whether the skills and training acquired by the claimant through his previous work experience have equipped him to undertake other similar or related jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-5\">Our decisions have consistently recognized that the initial inquiry in determining disability is whether the claimed impairment prevents the individual from engaging in his previous \u201cjob\u201d or \u201coccupation.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Stone v. Heckler, </em>722 F.2d at 468; <em>Sample v. Schweiker, </em>694 F.2d 639, 643 (9th Cir.1982); <em>Thompson v. Schweiker, </em>665 F.2d 936, 939 (9th Cir.1982). It is only after we have found the claimant unable to perform his past job that we have examined his \u201cwork experience\u201d and the other medical-vocational factors identified as relevant by Congress. <em>See Allen v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>726 F.2d 1470, 1472 (9th Cir.1984); <em>Kail v. Heckler, </em>722 F.2d 1496, 1497-98 (9th Cir. 1984); <em>Stone v. Heckler, </em>722 F.2d at 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-6\">The government\u2019s position ignores the dual nature of the inquiry demanded by the Social Security Act and recognized by our decisions. It collapses the two separate inquiries into one and would, in large numbers of cases, eliminate the use of the recently adopted grids. The government\u2019s argument, in effect, is that if a claimant is unable to perform any of his past jobs, but retains the capability to perform a particular task associated with one of those jobs, the claimant is nonetheless able to perform his \u201cpast relevant work.\u201d We disagree. Under the government\u2019s theory, in almost all cases it would only be necessary to examine whether the claimant could perform \u201clight\u201d or \u201csedentary\u201d work. To reduce the disability determination to such an inquiry is inconsistent with both the statutory scheme and the regulatory framework enacted by the Secretary. Where an individual cannot perform any of his previous jobs, but only one or more tasks associated with those jobs, the first of the two inquiries required by the statute must be resolved in the claimant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-9\">To summarize, if the claimant\u2019s disability renders him incapable of engaging in his previous occupations, he is unable to perform his \u201cpast relevant work.\u201d At this point, however, the Secretary is free to consider, as a part of the second step in the process, the skills which the claimant has previously developed in order to determine whether the applicant is able to perform <em>other </em>available work. It is at the second, not the first, step of the disability determination that the Secretary is aided by evidence regarding the claimant\u2019s previous \u201cwork experience,\u201d skills, and training.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-10\">In the case before us, we reject the government\u2019s contention that, because Valencia remains capable of sorting tomatoes, she can still perform her \u201cpast relevant work.\u201d The administrative law judge properly regarded Valencia\u2019s \u201cpast relevant work\u201d as consisting of her eight years employment as a \u201ckitchen helper\u201d as well as her two years as an \u201cagricultural laborer.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The government does not contest the administrative law judge\u2019s determination that both of these positions are classified as \u201cmedium\u201d work. Accordingly, we conclude that the Appeals Council erred in \u201cfinding\u201d that Valencia had engaged in past relevant work that was \u201clight\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-11\">IV. VALENCIA\u2019S \u201cRESIDUAL FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-12\">Although the administrative law judge found Valencia\u2019s \u201cpast relevant work\u201d to be \u201cmedium\u201d grade in exertional effort, he further found that she retained the ability to engage in \u201cmedium work\u201d and thus concluded that she was not disabled for purposes of the Act. We conclude there is insufficient evidence to sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>port the administrative law judge\u2019s finding that Valencia remains able to engage in \u201cmedium work.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\">Numerous doctors examined Valencia and rendered opinions regarding the extent to which her injuries impaired her ability to perform work-related activities. At least three of the examining doctors expressly concluded that Valencia\u2019s injuries were so severe that she could only undertake work involving minimal physical exertion. For example, Dr. Henry Go, after examining Valencia on two different occasions, concluded that she was \u201ctotally disabled\u201d and could only engage in \u201clight housework.\u201d On December 19, 1980, Valencia was examined by an orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Harvey Dannis. After issuing an extensive and detailed report, Dr. Dannis emphasized that Mrs. Valencia cannot sit or stand for any length of time, is so uncomfortable that she must change positions at 10-15 minute intervals, and must lie down for two hours each day. On the basis of his observations, Dr. Dannis concluded that Mrs. Valencia should not perform \u201canything more strenuous than sedentary work activities\u201d and even such work could only be undertaken on an irregular basis due to her severe impairments. Perhaps most important, Valencia\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Jose Gutierrez Verduzco, certified that he had been attending to Mrs. Valencia since the onset of her back problems in February, 1977, and recommended that she should not engage in \u201cany work that requires effort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ayp-dedup-0\">The medical evidence upon which the administrative law judge relied fails to support his conclusion that Valencia retains the ability to engage in \u201cmedium work.\u201d The conclusion was based principally upon the evaluation of Dr. George Ewing. Dr. Ewing\u2019s report indicated that Mrs. Valencia is able to sit for five hours at a time, to stand and walk for six hours a day, and to lift and carry up to ten pounds \u201cfrequently\u201d and over ten pounds only \u201coccasionally.\u201d However, the Secretary\u2019s regulations, attached to Dr. Ewing\u2019s report, provide that the capability to perform \u201cmedium work\u201d requires that a claimant be able to <em>frequently </em>lift and carry objects up to <em>25 </em>pounds. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567(c) (1984). Thus, Dr. Ewing\u2019s evaluation, wherein he clearly indicated that Mrs. Valencia could lift and carry objects from 10-25 pounds only \u201coccasionally\u201d rather than \u201cfrequently,\u201d actually belies rather than supports the administrative law judge\u2019s conclusion that Valencia retained the ability to engage in \u201cmedium work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-8\">The only other medical evidence of record was an evaluation by Dr. K.N. Hur-ria. Dr. Hurria examined Mrs. Valencia once and concluded that although \u201cshe should not lift heavy weights,\u201d she could undertake a \u201csitting type of job.\u201d This conclusion hardly represents substantial evidence that Valencia can frequently lift and carry objects up to 25 pounds and, thus, perform medium work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-9\">We find the overwhelming body of evidence is to the effect that Mrs. Valencia can no longer engage in \u201cmedium work;\u201d indeed the record is devoid of any evidence which suggests otherwise.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-10\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-11\">The administrative law judge correctly determined that Valencia\u2019s \u201cpast relevant work\u201d consisted of her positions as kitchen helper and agricultural laborer, both of which are classified as \u201cmedium\u201d work. The Appeals Council erred in holding that Valencia had engaged in past relevant work that was \u201clight.\u201d We further find that the law judge\u2019s conclusion that Valencia retained the capacity to perform \u201cmedi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>um work\u201d is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\">Thus, Valencia has demonstrated that her physical impairments prevent her from engaging in her previous occupations. A finding of disability is therefore mandated unless Valencia can perform other types of substantial gainful employment existing in the national economy. In making this determination, the Secretary is required to examine the medical-vocational guidelines. In most cases, the guidelines direct a conclusion of disability or non-disability depending upon the claimant\u2019s age, physical ability, education, and work experience. In this case, the uncontroverted evidence presented before the administrative law judge reveals that Valencia is of \u201cadvanced age\u201d (55 and over), \u201climited education\u201d (a non-high school graduate), trained in only unskilled positions, and has a residual functional capacity of either \u201clight\u201d or \u201csedentary\u201d work. Under these circumstances, the medical-vocational guidelines direct the Secretary to find Valencia disabled. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 2, Table No. 1, rule 201.01 and Table No.. 2, rule 202.01 (1984). Accordingly, we remand so that she may do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-6\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1170-11\">. We have been advised that in a subsequent administrative proceeding the Appeals Council has affirmed an administrative law judge\u2019s decision that Valencia was \"disabled\u201d as of May 28, 1982 and entitled to benefits thereafter. Because this appeal necessitates a determination of whether Valencia was entitled to disability benefits as of February, 1977, the question before us has not been rendered moot by the subsequent administrative decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1171-6\">. The regulations categorize occupations according to their physical exertion requirements, classifying jobs as either \"sedentary,\" \"light,\" \"medium,\u201d \u201cheavy,\u201d or \"very heavy.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567 (1984). The regulation defines \"light\u201d and \"medium\u201d work as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1171-8\">(b) <em>Light work. </em>Light work involves lifting no more than 20 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to 10 pounds. Even though the weight lifted may be very little, a job is in this category when it requires a good deal of walking or standing, or when it involves sitting most of the time with some pushing or pulling of arm or leg controls____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1171-14\">(c) <em>Medium work. </em>Medium work involves lifting no more than 50 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects up to 25 pounds.

The administrative law judge considered Valencia\u2019s experience as an agricultural laborer along the same lines, classifying the job as \"medium work\u201d notwithstanding the fact that one of its component tasks could have been regarded as \u201clight.\u201d The Appeals Council erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1174-5\">. The Appeals Council, having classified some of Valencia\u2019s past relevant work as \u201clight,\u201d did not address the sufficiency of the administrative law judge's finding that she retained the capacity to perform \"medium work.\u201d Our review is limited to determining whether that finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Hall </em>v. <em>Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, </em>602 F.2d 1372, 1374 (9th Cir.1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1174-12\">.
