We see no need to elucidate our reasons for dismissing these arguments. Suffice it to say that each is wholly lacking in merit, is without any logical basis, and has been rejected countless times by this Court and others. Accordingly, we affirm Judge Hamblen\u2019s well-reasoned decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">We now turn to the Commissioner\u2019s request for costs and damages. Where an appeal is completely frivolous, the courts of appeals are authorized to award damages and single or double costs to the appellee. Fed.R.App.P. 38. <em>See also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1912, 1927. This is so even where the Commissioner is the appellee. <em>Crain v. C.I.R., </em>737 F.2d 1417 (5th Cir.1984) (per curiam); <em>Beer v. C.I.R., </em>733 F.2d 435 (6th Cir.1984) (per curiam); <em>Lamb v. C.I.R., </em>733 F.2d 86 (10th Cir.1984) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Appellant is not, as his attorney maintained at oral argument, exercising his right to voice conceivably meritorious claims. His understanding of our federal tax system is such that he must have known' his claims would be rejected by this Court. Indeed, the tax court told him in no uncertain terms that his arguments were frivolous and that he was \u201cengaged in a \u2018folly\u2019 which [would] be costly to him.\u201d We can only conclude, therefore, that appellant brought this appeal either to delay the ultimate judgment against him or to make public his radical views on tax reform. We will not allow this Court\u2019s appellate processes to be misused for such purposes. Both damages and costs are appropriate sanctions against \u201cthose who would persistently raise arguments against the income tax which have been put to rest for years.\u201d <em>Parker v. C.I.R., </em>724 F.2d 469, 472 (5th Cir.1984). Accordingly, we grant the Commissioner\u2019s request and award the Commissioner double costs and $2500 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Affirmed with double costs and $2500 in damages against appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
