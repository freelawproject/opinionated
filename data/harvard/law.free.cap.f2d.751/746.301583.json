HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b861-12\">Burlington Northern Railroad appeals from a judgment in favor of Gulf Oil Corporation, the lessee of its track, and from the dismissal of its counterclaim for indemnity under the lease. The suit arose from an accident caused when Gulf railroad cars rolled from the leased siding and caused substantial damage. A jury found that the railroad\u2019s negligence allowed the cars to roll from the leased track. The district court held that under Texas law the indemnity provision of the lease did not cover the railroad\u2019s negligence. We disagree. The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for entry of judgment in favor of Burlington.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b861-16\">Gulf Oil Corporation leased track located in Denison, Texas from the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway Company. Burlington Northern Railroad is Frisco\u2019s successor-in-interest. Frisco employees, pursuant to the lease, placed nine of Gulf\u2019s railroad cars loaded with polypropylene on the leased track. Frisco employees attached to the track a device designed to derail the cars should they start to roll. The cars rolled through the device, entered the main track and collided with a Frisco train five miles down the line. Gulf\u2019s railroad cars and plastic products and Frisco\u2019s train, main line track and signal sustained extensive damage. Gulf sued Burlington for negligence and breach of the lease for failure to properly install and maintain derail devices adequate to prevent Gulf\u2019s cars from entering the main line. Burlington counterclaimed for recovery of its damages pursuant to the indemnity provision in the lease. The jury found for Gulf on the negligence and contract claims, and the court, whom the parties requested determine the issue, dismissed Burlington\u2019s suit for indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-17\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b861-18\">Burlington contends the district court erred in denying indemnity pursuant to paragraph eight of the lease:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-19\">Lessee [Gulf], in further consideration of the lease herein granted, hereby assumes all responsibility and liability for, and expressly covenants and agrees to protect, indemnify and save harmless Frisco from and against any and all loss, cost, damage or expense in consequence of death of or injury to persons whomsoever, <em>or loss or destruction of or damage to property whatsoever, in any manner caused by, resulting from or </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number><em>incident to storage of private cars on said track, </em>or resulting from or growing out of any failure of Lessee to comply with or perform any of the obligations, terms and conditions on Lessee\u2019s part to be complied with or performed hereunder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">(emphasis added.) Burlington argues that by agreement risks associated with the rail-car storage were shifted to Gulf. Gulf maintains that the shifted hazards did not include the risk of railroad negligence because Texas law requires that an indemnification of one\u2019s own negligence be explicitly expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">In this diversity suit, decisions of Texas courts control. Texas courts will enforce contracts indemnifying a party against his own negligence. <em>Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. v. Jefferson Construction Co., </em>565 S.W.2d 916, 920 (Tex. 1978); <em>Spence &amp; Howe Construction Co. v. Gulf Oil Corp., </em>365 S.W.2d 631, 633 (Tex.1963); <em>Delta Engineering Corp. v. Warren Petroleum, Inc., </em>668 S.W.2d 770, 772 (Tex.App. \u2014 Houston [1st Dist.] 1984, writ ref\u2019d n.r.e.). Indemnity provisions, however, will be strictly construed and generally \u201cwill not protect an indemnitee against his own negligence unless the obligation of the indemnitor to do so is expressed in <em>clear and unequivocal terms.\u201d Eastman Kodak Co. v. Exxon Corp., </em>603 S.W.2d 208, 211 (Tex.1980) (emphasis in original); <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co. v. Commercial Standard Insurance Co., </em>490 S.W.2d 818, 822 (Tex.1972); <em>Joe Adams &amp; Son v. McCann Construction Co., </em>475 S.W.2d 721, 723 (Tex.1971). <em>See also Haywood v. Southwestern Electric Power Co., </em>708 F.2d 163, 166 (5th Cir.1983); <em>McClane v. Sun Oil Co., </em>634 F.2d 855, 858 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Chevron Oil Co. v. E.D. Walton Construction Co., </em>517 F.2d 1119, 1121 (5th Cir.1975). Texas does not require that the word \u201cnegligence\u201d be used, but does require \u201cthat the parties state in so many words, that they intend to save the indem-nitee harmless from liability for his own negligence.\u201d <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund, </em>490 S.W.2d at 822.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">At one point in the development of Texas indemnity law, the Texas Supreme Court identified certain \u201cexceptions\u201d to the \u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d rule, one of which involved \u201cagreements in which one person clearly undertakes to indemnify another against liability for injuries or damages caused by defects in certain premises or resulting from the maintenance or operation of a specified instrumentality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 822.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Later that court recognized that the exceptions were actually specific applications of its requirement that an indemnity of one\u2019s own negligence be clearly expressed. <em>Eastman Kodak, </em>603 S.W.2d at 212. For example, the specific premises exception is but \u201can application of the general rule, for when indemnity is <em>clearly </em>expressed with reference to specific premises or - instrumentalities the indemnitor necessarily knows that he is assuming full responsibility for losses in connection with those particular premises or instrumentalities, regardless of whose negligence may cause the losses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original.) The rationale of <em>Eastman Kodak </em>also explains prior Texas cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">In <em>Houston &amp; Texas Central Railroad Co. v. Diamond Press Brick Co., </em>111 Tex. 18, 222 S.W. 204, <em>modified on rehearing on other grounds, </em>111 Tex. 18, 24, 226 S.W. 140 (1920), a brick company contracted to \u201csave the [railroad] harmless from any and all claims for damages arising from any cause whatsoever <em>growing out of the construction, maintenance and operation of [a] spur track \u201d. </em>(emphasis added). Indemnity was ordered despite the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>fact the indemnity clause did not explicitly refer to the railroad\u2019s own negligence. Similarly, in <em>Mitchell\u2019s, Inc. v. Friedman, </em>157 Tex. 424, 303 S.W.2d 775, 779 (1957), a lessee, who had contracted to accept the leased premises, waive \u201cdefects therein and ... hold the Lessor harmless from all claims for any such damage,\u201d was held to have clearly assumed any and all liability arising from the use of the leased building, including that generated by the lessor\u2019s negligence. In <em>St. Louis Southwestern Railway Co. v. </em>Lyons,. 486 S.W.2d 890 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 Beaumont 1972, writ ref\u2019d n.r.e.), a feed company had entered into an \u201cIndustrial Track Agreement\u201d with several railroads for the use of certain spur track. Two railcars rolled from this track onto the main line and collided with a truck at an intersection. The negligent railroads sued the feed company for indemnity under the track agreement which required the lessee to indemnify them \u201cagainst all liability, loss, damage or expense, occasioned by, arising from or incident to the moving of ... any freight cars located on said track.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 891. This language obligated the feed company to indemnify the railroads for the truck driver\u2019s damages, held \u201coccasioned by, arising from or incident to\u201d a \u201cspecified operation, i.e., moving of any freight cars, without regard to fault.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 892.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">By its \u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d rule, Texas ensures that a contracting party is put on \u201cfair notice that under his agreement and through no fault of his own, a large and ruinous award of damages may be assessed against him solely by reason of negligence attributable to the opposite contracting party.\u201d <em>McCann, </em>475 S.W.2d at 724, <em>quoting Spence &amp; Howe Construction Co., </em>365 S.W.2d 631 (Tex. 1963). <em>See also Chevron Oil Co., </em>517 F.2d at 1122; <em>Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., </em>565 S.W.2d at 920. When indemnity is clearly provided with respect to a specific instrumentality, operation, or premise, this \u201cfair notice\u201d objective is satisfied, for the indemnitor \u201cordinarily knows and certainly should be aware he is assuming full responsibility\u201d for those premises. <em>McCann, </em>475 S.W.2d at 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">We are persuaded that Gulf Oil had \u201cfair notice\u201d that it assumed full responsibility for damages incident to the storage of the hopper cars on the leased tracks. Gulf agreed to indemnify Frisco for \u201cany and all loss ... in any manner caused by, resulting from or <em>incident to </em>storage of private cars on said track____\u201d (emphasis added). The contract thus encompassed both a specified operation \u2014 \u201cstorage of private cars,\u201d and a specified premise \u2014 \u201con said track\u201d, and then expanded coverage by use of the words \u201cincident to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">Gulf insists that we strictly construe the contractual language and hold it inapplicable to this accident which occurred five miles from the \u201csaid\u201d leased track and which involved \u201cmovement\u201d rather than \u201cstorage\u201d of the cars. Gulf\u2019s construction, however, ignores the contractual language \u201ccaused by, resulting from <em>or incident to,\u201d </em>(emphasis added), which expressly extends indemnity to both direct <em>and </em>indirect loss. Gulf knew or should have known it was assuming full responsibility for damages in any way connected to \u201cstorage of private cars on said track.\u201d In any event, this accident began when the cars started their roll. They did not roll out from under the indemnity at some undefined point in their passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">Finally, Gulf argues that because the jury also found that Burlington breach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>ed the lease in supplying defective derails, Gulf is excused from performing its dependent obligation to indemnify under the lease.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That Gulf could reasonably anticipate that any negligence of Burlington would be in connection with its obligation under the lease, and thus coincidentally breach its terms, is implicit in the conclusion that Gulf\u2019s indemnity included the negligence of Burlington. Because the risk of injury from the railroad\u2019s negligent performance was by agreement placed with Gulf, that negligence is by definition no breach of the contract sufficient to excuse Gulf\u2019s performance. Gulf\u2019s argument begs the central question of the scope of indemnity and robs the indemnity clause of its intended meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">In dismissing Burlington\u2019s counterclaim for its own damages the lower court denied the indemnity clause its full efficacy. As we have explained, Gulf\u2019s obligation to indemnify was contractual and unaffected by Burlington\u2019s fault. In return for storage track and lower freight rates, Gulf bound itself to indemnify the railroad \u201cagainst any and all loss or destruction of or damage to property whatsoever, ... incident to storage of private cars on said track.\u201d The Frisco locomotives, main line track and railroad signal were damaged in the same collision that injured Gulf\u2019s cars and products. All are \u201closses\u201d \u201cincident to storage\u201d and within the grasp of the indemnity clause. As Gulf is contractually bound to indemnify Burlington for \u201call\u201d such losses, the judgment in its favor is reversed and the cause remanded for entry of judgment in favor of Burlington for its stipulated damages. In view of this disposition, we need not address Burlington\u2019s other contentions or Gulf\u2019s cross-appeal for pre-judgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b862-6\">. In addition to the \u201cspecific premises or instru-mentalities\u201d exception, the Texas Supreme Court has enunciated two other exceptions to the \u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d rule. These concern \u201cagreements which fall within the peculiar circumstances of the indemnitor having complete supervision over the property and employees of the indemnitee in connection with the performance of the indemnitor's contract,\u201d and \u201ccontracts in which there is an unequivocal provision that indemnitor will protect and indemnify the indemnitee from any and all liability by reason of injuries to indemnitor's employ-ees____\" <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund, </em>490 S.W.2d at 822 (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b863-6\">. <em>See also Spence &amp; Howe, </em>365 S.W.2d at 637 (indemnity for any damages growing out of work covered by subcontract for setting and piling of propane tanks); <em>James Stewart &amp; Co. v.
