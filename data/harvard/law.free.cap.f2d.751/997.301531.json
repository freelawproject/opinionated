He appealed to the district court, which granted summary judgment in favor of appellees (hereinafter the Marines Corps). Garrett seeks reversal on several grounds. He also asks this court to extend the exclusionary rule to military administrative discharge proceedings. We decline to do so because the societal cost would be intolerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-18\">1. PERTINENT FACTS AND PROCEDURE</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-19\">The procedural background of this case provides the framework for consideration of Garrett\u2019s contentions on appeal. Accordingly, we first summarize the proceedings before the Special-Court Martial, the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Military Review, the Administrative Discharge Board, and the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1113-20\">A. <em>The Court-Martial Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"AqRt\">On October 8, 1981, a Special Court-Martial found Garrett guilty of possession and the introduction of 386 grams of marijuana onto the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base in violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 892. Garrett was sentenced to pay reduction and separation with a bad conduct discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-21\">The case against Garrett was based, in part, on evidence seized by a military police officer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On July 16, 1981, a roving patrol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>observed four servicemen, including Garrett, engaged in discussion on the Camp Pendleton Base in an area known to be frequented by persons who use controlled substances. The officer became suspicious. He approached the group and ordered them to \u201cfreeze.\u201d Garrett was observed slipping what appeared to be a pipe into his pocket. He was commanded to remove and relinquish the item. At this time, the officer observed marijuana inside the pipe. The officer then requested and received Garrett\u2019s consent to search the interior of his camper. The search revealed sixteen plastic bags of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-4\">The marijuana and the pipe were admitted into evidence at the Special Court-Martial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-5\">Garrett was interviewed by Naval Investigation Service (hereinafter NIS) Agent Garcia following his arrest. He was fully advised of his rights prior to questioning. Garrett admitted ownership of the contraband, and stated that he obtained the marijuana in Arizona for the purpose of later sale and use. It is unclear whether this statement was introduced at the Special Court-Martial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While the record of the court-martial was being reviewed, Garrett was on \u201cappellate leave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-6\">B. <em>Military Review Court Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ah0\">Garrett raised three assignments of error on his appeal to the United States Navy-Marine Court of Military Review (hereinafter Review Court). Only one was addressed by the Review Court; i.e., the trial judge\u2019s alleged error in denying Garrett\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized in violation of the fourth amendment. <em>United States v. Garrett, </em>15 M.J. 601, 602 (NMCMR 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-11\">The Review Court held that the military police officer lacked probable cause to seize Garrett\u2019s pipe. The Review Court concluded that the pipe was erroneously admitted at the court-martial and that the evidence obtained in Garrett\u2019s camper was equally inadmissible as the fruit of the initial fourth amendment violation. <em>Id. </em>at 604. The Review Court set aside the Special Court-Martial\u2019s finding of guilt, dismissed the charge, and set aside all specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-12\">The Review Court limited its discussion to the reasonableness of the arrest and search. The Review Court stated: \u201cOur resolution of that issue renders the remaining assignments of error moot.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 602. The Review Court did not address the sufficiency of the evidence presented to show factual guilt nor the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-13\">C. <em>Administrative Discharge Board Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1114-14\">On December 2, 1982, Garrett was ordered to return to active duty by his Commanding General. The purpose of this order was to give the Board jurisdiction to determine Garrett\u2019s fitness for future service in the Marine Corps. The Commanding General recommended that Garrett be discharged with a characterization of service as \u201cother than honorable.\u201d On January 7, 1983, Garrett was notified of Board separation proceedings based on the charge of \u201cmisconduct; drug abuse\u201d pursuant to <em>Marine Corps Separation and Retirement Manual </em>(hereinafter <em>Manual) </em>\u00a7\u00a7 6210.1, 6210.5. The Board granted Garrett\u2019s request for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>At the hearing, the Marine\u2019s Recorder (Recorder) presented the Board a \u201cbasic package\u201d of evidence. This package which Garrett\u2019s military and civilian counsel had received prior to the proceeding included: (1) lab reports authenticating the marijuana seized in the pipe and camper; (2) the Special Court-Martial order documenting the specifications tried; and (3) a signed NIS statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-5\">The Recorder also offered into evidence the full NIS report, and Agent Garcia\u2019s unsworn statement which summarized Garrett\u2019s admissions. Garrett\u2019s civilian counsel had not received this supplemental material prior to the Board proceedings. His military counsel, however, had reviewed the entire report in connection with the court-martial. Garrett made a timely objection to the admission of all evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">Garrett presented evidence of overall good conduct and job performance. He denied participation in the <em>sale </em>of contraband. During closing argument, the Recorder implied that Garrett had a record of misconduct as a juvenile. Garrett did not object to the statements made by the Recorder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1115-7\">Following the hearing on the charge against Garrett, the Board recommended separation under \u201cother than honorable\u201d conditions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On February 16, 1983, the Commanding General effected this recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-8\">D. <em>District Court Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1115-9\">Garrett initially requested that the district court issue a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction staying his administrative discharge. This relief was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-13\">On May 31, 1983, Garrett filed an amended complaint requesting that the court declare the discharge void, vacate the judgment, and return him to active duty status. Thereafter, cross-motions for summary judgment were filed. On January 30,1984, the district court granted, the Marine Corps\u2019 motion for a summary judgment. Garrett\u2019s motion for a summary judgment was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-14\">The district court filed a memorandum decision in which it held, <em>inter alia, </em>that the exclusionary rule was inapplicable to the Board proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-15\">ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"Aoiu\">Garrett presents the following issues for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-16\">1. Should the exclusionary rule be extended to military administrative discharge proceedings?</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-17\">2. Did the Court of Military Review review the merits of the issues raised by Garrett concerning the judgment of conviction by the Special Court-Martial, thereby precluding any discharge proceedings concerning the same acts?</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-18\">3. Was the act of recalling Garrett to active duty for the purpose of initiating discharge proceedings an abuse of discretion?</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-19\">4. Were hearsay statements erroneously admitted by the Board?</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-20\">5. Were the Marine Recorder\u2019s statements at the Board proceeding made outside the scope of his authority?</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>6. Did the Board admit the NIS report in violation of applicable regulations?</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">A. <em>Extension of Exclusionary Rule to Discharge Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-6\">Garrett contends that his separation under \u201cother than honorable\u201d conditions was invalid because the Board relied on evidence seized in violation of the fourth amendment. His argument for extension of the exclusionary rule to administrative discharge proceedings rests on two grounds: (1) The exclusionary rule applies to criminal and quasi-criminal proceedings. Garrett asserts that the Board proceedings were criminal or quasi-criminal because he was given a less than honorable discharge as a punishment for his past behavior; (2) The benefit which may be derived from extending the exclusionary rule to administrative discharge proceedings is the deterrence of unlawful military police conduct. We are told that such benefit outweighs the cost to society of proscribing the military\u2019s use of otherwise competent evidence in administrative discharge proceedings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-7\">1. <em>Nature of Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-8\">The Supreme Court has not extended the rule excluding evidence seized in violation of the fourth amendment to proceedings which are civil in nature. \u201cIn the complex and turbulent history of the [exclusionary] rule, the Court has <em>never </em>applied it to exclude evidence from a civil proceeding, federal or state.\u201d <em>United States v. Janis, </em>428 U.S. 433, 447, 96 S.Ct. 3021, 3029, 49 L.Ed.2d 1046 <em>reh'g denied, </em>429 U.S. 874, 97 5. Ct. 196, 50 L.Ed.2d 158 (1976) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-12\">The exclusionary rule has been applied to federal criminal proceedings since 1914. <em>Weeks v. United States, </em>232 U.S. 383, 34 S.Ct. 341, 58 L.Ed. 652 (1914). Garrett first contends that the administrative discharge proceedings were criminal in nature and therefore the <em>Weeks </em>rule is applicable to this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-15\">In deciding whether the administrative discharge proceedings under review were criminal in nature, we are guided by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 3479, 82 L.Ed.2d 778 (1984). The threshhold inquiry in <em>Lopez-Mendoza </em>was whether a deportation hearing was criminal in nature. The Court concluded it was not. <em>Id. </em>104 S.Ct. at 3484. Although unlawful entry into the United States is a crime, the Court concluded that a deportation hearing is not designed to punish for such entry. Rather, the hearing \u201clooks prospectively to [the alien\u2019s] right to remain in this country in the future. Past conduct is relevant only insofar as it may shed light on the [alien\u2019s] right to remain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>104 S.Ct. at 3484.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-18\">Administrative discharge proceedings are equally prospective. The function of such proceedings is to determine eligibility for further military service; not to punish for past wrongs. This purpose is explicitly set forth in the governing <em>Manual </em>provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ais-dedup-0\">There is a sharp and distinct delineation between the administrative process which has as its purpose the administrative elimination of unsuitable, unfit, or unqualified Marines, and the judicial process, the purpose of which is to establish the guilt or innocence of a member accused of a crime and to administer punishment when appropriate. No evidence will be rejected from consideration solely on the grounds that it would be inadmissible in court-martial proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"An5q\"><em>Manual </em>\u00a7 6316.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-19\">Garrett also argues that the administrative discharge proceedings are quasi-criminal in nature because his right to an honorable discharge was forfeited. He asserts that \u201cthe right to an honorable discharge is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>a property right \u2014 to take property away because of misconduct is a penalty.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Garrett\u2019s penalty argument is not supported by the law of this circuit. In <em>Better v. Middendorf, </em>632 F.2d 788 (9th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 855, 102 S.Ct. 304, 70 L.Ed.2d 150 <em>reh\u2019g denied sub nom. Miller v. Weinberger, </em>454 U.S. 1069, 102 S.Ct. 621, 70 L.Ed.2d 605 (1981), we held that discharge proceedings against enlistees, and their ultimate separation for violating Navy regulations against homosexuality, did not involve a property interest. We reasoned that \u201c[t]he Navy regulations and practices create no reasonable expectation of continued employment once a person is determined to fall within the categories described in the applicable regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 805; <em>accord Watkins v. United States Army, </em>721 F.2d 687 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-4\">Garrett\u2019s attempt to characterize administrative discharge proceedings as being analogous to a forfeiture proceeding is equally unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">The exclusionary rule has been applied to forfeiture proceedings because they have been deemed to be \u201cquasi-criminal.\u201d <em>Boyd v. United States, </em>116 U.S. 616, 634, 6 S.Ct. 524, 534, 29 L.Ed. 746 (1886). The Court continues to instruct us, however, that the reason forfeiture proceedings are so characterized is that \u201cforfeiture is <em>clearly a penalty </em>for the criminal offense.\u201d <em>Janis </em>428 U.S. at 447 n. 17, 96 S.Ct. at 3029 n. 17, <em>quoting One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v. Comm. of Pennsylvania, </em>380 U.S. 693, 701, 85 S.Ct. 1246, 1251, 14 L.Ed.2d 170 (1965) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-6\">The Board recommended that Garrett be separated from the service with an \u201cother than honorable\u201d discharge because of his unfitness for future duty as shown by his commission of a crime \u2014 not as a punishment for his past behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-7\">2. <em>Balancing Test</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1117-8\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Janis </em>and <em>Lopez-Mendoza </em>did not foreclose extension of the exclusionary rule to civil proceedings. Instead, the Court instructed that the exclusionary rule may be extended where the benefits exceed the costs to society.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-9\">The balancing test we are required to employ, \u201cimprecise as it may be,\u201d requires weighing \u201cthe likely social benefits of excluding unlawfully seized evidence against the likely costs.\u201d Where the costs exceed the benefits, the exclusionary rule may not be applied. <em>Lopez-Mendoza </em>104 S.Ct. at 3486, <em>citing Janis </em>428 U.S. at 446, 96 S.Ct. at 3028 <em>(compare Adamson v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>745 F.2d 541 [9 Cir., 1984]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-10\">Garrett contends that the scales weigh in favor of extending the exclusionary rule to Board proceedings. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-11\">a. <em>Costs of Extension of Exclusionary Rule to Administrative Military Discharge Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1117-12\">The Supreme Court has consistently recognized the essential requirement of consistent military discipline. \u201c[T]he primary business of armies and navies [is] to fight or be ready to fight wars should the occa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>sion arise.\u201d <em>Schlesinger v. Councilman, </em>420 U.S. 738, 757, 95 S.Ct. 1300, 1313, 43 L.Ed.2d 591 (1975), <em>quoting United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, </em>350 U.S. 11, 17, 76 S.Ct. 1, 5, 100 L.Ed. 8 (1955). This readiness demands a \u201cmilitary discipline and obedience to orders [which] cannot be taught on the battlefield; the habit of immediate compliance with orders must be virtually reflex with no time for debate or reflection.\u201d <em>Chappell v. Wallace, </em>462 U.S. 296, 103 S.Ct. 2362, 2365, 76 L.Ed.2d 586 (1983). <em>See Parker v. Levy, </em>417 U.S. 733, 743, 94 S.Ct. 2547, 2555, 41 L.Ed.2d 439 (1974) (Court has long recognized that the military is by necessity, a specialized society); <em>Schlesinger, </em>420 U.S. at 757, 95 S.Ct. at 1312 (the laws and traditions governing military discipline have a long history ... they are founded on unique military exigencies as powerful now as in the past).</p>\n<p id=\"a2z-dedup-0\">The disruptive effect of extending the exclusionary rule to military administrative discharge proceedings is a price which our society cannot afford to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"anp-dedup-0\">This disruption is vividly illustrated by the facts of this case. Were we to disallow the use of unlawfully seized evidence in administrative discharge proceedings, the Marine Corps would be forced to permit a person who used and possessed marijuana for sale on a military base to return to active duty.</p>\n<p id=\"ajp-dedup-1\">/-v i \u2022 ., , ,, , <em>, </em>. , Our conclusion, that the costs of extend- , . i i ill. , . mg the exclusionary rule to military administrative discharge proceedings exceeds the , ... , ?, . , , , ,, benefits to society, is supported by the following comment of a unanimous Supreme Court in <em>Chappell:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASZr\">The special status of the military has required, the Constitution contemplated, Congress has created and this Court has long recognized two systems of justice to some extent parallel: one for civilians and one for military personnel (citation omitted). The special nature of military life, the need for unhesitating and decisive action by military officers and equally disciplined responses by enlisted personnel ... \u201csupports] the military establishment\u2019s power to deal with its own personnel. The most obvious reason is that courts are ill-equipped to determine the impact upon discipline that any particular intrusion upon military authority might have.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq0Y\"><em>Id. </em>103 g Ct at 2367-68, <em>quoting </em>E. Warren 37 N.Y.U.L.Rev. at 187.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"A6n\">b. <em>Benefits</em></p>\n<p id=\"AToZ\">While various arguments have been advanced to justify the adoption of the exclusionary rule throughout its \u201cturbulent history,\u201d the Supreme Court has most recently indicated that the prime purpose of the rule is \u201cto deter future unlawful police conduct.\u201d <em>Lopez-Mendoza </em>104 S.Ct. at 3486; <em>Janis, </em>428 U.S. at 446, 96 S.Ct. at 3028, <em>citing United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 347, 94 S.Ct. 613, 619, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974). The Court has noted that extension of the rule to civil proceedings would provide \u201cmarginal deterrence\u201d <em>Janis, </em>428 U.S. at 453, 96 S.Ct. at 3031 and has cautioned that even in the criminal context, the efficacy of the rule is dubious , , , \u25a0rr <em>.\u00b1 </em>, T TT at best. <em>United States v. Leon, </em>\u2014 U.S. _ n 6, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>3405 3413 n. 6 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"abr-dedup-0\"><em>Lopez-Mendoza </em>informs us that \u201cThe exclusionary rule is likely to be most effective when applied to ... intrasovereign violations.\u201d <em>Lopez-Mendoza, </em>104 S.Ct. at 3486.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Court, nevertheless, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>concluded that the costs of extending the rule to civil deportation proceedings conducted by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) where evidence was seized by INS agents in violation of the fourth amendment outweighed the possibility of any marginal deterrence. <em>Id. </em>104 S.Ct. at 3486-91.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">We are mindful that in this matter the evidence introduced at the administrative discharge proceeding was gathered by military police who were also members of the Marine Corps. We have carefully weighed that factor against the costs to the Marine Corps of the exclusion of material evidence of the moral fitness of a person to serve in the military. We conclude that the fact that the evidence was seized by intrasover-eign agents did not tip the scale in favor of extending the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-6\">We do not have the special training or knowledge to fathom the extent of the damage to military discipline which would result from imposition of the exclusionary rule in administrative discharge proceedings. We are certain, however, that the cost far exceeds the dubious \u201cadditional marginal deterrence\u201d that might result from such an intrusion upon military authority and discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-7\">B. <em>Reversal of Court-Martial Proceedings Not on Merits No Bar Administrative Discharge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1119-8\">Relying on section 6106.1 of the <em>Manual, </em>Garrett contends that the order of the Review Court, dismissing the charge and setting aside all specifications against Garrett, constituted an acquittal and a judicial determination of the merits of his factual guilt of possession and the introduction of marijuana on a Marine Corps base. Alternatively, he asserts that under general res judicata principles, the decision of the Review Court to dismiss the charge against him barred an administrative discharge hearing. Under the doctrine of res judicata, \u201ca final judgment on the merits precludes the parties from relitigating claims which were or could have been raised in that action.\u201d <em>Amaro v. Continental Can Co., </em>724 F.2d 747, 749 (9th Cir.1984); <em>Nevada v. United States, </em>463 U.S. 110, 103 S.Ct. 2906, 2918, 77 L.Ed.2d 509 <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 210, 78 L.Ed.2d 186 (1983); <em>Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc. v. Shore, </em>439 U.S. 322, 326 n. 5, 99 S.Ct. 645, 649 n. 5, 58 L.Ed.2d 552 (1979). Both arguments must fail because the Review Court did not reach the merits of the charges against Garrett.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-13\">Section 6106.1 of the <em>Manual </em>provides that a person may not be separated from the Marine Corps for \u201c[cjonduct that has been the subject of judicial proceedings resulting in an acquittal or action having the effect of an acquittal except ... (a) when such action is based upon a judicial determination <em>not </em>going to the merits of the issue of factual guilt of the respondent.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-14\">As noted above, the Military Review Court did not reach the merits of the issue of Garrett\u2019s factual guilt. After satisfying itself that the evidence introduced by the government was illegally obtained, the court expressly declined to reach any other assignment of error. The Review Court did not discuss the sufficiency of the evidence offered to prove Garrett\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>The legal basis for the Review Court\u2019s limited inquiry is quite clear, albeit unexpli-cated. Since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Weeks v. United States, </em>232 U.S. 383, 34 S.Ct. 341, 58 L.Ed. 652 (1914), guilt is irrelevant where the government\u2019s evidence was obtained in violation of the fourth amendment. The guilty must go free where the blundering constable gathers his evidence illegally.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-4\">Because the Review Court did not determine the merits of Garrett\u2019s factual guilt prior to dismissing the charge against him, section 6106.1 and the doctrine of res judi-cata are inapplicable to the validity of the administrative decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-5\">C. <em>Return to Active Duty</em></p>\n<p id=\"A6f\">Garrett contends that his fifth amendment right to due process was violated by his compelled return to active duty. He alleges that the Commanding General\u2019s sole purpose in taking this action was to give the Board jurisdiction to award an \u201cother than honorable\u201d discharge. According to Garrett, this \u201cact was vindictive and, thus, constituted an arbitrary and capricious act and an abuse of the Commanding General\u2019s discretion.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-6\">This court must uphold the decision of the Commanding General unless it is found to be \u201carbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with the law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). Under this standard of review, the actions of the Marine Corps are presumed to be valid. <em>KCST-TV Inc. v. FCC, </em>699 F.2d 1185, 1191 (D.C.Cir.1983); <em>Wilderness Public Rights Fund v. Kleppe, </em>608 F.2d 1250, 1254 (9th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 982, 100 S.Ct. 2962, 64 L.Ed.2d 838 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-7\">The Commanding General acted within the scope of his discretion in ordering Garrett returned to active duty. As stated in <em>Pickell v. Reed, </em>326 F.Supp. 1086, 1089 (N.D.Cal.), <em>aff'd, </em>446 F.2d 898 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 946, 92 S.Ct. 301, 30 L.Ed.2d 262 (1971): \u201cA serviceman does not have a right per se to remain in the service until either court martialed or the expiration of his enlistment. <em>McAulay v. United States, </em>305 F.2d 836, 158 Ct.Cl. 359 (1962) ... A serviceman\u2019s removal may be accomplished administratively. <em>Rowe v. United States, </em>167 Ct.Cl. 468 (1964).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-10\">Garrett has failed to point to any evidence in the record that demonstrates that the Commanding General acted vindictively or abused his discretion in returning Garrett to active duty from \u201cappellate leave.\u201d Garrett does not argue that the Commanding General lacked the power to recall him to active duty. The fact that the Commanding General may have ordered him back to active duty to give the Board the power to consider other options than an honorable discharge does not prove vindictiveness or an abuse of discretion. Evidence of Garrett\u2019s possession of marijuana for sale amply supports the Commanding General\u2019s decision that the Board should consider awarding an other than honorable discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-11\">D. <em>Hearsay</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1120-12\">Garrett further objects to the admission of Agent Garcia\u2019s unsworn statement on the ground that it was hearsay. There is no foundation for this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-13\">The strict rules of evidence governing the criminal court-martial proceeding, are not applicable to hearings before the Board. <em>Manual </em>\u00a7 6306.1. Furthermore, \u00a7 6317 of the <em>Manual </em>provides that testimonial evidence may be presented by <em>unsworn </em>witness statements or any other accurate or reliable means.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1120-14\">Agent Garcia\u2019s statement was properly admitted into evidence at the Board proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>E. <em>Recorder\u2019s Statements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">In his closing argument before the Board, the Recorder referred to the district court\u2019s denial of Garrett\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order. The Recorder also implied that Garrett had been engaged in \u201csome type\u201d of misconduct as a juvenile. Garrett contends that these statements were prejudicial and outside the scope of the Recorder\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">Section 6315.3 of the <em>Manual </em>sets forth the responsibility of the Recorder to the Board. The Recorder is under a duty to insure \u201cthat the Board is presented only such materials and documents which may properly be considered by it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The section further provides that \u201c[t]he Recorder\u2019s primary responsibility is to exploit all practical sources of information and to bring out all the facts in a manner in order to permit the Board to make fully informed findings and recommendations.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-7\">The Recorder\u2019s comments were directed to an exploration of \u201call practical sources of information.\u201d We note that Garrett failed to object to these comments at the Board hearing. In any event, the challenged comments appear quite harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of Garrett\u2019s involvement in serious misconduct meriting discharge from the Marine Corps.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-8\">F. <em>NIS Report</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-9\">Garrett contends that he was denied the right to examine and obtain copies of evidence presented to the Board in violation of section 6304 of the <em>Manual</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Garrett points to the fact that his civilian counsel was only provided the \u201cbasic package\u201d of evidence prior to the Board hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-10\">Garrett asserts that he was not afforded the opportunity to view or obtain the <em>entire </em>NIS investigation materials which were presented to the Board. This additional \u201cpackage\u201d contained duplicate copies of the lab report, chain of custody documents and Agent Garcia\u2019s unsworn statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-12\">We agree that section 6304 of the <em>Manual </em>mandated that Garrett be afforded the opportunity to examine this additional evidence. The facts show, however, that Garrett\u2019s civilian counsel had a full and fair opportunity to examine the entire NIS report at the time it was proferred by the Recorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-13\">The Marines concede that it is customary to provide advance copies of evidence to counsel. Contrary to Garrett\u2019s contentions, however, the relevant <em>Manual </em>provision does not require <em>prior </em>notice. <em>Manual </em>\u00a7 6304. Additionally, Garrett\u2019s military counsel reviewed the NIS report long before the Board was convened. Garrett was neither surprised by nor unfamiliar with the evidence presented before the Board. Thus, no prejudice occurred because his civilian counsel did not receive the report prior to the hearing. Accordingly, the introduction of the full NIS report did not violate Garrett\u2019s right to due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-14\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-15\">NORRIS, Circuit Judge, concurring separately:</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-16\">I concur in Judge Alarcon\u2019s opinion except for Part IIA.

GARRETT further admitted that he had been trying to sell the marijuana he brought from Arizona, but had not been very effective as it is homegrown and not of the best quality. GARRETT further stated that when he was apprehended by the Military Police at Lake O\u2019Neil he was in the process of getting ready to smoke the marijuana, but had not yet had a chance to do so. GARRETT refused to submit a written statement regarding the above information.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1115-10\">.

In his opening brief, Garrett\u2019s argument relied on our decision in <em>Lopez-Mendoza </em>v. <em>INS, </em>705 F.2d 1059 (9th Cir.1983) where we permitted expansion of the exclusionary rule to INS deportation proceedings. The Supreme Court reversed this court\u2019s decision one week after Garrett\u2019s brief was filed. <em>INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 104 S.Ct. 3479, 82 L.Ed.2d 778 (1984). The Marine Corps' brief relied on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. Counsel for Garrett failed to file a reply brief commenting on the Court\u2019s decision reversing Garrett\u2019s primary authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1117-13\">. Garrett relies on <em>United States ex rel Roberson v. Keating, </em>121 F.Supp. 477 (N.D.Ill.1949) in support of his assertion that the exclusionary rule should be applied to military discharge proceedings because a property right is at stake. This reliance is puzzling in view of the fact that the district court in <em>Keating </em>commented that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqba\">The Fourth Amendment grants a civilian the right to be secure in his person, house, papers, and effects which are [sic] denied members of the armed forces.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1117-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 478.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-15\">Thus, the district court in <em>Keating </em>would undoubtedly have denied any request to extend the exclusionary rule to Garrett, because he was still a member of the armed services at the time of the Board proceedings. The issue before the court in <em>Keating </em>was whether the plaintiff was a member of the armed services at the time of his court-martial. He had earlier been given an honorable discharge. In holding that the Navy had no jurisdiction to conduct the court-martial proceedings under the facts before him, the court noted that \"an honorable discharge is an extremely valuable property right.\" <em>Id. </em>at 479. In the matter before us, there is no dispute that Garrett was a member of the Marine Corps at the time of the administrative discharge proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"A4l-\">.
