We hold that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The complaint in this action in the District Court for the Southern District of New York alleged substantially as follows: Plaintiff, Eileen R. Yoder, is a nationally known specialist in the field of food allergies. In 1981, she established the Healthful Living Company (\u201cHealthful Living\u201d), a sole proprietorship which was registered to do business in Indiana, through which to conduct her professional activities. By 1983, as a result of her work as a consultant, author and lecturer, plaintiff had developed a mailing list with the names of over 2,000 doctors, other health professionals dealing with food allergies and individuals suffering from such allergies. By this time, plaintiff had also acquired certain proprietary information consisting of special recipes, sources of allergy-free ingredients that the plaintiff had tested extensively, special diet plans, programs for the physical and psychological management of multiple food allergies, and information and material required to develop an individual computerized allergy-free diet program. In the summer of 1983, plaintiff began to seek additional funds to expand Healthful Living, and particularly to enable her to implement and promote the computerized individual allergy-free diet program; she also sought to move from Indiana. She met defendant Henderson, president and chief executive officer of defendant Ortho-molecular Nutrition Institute, Inc. (\u201cOrtho-Nutrix\u201d), a publicly held Delaware corporation having its principal place of business in New York City. Henderson expressed an interest in having Ortho-Nutrix purchase Healthful Living and employ plaintiff to assist in the development of the computerized diet program. After negotiations in New York with Henderson and defendant Rothstein, treasurer and a major shareholder of Ortho-Nutrix, an oral agreement was reached whereby Ortho-Nutrix would purchase from plaintiff the assets of Healthful Living, including its name and good will; the copyright and exclusive right to distribute and promote the book \u201cAllergy Free Cooking\u201d and other Healthful Living publications, including a subscription newsletter; allergy-free recipes developed by plaintiff; all materials and proprietary information necessary to develop and promote the computer diet program; and the exclusive right to publish, copyright and market all of plaintiff's writings during the period of her employment by Ortho-Nutrix. As consideration for the sale of Healthful Living, Ortho-Nutrix was to pay Healthful Living\u2019s debts, at that time approximately $82,560; to employ plaintiff for three years at a salary of $40,000 per annum plus insurance benefits; to pay 10% royalties on the sale of publications written by plaintiff after payment of the debts; and to issue to the plaintiff up to 30,000 shares of Ortho-Nu-trix stock based on profits generated by the development of the computer diet program. Defendants were alleged also to have agreed to provide the necessary funds and support staff required to develop and promote the program. This oral agreement was to be reduced to writing by the defendants before plaintiff\u2019s return to New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">The complaint alleged further that, at the conclusion of the negotiations in New York, Henderson requested a copy of plaintiff\u2019s mailing list for use by Ortho-Nutrix, and that she declined to furnish this prior to receipt of a written acknowledgement of the oral agreement. As a result, plaintiff received a two-page memorandum, signed by Henderson for Ortho-Nutrix, which was stated to constitute \u201ca tentative agreement the spirit of which will remain but will be formally structured by our attorneys.\u201d This memorandum conformed generally to the allegations recited above except that the issuance of Ortho-Nutrix shares was tied to the company\u2019s gross sales rather than to profits generated by development <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>of the computer diet program. The clause relating to plaintiff\u2019s receipt of Ortho-Nutrix stock is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">The complaint next alleged that in reliance on defendants\u2019 representations, plaintiff furnished Ortho-Nutrix with the mailing list and other proprietary information and assets of Healthful Living and, with her two children, came to New York to commence working for Ortho-Nutrix. In late August, 1983, Ortho-Nutrix had the \u201cHealthful Living Company, Inc.\u201d incorporated as a wholly-owned subsidiary. However, plaintiff soon discovered that \u201cdefendants were without funds to meet their obligations pursuant to the agreement for the purchase of Healthful Living.\u201d In particular, insufficient funds were provided with which to fill orders for Healthful Living publications received from plaintiff\u2019s former customers or to enable plaintiff to develop the computer-diet program. On October 14, 1983, defendants terminated plaintiff\u2019s services.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The complaint alleged as a first cause of action for violation of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act that defendants made fraudulent representations as to the assets, liabilities and earnings of Ortho-Nutrix. The complaint also alleged pendent state law causes of action for fraud, breach of contract and conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Along with her complaint, plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction restraining defendants from using Healthful Living\u2019s name, mailing lists, publications, or proprietary information and other assets. Defendants countered with a motion for an order pursuant to F.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, or, in the alternative, for an order pursuant to F.R.Civ.P. 56 granting defendants summary judgment. A supporting affidavit submitted by Rothstein alleged that the arrangement with plaintiff was simply an employment agreement and not the purchase of a business, and that plaintiff\u2019s employment had been terminated because she had been unproductive. After this, plaintiff\u2019s attorney submitted an affidavit in support of the motion for a preliminary injunction to the effect that examination of Ortho-Nutrix\u2019 quarterly reports to the SEC for the periods ending November 30, 1982, and May 31, August 1 and November 30, 1983, disclosed that when \u201cthe negotiations between Plaintiff and defendants took place, [Ortho-Nutrix] was operating at a significant loss and experiencing major liquidity problems.\u201d The reports give this assertion considerable support. As early as November 30, 1982, when the working capital ratio was 1.8, the company reported that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-10\">given the present level of operating expenses and the lack of significant operating revenues to date, management believes that the Company may face a serious liquidity problem during the next year unless significant revenues can be achieved from the orthomolecular practice assistance program, operating expenses can be reduced and additional sources of financing can be found.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">The later reports reveal an increasingly deteriorating financial situation. The May 31 report showed a current working capital ratio of 1.3 and a quarterly loss of $142,-515; the August 31 report showed a current ratio of 1.2 and a loss for the quarter of $160,145; the November 30, 1983 report showed a working capital ratio of 1:1 and a $145,859 loss for the quarter. In the May 31 report management repeated its observation that \u201cthe Company may face a serious liquidity problem during the next year unless significantly greater revenues can be achieved, operating expenditures can be reduced and additional sources of financing can be found.\u201d Statements to the same effect may be found in the other reports as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>well; indeed, the November 30, 1983 report went so far as to include the observation that \u201c[t]here can be no assurance that the Company will have sufficient working capital to fund its needs during the next year.\u201d Plaintiff also submitted an affidavit in support of her motion and in opposition to defendant\u2019s motion. This contradicted many of the allegations made in Roth-stein\u2019s affidavit. In particular, plaintiff averred that Ortho-Nutrix\u2019 claim that its stock \u201cwas to be issued to me as merely an employment benefit\u201d was untrue. Rather, plaintiff alleged: \u201cThe stock was to have constituted a deferred payment for the acquisition of my assets, and was a major inducement to me to enter into the initial agreement with [Ortho-Nutrix].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Judge Griesa granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, holding that the complaint failed to state a cause of action under the federal securities laws and that the pendent jurisdiction claims should therefore be dismissed. Not unreasonably in light of its inept drafting, Judge Griesa construed the complaint as predicating the applicability of the federal securities laws only on the basis that the agreement constituted an \u201cinvestment contract\u201d under \u00a7 3(a)(10) of the Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(a)(10). He held that the arrangement described above did not constitute an \u201cinvestment contract\u201d as that term has been defined in <em>SEC v. W.J Howey Co., </em>328 U.S. 293, 298-99, 66 S.Ct. 1100, 1102-03, 90 L.Ed. 1244 (1946); <em>SEC v. Aqua-Sonic Prods. Corp., </em>687 F.2d 577, 581-85 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Hecht v. SEC, </em>459 U.S. 1086, 103 S.Ct. 568, 74 L.Ed.2d 931 (1982); and <em>SEC v. Glenn W. Turner Enter., </em>474 F.2d 476, 482 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 821, 94 S.Ct. 117, 38 L.Ed.2d 53 (1973): since Ms. Yoder was expected to be an active participant in the business, the agreement thus \u201cwas not an investment contract, but an employment contract.\u201d <em>Cf Aqua-Sonic Prods. Corp., supra, </em>687 F.2d at 582 (a scheme that is primarily \u201ca means whereby participants could pool their own activities, their money and the promoter\u2019s contribution in a meaningful way\u201d is not an investment contract).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">If the case involved no more than this, we would readily affirm the judge\u2019s ruling. However, we are required to read the complaint with great generosity on a motion to dismiss. <em>See Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 47-48, 78 S.Ct. 99, 102-03, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). Indeed, we have previously stated that \u201cit is our duty ... to determine whether the facts set forth justify taking jurisdiction on grounds other than those most artistically pleaded.\u201d <em>Chahal v. Paine Webber, Inc., </em>725 F.2d 20, 23 (2d Cir.1984) (quoting <em>New York State Waterways Ass\u2019n v. Diamond, </em>469 F.2d 419, 421 (2d Cir.1972)). This complaint alleged a contract for the sale of up to 30,000 shares of Ortho-Nutrix stock, conditioned on achieving given levels of sales,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as part of the consideration accruing to plaintiff for her sale of the assets of Healthful Living and her entering into the employ of Ortho-Nutrix. Stock is indubitably a security within the definitions of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77b(l), and the Securities Exchange Act, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 78c(a)(10); indeed, as the Fifth Circuit observed recently, it is \u201cthe paradigm of a security.\u201d <em>Daily v. Morgan, </em>701 F.2d 496, 500 (5th Cir.1983). There was thus no occasion for the plaintiff to rely on the concept of an \u201cinvestment contract\u201d in order to state a claim under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. As said in <em>SEC v. C.M. Joiner Leasing Corp., </em>320 U.S. 344, 64 S.Ct. 120, 88 L.Ed. 88 (1943), the use of the term \u201cinvestment contract\u201d in the legislation was part of Congress\u2019 effort to reach beyond \u201cthe obvious and commonplace\u201d to include \u201c[n]ovel, uncommon, or irregular devices, whatever they appear to be, ... if it be proved as matter of fact that they were widely offered or dealt in under terms or courses of dealing which established their character in commerce as \u2018investment contracts\u2019____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 351, 64 S.Ct. at 124. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>The fact that the contract between plaintiff and Ortho-Nutrix was not an \u201cinvestment contract\u201d is inconsequential if the transaction constituted a sale of stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">The agreement alleged between the plaintiff and the defendants constituted a sale of stock under the securities statutes even though the Ortho-Nutrix stock was not in fact sold. Section 2(3) of the Securities Act provides that \u201c[t]he term \u2018sale\u2019 or \u2018sell\u2019 shall include every contract of sale or disposition of a security or interest in a security, for value;\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u00a7 3(a)(14) of the Securities Exchange Act similarly provides that \u201c[t]he terms \u2018sales\u2019 and \u2018sell\u2019 each include any contract to sell or otherwise dispose of.\u201d Thus, a contract for the issuance or transfer of a security may qualify as a sale under the securities laws even if the contract is never fully performed. <em>See International Controls Corp. v. Vesco, </em>593 F.2d 166, 181 n. 18 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 941, 99 S.Ct. 2884, 61 L.Ed.2d 311 (1979). It is likewise immaterial that Or-tho-Nutrix\u2019 obligation to deliver the stock was conditional on the attainment of given levels of sales. <em>Cf. Mount Clemens Indus., Inc. v. Bell, </em>464 F.2d 339, 345-46 &amp; n. 11 (9th Cir.1972).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since the contract between Ms. Yoder and Ortho-Nutrix thus falls within the letter of these statutes, the transaction is covered by them unless the introductory phrase of the definitional sections, \u201cunless the context otherwise requires,\u201d demands that stock contracted to be sold to a person as an inducement to accept employment should be treated differently from stock contracted to be sold for cash or other consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Our decisions have indeed recognized the importance of this introductory phrase in certain situations. <em>See, e.g., Exchange Nat\u2019l Bank of Chicago v. Touche Ross &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number><em>Co., </em>544 F.2d 1126, 1131-39 (2 Cir.1976); <em>Chemical Bank v. Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., supra </em>note 4, 726 F.2d at 937-39. We have also acknowledged that the Securities Exchange Act \u201cis for the protection of investors, and its provisions must be read accordingly.\u201d <em>Zeller v. Bogue Electric Mfg. Corp., </em>476 F.2d 795, 800 (2 Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 908, 94 S.Ct. 217, 38 L.Ed.2d 146 (1973) (dictum) (quoted in <em>Exchange Nat\u2019l Bank of Chicago, supra, </em>544 F.2d at 1134); <em>see also Wilko v. Swan, </em>201 F.2d 439, 445 (2d Cir.) (\u201cThe purpose of the Securities Act of 1933 is to protect investors\u201d), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>346 U.S. 427, 74 S.Ct. 182, 98 L.Ed. 168 (1953); <em>Movielab, Inc. v. Berkey Photo, Inc., </em>452 F.2d 662 (2d Cir.1971); <em>Lank v. New York Stock Exchange, </em>548 F.2d 61, 65 (2d Cir.1977) (\u201cThe beneficiary of the 1934 legislation was intended to be the public investor\u201d). However, we have not rigorously applied-that concept as one that limits the reach of the Act, <em>see, e.g., A.T. Brod &amp; Co. v. Perlow, </em>375 F.2d 393, 396-97 (2d Cir.1967), nor, what is more important, has the Supreme Court, <em>see, e.g., Superintendent of Insurance v. Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co., </em>404 U.S. 6, 10-12, 92 S.Ct. 165, 167-169, 30 L.Ed.2d 128 (1971); <em>Rubin v. United States, supra </em>note 4, 449 U.S. at 429-31, 101 S.Ct. at 701-02. We see no reason why \u201cthe context requires\u201d us to hold that an individual who commits herself to employment by a corporation in return for stock or the promise of stock should not be considered an investor. Although this situation doubtless was not in the forefront of the mind of the 73d Congress, we perceive no reason why that Congress should have wished the courts to exclude from the benefit of facially applicable language a person who parts with his or her established way of life in return for a contract to issue stock. As the Supreme Court has noted in a similar context, \u201c[t]he economic considerations and realities present ... are similar in important respect[s] to the risk an investor undertakes when purchasing shares. Both are relying on the value of the securities themselves, and both must be able to depend on the representations made by the transferor of the securities____\u201d <em>Rubin, supra </em>note 4, 449 U.S. at 431, 101 S.Ct. at 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">In <em>Collins v. Rukin, </em>342 F.Supp. 1282 (D.Mass.1972), the court dealt with a situation quite similar to this one, except for the immaterial distinction that the contract involved stock options as well as stock, <em>see supra </em>note 2. Like Ms. Yoder, the plaintiff there alleged that he was induced to accept employment with the defendant at least partly on the basis of the latter\u2019s promises of stock and stock options. In a thorough opinion the court held that a complaint alleging fraudulent misrepresentation as to the value of the stock stated a claim under Rule 10b-5, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-7\">No compelling reason has been suggested to this Court why one who, in the interest of promoting his company and employing the most talented people in a particular field, engages in fraudulent practices in connection with the offer or sale of securities should enjoy any greater freedom from the operation of the federal securities laws than one who perpetrates a fraud without promotional or employment motive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1287-88 (footnote omitted). The court also held that the plaintiff\u2019s acceptance of employment and subsequent performance of services satisfied the requirement of value imposed expressly by the Securities Act and assumed also to be imposed by the Securities Exchange Act. 342 F.Supp. 1290. Although <em>Niederhoffer, Cross &amp; Zeckhauser, Inc. v. Telstat Sys., Inc., </em>436 F.Supp. 180 (S.D.N.Y.1977), dismissed a complaint that alleged a violation of \u00a7 10(b) from defendants\u2019 failure to pay plaintiff in securities for work performed for defendants under F.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), its reasoning gives the <em>Collins </em>decision added weight. In <em>Niederhoffer, </em>a \u201cfinder\u201d in the field of corporate acquisitions alleged breach of an agreement that it would receive a portion of the securities of any corporation that acquired the defendant. The fraud alleged had nothing to do with any particular security but related only to defendants\u2019 intention not to comply with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>the agreement. Judge Conner expressly agreed with <em>Collins v. Rukin, supra, </em>saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-4\"><em>Collins v. Rukin, supra, </em>upon which plaintiff relies, involved a very different set of circumstances. The plaintiff there was offered a stock option by the defendant corporation as an inducement to accept employment. In becoming a party to the option contract \u2014 through his acceptance of the offer of employment\u2014 the plaintiff was banking upon the continued financial health of the corporation. His interest as an investor could hardly have been clearer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">436 F.Supp. at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">In fact, this case does not require us to hold that an action under Rule 10b-5 can be maintained whenever sufficient allegations of fraudulent misrepresentations are made relating to stock where the plaintiff merely promises to work for a defendant in return for the latter\u2019s promise to issue stock, whether with or without the payment of a salary \u2014 although, as developed above, we see little reason for not holding to that effect. Here the complaint alleged that Ms. Yoder also transferred assets to Ortho-Nutrix, to wit, the name \u201cHealthful Living,\u201d its mailing list, copyrights on various publications, allergy-free recipes, special diet plans, sources of allergy-free ingredients, programs for the management of multiple food allergies and materials and proprietary information necessary to develop a computerized allergy-free diet program. In order to affirm the dismissal of her complaint, we should thus have to hold not merely that the \u201ccontext requires\u201d that the antifraud provisions not apply to stock contracted to be issued as compensation for services performed in connection with an employment relationship, but also that it requires holding them inapplicable to situations where an employment relationship forms a part of the consideration for a contract to sell stock although assets are also transferred. This we are quite unprepared to do.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">Appellees argue in the alternative that the complaint was properly dismissed on a ground which the district court did not reach, namely, that the complaint did not plead fraud with sufficient particularity, as required by F.R.Civ.P. 9(b). We have held that the specificity requirement of Rule 9(b) is satisfied by allegations that identify who made the misstatements, the occasions on which these were made and the content of the misstatements. <em>Zerman v. Ball, </em>735 F.2d 15, 22 (2d Cir.1984). While the allegations in the cause of action relating to the violation of the federal securities laws might be insufficient in the last respect if taken alone, the state law cause of action for fraud alleged that defendants\u2019 representations as to the ability of Ortho-Nutrix to provide the financial resources necessary to develop a computer-diet program and service Healthful Living customers were false when made and known to be so in that defendants knew or should have known that Ortho-Nutrix was in serious financial difficulties and was unlikely to have sufficient funds in the foreseeable future to meet its obligations to plaintiff. These allegations were sufficient to state a claim that Ortho-Nutrix stock was not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>sound security it was represented to be. It is elementary that, on a motion to dismiss, a complaint must be read as a whole, drawing all inferences favorable to the pleader. <em>Conley v. Gibson, supra, </em>355 U.S. at 47-48, 78 S.Ct. at 102-103. When such a generous reading is given to this complaint, it was adequate to survive a Rule 9(b) motion to dismiss on the ground of insufficient particularity. <em>See Credit &amp; Finance Corp. Ltd. v. Warner &amp; Swasey Co., </em>638 F.2d 563, 566 (2d Cir.1981). Moreover, the Ortho-Nutrix quarterly reports to the SEC attached as exhibits to the affidavit of plaintiffs attorney in support of plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction indicate that the complaint could readily have been amended to afford greater particularity, and we have little doubt that the district court should and would have permitted an amendment if it had reached the issue here discussed. <em>See Goldberg v. Meridor, </em>567 F.2d 209, 213 (2d Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1069, 98 S.Ct. 1249, 55 L.Ed.2d 771 (1978); <em>Ross v. A.H. Robins Co., </em>607 F.2d 545, 547, 557-59 (2d Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 946, 100 S.Ct. 2175, 64 L.Ed.2d 802 (1980).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On remand, the court should afford plaintiff an opportunity to do this.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">The order dismissing the complaint is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-7\">. <em>Incentive:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-8\">\"Computer Allergy Program\u201d \u2014 Stock options will be based on gross annual production; at $2 million gross sales per year 10,000 shares will be released; at $3 million gross sales per year 10,000 additional shares will be released; at $4 million gross sales per year 10,000 additional shares will be released.

Although the \"tentative agreement\u201d speaks of \"stock options\" as well as of \u201cstock,\u201d <em>supra </em>note 1, it seems plain from the fact that no price is mentioned that, as the complaint alleged, the stock was to be issued without any payment by plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b673-5\">. Our references in this opinion to the Securities Act are not intended as taking any position on the question whether there is an implied cause of action for damages for violation of \u00a7 17(a) of the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a). There is a split among the circuits that have addressed this question; <em>compare, e.g., Shull v. Dain, Kalman &amp; Quail, Inc., </em>561 F.2d 152, 159 (8th Cir.1977) (no private cause of action), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1086, 98 S.Ct. 1281, 55 L.Ed.2d 792 (1978) <em>and Landry v.

In <em>Kirshner v.

This conclusion may be open to reexamination, however, in the light of the subsequent Supreme Court decisions noted above and Professor Loss' comparison of the differences among the provisions for civil liability contained in the 1933 and 1934 Acts, and his analysis of the legislative history of \u00a7 17. <em>See </em>Loss, <em>supra, </em>at 1148-50; <em>see also </em>3 Bromberg &amp; Low-enfels, Securities Law \u00a7 8.5 (330)-(338) (1982). Here, as in so many instances, \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 afford plaintiff the same relief as would \u00a7 17(a) of the Securities Act. <em>See SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., </em>401 F.2d 833, 867-68 (2 Cir. 1968) (Friendly, J., concurring), <em>cert. denied, </em>394 U.S. 976, 89 S.Ct. 1454, 22 L.Ed.2d 756 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b673-10\">. We perceive no reason why a contingency attached to a contractual right to acquire stock should remove that right from securities law coverage simply because it increases the risk that plaintiff will not obtain the shares. In <em>Marine Bank v. Weaver, </em>455 U.S. 551, 102 S.Ct. 1220, 71 L.Ed.2d 409 (1982), the Supreme Court held that \"a pledge of stock is equivalent to a sale for purposes of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws,\u201d although no stock would change hands unless the pledgor defaulted on the loan. <em>Id. </em>at 554 n. 2, 102 S.Ct. at 1222 n. 2; <em>see also Rubin v. United States, </em>449 U.S. 424, 101 S.Ct. 698, 66 L.Ed.2d 633 (1981); <em>Mallis v. FDIC, </em>568 F.2d 824 (2d Cir.1977), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>435 U.S. 381, 98 S.Ct. 1117, 55 L.Ed.2d 357 (1978); <em>Chemical Bank v. Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., </em>726 F.2d 930, 939-40 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 253, 83 L.Ed.2d 190 (1984). We intimate no opinion as to whether contingencies that make the possibility of obtaining stock extremely speculative may preclude coverage. <em>Cf. International B\u2019hd of Teamsters v. Daniel, supra, </em>439 U.S, at 562, 99 S.Ct. at 797 (possibility of sharing asset earnings of pension plan too speculative to make pension benefit in employment contract an \"investment contract\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b675-7\">. We do not need here to rely on our decision in <em>Golden v. Garafalo, </em>678 F.2d 1139 (2 Cir.1982), which held that acquisition of a business by the purchase of stock is subject to the securities laws, even though the transaction could have been accomplished by a purchase of the assets. Here there was no way in which Ms. Yoder could be given an equity position in Ortho-Nutrix except by her acquisition of its stock. The conflict among the circuits over the sale of business doctrine at issue in <em>Golden, compare, e.g., Coffin v. Polishing Machines, Inc., </em>596 F.2d 1202 (4th Cir.)

Professors Moore and Lucas point out that complaints dismissed for failure to satisfy Rule 9(b) are \"almost always\" dismissed with leave to amend. 2A Moore &amp; Lucas, Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 9.03 at 9-34 (2d ed. 1984). In cases where such leave was not granted, the plaintiff had already been afforded at least one opportunity to plead fraud with greater specificity. <em>See, e.g., Denny v.
