The issue is whether the Special Fund established by the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is entitled to offset, against the amounts due from it with respect to such an injury, recovery that the covered employee has obtained from the third-party tortfeasor responsible for the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1484-24\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1484-25\">On December 9, 1975, petitioner Gorman Carter, an employee of the Wood, Wire &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1399\">*1399</page-number>Metal Lathers\u2019 International Union, Local No. 9, sustained employment related injuries in an accident, for which he filed a compensation claim under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (\u201cLHWCA\u201d), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-950 (1982).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Administrative Law Judge found that he was permanently totally disabled as the combined consequence of the accident and a pre-existing permanent partial disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-4\">Under the LHWCA, an employee who becomes permanently disabled as a combined result of a pre-existing condition and new work-related injuries recovers compensation from two sources: his employer, and a \u201cSpecial Fund\u201d established by Section 44 of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 944. The Special Fund is funded by a combination of assessments upon employers or their insurers, compensation owed by an employer for which there is no surviving statutorily authorized beneficiary, fines, and a loan from the Treasury. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 944(c). The general method for dividing liability between the employer and the Special Fund is that the employer provides compensation for that portion of the employee\u2019s disability due to the new injury, and the Special Fund for the rest. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(f). But where, as here, the employee had previously been permanently partially disabled and the new injury renders him permanently totally disabled, the statutory formula is that the employer makes payments for 104 weeks, after which the Special Fund takes over the responsibility. <em>Id. </em>Applying this formula to petitioner\u2019s claim, the ALJ directed that Local No. 9 pay Carter compensation for 104 weeks beginning December 9, 1975, and that the Special Fund assume liability for the remainder of the compensation payments due after December 6, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-7\">The LHWCA permits the compensated employee to seek damages from any person (other than his coworkers and the employer) who was wholly or partially responsible for the work related injury, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933(a). Petitioner did so with regard to the December 9, 1975 accident, and settled his suit in May 1979 for $35,000. The manner in which the benefits of that settlement should be apportioned is the subject of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-8\">The LHWCA provides that if an employee recovers damages from a third party, the employer\u2019s (or his insurer\u2019s) obligation .to pay compensation is diminished by that amount. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933(f), (h). The employee will therefore retain only the excess, if any, of what he recovers over what his employer would be obligated to pay him. The statute contains no similar provision with regard to the Special Fund\u2019s ability to subtract tort recovery from its obligation. The settlement into which petitioner entered accordingly provided for $17,500 to be paid to Local No. 9\u2019s insurance carrier in settlement for its past compensation payments, $1,192.97 for expenses, $8,153.51 for attorney\u2019s fees, and $8,153.52 to be paid to petitioner. On July 13, 1979, the Director of the Special Fund notified petitioner by letter that he was suspending payments to petitioner effective after the most recent payment of June 20, 1979, until he had retained an amount equal to petitioner\u2019s net recovery of $8,153.52. Special Fund payments resumed in November 1979, after that amount had been withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b1485-9\">Petitioner filed a claim with the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1400\">*1400</page-number>(\u201cOWCP\u201d) seeking to recover the withheld payments. The OWCP denied the claim, and the Benefits Review Board affirmed. Petitioner challenges this disposition, on the grounds that there is no statutory provision for the Special Fund to share in employee recoveries from third-party tort-feasors, and that the manner in which his payments were suspended violates the procedural guarantees of the Fifth Amendment's due process clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-5\">The LHWCA provides that the Special Fund shall pay \u201cthe remainder of the compensation that would be due\u201d after the employer has satisfied his obligation to compensate a claimant for 104 weeks. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(f)(2). Respondent argues that this language permits the Special Fund to offset, because \u201cthe remainder of the compensation that would be due\u201d means the amount the <em>employer </em>would owe, if he were paying compensation for the full period, rather than only 104 weeks. As the employer is permitted to offset third-party recoveries, the compensation \u201cdue\u201d would be reduced by any amount recovered from third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-6\">There is, however, an alternative interpretation. Petitioner suggests that \u201cthe remainder of the compensation that would be due\u201d is simply the total compensation to which the employee is entitled under the statute, minus that paid by the employer. The employer\u2019s right to offset would then be exercised only over that portion of the compensation he actually owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-7\">The latter interpretation seems to us less strained, but the former is not textually precluded. We therefore turn to the other indications of statutory intent which the parties suggest are relevant. Petitioner points to those sections of the statute that provide very explicitly for offsetting by the employer and subrogation of his insurer to this right.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He argues, plausibly enough, that it would be passing strange to achieve an equivalent result elsewhere in the statute through the murky phrase \u201cthe remainder of the compensation that would have been due.\u201d Respondent, on the other hand, points to legislative history indicating that Congress has consistently tried to prevent the Act from having the effect of enabling double recovery by employees. Since that history is so central to the case, we set it forth in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1486-12\">When the LHWCA was originally enacted in 1927, it required employees to elect between accepting compensation under the statute or seeking damages from a responsible third party. If the employee accepted compensation, his right to damages was assigned to the employer. Longshoremen's &amp; Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, ch. 509, \u00a7 33(a), (b), 44 Stat. 1424 (1927) (current version at 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933(a), (b) (1982)). The statute thus expressly precluded double recovery by the employee. It did not, however, contain an express provision assigning the employee\u2019s cause of action to the employer\u2019s insurer, as opposed to the employer himself, if the insurer has paid the benefits to the employee \u2014 thus creating the possibility of double (or, more accurately, windfall) recovery by the employer. Nonetheless, in order to prevent \u201cthe consequence [of] ... double recovery ... which the statute is careful to avoid,\u201d the Supreme Court held that the insurer could sue the tortfeasor to obtain reimbursement for any payments it had made. <em>Aetna Life Insurance Co. v. Moses, </em>287 U.S. 530, 542, 53 S.Ct. 231, 233, 77 L.Ed. 477 (1933). \u201cSubrogation,\u201d it said, \u201cis a normal incident of indemnity insur-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1401\">*1401</page-number>anee,\u201d and \u201cnothing in [the statute] indicates that the insurer is to be denied an indemnator\u2019s rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Congress codified this result five years later by adding a provision to the LHWCA subrogating an insurer who had assumed the payment of compensation to the rights of the employer. Act to Amend the Longshoremen\u2019s &amp; Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, ch. 685, \u00a7 13, 52 Stat. 1164, 1168 (1938) (codified at 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933(h) (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-4\">In the same year, Congress modified the LHWCA to limit provision for automatic assignment of the employee\u2019s right of action to cases in which the employee accepted compensation pursuant to a formal award rendered by the agency. Act to Amend the Longshoremen\u2019s &amp; Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, ch. 685, \u00a7 12, 52 Stat. 1164, 1168 (1938) (current version at 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933(b), (c) (1982)). (Formal award is the exception rather than the rule, applicable only to situations in which liability is contested, <em>see </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914(a) (1982)). This protected the employee against improvident acceptance of inadequate compensation, but it created a new double recovery problem, because the statute contained no provision entitling the employer to reimbursement for compensation he had paid when the employee had accepted it without a formal award and then recovered from a third party. Nonetheless, the courts uniformly construed the statutory scheme, in light of equitable principles of subrogation and the purpose of avoiding double recovery they saw in the Act, to require that the employer be reimbursed for his compensation payments out of the employee\u2019s recovery in a third-party action. <em>E.g., The Etna, </em>138 F.2d 37, 39-41 (3d Cir.1943); <em>Fontana v. Pennsylvania R. R., </em>106 F.Supp. 461, 462-63 (S.D.N.Y. 1952), <em>aff'd on opinion below sub nom. Fontana v. Grace Line, Inc., </em>205 F.2d 151 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>346 U.S. 886, 74 S. Ct. 137, 98 L.Ed. 390 (1953). <em>See Bloomer v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., </em>445 U.S. 74, 79, 100 S.Ct. 925, 928, 63 L.Ed.2d 215 (1980).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1487-8\">Insofar as respondent\u2019s desired interpretation of \u00a7 944 is concerned, the problem with appeal to this history of the statute is that it proves too much. At most, the rather unnatural interpretation of \u00a7 944 that respondent urges upon us would give the Special Fund a right to set-off. It would not give the Fund the right to sue the tortfeasor in its own behalf where the employee and the employer choose not to, or the right to impose a lien upon recovery for compensation payments already made. Yet it is precisely these two means of avoiding \u201cdouble recovery\u201d that the two lines of cases appealed to by respondent involved. Thus, if Congress intended to embody the \u201cno double recovery\u201d principle in \u00a7 944, it did so in a fashion that was not only murky but also highly incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-9\">For these reasons we reject respondent\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 944. The same reasons, however, would seem to suggest that the Fund has an <em>implicit </em>right to set-off under the Act. Petitioner argues that such an implicit right is inconsistent with the <em>explicit </em>provisions for employer set-off and for insurer subrogation in \u00a7 933. \u201cInclusio unius,\u201d he says, \u201cest ex-clusio alterius.\u201d That maxim has force, however, only when there is no apparent reason for the inclusion of one disposition and the omission of a parallel disposition except the desire to achieve disparate results. Here, however, another reason is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1402\">*1402</page-number>evident: The section subrogating insurers to employers\u2019 rights \u2014 including employers\u2019 set-off rights \u2014 is merely a codification of earlier court decisions applying traditional equitable principles they thought implicit in the statutory scheme. It would be perverse to say that that codification is a repudiation rather than an affirmation of the proposition that those equitable principles <em>are </em>implicit, prohibiting rather than sanctioning further judicial elaboration along the same lines. That is assuredly the view taken by those cases, decided after the insurer-subrogation amendment, which subrogate employers to employees\u2019 rights to the extent of compensation payments made without formal award. <em>See, e.g., The Etna </em>and <em>Fontana v. Pennsylvania R.R., supra. </em>We are persuaded that Congress intended to permit the federal courts to continue leavening the LHWCA with well established equitable principles as necessary to avoid the problem of double recovery and to prevent the statute from becoming a scheme for compensating tortfeasors instead of their victims. It is necessary to posit such an intent not only with regard to the Special Fund but even with regard to more basic features of the Act. For example, while the Act explicitly provides for return to the employee of excess recovery in suits by the employer as assignee of the tort claim, \u00a7 933(e), and for <em>set-off </em>against the employer\u2019s liability of recovery by the employee when the employee chooses to sue. the tortfeasor, \u00a7 933(f), it does not explicitly provide for the employer\u2019s <em>reimbursement </em>out of the employee\u2019s tort recovery for compensation already paid before that recovery is obtained. A lien for such reimbursement is imposed on the recovery, however \u2014 as normal equitable principles of unjust enrichment dictate. <em>See, e.g., Ruggiero v. Rederiet for M/S Marion, </em>308 F.Supp. 798, 800 (S.D.N.Y.1970). And of course denying equitable subrogation with respect to compensation paid without formal award, <em>see The Etna, supra, </em>would frustrate the clear statutory intent that compensation be paid \u201cpromptly, ... without an award, except where liability ... is controverted.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-4\">The only court which has previously considered the precise issue of double recovery that is before us here agrees with this view. In <em>Ruggiero v. Rederiet for M/S Marion, supra, </em>a jury had awarded the claimant damages against a third-party tortfeasor, and the United States sought to impress a lien on the judgment to the extent of compensation payments already made to him from the Special Fund. Despite the absence of explicit provision for such a lien, the court permitted the Special Fund to recover on the basis of the equitable doctrine of subrogation. 308 F.Supp. at 800-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-5\">State courts interpreting similar state statutes have concluded that recoveries from third-party tortfeasors decrease the liability of state special funds. The most notable instance, because it dealt with the New York statute upon which the LHWCA was based, is <em>Dougherty v. J.F. Quaken-bush Waverly Stage Co., </em>10 A.D.2d 125, 128, 197 N.Y.S.2d 658, 660-61 (1960). <em>See also Bello v. Commissioner of Department of Labor &amp; Industry, </em>56 N.J. 41, 45, 264 A.2d 222, 224 (1970); <em>Cole v. Morris, </em>409 S.W.2d 668, 669-71 (Mo.1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-6\">Petitioner relies on <em>Crescent Wharf &amp; Warehouse Co. v. Barracuda Tanker Corp., </em>696 F.2d 703 (9th Cir.1983), which rejected the proposition that traditional equitable principles are implicit in the LHWCA. We must disagree with this particular basis for the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision. Its opinion on the point relies heavily upon the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers Union, </em>451 U.S. 77, 101 S.Ct. 1571, 67 L.Ed.2d 750 (1981), which held that a cause of action could not be implied under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17 (1982), or the Equal Pay Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d) (1982), on behalf of a company held liable in damages for having violated the Act, against a union which allegedly coerced the violation. That seems to us not at all comparable. Disallowing a cause of action over against the alleged coercer of a Title VII or Equal Pay Act violation in no way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1403\">*1403</page-number>impairs the Act\u2019s principal purpose of discouraging discrimination by the employer; in fact, it is arguably <em>necessary </em>for that purpose, since an employer confident of recovering for coercion will be more likely to yield to it. By contrast, disallowing subrogation under the LHWCA where equitable principles would normally provide it changes the whole function of the statute in those cases from compensation of injured employees to exoneration of tort-feasors. Moreover, the brief portion of <em>Crescent Wharf </em>devoted to this point does not even mention, and we must assume the court was unaware of, the long history of subrogation found implicit in the LHWCA that we consider so persuasive here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1489-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1489-5\">What we have said thus far establishes to our satisfaction that equitable principles of subrogation continue to apply with regard to payments made by the Special Fund. There remains one further issue, however: whether those principles would permit set-off of the particular Fund payments at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1489-6\">It is not the policy of the Act that the injured employee should receive no more than the compensation the Act prescribes when the injury is caused by the negligence of someone other than the employer or his coworkers. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933(i). If he sues for such negligence himself, he. is entitled to retain the excess of his recovery over the compensation payments, <em>cf </em>\u00a7 933(f), and if the employer sues as as-signee of the negligence claim, the recovery in excess of the compensation payments (less one-fifth of the total recovery) must be returned to the employee, \u00a7 933(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1489-7\">To the extent, then, that any payments are compelled out of the employee\u2019s tort recovery which go beyond reimbursing the employer or the Fund for payments attributable to the injury to which that recovery related, rather than equity being done the clear principles of the Act are being violated. The problem that presents in this case can be simply stated: The recovery in which the Fund seeks to participate reimbursed Carter for the harm he suffered in the December 9, 1975 accident \u2014 harm which changed his condition from permanent partial disability to permanent total disability. If this was the same harm for which the Fund was to make compensation, there is no doubt that established equitable principles would permit set-off. But in fact, the Fund and the last employer, in combination, are compensating Carter for <em>more </em>than <em>that </em>\u2014 i.e., for the entire amount of his disability, including not only the increment between partial and total disability, but the partial disability as well. In these circumstances, how can it be said what portion of the total compensation is attributable to the incremental disability and therefore can be offset against the recovery for that increment?</p>\n<p id=\"b1489-10\">The thought that comes immediately to mind is that only the <em>employer\u2019s </em>payments \u2014 for the first 104 weeks \u2014 are attributable to the incremental injury since, after all, that injury is the only justification for assessing the employer. (This appears to have been the theoretical approach taken by the New York courts, <em>see Mastrodonato v. Pfaudler Co., </em>307 N.Y. 592, 596, 123 N.E.2d 83, 86 (1954).) But while this reasoning might establish that <em>all </em>of the employer\u2019s payments are attributable to the incremental injury, it does not establish that <em>none </em>of the Fund\u2019s are. There is no suggestion in the legislative history that employer compensation for 104 weeks was settled upon because it was thought to represent an estimate of the \u201caverage\u201d proportion of the total disability attributable to the incremental injury. To the contrary, it is likely that the figure was thought to let the employer off with less than he should. properly bear, since the whole purpose of this provision was to encourage employment of the handicapped. <em>C &amp; P Telephone Co. v. Director, OWCP, </em>564 F.2d 503, 511 (D.C.Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1489-11\">The court in <em>Ruggiero, supra, </em>sought to solve the difficulty in another fashion. That case, unlike this one, involved an employee\u2019s tort suit relating to the <em>earlier </em>injury that had caused permanent partial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1404\">*1404</page-number>disability, and that had been followed eight months later by another injury rendering the disability total. The court had before it (as we do not) a specific finding in the Compensation Order that the accident on which the negligence suit was brought contributed 50 percent to the employee\u2019s permanent total disability. Half of the Fund\u2019s payments, it reasoned, must be attributable to that accident, and therefore half of them should be reimbursed out of the tort recovery. Even if we had the relevant percentage before us, however, this approach would not achieve a precise subrogation in the present case. At the time of <em>Ruggiero </em>the statutory scheme was that the first employer would pay for the permanent partial disability attributable to the first injury, the second employer for the permanent partial disability attributable to the second injury, and the Fund for the difference between the sum of these two and the amount due for permanent <em>total </em>disability. 308 F.Supp. at 799. It could genuinely be said, therefore, that the Fund\u2019s payments were attributable to the two accidents in precisely the proportion of their respective contributions to the permanent total disability. That cannot be said under the current scheme, which makes the second employer liable, not for the permanent partial disability caused by the second accident, but for 104 weeks <em>of the permanent total disability payments, </em>and the Fund for the remainder. Under this arrangement, the residual liability of the Fund cannot be said to be attributable to the two accidents in proportion to their contribution to the total disability, unless the second employer\u2019s 104-weeks payments are similarly allocable. But we know of no case denying the second employer 100 percent reimbursement out of recovery <em>for the second accident. </em>This seems to be prescribed by the provision for full assignment of the claim, \u00a7 933(b). Moreover, any other rule would mean that an employer could not obtain full reimbursement of his total disability payments for a handicapped worker when he would be able to do so for a nonhandicapped worker \u2014 which seems directly contrary to the whole purpose of the Special Fund assumption of liability for injuries increasing preexisting disability, <em>i.e., </em>the purpose of rendering hiring of the handicapped more attractive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1490-5\">In sum, while equitable principles may entitle the Special Fund to reimbursement out of tort recovery with respect to some of its other disbursements under the Act \u2014 for example, its payment of the sums due from an insolvent employer, \u00a7 <em>918(b) </em>\u2014 we see no application for them here. Some portion of the Special Fund\u2019s payments must be attributable to the injury for which this tort recovery has been awarded, but it is quite impossible to say what that portion might be, and therefore quite impossible to say that Congress expected us to require reimbursement of that portion on the basis of accepted equitable principles. As it turns out, in fact, the judicial notion of an equitable result is not what Congress intended\u2014 or at least not what the current Congress intends. A recent amendment to the LHWCA, effective September 28, 1984, but not applicable to already adjudicated claims such as the one here at issue, provides that \u201c[a]ny payments by the special fund ... shall be a lien upon the proceeds of any settlement obtained from or judgment rendered against a third person [liable in damages].\u201d Longshore &amp; Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act Amendments of 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-426, \u00a7 21, 98 Stat. 1652-53 (1984). This evidently requires the employee to reimburse, out of his recovery for the second accident alone, even those payments of the Fund attributable to the first accident. # # # $ *</p>\n<p id=\"b1490-7\">Since the express provisions of the statute cannot reasonably be read to permit set-off by the Special Fund; and since there is no basis for application of the equitable principles of subrogation implicit in the statute; the suspension of payments by the Director was invalid. Because petitioner is entitled to relief on the merits, we need not consider his allegations of procedural deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1490-8\">\n<em>Petition granted.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1485-5\">.
