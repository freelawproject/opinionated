Madison Square Garden Center, </em>482 F.Supp. 414; 482 F.Supp. 918 (S.D.N.Y.1979); 535 F.Supp. 1082 (S.D.N.Y. 1982), <em>modified, </em>709 F.2d 807 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 346, 78 L.Ed.2d 313 (1983). Judge Sand, finding no factual question to be tried, granted plaintiffs\u2019 summary judgment motion and declared them not liable to Local 3 for any monies associated with the antecedent litigation. 582 F.Supp. 627 (S.D.N.Y.1984). For reasons substantially in agreement with those of the district court, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">The consolidated employment discrimination suits, from which the present declaratory judgment action stems, named, as defendants, the Garden entities, Local 3, and others. The suits alleged that the defendants had violated the civil rights laws by engaging in a pattern of hiring and employment practices which made it impossible for class members to secure higher paying and generally more desirable positions as laborers at Madison Square Garden. Prior to the trial of these antecedent suits, which commenced in 1976 and 1978, the plaintiff classes entered into a consent decree with all defendants other than Local 3. By the terms of the decree, which was approved by the district court in October 1979, <em>see </em>482 F.Supp. 426 (S.D.N.Y.1979), the settling defendants agreed to undertake remedial measures, including the immediate hiring of class members and the setting of employment goals for minorities, and to pay a monetary award and attorney\u2019s fees. The plaintiff classes withdrew their claims against the settling defendants, with prejudice, and agreed to indemnify them from claims by Local 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">Litigation against Local 3 proceeded to trial and resulted in a finding that the union had violated both Title VII and \u00a7 1981. 482 F.Supp. at 424. Judge Sand found that Local 3, which referred applicants to the Garden to fill positions in its permanent laborer work force, had engaged in a pattern of \u201csubjective and standardless\u201d referrals and that the union had frustrated the attempts of minorities to gain information about becoming laborers at the Garden. <em>Id. </em>at 420-21. The court entered judgment against Local 3 for injunctive and monetary relief, specifically accounting for payments received by the plaintiff classes from the settling defendants and reducing Local 3\u2019s liability accordingly. 535 F.Supp. at 1095. On appeal, the award against Local 3 was upheld, as modified by a panel of this court. 709 F.2d 807 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 346, 78 L.Ed.2d 313 (1983). Local 3 has paid a total of $684,514, including interest, into an escrow account that will be used to satisfy the judgment, subject to determination of the issues here.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-13\">The plaintiffs herein, settling parties in the prior litigation, brought this action seeking a judgment \u201cdeclaring that Local 3 has no claim and is not entitled to any award for contribution, indemnification or otherwise with respect to the amounts paid (or to be paid) to the plaintiff classes in the antecedent litigation.\u201d Local 3 denied the material allegations of the complaint and asserted claims seeking to recoup all or part of the monies awarded. Upon plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment, Judge Sand determined that, even accepting Local 3\u2019s factual allegations as true, the union, estopped from denying its own intentionally wrongful conduct by virtue of the prior litigation, could not, as a matter of law, state a claim to contribution, indemnification, or other relief from plaintiffs. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>district court found that contribution is not available to a defendant found to be in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, by virtue of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Northwest Airlines Inc. v. Transport Workers, </em>451 U.S. 77, 101 S.Ct. 1571, 67 L.Ed.2d 750 (1981). The rationale of this case, the district court asserted, extends to claims for indemnification, as well as to claims for contribution or indemnification under \u00a7 1981, at least in the circumstances presented here. The court concluded that, even accepting the union\u2019s contentions that Local 3 acted as an employment agency for the Garden and that the Garden directed Local 3\u2019s discriminatory actions, Local 3 has no entitlement to recovery from its former co-defendants, or their indemnitors, of any monies paid (or to be paid) to the individual plaintiffs in the antecedent litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">On appeal, Local 3 contends that the district court erred in holding that the union can assert no right to contribution or indemnification under either Title VII or \u00a7 1981. The union argues that the holding in <em>Northwest Airlines </em>should be read narrowly, to bar the assertion of a claim to contribution under Title VII only in circumstances in which no charge of discrimination was ever filed against the party from whom contribution is sought. Local 3 relies on the following language in the Court\u2019s opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">A court\u2019s broad power ... to fashion relief against all respondents named in a properly filed charge is not, of course, at issue in this litigation since no charge was filed against either of the respondent unions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">451 U.S. at 93 n. 28, 101 S.Ct. at 1581 n. 28. In addition, the union contends that the decision in <em>Northwest Airlines </em>should not be construed to frustrate claims to contribution or indemnification under \u00a7 1981. Local 3 contends that the holding in <em>Northwest Airlines </em>hinged on the concern that a judicially-fashioned right to contribution under Title VII would upset a comprehensive administrative scheme \u2014 a scheme not legislated in the context of \u00a7 1981 actions. Finally, Local 3 contends that the holding in <em>Northwest Airlines </em>does not extend to claims for contribution or indemnification by agents against their principals and that Local 3 acted at the direction of the Garden entities in the perpetration of its discriminatory practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">Local 3\u2019s first argument \u2014 that the holding in <em>Northwest Airlines </em>does not bar actions for contribution among the named respondents in a Title VII litigation \u2014 was rightly rejected by the district court. The Supreme Court\u2019s language at 451 U.S. at 93 n. 28, 101 S.Ct. at 1581 n. 28, addresses only a <em>court\u2019s </em>power to apportion damages among Title VII defendants in a judgment. The issue of whether a party found in violation of Title VII is entitled to bring a later suit against another named respondent is a distinct question, for which other language in the Court\u2019s opinion is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-10\">Whatever may be a federal court\u2019s power to fashion remedies in other areas of the law, we are satisfied that it would be improper for us to add a right to contribution to the statutory rights that Congress created in ... Title VII.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">451 U.S. at 98, 101 S.Ct. at 1581 (footnote omitted). The rationale of this holding extends to claims for indemnification, as the district court held: \u201cAs with contribution, such claims could only arise by implication ' under the statute[] or under common law principles, and the same argument would preclude recognition of indemnity under either theory.\u201d 582 F.Supp. at 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-12\">We likewise agree with the district court\u2019s analysis with regard to the propriety of recognizing a right of contribution or indemnification under \u00a7 1981. The legislative scheme for Title VII enforcement would, indeed, be disrupted if defendants found liable under both Title VII and \u00a7 1981 were permitted to bring actions among themselves. <em>Id. </em>at 631. In particular, the threat of \u00a7 1981-derived actions among persons conceivably liable under Title VII would discourage the voluntary settlement of employment discrimination claims. The courts have asserted, on numerous occasions, the importance of voluntary settlements in this area of the law, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>such settlements work to speed the placement, in the workplace, of historically underrepresented groups. <em>See, e.g., Carson v. Am. Brands, Inc., </em>450 U.S. 79, 88 n. 14, 101 S.Ct. 993, 998 n. 14, 67 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981); <em>Bushey v. New York State Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>733 F.2d 220, 226 (2d Cir. 1984); <em>Kirkland v. New York State Dep\u2019t of Corrections Servs., </em>711 F.2d 1117, 1128 (2d Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 997, 79 L.Ed.2d 230 (1984). Congress, of course, expressed a strong preference for voluntary settlement in the enactment of Title VII. <em>See Carson, </em>450 U.S. at 88 n. 14, 101 S.Ct. at 998 n. 14. We agree with the district court that there is little reason to depart from general principles of common law in order to recognize a right of contribution or indemnification in favor of the intentional tortfeasor in the circumstances presented here. <em>See Gen. Bldg. Contractors Ass\u2019n v. Pennsylvania, </em>458 U.S. 375, 391, 102 S.Ct. 3141, 3150, 73 L.Ed.2d 835 (1982) (finding of discriminatory intent is a prerequisite to liability under \u00a7 1981); <em>see generally </em>W. Prosser, <em>The Law of Torts, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 50, 51 at 308, 312 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The union is not helped by its contention that it acted as the agent of the Garden entities with respect to the discriminatory hiring practices in which it participated. Whatever the merits of this contention, the district court was correct in asserting that the contention establishes, at most, a basis for the Garden entities\u2019 liability in the antecedent litigation. The question whether Local 3 has an entitlement to contribution or indemnification from its former co-defendants is still governed by the decision and rationale of <em>Northwest Airlines. </em>Parenthetically, even if we were to adopt an artificially narrow construction of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in this case, as pressed by defendant, established principles of common law would still militate against the recognition of a cause of action in the present circumstances. As the district court noted, for instance, even if indemnification is sometimes allowed because the indemnitee acted \u201cpursuant to directions of the indemnitor,\u201d this principle is invoked only if the indemnitee reasonably believed his directions to be lawful. <em>See Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 886B(2)(b) (1979). The union, found to be in violation of \u00a7 1981, cannot assert a good faith belief in the lawfulness of its conduct. We agree with Judge Sand that, even assuming Local 3 acted at the direction of the Garden entities, any claim to contribution or indemnification must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">Local 3 also contends that Judge Sand should be directed to recuse himself, as his involvement in the antecedent litigation prevented, according to the union, a disinterested review of the settlement and the consent decree which the district court had previously approved. In addition, the union asserts that the court\u2019s sympathy for the individual plaintiffs affected its ability to appraise the relative responsibility of the Garden entities and Local 3, and thus to rule on the summary judgment motion. In large measure, the union bases this argument on the following statement by Judge Sand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-10\">I suggest to you that there is over half a million dollars, large portions of which have been held by the courts to be the entitlement of people who earn their livelihood by pushing a mop around and that there is an obligation on the part of the Court as well as counsel in any way involved in this matter in advancing rather than delaying the time at which the sums to which those persons are entitled are received by them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">Local 3, however, has made no showing that the district court\u2019s impartiality can reasonably be questioned. Judge Sand\u2019s knowledge of and involvement in the antecedent litigation, without more, would certainly not lead any reasonable person, \u201caware of all the facts,\u201d to question the court\u2019s impartiality. <em>United States v. Ferguson, </em>550 F.Supp. 1256, 1259-60 (S.D.N.Y. 1982). We read the district court\u2019s statement to be a commendable expression of the court\u2019s desire to expedite the proceedings. This desire to proceed with due haste in order that the individual plaintiffs might receive their compensation cannot be construed as evidence of bias. Local 3\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Even accepting Local 3\u2019s factual allegations as true, the union states no claim to contribution or indemnification under Title VII, \u00a7 1981, or otherwise against the plaintiffs herein. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court, which granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and dismissed Local 3\u2019s claims.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
