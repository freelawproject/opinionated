No. 96-448, 94 Stat.1895, amended 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10706(a)(3)(B) with regard to inflationary cost recovery. Petitioners allege that the ICC misinterpreted the \u201cfeasibility\u201d criterion and that the direct connector standard is presently not feasible. They therefore seek a three year delay in its implementation.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-18\">Intervenor Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Company (\u201cCSX\u201d) generally supports the decision but requests a proceeding to consider antitrust immunity for alternative plans submitted to implement the direct connector standard. Intervenor Canadian Pacific Limited (\u201cCP\u201d) supports petitioners\u2019 position and requests reversal because of ICC\u2019s failure expressly to have allowed Canadian carriers to negotiate as a group with their direct connectors within the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-19\">We hold that the ICC did not err in its interpretation of the feasibility standard and that it properly exercised its discretion in denying petitioners' request for a delay. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>We also hold that CSX\u2019 request for an additional proceeding is unripe and moot and that its claim may not be considered by this court since it was not raised before the Commission. In sum, we affirm the decision of the ICC.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Petitioners, twenty large and small railroads and the American Shortline Railroad Association, representing an additional 266 railroads operating in the United States, sought a finding by the ICC that current implementation of the Staggers Act restriction on collective ratemaking with regard to inflationary cost recovery is not feasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10701(a), the ICC is authorized to determine whether railroad rates are reasonable. Toward this end, tariffs establishing or changing rates are filed by each railroad with the Commission. These rates can be for either a single-line or joint-line, i.e., they can apply either to a single route of an individual carrier or to a joint route in which more than one railroad participates. For joint-line or interline routes, in which traffic moves over two or more railroads, \u201csingle factor\u201d or \u201cjoint rates\u201d are calculated to provide shippers with a single fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Prior to enactment of the Staggers Act, railroads subject to regulation by the ICC were permitted to set rates collectively with other carriers. <em>See Section 5a Application No. 2, Western Traffic </em>Ass\u2019n\u2014 <em>Agreement, </em>276 I.C.C. 183, 185-91 (1949). The carriers established rate bureaus to facilitate negotiation of these collective rates and to ensure rate uniformity. H.R. Rep. No. 1035, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 119-21 (1980), <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4063-65. Provided the agreement establishing a rate bureau was approved by the Commission, the carriers\u2019 activities in a rate bureau were not considered to be violative of the antitrust laws. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10706(a)(2)(A). For example, railroads were given antitrust immunity to determine through the rate bureaus how much of an increase was necessary to offset their inflationary costs. The rate bureaus acted as their members\u2019 agents and filed petitions for rate increases with the Commission, demonstrating the impact of inflation on the railroads\u2019 costs. Shippers then had the opportunity to object. A single railroad could not, however, alter a rate without the \u201cconcurrence\u201d of all participating carriers. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10762(b)(2). <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10705(a)(1), (c)-(f); H.R.Rep. No. 1430, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 111-12 (1980), <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4143.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">Pursuant to the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976, Pub.L. No. 94-210, 90 Stat. 35 (the \u201c4R Act\u201d), the forerunner of the Staggers Act, Congress amended the ICC\u2019s authority to regulate railroad rates. <em>Green Bay and Western Railroad Co. v. United States, </em>644 F.2d 1217, 1227 (7th Cir.1981). Introducing the concept of \u201cmarket dominance,\u201d the 4R Act permitted rate regulation by the ICC only in the \u201cabsence of effective competition,\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10709(a), and, to encourage such competition and individual ratemaking, the Act prohibited certain collective action. Rate bureaus were precluded from allowing their members to vote on or discuss single line rates established by member carriers or joint rates in which members did not \u201cpractically participate,\u201d \u00a7 208(b) of the 4R Act; H.R.Rep. No. 781, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 153-54 (1976). In accordance with the Act\u2019s procompetitive thrust, four years after passage of the 4R Act, the Commission, in <em>Section 5b Application No. 2, Western Railroads </em>\u2014 Agree<em>ment, </em>364 I.C.C. 1 (1980), stated that collective action was contrary to the public interest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>In 1980, Congress enacted the Staggers Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101 <em>et seq., </em>which expanded the 4R Act and continued its policy of encouraging competition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Essentially, railroads were permitted to discuss rate changes only with their \u201cdirect connectors\u201d in a particular joint-line movement, i.e. with those railroads that \u201cpractically participate[d]\u201d with them in handling traffic over a particular route. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10706(a)(8)(A)\u00ae, (A)(iii) <em>&amp; </em>(B). <em>See Section 5b Application No. 2, Western Railroads </em>\u2014 Agreement, 364 I.C.C. 635, 651 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The statute draws a distinction between, on the one hand, collective activity concerning single line rates (\u00a7 10706(a)(3)(A)(i)), interline rates in which the carriers do not practically participate (\u00a7 10706(a)(3)(A)(ii)), and interline rates for alternative routes between any two points (\u00a7 10706(a)(3)(A)(i-ii)), and, on the other hand, collective activity involving general increases to cover inflationary costs (\u00a7 10706(a)(3)(B)(i)) or broad tariff changes (\u00a7 10706(a)(3)(B)(ii)). The restrictions on carriers which do not practically participate were to be effective immediately. The provisions prohibiting collective activity on single line rates and on rates for alternative routes were to become effective unless the Commission were to find implementation not feasible, in which case it could suspend or delay implementation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-13\">For the remaining two provisions, prohibiting collective activity with regard to broad tariff changes and prohibiting collective activity to cover inflationary cost increases, the provision at issue in the instant case, Congress granted a three-and-one-quarter year grace period until January 1,1984. Moreover, Congress also gave the Commission discretionary power to suspend or delay implementation if it found that implementation were shown to be not feasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-14\">At the same time that the Staggers Act placed restrictions on collective ratemaking for inflationary cost recovery, it also lifted certain barriers, enabling carriers to recoup inflationary costs without regulatory interference. Section 203 of the Staggers Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10707(a), authorizes the railroads to develop an index reflecting the estimated effect of inflation on their operating costs in the following quarter and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>then to submit the index to the Commission for verification. If the verified index, the \u201crail cost adjustment factor,\u201d projects an increase in costs for the next quarter, the railroads are permitted, without additional regulatory action, to increase their regulated rates for all commodities they transport by the percentage necessary to recover these projected costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Since joint rates may be increased only by mutual concurrence, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10762(b)(2), petitioners allege that the direct connector restriction on collective rate-making practically impairs their recovery of inflationary costs. Petitioners further allege that, by impairing inflationary cost recovery, the direct connector standard precludes realization of what they consider the primary goal of the Staggers Act, namely, enhancement of railroad revenue adequacy. Therefore, petitioners sought a finding by the ICC that application of the direct connector ratemaking restriction to inflationary cost recovery is presently infeasible and requested an additional delay of three years in its implementation.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">In response to the railroads\u2019 petition, the ICC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemak-ing in the <em>Federal Register, </em>48 Fed.Reg. 41, 464 (1988) soliciting public opinion on whether implementation of the direct connector restriction was \u201cnot feasible.\u201d The petitioning railroads filed comments in which they argued that collective procedures for recovering increased costs are not really anticompetitive, and that the only feasible alternative to collective activity is cumbersome separate negotiations among the various railroads for each rate increase. The National Industrial Transportation League, representing many of the Nation\u2019s shippers, filed comments supporting petitioners\u2019 request for a finding of infeasibility, but suggested that only a one year delay was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Several parties submitted comments opposing the railroads\u2019 petition for a delay, including the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d), the Department of .Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d), Consolidated Rail Corporation (\u201cConrail\u201d), CSX Railroads, Burlington Northern (\u201cBN\u201d), and Chemical Manufacturers Association (\u201cCMA\u201d). The DOT and Conrail submitted plans for implementing direct connector ratemaking without requiring the individual negotiations contemplated by petitioners. According to the DOT \u201cindependent factor joint rate\u201d plan, any railroad could alter its portion of a rate unilaterally, but the individual segments would be published as a joint-line tariff, for the convenience of the shipper. According to the Conrail plan, which was supported by BN, CSX, and, tentatively, the DOJ, each railroad would submit to the tariff publishing officer (\u201cTPO\u201d) the percentage of the Commission authorized increase it intended to implement. The TPO would then publish a tariff listing the increases specified by each railroad. On the assumption that all of the participating carriers could be deemed to have concurred in the lowest percentage increases submitted, the increase ultimately put into effect would be the lowest percentage increase selected by any of the participating carriers. Under both the DOT and Conrail plans, the railroads would not have to engage in individual negotiations. Furthermore, under either plan, railroads would be free to negotiate directly with their direct connectors. Petitioners noted difficulties with the Conrail plan, both mechanical and antitrust, and requested that the ICC conduct a separate sub-proceeding to study its feasibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Given the statutory goal of rate competition, the existence of alternative plans implementing the direct connector standard without tedious individual ratemaking, and the ICC\u2019s findings that petitioners did nothing to begin to implement the rate restrictions and failed to present evidence of concrete economic harm, the ICC held that petitioners had not shown that implementation of the statutory scheme was not feasible. Therefore, the Commission denied petitioners\u2019 request for a three year delay in the application of the direct connector rate-making restriction to inflationary cost recovery. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">Since CSX supported Conrail\u2019s proposal but was concerned about its antitrust impli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>cations, CSX requested that the Commission conduct a sub-proceeding to consider this issue. Recognizing that the onus is on petitioners to develop a plan for implementing the direct connector standard, the Commission refused CSX\u2019 request to evaluate Conrail\u2019s proposal. In denying CSX\u2019 request, the Commission stated in <em>dictum: </em>\u201cSince we will lose our authority to grant antitrust immunity after the direct connector standard goes into effect, any questions about whether the Conrail plan or any other plan violates the antitrust laws should be directed to the DOJ, not the Commission.\u201d 367 I.C.C. 896 n. 16. CSX inter- , . ,, . , , , , vened in the instant proceeding to seek A r. xi o \u2022 review of this statement by the Commis-<em>J </em>S10n'</p>\n<p id=\"AEe\">CP intervened in the present action on behalf of petitioners to assert an additional reason for a finding of infeasibility. Since the Canadian Railway Act permits collective ratemaking among Canadian rail carriers, CP alleges that the Commission s decision ignored principles of international comity by not expressly allowing Canadian carriers to negotiate collectively with their direct connectors in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"ANu\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"A0\">\n<em>Feasibility of the Direct Connector Stan-\u00bfar(n</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ATqT\">Petitioners mam contention is that the Commission erred in its interpretation of the term feasible and, thus, in its holding that there was insufficient proof to substantiate the railroads claim that present implementation of the direct connector standard is \u2018not feasible.\u2019 Petitioners go even further and state that \u201cCongress imposed on the ICC a duty to determine the subsequent workability and practicability of utilizing the direct connector standard\u201d (Petitioners\u2019 Br. at 16), implying that the Staggers Act requires the ICC to make a positive determination of feasibility.</p>\n<p id=\"A2n\">Petitioners\u2019 contention that the Commission is required to make an affirmative determination regarding the feasibility of direct connector ratemaking is without merit. The statute expressly states *at collective ratemaking shall end on January 1&gt; 1984 unless the Commission \u201cfinds at any time that implementation ... is not feasible.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10706(a)(3)(B). Furthermore, while the Senate version of the legislation which became the Staggers Act W(mld have \u2122posed a duty on Congress to \u2122ake <em>* </em>P0?1^6 fmdmg of feasibility, No. 470, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 53 1979), the Conference^Committee,^refusing to impose such an affirmative obligation, , , . TT \u00b0 \u2019 rejected the Senate s approach. H.R.Rep. - <em>n\u201e </em>\u201e, \u201e 1430, 96th Cong., 2d Sess., 113-14 (1980). Thus, both the plain language and legislative history of the statute refute petitioners\u2019 claim regarding a positive finding of feasibility.</p>\n<p id=\"A-F\">Similarly) contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention, the ICC\u2019s interpretation of the term \u2018feasible\u2019 is consistent with the plain meaning and dictionary definitions of the term. Petitioners provide two definitions 0f \u2018feasible\u2019 \u2014 \u201ccapable of being done or carried out,\u201d Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 453 (1983), and \u201ccapable of being managed, utilized or dealt with successfully.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary of the English Language 831 (1976). (Petitioners\u2019 Br. at 14). In support of their argument that the restriction on collective ratemaking is not feasible, petitioners o\u00a3fer evidence that the scheme would cause delay in implementing inflation based increases, resulting in a loss of revenue to the railroads. (Petitioners\u2019 Br. at 35) Petitioners allege that each carrier would be required to negotiate with each combination of other carriers with which it participates in joint rates, thereby resulting in delay. In addition, since direct connector ratemaking multiplies the number of required agreements, petitioners claim that the statutory scheme would produce increased costs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Based on either definition of feasibility, however, neither delay nor loss of revenue necessarily implies that the restriction on collective ratemaking is not feasible. Despite resulting delay or reduced recovery, the restriction may still be \u201ccapable of being implemented.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Further, even if the restriction does cause delay and reduced recovery, the ICC could still have justifiably concluded that the restriction was feasible, in the sense of \u201ccapable of being managed ... successfully,\u201d in light of the statutory goals that the restriction was intended to achieve.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Not only is the ICC\u2019s interpretation of \u2018feasible\u2019 consistent with the ordinary definitions of the term, it is also consistent with the legislative history of the Staggers Act and the goals Congress wanted to realize in enacting the legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The purposes of the Staggers Act are clearly enunciated, revealing its dominant procompetitive objectives. The statute was enacted: \u201cto allow, to the maximum extent possible, competition and the demand for services to establish reasonable rates,\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101a(l); \u201cto promote a safe and efficient rail transportation system by allowing rail carriers to earn adequate revenues,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 10101a(3); \u201cto ensure effective competition among rail carriers,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 10101a(4); and \u201cto require rail carriers, to the maximum extent practicable, to rely on individual rate increases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 10101a(ll). Moreover, the Congressional Conference report further emphasizes the central role of competition in the mind of Congress when it enacted the legislation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is axiomatic that the words of a statute should be interpreted in the context of congressional purposes, <em>Dickerson v. New Banner Institute, Inc., </em>460 U.S. 103, 103 S.Ct. 986, 994, 74 L.Ed.2d 845 (1983), and thus we conclude that the Commission was correct in its interpretation of \u2018not feasible.\u2019 <em>See Water Transport Ass\u2019n v. I. C. C., </em>722 F.2d 1025, 1031 (2d Cir.1983) (phrase \u201cessential terms\u201d in Staggers Act must be interpreted in light of purposes of Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">While admitting that competition is a goal of the Staggers Act, petitioners argue that the primary objective of the Act is to promote railroad \u201crevenue adequacy,\u201d and that the anticollective ratemaking provisions are to be evaluated as only one route toward this end. (Petitioners\u2019 Br. at 17). Several factors favor upholding the Commission\u2019s interpretation of congressional purpose. First, the language of the Act itself highlights the central importance of competition by specifically mandating that competition is to determine rates to the <em>maximum extent possible, </em>\u00a7 10101a(ll), and that rail carriers are to rely on individual rate increases <em>to the maximum extent practicable, </em>\u00a7 10101a(l). Second, although in enacting the Staggers Act, the railroads\u2019 financial well-being was clearly a major concern of the Congress, the Act tries to achieve railroad revenue adequacy by means of the interaction of competitive forces. As noted by the Commission, Congress recognized that the way to attain revenue adequacy for the railroads was through individual pricing mechanisms, rather than through collective ratemaking. 367 I.C.C. 892-94. Third, Congress enacted the procompetitive provisions of the Staggers Act after finding that collective ratemaking was a partial cause of the railroads\u2019 pre-Staggers financial difficulties. H.R.Rep. No. 1035, 96th Cong., 2d Sess., 34-38 (1980). Therefore, contrary to petitioners\u2019 argument, it is not likely that Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>gress viewed collective action as a preferred route to achieving financial recovery for the railroads. Fourth, the Commission's decision in the instant case is consistent with its prior decisions. In <em>Section 5b Application No. 2, Western </em>Railroads\u2014 <em>Agreement, </em>364 I.C.C. 635 (1981), e.g., the ICC held that \u201c[t]he major premises of both the 4R Act and the SRA [Staggers Rail Act] are the encouragement of rail competition, and to allow individual carriers to price their services according to individual costs and revenue need.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 644. <em>See Section 5b Application No. 2, Western Railroads </em>\u2014 Agreement, 365 I.C.C. 918 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Furthermore, not only must the Commission\u2019s decision be sustained unless it was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\u201d Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1982); <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 2865, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983); <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 414, 91 S.Ct. 814, 822, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971), but, since we believe the agency\u2019s statutory interpretation is consistent with congressional purposes, <em>Katharine Gibbs School (Inc.) v. Federal Trade Commission, </em>612 F.2d 658, 664 (2d Cir.1979), the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the Staggers Act should be given great deference. <em>Federal Election Commission v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, </em>454 U.S. 27, 39, 102 S.Ct. 38, 46, 70 L.Ed.2d 23 (1981); <em>FCC v. WNCN Listeners Guild, </em>450 U.S. 582, 598, 101 S.Ct. 1266, 1276, 67 L.Ed.2d 521 (1980); <em>The Commissioner of Transportation of the State of N.Y. v. United States of America &amp; I.C.C., </em>750 F.2d 163 (2d Cir.1984); <em>Connecticut Fund for Environment, Inc. v. EPA, </em>696 F.2d 169, 173-74 (2d Cir.1982) (agency\u2019s interpretation of its governing statute is entitled to great deference).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Herein, the ICC\u2019s decision was clearly not arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion. Rather, it was based upon numerous arguments presented to the ICC as a result of its call for public comment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Among other things, the Commission considered the plans submitted to it by the DOT and Conrail. It concluded that the alternatives suggested show that the direct connector standard would not necessarily lead to the cumbersome individual negotiations predicted by petitioners and, therefore, that the statutory scheme could not be said to be infeasible. Petitioners contend, however, that, without a sub-proceeding, the ICC should not have considered the Conrail Plan since it \u201cis untested and raises grave legal issues.\u201d We agree with the ICC that because it is not required to make an affirmative finding of feasibility under \u00a7 10706(a)(3)(B), petitioners may not legitimately object to the ICC\u2019s considering the plan, even though it is untested. With regard to the claim of \u201cgrave legal issues,\u201d the Commission reasonably noted, based on comments from the DOJ, that no significant antitrust problems exist with the Conrail plan. 367 I.C.C. 886, 896 n. 16. As CMA states, on May 22, 1984, the DOJ issued a business review letter commenting approvingly on the Conrail plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">In addition to the plans submitted by Conrail and the DOT, the Commission took into consideration petitioners\u2019 failure to show that they had explored any alternatives of their own during the three-and-one-quarter year statutory grace period. Given the clear January 1, 1984 deadline imposed by Congress, \u00a7 10706(a)(3)(B), and the grace period provided, it was reasonable for the Commission to conclude that \u201cthe carriers have the burden of using their new freedoms to find new ways to price their services without antitrust immunity,\u201d 367 I.C.C. 886, 894, and that by doing nothing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>the railroads had failed to act as \u201creasonably prudent businessmen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 896. Moreover, in the absence of a showing that petitioners explored alternative means for implementing the direct connector standard, petitioners\u2019 objection to the Conrail plan because it is \u201cuntested\u201d is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The Commission also observed that, as required by the Staggers Act, railroads are already implementing inflationary cost recovery rate changes without collective action. <em>Id. </em>at 894. Subsequent to the ICC decision herein, an inflationary cost recovery tariff increase, resulting from route to route rather than collective negotiations, was authorized to be taken in full on July 1,1984 by all of the Nation\u2019s railroads, Rail Carrier Cost Recovery Tariff, RCCR X084-A, further indicating that the direct connector standard is not infeasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Finally, the Commission considered evidence regarding the costs of implementing the direct connector standard. In its comments, the DOT pointed out, and petitioners concede, the number of regulated joint rates, the only ones to which the direct connector standard applies, has been decreasing and is likely to continue to decrease. Furthermore, the Commission notes that the bulk of rail traffic moves in single-line, rather than joint-line service. <em>Id. </em>Consequently, the Commission concluded that petitioners have \u201cgreatly overstated the magnitude of any increase in transaction costs which would occur from the timely implementation of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We are not persuaded to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">In arguing that collective action to recover inflationary costs is not anticompetitive in the same way that collusive price-fixing is (Petitioners Br. at 30), petitioners admit that competitive pressures often limit inflationary increases actually taken.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This suggests that, in many instances, railroads would continue to act independently, even after implementation of the direct connector standard, thereby further reducing the burden that implementation would place on petitioners. Moreover, any increased competition among the railroads themselves, which might well result from individual as opposed to collective ratemaking, would tend to further promote, rather than thwart, the objectives of Congress in enacting the Staggers Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the Commission\u2019s finding that petitioners failed to offer sufficient evidence of concrete economic harm and the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the Staggers Act are neither arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, nor inconsistent with the law and are therefore entitled to great deference. <em>Newsweek, Inc. v. U.S. Postal Service, </em>663 F.2d 1186, 1197 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>457 U.S. 1133, 102 S.Ct. 2959, 73 L.Ed.2d 1350 (1981). The Commission found that revenue adequacy for railroads, while an important goal, does not override Congress\u2019 interest in promoting competition. As the Commission states, \u201cCongress determined that the potential welfare loss associated with collusion outweighed possibly ... higher transaction costs associated with competitive ratemaking.\u201d 367 I.C.C. 886, 893-94. Therefore, we uphold the interpretation by the Commission of the Staggers Act, including its views as to feasibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-13\">\n<em>Claims of Intervenors CSX and CP</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b229-14\">Intervenor CSX generally supports the Commission\u2019s decision but intervened herein for the limited purpose of seeking review of the Commission\u2019s <em>dictum </em>that it \u201cwill lose [its] authority to grant antitrust immunity after the direct connector standard goes into effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at- 896 n. 16. CSX maintains that, if need be, the Commission could make a \u201cnot feasible\u201d finding in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-15\">We consider the issue presented by CSX to be both unripe and moot. As noted by the ICC, no party raised the question before it of whether and under what circumstances the Commission could reopen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>the proceeding in the future to make a finding of infeasibility. Moreover, in <em>Section 5b Application No. 2, Western Railroads </em>\u2014 Agreement, ICC Docket No. \u00a7 5b Application No. 2, not printed, served May 7, 1984 at 6-7, the Commission stated that situations could arise in which the Commission may have occasion to make a \u201cnot feasible\u201d finding in the future. In our view, CSX\u2019 concern is not an issue which we need address.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">With regard to CP\u2019s claim that the Commission ignored principles of international comity, we hold that CP\u2019s failure to raise this issue before the ICC precludes it from being raised on appeal. <em>United States v.

The Commission stated that collective action tends to inflate rate levels through setting of uniform rates acceptable to a majority of carriers, including the less efficient. It creates an atmosphere of consensus which discourages the establishment of innovative price and service options by individual carriers. Competition gives carriers an incentive to price their services in closer alignment with the actual costs of providing those ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>vices.

Such delay and increased cost is further exacerbated, according to petitioners, by several factors complicating the rail industry joint rate structure \u2014 e.g., the different rate provided for each commodity transported; the special modification of railroad cars demanded of particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>shippers; and the competition from other forms of transportation, as well as from other railroads themselves.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b227-8\">.
