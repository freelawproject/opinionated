HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">After a jury trial, Albert William Gray was convicted of four counts of mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, and one count of inducing travel in interstate commerce with the intent to defraud the travel-ler of property worth over $5,000, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314. Gray offers three reasons for reversal: the trial court\u2019s refusal to give his requested jury instruction on good faith; rejection of his Fourth Amendment objections to the admission into evidence of a brochure that the receiver of Gray\u2019s defunct bonding company had turned over to the FBI; and the alleged insufficiency of the evidence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">The indictment charged Gray with conducting a scheme to sell fraudulent surety bonds to contractors. Gray was accused of representing to contractors that his bonds had been issued by established insurance companies, when instead they were backed only by Gray\u2019s similarly-named Texas businesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">In June of 1982, Gray incorporated a Texas corporation called New Hampshire Financial Services. Gray then filed assumed name certificates stating that New Hampshire Financial Services would do business under the names \u201cNew Hampshire Insurance Company\u201d and \u201cGranite State Insurance Company.\u201d Although Gray listed his true name and address in all of these filings, his selection of trade names showed little originality. New Hampshire Insurance Company is an estab-' lished and prominent insurer with offices in Manchester, New Hampshire and Granite State Insurance Company is its subsidiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">Gray promoted his companies as issuers of performance and payment bonds for contractors. He had a brochure printed describing each company\u2019s operations, financial status and officers. Much of the information in the brochure was false. Of the persons listed as officers, one was dead, two were attorneys with no connection to Gray\u2019s companies, and two were Gray\u2019s children, both under age 11. The brochure also listed over $800,000 in nonexistent corporate assets, and listed a nonexistent accounting firm as the corporate auditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">In September 1982, Scott McPherson, an independent insurance agent, arranged for Gray\u2019s Granite State Insurance Co. to issue a performance bond for one of McPherson\u2019s clients. McPherson believed that he was dealing with the New Hampshire-based company. McPherson mailed Gray a premium check for $9,367.20. Gray then mailed McPherson a performance bond that bore two forged signatures and listed the company\u2019s home office as Manchester, New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-13\">In October 1982, Larry Snider, McPherson\u2019s partner, mailed Gray a premium check for $463.20. Gray mailed Snider a performance bond listing Associated Indemnity Company as the surety. Snider checked a U.S. Treasury Department list of insurers, saw Associated Indemnity listed as a division of Fireman\u2019s Fund, and assumed that the bond had come from the Fireman\u2019s Fund company. It was in reality backed only by Gray. The bond also contained the forged signature of a notary.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-14\">During the same month, for a $23,000 premium, Gray sold W.L. Kilgore a bond insuring Kilgore\u2019s performance as contractor on an Army Corps of Engineers dredging project in Louisiana. Kilgore\u2019s wife flew from New Orleans to Dallas, paid for and obtained the bond, and returned to New Orleans to submit the bond to the Corps for approval. The bond was issued by Gray\u2019s New Hampshire Insurance Co., but listed the company\u2019s home office as Manchester, New Hampshire; once again, the bond bore the forged signature of a purported corporate officer. The Corps later rejected the Gray bond, and demanded that Kilgore obtain a new one. When he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>did not, the Corps cancelled Kilgore\u2019s contract and Kilgore filed for bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">On October 14, a Texas court ordered Gray\u2019s business into a receivership. The State Board of Insurance was appointed as receiver. Christopher Meisel, the State Board official assigned to act as receiver, discovered the brochure. He questioned Gray, who admitted that many of the brochure\u2019s representations were false. Later, FBI Agent Sam Williams visited Meisel and told him that Gray was being investigated for possible criminal acts. Meisel agreed to cooperate with Williams, and turned over to him, among other items, the brochure.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Soon after the receivership took effect, Gray, using personal funds, refunded Snider\u2019s premium and other premiums paid to him for unused bonds. In the succeeding months, Gray wrote to the receiver and offered suggestions as to what actions New Hampshire Financial Services should take in the litigation over the Kilgore project.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">Gray was indicted for mail fraud with respect to the McPherson and Snider bonds, and for causing Mrs. Kilgore to travel in interstate commerce with the intent to defraud her of over $5000. Before trial, Gray moved to suppress the brochure as the fruit of an illegal search; the court denied his motion without opinion. At trial, Gray, through cross-examination of government witnesses and exhibits submitted on cross-examination, introduced evidence of his post-receivership actions and of the truthfulness of his June 1982 state filings. The defense called no witnesses of its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">At the close of the evidence, Gray\u2019s counsel submitted a proposed jury instruction setting forth good faith as a defense. The court refused to give this instruction, but instead charged the jury that specific intent was necessary for a conviction, and explained how Gray\u2019s intent might be inferred. Gray was convicted on all the counts submitted to the jury, and was sentenced to prison terms totalling seven years, followed by four years of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">-1-</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">We have recently explained that in deciding the sufficiency of the submission of a defendant\u2019s theory of defense the charge \u201c... must be examined in the full context of trial including the final arguments of counsel.\u201d <em>United States v. Fooladi, </em>746 F.2d 1027, 1030 (5th Cir.1984). That the inquiry is not confined to the four corners of the charge flows directly from the circumstance that the ultimate question is whether the claimed instructional deficiency \u201cviolates a defendant\u2019s right to the fair trial guaranteed him by the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments----\u201d <em>Id. </em>Any further narrowing of the judicial inquiry would then by necessity be justifiable only as a matter of superintendence. Arguably, we did just that in <em>United States v. Goss, </em>650 F.2d 1336, 1344-45 (5th Cir.1981) and <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>592 F.2d 1282, 1286-87 (5th Cir.1979). In <em>Goss </em>and <em>Lewis </em>the inquiry, although it is not certain, seems to have been confined to the charge. Whether this was simply reflective of the facts of those cases or whether it was a considered expression of a rule of superintendence was not clear. In <em>Fooladi, </em>we \u201cread them in the reconciling light that neither <em>Goss </em>nor <em>Lewis </em>explained the shortcoming of the charge in the context of trial[.]\u201d <em>United States v. Fooladi, </em>at 1031. We pointed out that reading <em>Lewis </em>and <em>Goss </em>as having adopted a per se rule, with its companion limit of looking solely to the charge, was inconsistent with earlier cases including <em>United States v. Wellendorf </em>574 F.2d 1289, 1290-91 (5th Cir.1978). Under our court rules any such inconsistency must be resolved in favor of the earlier line, absent intervening decisions by the Supreme Court. Arguably, the conflict among our prior decisions is illusory, a \u201cseeming variation in principle ... the anticipatable result of examining myriad fact patterns with a measure of whether an instruction was \u2018sufficiently\u2019 precise.\u201d <em>Fooladi, </em>at 1031. In any event, we now lay uncertainty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>rest and make plain that any conflict among our prior decisions is resolved in favor of <em>United States v. Wellendorf, </em>574 F.2d 1289 (5th Cir.1978); <em>United States v. Barham, </em>595 F.2d 231, 244 (5th Cir.1979); <em>United States v. Fooladi, </em>746 F.2d 1027 (5th Cir.1984); they are the law of the circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">-2-</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Gray argues that the trial court erred in refusing his requested good-faith instruction. We must decide whether the charge that was given allowed Gray to develop and present to the jury his theory that he lacked the requisite intent to defraud his customers. As in <em>Fooladi, </em>we find that Gray had ample opportunity to present his defense and did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">The evidence offered by the defense during the trial was explicitly submitted as proof of Gray\u2019s good faith. For example, when Gray\u2019s counsel moved for the admission of a document showing that Gray had refunded an unused bond premium, the prosecution objected on relevance grounds. Gray\u2019s counsel responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-7\">Your Honor, I would offer Defendant\u2019s Exhibit No. 19 on the basis it is a valid defense to the charge of fraud to show good faith, and this assignment and refund shows good faith on the part of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">The court admitted the exhibit, and instructed the jury that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-9\">[The exhibit] has no bearing particularly on the indictment here as to the facts, but if you consider it for any reason you\u2019ll consider it for the sole and limited purpose as it relates to the intent of this defendant to commit the offenses charged____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">The court\u2019s charge to the jury in no way undercut Gray\u2019s theory that he lacked fraudulent intent. To the contrary, it reinforced Gray\u2019s effort to express in terms of good faith his contention that he lacked the required intent. In relevant part, the charge read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-11\">The crimes charged in this case are serious crimes which require proof of specific intent before the defendant can be convicted. Specific intent, as the term implies, means more than the general intent to commit the act. To establish specific intent, the government must prove that the defendant knowingly did an act which the law forbids, purposely intending to violate the law. Such intent may be determined from all the facts and circumstances surrounding the case____ You may consider any statement made and done or omitted by the defendant, and all other facts or circumstances in evidence which indicate his or her state of mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-15\">This charge, as in <em>Fooladi, </em>was a springboard from which Gray\u2019s counsel was allowed to launch his good faith argument to the jury. The record shows that he did exactly that.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-16\">Gray\u2019s counsel introduced his argument by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-17\">[W]hat it will all boil [down] to is your determination of whether or not the government has proven to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt that A.W. Gray intended to defraud somebody.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-18\">He then discussed at length the state filings, post-receivership letters, and refunds, twice explicitly referring to the issue at hand as one of good faith. In conclusion, counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-19\">[I] f there is any explanation, any reasonable explanation for the conduct of the defendant, other than his intent to defraud people, proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the law charges you to find him not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-20\">Taken together, the trial, charge, and closing argument laid Gray\u2019s theory squarely before the jury. The court\u2019s charge enabled the jury to \u201crecognize and understand the defense theory, test it against the evidence presented at trial, and then make a definitive decision whether, based on that evidence and in light of the defense theory, the defendant [was] guilty or not guilty.\u201d <em>Fooladi, </em>746 F.2d at 1031, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number><em>quoting United States v. Barham, </em>595 F.2d 231, 244 (5th Cir.1979). The court\u2019s refusal to give the specific charge requested did not deny Gray a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">Gray argues that FBI Agent Williams should have obtained a warrant before asking Meisel, the receiver, to turn over the brochure, and that the \u201cseizure\u201d of the brochure without a warrant invaded his Fourth Amendment rights. At the time of Williams\u2019s investigation, though, Gray no longer had custody or control over his companies\u2019 records, that authority having passed to the receiver. Because Gray no longer had a reasonable expectation that those records would remain private, he lacks standing to challenge the \u201cseizure.\u201d <em>See United States v. Payner, </em>447 U.S. 727, 100 S.Ct. 2439, 65 L.Ed.2d 468 (1980); <em>Rakas v. Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978). Regardless, Williams did not \u201cseize\u201d the records, but made a request that Meisel agreed to. Williams obtained the brochure through the consent of its lawful custodian, Meisel, and thus did not violate the Fourth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 171, 94 S.Ct. 988, 993, 39 L.Ed.2d 242 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">Finally, Gray challenges the sufficiency of the government\u2019s case. The prosecution\u2019s evidence showed that Gray sent bonds containing falsehoods and forgeries through the mail, and that he prompted Mrs. Kilgore to travel from Louisiana to Texas to obtain a similarly misleading bond. This evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942), is sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Gray intended to deceive the contractors he did business with.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
