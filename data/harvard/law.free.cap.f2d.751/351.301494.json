Kathy Warner subsequently joined the action as an intervenor. Plaintiffs alleged that the Secretary exceeded his statutory authority by withholding federal income tax refunds and earned income credits due them. They sought declaratory and injunc-tive relief. The district court dismissed Rucker\u2019s claims as moot and also dismissed Warner\u2019s intervenor claim. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-16\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b467-17\">This case involves the federal-state intercept program authorized by section 2331 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, Pub.L. No. 97-35, 95 Stat. 860 (1981) (Omnibus Act). Under this program, federal income tax refunds due a taxpayer may be transferred to a state to the extent of a taxpayer\u2019s past-due child support obligations. Two provisions of the Omnibus Act are relevant here. The first is an amendment to the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 664 (1982), which provides for reimbursing states that have supported the taxpayer\u2019s children through the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (AFDC).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 664(a) authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to withhold \u201crefunds of Federal taxes paid\u201d which are due to a parent of children supported by AFDC, and to transfer these funds to an appropriate state agency to satisfy the parent\u2019s child support obligation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The second pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>vision is an amendment to section 6402 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6402(c) (1982), which implements the procedure authorized by section 664(a) and provides that \u201c[t]he amount of any overpayment to be refunded to the person making the overpayment\u201d shall be reduced by the amount of any past-due child support.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Plaintiff Dalleen Rucker is a married woman and a Colorado resident. Her husband is indebted to the State of Colorado for his failure to make required support payments to the children of his prior marriage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In April 1982, Rucker and her husband filed a joint 1981 Federal income tax return, expecting to receive $1,124 back from the Internal Revenue Service. This sum consisted of an income tax refund and an earned income credit. In June 1982, the IRS notified the Ruckers by letter that this sum was being withheld to satisfy Mr. Rucker\u2019s child support obligations. In August 1982, Rucker filed an amended tax return seeking a refund of that portion of the overpayment of income taxes and the earned income credit allocable to her. She subsequently received a refund of $126, which represented the entire amount of her excess wage withholdings and a portion of the earned income credit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">Immediately after filing her amended tax return, and before receiving the $126 refund, Rucker brought this action claiming that defendants exceed their statutory authority by intercepting and withholding funds owed to a taxpayer who is the nonob-ligated spouse of a child support obligor. She also claimed that defendants\u2019 taking money due to a married taxpayer to satisfy obligations of a spouse, without affording the taxpayer notice and an opportunity to contest the liability, is a taking of property without due process in violation of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">The district court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claims on the grounds of mootness.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Rucker v. Secretary of the Treasury, </em>555 F.Supp. 1051, 1053 (D.Colo.1983). The court held that Rucker\u2019s Fifth Amendment and tax refund claims were moot because she had received her allocable share of the income tax refund. The court also ruled that earned income credits are subject to the intercept program and that Rucker\u2019s earned income credit claim was also moot because she had received an allocable share of this credit. On appeal, Rucker raises only the issue whether earned income credits are subject to the intercept program and whether they lawfully can be withheld under section 664(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">MOOTNESS</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Defendants assert that there is no case or controversy to support federal court jurisdiction, as required by article III, section 2 of the United States Constitution, because Rucker has received her allocable share of the earned income credit. Defendants claim that it was unnecessary and purely advisory for the trial court to consider whether the earned income credit could be withheld under section 664, and that no justicable issue is presented to this court on appeal. <em>See Golden v. Zwickler, </em>394 U.S. 103, 110, 89 S.Ct. 956, 960, 22 L.Ed.2d 113 (1969); <em>Baker v. Carr, </em>369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 703, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962); <em>Norvell v. Sangre de Cristo Development Co., </em>519 F.2d 370, 375 (10th Cir.1975); <em>Oklahoma City, Oklahoma v. Dulick, </em>318 F.2d 830, 831 (10th Cir.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">This argument misconceives the nature of Rucker\u2019s claim. As we read Rucker\u2019s complaint, she is clearly claiming that defendants have exceeded their statutory authority by withholding <em>any </em>of the earned income credit due to her and her husband as a family unit. The IRS refunded only what it determined to be the portion of the credit allocable to her alone. The remaining portion of the credit has not been refunded to the Ruckers and Mrs. Rucker\u2019s claim to the remainder provides the necessary controversy needed to support federal court jurisdiction. In arguing to the contrary, defendants assume the very issue in this case: whether the earned income credit can be allocated among spouses and a portion of it withheld under section 664 to satisfy one spouse\u2019s child support obligations. Consequently, Rucker\u2019s claim is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"ACh\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY Defendants argue that if Rucker\u2019s claim is not moot, it is barred by her failure to comply with the jurisdictional requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422(a) (1982), which provides that no suit may be maintained for the recovery of any tax until a claim for refund has been duly filed with the IRS. They argue that Rucker\u2019s suit, instituted after her refund claim had been filed but prior to the expiration of the six-month period set forth in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6532(a)(1) (1982),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. <em>See, e.g., Dieckmann v. United States, </em>550 F.2d 622, 623 (10th Cir.1977); <em>United States v. Freedman, </em>444 F.2d 1387, 1388 (9th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 992, 92 S.Ct. 538, 30 L.Ed.2d 544 (1971); <em>Oldland v. Kurtz, </em>528 F.Supp. 316, 322-23 (D.Colo. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">A number of courts have addressed this very issue in the context of challenges to the intercept program. Almost all have concluded that claims to withheld tax refunds and earned income credits are not barred by sections 7422(a) and 6532 of the Internal Revenue Code. <em>See Nelson v. Regan, </em>731 F.2d 105, 109 (2d Cir.1984); <em>Jahn v. Regan, </em>584 F.Supp. 399, 408 n. 17 (E.D.Mich.1984); <em>Sorenson v. Secretary of the Treasury, </em>557 F.Supp. 729, 732-33 (W.D.Wash.1982), <em>appeal docketed, </em>No. 83-3694 (9th Cir. Mar. 23, 1983); <em>cf. Marcello v. Regan, </em>574 F.Supp. 586, 594 (D.R.I. 1983) (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421(a) likewise does not bar these challenges); <em>Coughlin v. Regan, </em>584 F.Supp. 697, 705-06 (D.Maine 1984) (same). <em>But see Vidra v. Egger, </em>575 F.Supp. 1305, 1307-08 (E.D.Pa.1982). As these decisions recognize, the statutory language of section 7422(a) and the policies prohibiting judicial intervention in tax col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>lection and assessment are not applicable to challenges to the intercept program. The intercept program operates only after tax assessment and collection, when the federal government ceases to have an interest in the tax refunds. Judicial review at this point will not interfere with or thwart the government\u2019s ability to collect taxes or its need for steady and predictable tax revenues. <em>See, e.g., Marcello, </em>574 F.Supp. at 594. <em>Cf. Bob Jones University v. Simon, </em>416 U.S. 725, 736, 94 S.Ct. 2038, 2045, 40 L.Ed.2d 496 (1974). Accordingly, we conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 claims for earned income credit benefits are not barred by sections 7422(a) and 6532 of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">EARNED INCOME CREDIT WITHHOLDING</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">As noted above, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 664(a) authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to withhold \u201crefunds of federal taxes paid\u201d which are due to an obligated spouse. In addition, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6402(c) provides that the amount of any \u201coverpayment to be refunded to the person making the overpayment\u201d shall be reduced by the amount of past-due child support. Rucker asserts that the earned income credit is neither a \u201crefund of federal taxes\u201d nor an \u201coverpayment\u201d within the meaning of these two statutory provisions, and thus is not subject to withholding in the intercept program.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The earned income credit is a benefit available to certain families with dependent children and with an earned family income of less than $10,000 per year. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 43 (1982). The maximum credit allowed is $500. It is reduced proportionately as the adjusted gross family income increases above $6000, dropping to zero at $10,000. It was designed to provide relief to low income families who pay little or no income tax, and it was intended to provide an incentive for low income people to work rather than to receive federal assistance. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 94-36, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 11 (1975), <em>reprinted in </em>1975 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 54, 63-64. While the credit benefits are distributed through the tax refund process, a recipient need not have owed or paid any taxes to be eligible. <em>See Nelson, </em>731 F.2d at 109; <em>In re Searles, </em>445 F.Supp. 749, 752-53 (D.Conn.1978). A refund of federal taxes is a repayment of money paid by a taxpayer in excess of that taxpayer\u2019s liability. Although the earned income credit is given effect through the income tax return, the credit is not a tax refund because eligibility for the credit is not contingent upon payment of any federal income tax. <em>Id.; In re Hurles, </em>31 B.R. 179, 180 (Bankr.S.D.Ohio 1983). Section 664(a), which authorizes interception only of \u201crefunds of federal taxes paid,\u201d does not itself authorize interception of the earned income credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">Defendants argue, however, that while section 664(a) may not authorize the withholding of earned income credits, such withholding is expressly authorized by section 6402(c) of the Internal Revenue Code because the earned income credit is an \u201coverpayment\u201d subject to interception. They point out that section 6401 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6401, defines \u201coverpayment\u201d to include the excess of an earned income credit over tax liability, and that this excess exists even when there is no tax liability.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Rucker counters that because section 6402(c) only authorizes an offset against an \u201coverpayment to be refunded to the person making the overpayment,\u201d the earned income credit is not an \u201coverpayment\u201d that can be withheld under section 6402(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">Courts that have faced this issue have reached conflicting results. <em>Compare Nelson, </em>731 F.2d at 111-12 (the earned income credit is not subject to interception under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6402(c)) <em>with Coughlin, </em>584 F.Supp. at 706-07 (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6402(c) authorizes interception of the earned income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>credit), <em>and Sorenson, 557 </em>F.Supp. at 733-34 (W.D.Wash.1983) (same). For the reasons set forth below, we believe the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Nelson </em>is the better view.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">As the <em>Nelson </em>court notes, the term \u201coverpayment,\u201d broadly defined in section 6401 but limited in section 6402 by the phrase \u201cto be refunded to the person making the overpayment,\u201d is ambiguous with regard to the earned income credit. Section 6401 is a general provision in the chapter on Abatements, Credits, and Refunds of the Internal Revenue Code, governing the tax refund process. <em>See Nelson, </em>731 F.2d at 111. Section 6402(c) and section 664(a), on the other hand, were both enacted as part of the Omnibus Act, which established the tax intercept program. <em>Id. </em>Interpreting the term \u201coverpayment\u201d in section 6402(c) so as not to include the earned income credit results in consistency with section 664(a) which authorizes only withholding of federal tax refunds. Moreover, we believe that this interpretation furthers the congressional purpose in enacting the earned income credit. Reducing the amount of the earned income credit due to a low income working family would reduce the family members\u2019 incentive to work, and would frustrate the congressional goals of providing relief to low income families, encouraging work, reducing dependence on federal assistance, and stimulating the economy. <em>See id. </em>at 111-12; <em>cf., In re Searles, </em>455 F.Supp. at 752-53 (discussing the adverse effects of including the credit in a bankrupt\u2019s property).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Defendants claim and the district court agreed, that the tax intercept program\u2019s goal of enforcing child support obligations should take priority over the policies underlying the earned income credit. <em>See Rucker, </em>555 F.Supp. at 1053. We are not persuaded. The intercepted funds are not paid to support the obligated taxpayer\u2019s child but to reimburse a state for its support of that child in the past. The earned income credit, on the other hand, directly benefits the dependent children of the low income taxpayer. In the absence of evidence that Congress intended such a substantial cutback on the earned income credit program, we interpret the intercept legislation before us so as to avoid both conflict between the provisions of the Omnibus Act and a result clearly at odds with the goals of the earned income credit program. We hold that 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6402 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 664 do not authorize the withholding of any portion of the earned income credit due an otherwise eligible recipient.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">The judgment is reversed and remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-11\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(26) (1982) requires the parent to whom child support payments are due to assign the right to such payments to a state as a precondition to AFDC eligibility in that state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b467-12\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 664(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-13\">\u201cUpon receiving notice from a State agency administering a plan approved under this part that a named individual owes past-due support which has been assigned to such State pursuant to section 602(a)(26) of this title, the Secretary of the Treasury shall determine whether any amounts, as refunds of Federal taxes paid, are payable to such individual (regardless of whether such individual filed a tax return as a married or unmarried individual).
