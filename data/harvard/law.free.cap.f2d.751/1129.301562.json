At the time of the accident, CWS was under contract to drill a well for defendant Amoco. Plaintiff alleged that several defects in the design, maintenance and operation of the rig contributed to his injury. He claims that Amoco was negligent in failing to correct the safety hazards or to terminate the work until the hazards had been corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-4\">The district court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding that under the terms of the contract between Amoco and CWS, CWS was an independent contractor and therefore Amoco had no duty toward plaintiff, one of CWS\u2019s employees. Plaintiff appeals claiming that there is a legitimate dispute as to whether CWS was an independent contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-5\">Summary judgment is proper only \u201cwhen the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R. Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-6\">The essential question in this case is whether CWS was an independent contractor of Amoco. This question turns on whether Amoco had in fact retained sufficient control over CWS\u2019s operations that it could not in law shield itself from liability for plaintiff\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-7\">There appears to be some question over whether the contract as written reserves such a right to Amoco. Regardless of whether the contract purports to make CWS an independent contractor, however, it will not protect Amoco if it may be inferred from facts and circumstances revealed by the evidence that the real relationship between Amoco and CWS was that of master and servant. <em>McReynolds v. Oklahoma Turnpike Authority, </em>291 P.2d 341, 345 (Okla.1955); <em>Ulibarri Landscaping Material, Inc. v. Colony Materials Inc., </em>97 N.M. 266, 639 P.2d 75, 78 (1981); <em>see also Stockwell v. Morris, </em>46 Wyo. 1, 22 P.2d 189 (1933) (issue in determining whether master-servant relationship exists is <em>control or </em>right to control). The extent to which Amoco actually retained the right to control is primarily a question of fact for the jury. <em>Combined Insurance Co. of America v. Sinclair, </em>584 P.2d 1034, 1042 (Wyo.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-9\">Deposition evidence in the hearing for summary judgment clearly creates, an issue of fact on the question of Amoco\u2019s control over the claimed hazardous situation that resulted in the plaintiff\u2019s injury. The following excerpt from the deposition of an Amoco employee, which was quoted to the judge during the hearing, is sufficient to create a factual question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1216-10\">Q If you should observe on the well site violations of any rules, regulations, or laws that you know about, what procedure would you employ, what would you do about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1216-11\">A If it was along the line of safety of somebody working on there, I would tell them directly at the time. If there was a matter of safety of someone working on there. But if they was doing something unsafe, I\u2019d go through the pusher, and if the pusher wasn\u2019t there I would talk to the driller on the job at the, time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1216-12\">Q What would you do if you observed an unsafe condition on or about the drilling rig?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1216-13\">A Get it corrected immediately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1216-14\">Q How would you accomplish that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1216-15\">A Just go through the tool pusher, and if he wasn\u2019t around, go to the driller.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1216-16\">Q You wouldn\u2019t shut down operations or anything of that nature, would you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1216-17\">A We\u2019d shut down operations if it was necessary, yes, until it was corrected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1216-18\">Q You have the authority to shut down operations\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1216-19\">A Oh, yeah.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1216-20\">Record, vol. 6, at 22. Mr. Bates, the Amoco employee, clearly felt he had the right and the responsibility to correct unsafe conditions on the CWS drilling rig.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>The court below ruled that the contract did not give Amoco the right to control, but ignored the factual question, legitimately raised by the Bates deposition, of whether Amoco had in fact retained the right to control notwithstanding the contractual language. Plaintiff has carried his burden of showing that a genuine issue of fact exists on the question of Amoco\u2019s control, and summary judgment on this issue was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-4\">The decision is reversed and the case is remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
