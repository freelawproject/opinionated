Various labor organizations filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the authority of the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7101 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cCSRA\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d), to promulgate guidelines on this subject. In the labor organizations\u2019 view, the CSRA, in working a fundamental transformation of the Nation\u2019s civil service laws, vested all responsibility exclusively in the Federal Labor Relations Authority (\u201cFLRA\u201d or \u201cAuthority\u201d) for providing policy guidance and advice to administrative agencies with respect to labor-management relations. The District Court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 contentions, concluding that OPM had acted within its province in determining to issue what the court deemed to be non-compulsory guidelines. We agree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-10\">The watershed nature of the CSRA has been adequately treated elsewhere, <em>see, e.g., BATF v. FLRA, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 439, 441-42, 78 L.Ed.2d 195 (1983); <em>National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA, </em>691 F.2d 553, 554-55 (D.C.Cir.1982); <em>Department of Defense v. FLRA, </em>659 F.2d 1140, 1144-47 (D.C.Cir.1981), and need not be rehearsed in detail here. It is sufficient for present purposes to observe the principal organizational changes effected by this landmark legislation, for it is the structural modification in the framework of civil service administration and management that bear most directly on our case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-14\">As is by now well known, the Civil Service Commission was dispatched by the CSRA; its various functions live on, however, divided among several new entities, including OPM, the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Office of Special Counsel. Of especial relevance to the inquiry before us, the new statute created the FLRA, an independent entity within the Executive Branch, with various enumerated functions in respect of labor-management relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-15\">Title VII of the CSRA is critical to our inquiry. It stands, in effect, as the new statutory charter establishing both the framework and the substantive law governing the relationship between labor and management in the federal civil service. The powers and duties of the Authority are set forth in section 701 of Title VII of the Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7105. Among those powers is the following: \u201cThe Authority shall provide leadership in establishing policies and guidance relating to matters under this chapter ....\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7105(a)(1). OPM, in contrast, is expressly mentioned in only one provision of Title VII, namely section 701(i), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7105(i). There, as part of the enumerated powers of the <em>Authority, </em>the FLRA is vested with discretionary powers to \u201crequest from the Director of [OPM] an advisory opinion concerning the proper interpretation of rules, regulations, or policy directives issued by [OPM] in connection with any matter before the Authority.\u201d OPM\u2019s responsibilities are thus nowhere to be found in the labor-management relations portion of the Act; rather, one must turn back to Title II of the statute to learn of OPM\u2019s duties, which pertain, in brief, to the personnel management functions previously carried out by the old Civil Service Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-17\">The complicating feature in this otherwise clearly delineated set of roles is Title VII\u2019s grandfather provision, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7135, a provision of pivotal importance to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1426\">*1426</page-number>the resolution of this case. One part of that section, which is set out in the text below in Part II of our opinion, expressly mandates that the pre-CSRA slate was not to be wiped clean. Quite to the contrary, the statute in the clearest of terms kept alive <em>en toto </em>the pre-CSRA regime, including Executive Orders and decisions under those orders by the old Federal Labor Relations Council, unless the President revised or revoked those orders or unless those \u201c[p]olicies, regulations, ... procedures ... and decisions\u201d were \u201csuperseded by specific provisions of this chapter.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As we will now see, this case turns on whether Congress has superseded by means of <em>specific provisions </em>a policy guidance and advisory function which OPM, as successor in this respect to the Civil Service Commission, has sought to continue through its proposed issuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-6\">We pause briefly at the threshold to analyze whether the issue of OPM authority to publish the Federal Personnel Manual (\u201cFPM\u201d) issuance is ripe for judicial resolution. OPM has, after all, not actually promulgated the new guidelines; it has, instead, twice published in the Federal Register a notice of its intention to publish an FPM issuance \u201con management rights, consultation and scope of bargaining policy in labor-management relations.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Litigation erupted almost instantly, as the National Treasury Employees Union (\u201cNTEU\u201d) was in court within less than a week of the publication of the first notice in the Federal Register. Since nothing had happened beyond publication of a notice of OPM\u2019s intent to take action, the District Court went to some lengths to analyze whether OPM\u2019s action was ripe for review. Concluding that the well-established test of ripeness laid down originally in <em>Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 136, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967), was satisfied, Memorandum Opinion at 7-11, <em>reprinted in </em>NTEU J.A. at 82, 88-92, the District Court emphasized that OPM\u2019s intention to publish guidelines in substantially the form set forth in the two notices of March 30, 1983 and July 14, 1983, squarely presented for resolution the legal issue \u201cwhether OPM has authority to issue the policy guidance as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. It was that pivotal legal issue which, the court concluded, was ripe for review. We agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion, <em>see Independent Bankers Ass\u2019n of America v. Smith, </em>534 F.2d 921, 927-29 (D.C.Cir.1976), and move on to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-13\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-14\">Section 25(a) of Executive Order (\u201cE.O.\u201d) 11,491, as amended, provides in pertinent part that \u201c[t]he Office of Personnel Management, in conjunction with the Office of Management and Budget, shall establish and maintain a program for <em>the policy guidance of agencies on labor-management relations </em>in the Federal Service and periodically review the implementation of these policies.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Exee.Order No. 11,491 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1427\">*1427</page-number>\u00a7 25(a), 8 C.F.R. 861, 874-75 (1966-70 Comp.), <em>as amended by </em>Exec.Order No. 11,616, 3 C.F.R. 605, 609 (1971-75 Comp.), <em>as amended by </em>Exec.Order No. 12,107, 44 Fed.Reg. 1055, 1063 (1979) (emphasis added). This language, if still in effect, would plainly give OPM the authority to issue the proposed policy guidance. Under the grandfather provision of Title VII, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7135(b), this authority remains in effect, as we have seen in the prior discussion, unless it has been \u201csuperseded by <em>specific provisions </em>of this chapter or by regulations or decisions issued pursuant to this chapter\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *(emphasis added). Thus, for appellants to prevail, they must identify a \u201cspecific provisionf ]\u201d of the CSRA that supersedes E.O. 11,491.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1513-4\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b1513-5\">In their survey of the statutory landscape, appellants argue that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7105(a)(1) fits this bill. That provision, as we have observed, mandates that \u201c[t]he Authority shall <em>provide leadership in establishing policies and guidance </em>relating to matters under this chapter, and, except as otherwise provided, shall be responsible for carrying out the purpose of this chapter\u201d (emphasis added). Appellants maintain that this language confers upon the FLRA exclusive control of policy guidance with respect to federal labor-management relations, so that the Authority occupies the field entirely, as it were, to the exclusion of OPM.</p>\n<p id=\"b1513-11\">The problem with this argument is that \u00a7 7105(a)(1) does not explicitly state that <em>only </em>the FLRA shall engage in such guidance. To the contrary, the requirement that the FLRA \u201cshall provide leadership\u201d implies that other entities may be involved in providing policy guidance. In a word, the statutory language itself does not connote exclusivity, and does not, on its face, appear to satisfy the express statutory requirement of a specific superseding provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1513-12\">Appellants do not, however, ground their position on the statutory language alone. They repair, rather, to the legislative history and contend that a careful examination of the structure and purpose of the CSRA, in light of the Act\u2019s history, leads inexorably to the conclusion that the FLRA was given exclusive dominion over policy guidance in federal labor-management relations. In support of this argument, appellants rely heavily upon the history of the key provision in this case, \u00a7 7105(a)(1). The unions emphasize that when the CSRA was first presented to Congress in 1978, the Administration proposed, and the Senate adopted, a provision with respect to the FLRA\u2019s power which did not charge the FLRA with a policy guidance role.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In its</p>\n<p id=\"b1514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1428\">*1428</page-number>report on this section, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1514-4\">[T]he Authority\u2019s powers and duties are to prescribe and interpret this subchap-ter, decide major policy issues, prescribe regulations needed to administer its functions, and disseminate information relating to its operations. Similar powers and duties are assigned to the Federal Labor Relations Council under Executive Order 11491. <em>Under this provision, the Authority will not advise or issue policy guidance to agencies, which role will rest with the Office of Personnel Management. </em>Likewise, the Authority is not authorized to advise the President other than the normal role of agencies to suggest necessary and desired changes in legislation. Also, the Authority, like the Council, will not issue advisory opinions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1514-5\">S.Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 99-100 (1978), U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Admin.News 1978, pp. 2723, 2821-22 (emphasis added), <em>reprinted in </em>Legislative History, <em>supra </em>note 6, at 740, 759-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b1514-6\">In contrast to the Senate-passed bill, the House passed a different version, which vested the FLRA with a leadership role in federal labor-management relations policy. H.R. 11,280, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. \u00a7 7105(a), 124 Cong.Rec. 29,221, 29,245, <em>reprinted in </em>Legislative History, <em>supra </em>note 6, at 970. The House Report on this section, in what appellants deem a critical omission, made no mention of a policy guidance role for OPM. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1403, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 42, <em>reprinted in </em>Legislative History, <em>supra </em>note 6, at 675, 688. The House version was eventually, passed by the entire Congress and became what is now \u00a7 7105(a)(1). From this sequence, appellants maintain that Congress\u2019 embracing the House version, as opposed to the Senate version, demonstrates that Congress rejected any policy guidance role for OPM.</p>\n<p id=\"b1514-10\">Going beyond the specific development of the statute as ultimately enacted, appellants argue that Congress\u2019 rejection of a policy guidance and advisory role for OPM becomes manifest when the CSRA is viewed as a whole. In their view, \u201c[t]he Civil Service Reform Act is so comprehensive a treatment of the personnel functions to be performed by the various newly created agencies, and so complete a description of the labor-management program established therein, that it is incomprehensible how it could be read to leave any matter to be governed by the terms of the superceded executive order.\u201d Federal/Postal/Retiree (\u201cF/P/R\u201d) Coalition Brief at 19. Specifically, appellants emphasize that OPM\u2019s duties and responsibilities are enumerated in Title II of the CSRA, codified as Part II, of the 1978 landmark legislation. FLRA\u2019s duties are set forth not in Title II but, as we have seen, in an entirely different part of the statute, namely Title VII, codified in Part III, Subpart F. Title VII, which governs labor-management relations, is silent with respect to OPM, save for the solitary provision authorizing the FLRA to request advisory opinions from the Director of OPM. From this, appellants argue that when OPM is in fact granted authority to issue regulations or implement certain personnel-related functions, that authority is specifically stated in the statute,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> thus making the omission of any grant of authority to OPM in Title VII highly significant in divining Congress\u2019 intent. Furthermore, appellants contend that whenever interplay between agencies was contemplated by Congress in its overhauling of the civil service laws, the precise roles of those agencies were delineated in the CSRA,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but critically, in appellants\u2019 view, no such provision for interplay exists between OPM and the FLRA (except, again, for the FLRA\u2019s power to solicit advisory opinions from OPM).</p>\n<p id=\"b1515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1429\">*1429</page-number>This line of reasoning leads appellants to the conclusion that \u201c[i]f the language and history of the Act, and of the labor management Statute which it contains, demonstrate anything, it is that Congress intended to pass a comprehensive measure, and that the compromises and concessions as to the nature of the labor management program were incorporated in that measure.\u201d F/P/R Coalition Brief at 19.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1515-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b1515-6\">These arguments suffer from two major flaws. <em>First, </em>it is highly doubtful that a combination of implications of and inferences from the legislative history, coupled with the structure of the CSRA, could add up to the \u201cspecific provisions\u201d of law expressly required under \u00a7 7135(b) to supersede the Executive Order\u2019s* regime. While expressions of congressional intent are obviously germane in determining the authority which agencies enjoy under a statute, Congress has clearly provided that in determining whether OPM\u2019s authority</p>\n<p id=\"b1515-9\">under the Executive Order has been circumscribed, we are to look to the language of the CSRA. As we have seen, we find when we examine that language no provision which directly limits OPM\u2019s authority in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1515-10\"><em>Second, </em>even if the statute\u2019s legislative history could supply a \u201cspecific provision\u201d within the meaning of the CSRA, the legislative history, when viewed as a whole, fails to yield the conclusion that Congress intended OPM to have no role in advising agencies on labor-management relations. In our view,' the history of \u00a7 7105(a)(1), fairly viewed, does not reveal any \u201crejection\u201d of such a role for OPM. By adopting the House version, Congress clearly rejected the proposition \u2014 embodied in the Senate bill \u2014 that the FLRA would have <em>no </em>policy guidance role. But to confer authority upon the FLRA to provide guidance and advice to Executive Branch agencies is one thing; it is quite another to conclude that Congress thereby meant to reject the Senate\u2019s contemplation that OPM would have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1430\">*1430</page-number>policy guidance role, especially since this \u201ccontemplation\u201d was not written into the language of the Senate bill. It was, rather, only part of the Senate report. It simply goes too far to suggest that we should interpret the rejection of a particular section of a proposed bill so as to work a rejection of every concept in a legislative <em>report </em>on that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b1516-4\">Moreover, having OPM and the FLRA act as co-occupants of this field is not, as appellants would have it, illogical or inconsistent. Quite to the contrary, if OPM were entirely deprived of a policy guidance role, a gap would exist as to policy advice being provided to federal agencies. Under its regulations, the FLRA will not, without exception, provide policy guidance to an agency which request it. Indeed, the Authority \u201cordinarily will not consider a request [for policy guidance] related to any matter pending before the Authority.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2427.2(b). Plainly, it could be quite some time before a matter pending before the Authority is fully and finally resolved by that entity, and in the interim federal agencies would be left to their own devices, deprived of policy advice in such matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1516-5\">But more is at issue than a gap in the advice-giving function. At bottom, the FLRA is not designed to provide agencies with the same sort of guidance that OPM can appropriately furnish. The FLRA, after all, is an independent and bipartisan body, which represents neither labor nor management;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> it carries on adjudicatory functions analogous to those discharged by the NLRB.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A neutral adjudicatory entity such as the FLRA is certainly able to and does provide advice, but it can scarcely remain neutral while wearing the quite different hat of a management consultant to the federal administrative agencies. If the Authority attempted to act, as it were, as a management consultant, the Authority would be stepping out of its role of a neutral third-party when acting in its adjudicatory capacity.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1516-12\">Appellants claim, in effect, that under the CSRA the federal administrative agencies are not to have a management consultant in regard to labor-management relations \u2014 at least in the form of OPM \u2014 inasmuch as the Act \u201cimposes responsibility for collective bargaining directly on federal agency heads, who are answerable only to the FLRA and courts for their decisions.\u201d NTEU Brief at 14. But OPM\u2019s issuance does not remove from agencies one whit of their authority \u2014 or their duty \u2014 to bargain or otherwise comply with the CSRA\u2019s strictures; to the contrary, the FPM issuance emphasizes \u201cthat agencies should fully recognize their obligation to bargain and should carefully, and in good faith, consider all serious proposals presented in ne<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1431\">*1431</page-number>gotiations.\u201d 48 Fed.Reg. 32,276 (1983).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Appellants demur on this point, contending that OPM enjoys such significant, practical control over agencies in personnel matters that agency heads would not dare stray from the path that OPM has laid out. But this does not alter the undisputed fact that OPM\u2019s advice is precisely that \u2014 advice\u2014 and will not tie the hands of agencies in carrying out their own statutorily imposed duties under the CSRA.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1517-5\">The foregoing analysis demonstrates that the history and structure of the CSRA are not, as appellants would have it, of crystalline clarity in delimiting the respective roles of FLRA and OPM in the policy guidance area.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Without such clarity, we are unable to conclude that a \u201cspecific provision\u201d exists in Title VII that supersedes OPM\u2019s continuing authority under E.O. 11,-491.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1517-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1512-7\">. The importance of the pre-1978 regime is illustrated by the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis and decision in <em>BATF v.

The notice also stated that \u201cthe issuance will constitute policy guidance\u201d and was accordingly not subject to the notice and comment provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(3) (1977). The District Court agreed with the agency\u2019s determination in this respect, as do we. Policy guidance, which the proposed issuance would be, is precisely that \u2014 guidance. It is not mandatory, regardless of its \"persuasive authority\u2019 or, as appellants put it more colorfully at oral argument, its genesis in the halls of \u201cBig Brother.\" As is usually the case, sloganeering is an inadequate substitute for analysis; we are simply unable to divine in what manner, assuming the power that persuasiveness may have, guidance, is, in law, transformed into a directive. We should also observe in this respect that NTEU, the appellant in No. 84-5057, does not on appeal advance the APA procedural arguments embraced by the appellants in No. 84-5040. <em>But see </em>NTEU Complaint f 12, NTEU J.A. at 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1512-16\">.

Ford, a principal author of Title VII, stated on April 21, 1983, that Congress did not give OPM the power to issue policy guidance to Federal agencies on labor-management relations. Affidavit of Mary E. Jacksteit, F/P/R Coalition J.A. 100, 101. Finally, on Nov. 14, 1983, Congress passed H.J. Res. 413, which, <em>inter alia, </em>appeared to prohibit OPM from implementing its policy guidelines in fiscal year 1984. Further Continuing Appropriations for Fiscal Year 1984, Pub.L. No. 98 \u2014 151, \u00a7\u00a7 101(f), 140, 97 Stat. 964, 973, 982 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1515-8\">These subsequent legislative actions do not demonstrate that Congress, when it passed the CSRA, intended that only the FLRA engage in policy guidance. As a general rule, subsequent statements by members of Congress do not constitute reliable evidence as to what Congress intended in the past. Moreover, it may be that other members of Congress would disagree with the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee. We do not and cannot know. The Committee comments were not attached to any legislation requiring the approval of the entire House. Only subsequent legislative actions that clearly demonstrate congressional intent, such as a long period of acquiescence in a practice of which Congress was aware, <em>see Bob Jones University v. United States, </em>461 U.S. 574, 597-601, 103 S.Ct. 2017, 2032-33, 76 L.Ed.2d 157 (1983), or subsequent legislation declaring the intent of earlier legislation, <em>see Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, </em>395 U.S. 367, 380-81, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 1801-02, 23 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969), properly guides a court's statutory interpretation. A longstanding interpretation placed on the CSRA by the FLRA would have great weight, <em>see NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., </em>416 U.S. 267, 274-75, 94 S.Ct. 1757, 1761-62, 40 L.Ed.2d 134 (1974), but it appears that the FLRA has not addressed the question whether it has an exclusive role in policy guidance. The wisest course in this case is for us to rely upon the language of the CSRA and, secondarily, its accompanying legislative history.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1516-6\">. \"[T]he [Civil Service] Reform Act replaced the Federal Labor Relations Council, which had been criticized as \u2018defective\u2019 because its members \u2018come exclusively from the ranks of management,\u2019 with an independent and bipartisan FLRA.\u201d <em>Dep't of Defense v. FLRA, </em>659 F.2d 1140, 1145 (D.C.Cir.1981) (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1516-7\">. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>BATF v. FLRA, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 439, 442, 78 L.Ed.2d 195 (1983), the Authority\u2019s role \u201cis analogous to that of the National Labor Relations Board in the private sector.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1516-10\">. In fact, much of the impetus for establishing the FLRA was to provide a neutral adjudicatory body independent of the influences of management reflected in the composition of the old Federal Labor Relations Council. <em>See supra </em>note 10. We note in this respect, however, that the District Court was not entirely correct in stating that \"FLRA\u2019s role is that of an adjudicator while OPM's role is that of an advisor.\u201d Memorandum Opinion at 14, <em>reprinted in </em>NTEU J.A. at 82, 95. It is clearly contemplated by \u00a7 7105(a)(1) that FLRA will have a role, indeed a <em>leadership role, </em>in providing policy guidance. <em>See BATF v. FLRA, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 439, 442, 78 L.Ed.2d 195 (1983) (\u2018\u2018In addition to its adjudicatory functions, the Authority may engage in formal rulemaking, \u00a7 7134, and is specifically required to 'provide leadership in establishing policies and guidance relating to matters\u2019 arising under the Act, \u00a7 7105(a)(1).\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1517-6\">. Appellants vigorously complain that OPM has stepped out of bounds in another respect by virtue of the contents of the proposed issuance. While acknowledging OPM's authority to publish, say, an informational brochure for federal managers setting forth in neutral fashion the terms of the statute, appellants contend that the proposed issuance constitutes an assault on important areas clearly within FLRA\u2019s cognizance. For example, appellants point to the admonition in the notice that matters held negotiable by the FLRA but which are under judicial challenge should not be deemed subjects of collective bargaining by the agencies. NTEU Brief at 19. The F/P/R Coalition points to a number of other matters in which, in their view, OPM\u2019s admonitions fly in the teeth of FLRA\u2019s decisions to the contrary. F/P/R Coalition Brief at 29-37. The upshot of all this, appellants argue, is that OPM is seeking to subvert the FLRA\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1517-7\">The answer to this contention does not lie in a case-by-case comparison of each cited instance of an asserted FLRA-OPM conflict. That is far beyond the scope of matters appropriately within the bounds of this litigation. Rather, the answer lies in the nature of OPM\u2019s action; it is, on its face and as the District Court found, advisory in nature. It is not a mandate or a directive to agencies to do anything, much less an order for them to disobey the law. And even as to the matters which appellants find so destructive of the FLRA\u2019s authority, namely the recommendation that agencies refuse to obey challenged actions of the FLRA while those matters are on appeal, appellants have pointed to nothing that renders such advice unlawful. Whether the advice is seemly or promotive of respect for the FLRA are not questions which the courts are positioned to adjudge, unless Congress directs us to do so. We do not sit to referee squabbles over assertedly competing advice and guidance, even advice and guidance that may appear contradictory; we simply carry out our more limited function of determining whether OPM has legal authority to render such advice and guidance, regardless of the wisdom or correctness of that advice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1517-12\">. Patrick S. Korten, Assistant Director for Policy and Communications of OPM, averred that the issuance was \"precatory and will not bind Federal agencies in the manner of a regulation.\u201d Affidavit of Patrick S. Korten, NTEU J.A. 46, 47.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1517-13\">. To be sure, courts should not indulge in rigidly literal interpretation of statutes at the expense of achieving that which Congress plainly sought to effectuate. <em>Cf. Johnson v. United States, </em>163 Fed. 30, 32 (1st Cir.1908) (\u201d[I]t is not an adequate discharge of duty for courts to say [to the Legislature]: We see what you are driving at, but you have not said it, and therefore we shall go on as before.\u201d). But it simply is not, as appellants would have it, plain that Congress was seeking to sweep OPM entirely off the field in providing advice in this area to the administrative agencies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1517-14\">. Appellants in No. 84-5040 also argue that OPM\u2019s action runs afoul of separation of powers principles. In their view, OPM poached on the territory of two Article I entities, namely the Library of Congress and the Government Printing Office, inasmuch as those two entities are deemed \u201cagencies\u201d under the statute. F/P/R Coalition Brief at 44-46. We find this argument unavailing in that OPM is simply providing guidance to the two agencies.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
