This Court subsequently stayed the district court order. The stay remains in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-9\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-10\">The June 11, 1984, contempt order arises from two unrelated cases, <em>Trickel v. Schweiker, </em>No. C 82-3087 (N.D.Iowa) and <em>Dervore v. Heckler, </em>No. C 83-2040 (N.D. Iowa). In both cases, Judge McManus found that the Social Security Administration had improperly dealt with plaintiffs\u2019 complaints of pain and remanded for further proceedings. Upon receipt of the order of remand, the Appeals Council referred each case to an administrative law judge (AU), directing the AU to follow the court\u2019s order of remand, but also reminding the AU to follow social security regulations, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1528, 404.-1529, and Ruling 82-58 concerning the role of pain in determining disability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1069-14\">On March 23, 1984, prior to final action by the Appeals Council on remand, Trickel and Devore filed a motion for the order to show cause at issue here. They alleged that the Secretary refused to follow the court\u2019s order on remand, citing the instructions to the AU by the Appeals Council. On June 11, 1984, the district court entered the show cause order, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-15\">The court has reviewed the content of these instructions and believes they may not be in accord with its orders * * *. It is fundamental that the power of a court to make an order carries with it the power to enforce that order and \u201cthe inquiry as to the question of disobedience has been, from time immemorial, the special function of the court.\u201d <em>In re Debs, </em>158 U.S. 564, 594, 15 S.Ct. 900, 910, 39 L.Ed. 1092 (1895). <em>See also </em>18 U.S.C., \u00a7 401(3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1069-16\">On June 14, 1984, after the trial court\u2019s issuance of the June 11 show cause order, the Appeals Council adopted the recommended decision of the AU of May 7,1984, and the Appeals Council entered an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>awarding benefits to claimant Trickel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In entering that order, the Appeals Council rejected the AU\u2019s recommendation that benefits be denied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1070-4\">On July 17, 1984, this Court entered an order in <em>Polaski v. Heckler, </em>739 F.2d 1320 (8th Cir.1984), in which we recited that the plaintiffs and the Secretary had entered into a settlement agreement in that class action, which purported to state the law concerning the evaluation of pain and other subjective complaints for determining disability. We stated in the order that the stipulation correctly stated the law and was to be followed in all administrative and judicial proceedings within the Eighth Circuit. On October 9, 1984, the President signed the Social Security Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984 (1984 Act), Pub.L. No. 98-460, 98 Stat. 1794 (1984), which set forth the standard for evaluating pain and other subjective complaints. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3(a). We filed a final opinion in the <em>Polaski </em>case today in which we reiterated the view that the settlement agreement correctly sets forth the case law and is fully consistent with the 1984 Act. <em>Polaski v. Heckler, </em>No. 84-5085, 751 F.2d 943, 950-951 (8th Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-5\">In the light of this Court\u2019s order of July 17, 1984, its opinion of December 31, 1984, and the 1984 Act, the controversy surrounding the Secretary\u2019s action has been resolved and a finding of contempt would be inappropriate. We are confident that the district court will on receipt of this order vacate its June 11, 1984 order. If not, the Secretary is free to renew her petition to this Court which we will handle on an expeditious basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-6\">We deny the petition for the writ for the reasons stated and remand to the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1069-11\">. The instructions to the AU were as follows: The administrative law judge is directed to follow the procedures described in the Court\u2019s order of remand; however, the administrative law judge is reminded that Social Security Administration Regulations 404.1529 and Ruling 82-58 direct that pain is a symptom, not an impairment. While an individual\u2019s symptoms, including pain, are an important element in the evaluation of disability, and the Social Security Act and regulations require that an individual's own description of symptoms (including pain and limitations) be considered along with pertinent signs and laboratory findings shown in the record, Sections 404.1528 and 404.1529 of Social Security Regulations No. 4 and Sections 416.928 and 416.-929 of Regulations No. 16 specifically provide that an individual\u2019s statements alone are not enough to establish that there is a severe mental or physical impairment. A finding of \"disabled,\u201d therefore, must not be based on symptoms unless medical signs or findings show that there is a severe medical condition which could be reasonably expected to produce the symptoms and the degree of symptomatology alleged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1070-7\">. In his affidavit attached to this petition, Frank V. Smith III, Associate Commissioner for Hearings and Appeals, represents that the SSA would also be prepared, upon Trickel\u2019s request, to reinstitute his benefits from January 1983, through June 1984.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1070-18\">. The Appeals Council had earlier rejected the AU\u2019s recommended decision on remand adverse to Trickel and directed that the case be reviewed in accordance with Eighth Circuit law. This first rejection occurred after claimants made their motion for an order to show cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
