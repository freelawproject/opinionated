In April, 1983, the debtors in both proceedings filed an amended consolidated plan of reorganization, the Debtors\u2019 Plan. In essence, the Debtors\u2019 Plan calls for continued ownership of the nursing home by the Koelbls and the payment to creditors over an eight-year period. Various creditors specifically rejected the Debtors\u2019 Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-25\">At the same time that the debtors submitted their proposal, Charles Glessing, a creditor and former administrator of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>nursing home, proposed a competing plan pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1121 (1982), the Glessing Plan. Under the Glessing Plan, Mr. Glessing would buy the nursing home, and the proceeds from his purchase would be used to make a substantial down payment to creditors. The Glessing Plan received approval by vote from most of the classes of creditors. One class, however, representing the secured claims of a law firm, did not cast a vote for or against the plan, although the plan provides for full payment of the claims of this class. The classes representing the debtors\u2019 interests rejected the Glessing Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of New York, Justin J. Mahoney, Bankruptcy Judge, rejected the Debtors\u2019 Plan and confirmed the Gless-ing Plan. The United States District Court for the Northern District of New York, Roger J. Miner, Judge, affirmed the Bankruptcy Court order. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Appellants offer two challenges to the confirmation of the Glessing Plan. First, they argue that the Glessing Plan should not have been confirmed because it was proposed in violation of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(a), which provides that \u201c[t]he court shall confirm a plan only if ... (3) [t]he plan has been proposed in good faith and not by any means forbidden by law.\u201d We accept the debtors\u2019 argument that \u201cmeans forbidden by law\u201d refers inter alia to state law. <em>See In re Landau Boat Co., </em>13 Bankr. 788, 794 (Bankr.W.D.Mo.1981); 5 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>\u00b6 1129.02, at 1129-13 (15th ed. 1984) (\u201c[Ejection 1129(a)(3) requires that the proposal of the plan comply with all applicable law, not merely the bankruptcy law.\u201d). Nevertheless, we decline appellants\u2019 invitation to extend the duty of loyalty under New York law to prohibit a debtor\u2019s former employee from proposing a reorganization plan that transfers ownership to the employee. There is no evidence that Glessing violated the principal duty of an employee by using any confidential information or trade secrets acquired during employment to propose his own plan. <em>See Ability Search, Inc. v. Lawson, </em>556 F.Supp. 9, 15 (S.D.N.Y.1981), <em>aff'd mem., </em>697 F.2d 287 (2d Cir.1982); <em>McLean v. Hubbard, </em>24 Misc.2d 92, 96-97, 194 N.Y.S.2d 644, 649 (1959), <em>aff'd mem., </em>11 A.D.2d 1084, 208 N.Y.S.2d 443 (1960). And Glessing\u2019s proposal cannot be equated with other conduct New York\u2019s courts have held violative of an employee\u2019s duty of loyalty, such as secretly outbidding the employer on its lease, <em>see Rand Tea &amp; Coffee Stores, Inc. v. Lebowitz, </em>118 N.Y.S.2d 51, 52 (Sup.Ct. 1952) (Steuer, J.), or conspiring to take over the employer\u2019s business, <em>see Duane Jones Co. v. Burke, </em>306 N.Y. 172, 187-88, 117 N.E.2d 237, 245 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">We also reject appellants\u2019 contention that the Glessing Plan was not proposed in good faith. This court has defined the good faith standard in the bankruptcy context as requiring a showing that the plan was proposed with \u201chonesty and good intentions\u201d and with \u201ca basis for expecting that a reorganization can be effected.\u201d <em>Manati Sugar Co. v. Mock, </em>75 F.2d 284, 285 (2d Cir.1935); <em>see also In re Cyr Bros. Meat Packing, Inc., </em>2 B.R. 620, 626 (Bankr. D.Me.1980) (\u201cFull disclosure is the very essence of the obligation imposed by the requirement of good faith.\u201d). For example, good faith has been found to be lacking if the plan was proposed for ulterior motives. <em>See, e.g., Gonzalez Hernandez v. Borgos, </em>343 F.2d 802, 805 (1st Cir.1965) (\u201c[A] Chapter XII proceeding may not be used as a vehicle to place a debtor\u2019s assets beyond the reach of his dependent children.\u201d); <em>In re Weathersfield Farms, Inc., </em>14 B.R. 572, 574 (Bankr.D.Vt.1981) (bankruptcy cannot be used to thwart foreclosure); 5 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy, supra, </em>\u00b6 1129.02, at 1129.-15. Moreover, the district court\u2019s finding of good faith will not be overturned unless the opponent of the plan can show that the finding was clearly erroneous. <em>See In re Bermec Corp., </em>445 F.2d 367, 368-69 (2d Cir.1971). Appellants certainly have not satisfied that burden here. There is no evidence that Mr. Glessing was dishonest in any way or that his plan has little chance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>of success. <em>Cf In re Flushing Mall Co., </em>7 B.R. 277, 281 (S.D.N.Y.1980) (noting that rehabilitation of the debtor is not a factor in determining good faith).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Second, appellants argue that the Glessing Plan is not \u201cfair and equitable\u201d as required by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(b), containing the so-called \u201ccram down\u201d power. <em>See </em>5 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy, supra, </em>\u00b6 1129.03, at 1129-47. Appellants claim that they are unfairly prejudiced by the waiver of prior status, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 507(a)(6), in respect to claims for taxes by the Internal Revenue Service and the State of New York, since the taxes are nondischargeable. Even if we were to assume that a junior creditor could claim that a plan is not \u201cfair and equitable\u201d because somehow a waiver of priority status by a senior creditor operated to prejudice his claims, an assumption that seems unlikely if not inconceivable, the assumption would not aid appellants. The \u201cfair and equitable\u201d requirement does not look toward protection of debtor interests, but rather toward protection of dissenting creditor interests, absent the value of the ongoing business being large enough to support protection of the debtors. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 989, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 128 (1978), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 5787; H.R.Rep. No. 595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 413 (1977), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin:News 1978, p. 5963; 5 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy, supra, </em>\u00b6 1129.03, at 1129-56, 1129-59. Thus, even though the debtors are prejudiced by the Glessing Plan insofar as it diverts some $32,000 of taxes entitled to priority to the payment of unsecured claims, leaving them with the taxes owed and outstanding after bankruptcy, appellants cannot complain. Finally, since appellants fail to raise other questions about the Glessing Plan \u2014 such as whether the $100 payment to an equity claim is improper under \u00a7 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii) where an objecting unsecured interest claim remains impaired or whether the plan is discriminatory \u2014 we decline to address these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
