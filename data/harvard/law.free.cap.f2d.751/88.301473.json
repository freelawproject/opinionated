Trans Union had loaned Alitho-chrome the money with which it purchased the presses, and in return had taken purchase money security interests in them. The presses were installed at the plant of General Offset Printing Co., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alithochrome, located in Springfield, Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-15\">After a two-day bench trial, the bankruptcy court (Ryan, Judge) held that Ali-thochrome maintained a \u201cplace of business\u201d in Springfield, Massachusetts as that term is used in Mass.U.C.C. \u00a7 9-401 (West 1982) , <em>see </em>31 B.R. 352 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y. 1983) . Accordingly, the court found that Trans Union\u2019s failure to file a U.C.C. Form 1 financing statement in the office of the Clerk of the City of Springfield rendered its security interests in the two presses unperfected. As a result, the security interests were voidable by Alithochrome, as a debtor-in-possession, pursuant to the \u201cstrong arm clause\u201d of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-18\">The decision of the bankruptcy court was affirmed by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Stewart, <em>Judge) </em>in a memorandum decision and order entered on July 10,1984, and Trans Union timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-19\">After a careful review of the record on appeal, we find Trans Union\u2019s claims of error to be wholly without merit. We believe ample evidence was adduced in the Bankruptcy Court to support a finding that Alithochrome maintained a \u201cplace of business\u201d at the plant of its subsidiary, General Offset. Accordingly, we affirm the order of the district court, essentially for the reasons set forth in its opinion, and in the thorough opinion of the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
