We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-19\">Appellees are directors of Northwest Rural Opportunities [NRO], a private, nonprofit organization. NRO is a grantee under Title III of CETA providing social services under contract with the Department of Labor. In late 1980 the owner of the building NRO rented as a site for training migrant and seasonal farmworkers informed appellees the building could no longer be rented and offered NRO an option to purchase. The contract between the Department and NRO required NRO to obtain the Department\u2019s approval before acquiring property for more than $300.00. Appellees used $32,000 of CETA funds, earmarked for \u201cspace,\u201d to place a down payment on the building without obtaining prior approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-20\">Appellees were indicted for \u201cwillfully misapplying\u201d the $32,000 in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 665(a). Appellees moved to dismiss because the indictment did not allege appellees had converted the funds to their own use or benefit. The government argued that benefit to a third party \u2014 here NRO \u2014 was sufficient. The district court agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-21\">After denying the motion to dismiss, the district court\u2019s memorandum order went on to note: \u201c[t]here is not even a hint that [appellees] either sought or realized any personal gain, nor is it contested acquisi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>tion of the subject property was designed to implement the efficient administration of CETA training functions.\u201d The court advised counsel that the court was \u201cinclined\u201d to rule that willful misapplication requires willful conversion with intent to defraud. Counsel was told to anticipate instructions that the government must demonstrate \u201csome measure of harm, injury, or deprivation.\u201d The court suggested that loss by the government of control of its funds might constitute sufficient deprivation, but that the government in addition must show defendants \u201cintended some measure of injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-5\">The government filed a response to the court\u2019s memorandum order. The government asserted that \u201cwillful misapplication\u201d did not require a specific intent to injure or defraud, and that the government \u201cwould not be able to produce any\u201d evidence suggesting \u201ca specific intent on behalf of the Defendants to injure the United States,\u201d but only evidence that appellants \u201cknowingly and willfully\u201d paid the down payment \u201cwith the knowledge that they were in violation of NRO\u2019s contract with the Department of Labor.\u201d Relying on the government\u2019s assertion, the district court dismissed the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-6\">CETA contains no prohibition against using grant money to purchase space or for other capital expenditures necessary to carry out CETA functions. The regulations governing the grant of funds to NRO do not require prior approval for capital expenditures. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 97.-210-97.280, 98.1-98.29a (1980).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is only NRO\u2019s operating contract with CETA that provides that NRO must obtain CETA\u2019s approval before using CETA funds to purchase capital items over $300. The government argues that use of funds in knowing violation of this contract provision is sufficient to constitute willful misapplication because it deprives CETA of the power to control the expenditure of its funds. We hold, with the district court, that the government must prove defendants intended not merely to deprive the government of control over the expenditure of funds, but also to injure or defraud the United States. The simple intent to use funds in a manner not fully in compliance with contract procedures is not alone sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-10\">In <em>Morissette v. United States, </em>342 U.S. 246, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952), the Supreme Court construed a similar statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641, which provides for punishment as a felon of \u201c[wjhoever embezzles, steals, purloins, or knowingly converts\u201d property of the United States. The Court held that in this context to \u201cknowingly convert\u201d required an intention <em>\u201cwrongfully </em>to deprive another of possession of property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 276, 72 S.Ct. at 256 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-11\">In a criminal statute, \u201cwillfully\u201d generally means a voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty in bad faith or with evil purpose. <em>See United States v. Pomponio, </em>429 U.S. 10, 11-12, 97 S.Ct. 22, 23-24, 50 L.Ed.2d 12 (1976) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Bishop, </em>412 U.S. 346, 360, 93 S.Ct. 2008, 2017, 36 L.Ed.2d 941 (1973). A general intent to commit the proscribed act is not enough; a specific intent to do something the law forbids is required. <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>631 F.2d 118, 119 (9th Cir.1980). The definition of \u201cmisapplication\u201d suggests a similar element: \u201c[ijmproper, illegal, wrongful, or corrupt use [or] application of funds, property, etc.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 901 (5th Ed. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-12\">The term \u201cwillfully misapply\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 665(a) is embedded in a series of words referring to harmful or wrongful acts clearly causing financial injury to the United States or impeding the achievement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>of CETA\u2019s goals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Morissette, </em>342 U.S. at 265-70, 72 S.Ct. at 250-54 (construing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641). All the acts prohibited by the statute are more serious in character than simple violations of procedural requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">On its face, the primary thrust of section 665 is the punishment of theft, embezzlement, or fraudulent conversion of CETA funds. The legislative history indicates that Congress intended these criminal provisions to reach embezzlement and obstruction of CETA investigations and \u201ckickbacks and similar schemes.\u201d <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 891, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 42-44, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 4522-23. Thus, the offenses specifically identified on the face of the statute and those that concerned Congress differ in kind from the procedural violation charged here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">CETA grants the Secretary of Labor extensive administrative authority to take corrective action if any provision of the statute or regulations is violated. \u201cIf the Secretary concludes that any recipient of funds under this Act is failing to comply with any provision of this Act or the regulations under this Act ... the Secretary shall have authority to terminate or suspend financial assistance in whole or in part and order such sanctions or corrective actions as are appropriate.\u201d <em>See </em>CETA Amendments of 1978, Section 106, 92 Stat. 1909, 1927 (1978) (repealed 1982) (previously codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 816(d)). This broad and flexible administrative authority to deal with administrative violations makes it unlikely that Congress in prohibiting \u201cwillful misapplication]\u201d of funds in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 665 intended to punish as felonies all departures from contract procedures in the funding process, however harmless and routine.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1150-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-13\">In concluding that section 665 requires a specific intent to injure or defraud the United States, the district court relied on the interpretation of the similarly-worded bank fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 656.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., United States v. Dreitzler, </em>577 F.2d 539, 548 (9th Cir.1978). The government argues the analogy is not compelling because precodification versions of section 656 explicitly required an intent to injure or defraud the bank, and the codifiers disclaimed any intention of changing the law. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 1620, 80th Cong., 2d Sess., 3, 4, <em>reprinted in </em>1948 U.S.Code Cong. Serv. 2429-30 (Title 18 United States Code, Crimes and Criminal Procedure). But this circumstance cuts against the government\u2019s reading of the statute. The only reason Congress could have considered the explicit requirement of a purpose to injure or defraud redundant was that Congress understood the term \u201cwillful misapplication\u201d to include such an intent by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-14\">The few opinions that have construed section 665 suggest that to willfully misapply funds requires more than the intent to use the funds without prior approval. The defendants in <em>United States v. Tamargo, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>637 F.2d 346 (5th Cir.1981), were convicted of willfully misapplying CETA funds to pay the salaries of their employees even though no training services were provided, and for periods far longer than reasonable for training purposes. In rejecting a constitutional vagueness challenge to the term \u201cwillfully misapplies,\u201d the court approved the trial court\u2019s instruction defining the offense to require a conversion or taking \u201cwith intent to defraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 350. <em>See also United States v. Pappas, </em>611 F.2d 399, 404 (1st Cir.1979) (\u201c[T]he question ... is ... whether a jury could reasonably find that [the facts] indicated dishonesty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-6\">The government having conceded a specific intent to injure or defraud the United States cannot be proven, an essential element of the offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 665 is lacking. Dismissal of the indictment is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1148-15\">. CETA has since been repealed, Pub.L. No. 97-300, Title I, \u00a7 184(a)(1), 96 Stat. 1357 (1982), and in many respects replaced by the Jobs Training Partnership Act, Pub.L. No. 97-300, 96 Stat. 1324 (1982), codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1501-1781.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1149-7\">. Section 97.255(f)(6)(ii) lists \"office space costs\u201d as allowable administrative costs. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 97.255(c) forbids the expenditure of funds for <em>new </em>construction, but the building involved here was old. Section 97.-213(b)(3)(i)(E) requires a grantee to provide an \u201citemized budget of allowable costs, as defined in \u00a7\u00a7 97.255 and 260\u201d in its funding request, but no issue is made that NRO failed to comply with this requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">.
