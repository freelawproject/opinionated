The cause is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-21\">This matter is before the court on plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cMotion to Remand to District Court with Instructions to Dismiss the Complaint as Moot and to Vacate Decision of District Court.\u201d The basis for this motion is plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the governmental actions complained of below have been satisfied by intervening state court pronouncements relating to the subject cable television permit and contract. We are not convinced, however, that the instant appeal has been rendered moot by the state court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-22\">Nevertheless, we do consider plaintiffs\u2019 papers filed in this court as compelling evidence of their lack of willingness to fully contest the issues on appeal. Therefore, we construe their motion to remand as a request for voluntary dismissal of the appeal under Fed.R.App.P. 42(b). As so construed, the motion is hereby granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-23\">DISMISSED. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
