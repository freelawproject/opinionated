The district judge based the dismissal on the Aguilars\u2019 failure to join an indispensable party, their son Jaime, whose join-der would defeat diversity jurisdiction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-26\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-27\">On August 2, 1983, appellants Rosa and Bardomiano Aguilar filed a medical mal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>practice suit against appellees County of Los Angeles, Los Angeles County/U.S.C. Medical Center, and several medical center employees (\u201cCounty\u201d). The Aguilars alleged that the County\u2019s negligence in providing medical care to their minor child, Jaime, caused him to sustain permanent brain damage. Under California Code of Civil Procedure (C.C.P.) \u00a7 376, which provides that parents may maintain an action for injury to their child, the Aguilars sought to recover pre-majority special damages for Jaime\u2019s injuries.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Aguilars alleged that they were citizens of Mexico and El Salvador and that the defendants were citizens of California and based the district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship. Their son Jaime, a California citizen, was not named as a plaintiff in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-4\">On August 3, 1983, Jaime Aguilar, through his guardian <em>ad litem, </em>Rosa Aguilar, filed an action in the Los Angeles Superior Court to recover post-majority special damages and general damages for injuries caused by the County\u2019s alleged negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">The County moved to dismiss the federal action pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(7), failure to join a party under Fed.R.Civ.P. 19. On October 24, 1983, the district court granted the motion to dismiss the complaint and action under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(7) for failure to join Jaime Aguilar, an indispensable party whose joinder would defeat diversity jurisdiction. Adopting the reasoning in <em>Lopez v. Martin Luther King, Jr. Hospital, </em>97 F.R.D. 24 (C.D.Cal.1983), the court found that Jaime Aguilar claimed an interest relating to the subject of the action and that disposition of the action in his absence could impair or impede his ability to protect that interest under the California law of collateral estoppel. The court also determined under Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that the County would be subject to a substantial risk of incurring inconsistent obligations because of Jaime\u2019s claimed interest, should the action continue without his joinder as a party. The court further found that, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(b), the actions and complaint should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-12\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 19 establishes a two-step analysis for determining who should be joined in a given action. The first step, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>set forth in subsection (a), determines which persons should be joined, if joinder is feasible. Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(a)(2), a person should be joined if he claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that disposition in his absence could impair that interest or subject the other parties to multiple or inconsistent liabilities. The second step of the Rule 19 analysis, set forth in subdivision (b), determines whether the action should be dismissed or proceed without the party if joinder is not feasible. Subsection (b) does not apply until the subsection (a) determinations are made. <em>Bakia v. County of Los Angeles, </em>687 F.2d 299, 301 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">This case turns on a Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(a)(2) determination whether Jaime has an interest in the subject of this action that could be impaired \u2014 and, if so, whether the action should have been dismissed under Fed.R. Civ.P. 19(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-6\">\n<em>Jaime Aguilar\u2019s Interest and Its Impairment; Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(a)(2)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-7\">The district court concluded that Jaime Aguilar had an interest in his parents\u2019 action that could be impaired under the California law of collateral estoppel. While Fed.R.Civ.P. 19 cases are generally reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard, <em>Bakia v. County of Los Angeles, </em>687 F.2d 299, 301 (9th Cir.1982), to the extent that the determination of Jaime\u2019s interest and its impairment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(a)(2) involved an interpretation of California collateral estoppel law, it is reviewed under a <em>de novo </em>standard. <em>In re McLinn, </em>739 F.2d 1395, 1397 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-8\">The doctrine of collateral estoppel, as interpreted in California law, bars parties, or those in privity with them, from relitigating any issue actually litigated, determined, and necessary to the disposition of a former proceeding. <em>In re Russell, </em>12 Cal.3d 229, 233, 115 Cal.Rptr. 511, 513, 524 P.2d 1295, 1297 (1974). Application of the collateral estoppel doctrine thus depends on an affirmative answer to three questions: (1) was the issue decided in the prior adjudication identical to the one presented in the action in question? (2) was there a final judgment on the merits? (3) was the party against whom the doctrine is asserted a party or in privity with a party to the prior adjudication? <em>Levy v. Cohen, </em>19 Cal.3d 165, 171, 137 Cal.Rptr. 162, 166, 561 P.2d 252, 256 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-10\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(a)(2) states that a person should be joined if disposition of the action in his absence <em>may </em>as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest. Although Jaime seeks to recover different damages (post-majority) from that of his parents (pre-majority), his right to recovery, like his parents\u2019, depends on a determination of the County\u2019s negligence. If his parents\u2019 suit is allowed to proceed, and the County is found non-negligent, Jaime may be collaterally es-topped from relitigating the issue of the County\u2019s negligence. Since a California court may find Jaime collaterally estopped from pursuing his own suit in state court, the district court here properly found him to have an interest in his parents\u2019 action that could be impaired if that action goes forward without him as a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-11\">The Aguilars contend that the district court erred. They maintain that the collateral estoppel doctrine is inapplicable here because Jaime is not in privity with them. Privity, they argue, \u201cinvolves a person so identified in interest with another that he represents the same legal right.\u201d <em>Zarago-sa v. Craven, </em>33 Cal.2d 315, 318, 202 P.2d 73, 76 (1949); <em>State Farm Ins. Co. v. Salazar, </em>155 Cal.App.2d 861, 865, 318 P.2d 210 (1957). The Aguilars contend that C.C.P. \u00a7 376 gives them a distinct and independent cause of action from Jaime\u2019s, and that they are therefore not in privity with Jaime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-12\">As support for their position, the Agui-lars rely on <em>Cortez v. County of Los Ange-les, </em>96 F.R.D. 427 (C.D.Cal.1983). <em>Cortez </em>involved a dismissal for non-joinder of an indispensable party in a fact situation identical to the one now before this court, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>identical to that in <em>Lopez v. Martin Luther King, Jr. Hospital, </em>97 F.R.D. 24 (C.D.Cal. 1983), the case the district court followed. In <em>Cortez, </em>the court refused to dismiss the parents\u2019 medical malpractice action based on diversity of citizenship for failure to join their injured son and concluded that the child had no legally protected interest in his parents\u2019 lawsuit. Like the Aguilars, the <em>Cortez </em>parents sued for pre-majority damages in federal court and the son sued for post-majority damages in state court. The court reasoned that the child would not be collaterally estopped from obtaining relief in state court because he and his parents asserted distinct legal rights to recovery and were therefore not in privity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">We affirm the district court\u2019s choice of the reasoning in <em>Lopez v. Martin Luther King, Jr. Hospital, </em>97 F.R.D. 24 (C.D. Cal.1983), rather than that in <em>Cortez v. County of Los Angeles, </em>96 F.R.D. 427 (C.D.Cal.1983). <em>Lopez </em>properly construed the Rule 19(a)(2) \u201cinterest\u201d requirement as not limited to a \u201clegal\u201d interest, but one to \u201cbe determined from a practical perspective, not through the adoption of strict legal definitions and technicalities.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>97 F.R.D. 24, 29 (C.D.Cal.1983). This reasoning is supported by ample authority. See <em>Provident Tradesmen\u2019s Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Patterson, </em>390 U.S. 102, 110, 88 S.Ct. 733, 738, 19 L.Ed.2d 936 (1968); <em>Kaplan v. International Alliance of Theatrical &amp; Stage Employees, </em>525 F.2d 1354, 1361 (9th Cir.1975); <em>Smith v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>633 F.2d 401, 405 (5th Cir.1980). The Aguilars\u2019 approach, which emphasizes the distinct legal causes of action asserted by parents and child, focuses on legal technicalities and runs contrary to the prevailing view that \u201cinterest\u201d under Rule 19 should be determined from a practical, and not technical, perspective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-6\">The Aguilars also rely on <em>Kaiser Foundation Hospital v. Superior Court, </em>254 Cal.App.2d 327, 62 Cal.Rptr. 330 (1967). <em>Kaiser </em>involved the collateral estoppel effect of a prior judgment on a subsequent suit brought against the same hospital. A husband and wife had sued defendant hospital for injuries caused to the wife and judgment was rendered for the hospital. After the wife\u2019s death, the husband and daughter brought a wrongful death action against the same hospital. The court held that because the daughter had a distinct cause of action, she was not in privity with a party to the first action and could not be collaterally estopped, though the husband could not sue again. <em>Kaiser, </em>254 Cal.App.2d 327, 333, 62 Cal.Rptr. 330, 333 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-8\"><em>Kaiser, </em>however, reflects outdated notions of privity under the California law of collateral estoppel. The concept of privity \u201chas been expanded ... to a relationship between the party to be estopped and the unsuccessful party in the prior litigation which is \u2018sufficiently close\u2019 so as to justify the application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>97 F.R.D. 24, 30 (C.D. Cal.1983); <em>Clemmer v. Hartford Ins. Co., </em>22 Cal.3d 865, 875, 151 Cal.Rptr. 285, 289, 587 P.2d 1098, 1102 (1978). <em>Lynch v. Glass, </em>44 Cal.App.3d 943, 948, 119 Cal. Rptr. 139, 143 (1975). For example, the California Supreme Court has applied the collateral estoppel doctrine to prevent children from relitigating an issue decided in a previous action brought by their mother. <em>Armstrong v. Armstrong, </em>15 Cal.3d 942, 126 Cal.Rptr. 805, 544 P.2d 941 (1976). As in <em>Armstrong, </em>a California court could well apply the collateral estoppel doctrine to bar Jaime\u2019s suit if his parents\u2019 suit is allowed to proceed and proves unsuccessful, since the underlying issue of the County\u2019s negligence is identical in both suits. <em>See Zara-gosa v. Craven, </em>33 Cal.2d 315, 202 P.2d 73 (1949) (fact that parties have different causes of action is immaterial, since underlying issue of liability is identical to both parties).</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-9\">The Aguilars assert that <em>Armstrong </em>involved only retroactive rights and not the prospective rights involved here, and that <em>Ruddock v. Ohls, </em>91 Cal.App.3d 271, 154 Cal.Rptr. 87 (1979), prevents application of the collateral estoppel doctrine when the prospective rights of a minor are involved. In <em>Ruddock, </em>the court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1094\">*1094</page-number>children were not collaterally estopped from relitigating the issue of paternity, although non-paternity had been established in a prior marital dissolution suit. <em>Id. </em>at 286, 154 Cal.Rptr. 87. However, <em>Ruddock </em>is distinguishable since it involved paternity, which the court described as \u201cthe most fundamental right the child possesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 277-78, 154 Cal.Rptr. 87. Moreover, a California court could ignore this prospective/retrospective distinction and apply the <em>Armstrong </em>court\u2019s reasoning to collaterally estop Jaime from pursuing his state action. Rule 19 speaks to <em>possible </em>harm, not only to certain harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">We conclude that Jaime should have been joined in his parents\u2019 action because under Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(a)(2), he has an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in his absence may impair or impede his ability to protect that interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-6\">\n<em>The Equity and Good Conscience Test Under Rule 19(b)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-7\">Since the district court properly determined that Jaime, having an interest in the subject of his parents\u2019 action that could be impaired under California collateral estop-pel law, should therefore be joined, if feasible, it was appropriate for the court to turn to Rule 19(b). Since Jaime could not be joined without destroying diversity jurisdiction, the district court dismissed the action rather than allow it to proceed without joinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-8\">The district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to join an indispensable party under Fed.R.Civ.P. 19 is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Walsh v. Centeio, </em>692 F.2d 1239, 1241 (9th Cir.1982); <em>Bakia v. County of Los Angeles, </em>687 F.2d 299, 301 (9th Cir.1982). The Aguilars are incorrect in their assertion that the district court\u2019s dismissal of their actions and complaint amounted to a summary judgment that is reviewable <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1180-9\">The district court had adequate grounds to find that each of the factors in Rule 19(b), which represent an attempt to balance the rights of all those affected by the litigation, mandated dismissal in this case. The Aguilars have an adequate alternative forum, state court, in which they can obtain relief. By having to defend two separate lawsuits turning on the same issues, the County would be subjected to multiple litigation and possibly inconsistent obligations. There is potential prejudice to Jaime, since he could be collaterally es-topped from pursuing his state action if his parents\u2019 suit is allowed to proceed and is unsuccessful. In light of these facts, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-12\">The district court correctly dismissed the action for non-joinder under Fed.R.Civ.P. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1177-6\">. California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 376 provides, in relevant part, as follows: \u201cThe parents of a legitimate unmarried minor child, acting jointly, may maintain an action for injury to such child caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1177-7\">. Fed.R.Civ.P. 19 provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-8\">Rule 19. Joinder of Persons Needed for Just Adjudication</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1177-9\">(a) Persons to be Joined if Feasible. A person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action shall be joined as a party in the action if (1) in his absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties, or (2) he claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in his absence may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of his claimed interest. If he has not been so joined, the court shall order that he be made a party.

I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-16\">I believe the majority, in adopting the reasoning in <em>Lopez v. Martin Luther King, Jr. Hospital, </em>97 F.R.D. 24 (C.D.Cal.1983), has put the cart before the horse. In <em>Lopez, </em>the district court stated what was believed to be the relevant inquiry as follows: \u201c[I]f there is a possibility that collateral estoppel will be applied by the California court, then it is axiomatic that the child has an interest in this action.\u201d 97 F.R.D. at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-17\">The majority in this case employed this exact reasoning, finding that this \u201cinterest\u201d determination is properly construed \u201c \u2018from a practical perspective, not through the adoption of strict legal definitions and technicalities.\u2019 \u201d (Opinion at p. 182, citing <em>Lopez v. Martin Luther King, Jr. Hospital, </em>97 F.R.D. at 29).</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-18\">While the question of joinder is one of federal procedure, in diversity cases the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>standards must be applied to the rights and interests that are derived from and defined by state law. <em>Provident Tradesmens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Patterson, </em>390 U.S. 102, 125 n. 22, 88 S.Ct. 733, 746 n. 22, 19 L.Ed.2d 936 (1968). In this case, section 376 of the California Code of Civil Procedure provides the Aguilars with a separate and independent cause of action from that asserted by Jaime in state court. <em>Faitz v. Ruegg, </em>114 Cal.App.3d 967, 971, 171 Cal.Rptr. 149, 150 (1981) (right to recover for loss of child\u2019s earnings and for medical expenses incurred in treating its injuries belongs to parent).</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-4\">To be sure, Jaime has an obvious financial stake in the outcome of his parents\u2019 action, but this cannot support the legally protected \u201cinterest\u201d required to invoke Rule 19(a). <em>See </em>3A <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>II 19.07 \u2014 1[2], at 19-129 (2d ed. 1982). \u201cIt is a misapplication of Rule 19(a) to add parties who are neither necessary nor indispensable, who are not essential for just adjudication and who have a separate cause of action entirely.\u201d <em>Bakia v. County of Los Angeles, </em>687 F.2d 299, 301 (9th Cir. 1982). Thus, the majority has used inverse reasoning to find Jaime\u2019s legally protected \u201cinterest\u201d in the instant action from mere speculation that collateral estoppel might be applied in Jaime\u2019s separate state court action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">Even assuming Jaime has the required interest in his parents\u2019 action, Rule 19(a) is satisfied only if the disposition of the action in his absence would either (i) as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest, or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of his claimed interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">This court concludes that \u201c[sjince a California court may find Jaime collaterally estopped from pursuing his own suit in state court, the district court here properly found him to have an interest in his parents\u2019 action that could be impaired if that action goes forward without him as a party.\u201d To the contrary, I agree with both the holding and reasoning of Judge Cynthia Holcomb Hall\u2019s decision in <em>Cortez v. County of Los Angeles, </em>96 F.R.D. 427 (C.D.Cal. 1983). Like <em>Lopez, </em>the facts in <em>Cortez </em>were identical to those present here. Judge Hall found the minor child in that case \u201ccould not be collaterally estopped by his parents\u2019 litigation of their distinct legal right to recovery.\u201d 96 F.R.D. at 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-9\">Here, the application of Rule 19 requires inquiry into the effect on Jaime of any relief granted to his parents, and whether \u201cas a practical matter\u201d such may \u201cimpair or impede his ability to protect his interest.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1181-10\">The language \u201cas a practical matter\u201d has a restrictive as well as an expansive side. Thus, the fact that the absent person may be bound by the judgment does not of itself require his joinder if his interests are fully represented by parties present, and the mere theoretical possibility of prejudice does not require join-der.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1181-11\">3A <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, </em>\u00b6 19.07-1[2-1], at 19-133 (2d ed. 1982) (footnotes omitted). As pointed out by Judge Hall, these parents, like those in <em>Cortez, </em>have every incentive to reach a result that will benefit their child\u2019s legal interest as well as their own. This is not a case where one party may do something to affect wrongfully the rights of a nonparty. All inferences point to the fact that these parents will vigorously do all they can to protect their child and make every argument Jaime would or could make if he were a party. Indeed, Rosa Aguilar is the appointed guardian ad litem in Jaime\u2019s state court action, charged with the responsibility to litigate that case in Jaime\u2019s best interests. To presume Jaime\u2019s interest will be prejudiced if this action is allowed to proceed without him as a party flies in the face of common sense and recognized familial bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-12\">In applying Rule 19 \u201ccourts must refrain from taking a view either too broad or too narrow in determining \u2018prejudicial\u2019 effect of a judgment. The watchwords of Rule 19 are \u2018pragmatism\u2019 and \u2018practicality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schutten v. Shell Oil Co., </em>421 F.2d 869, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1096\">*1096</page-number>874 (5th Cir.1970). \u201cRather the courts are urged to consider whether the absentee would be \u2018adversely affected in a practical sense, and if so, would the prejudice be immediate and serious, or remote and minor?\u2019 \u201d <em>Gottlieb v. Vaicek, </em>69 F.R.D. 672, 675 (N.D.Ill.1975), <em>aff'd, </em>544 F.2d 523 (7th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">The second prong of the Rule 19(a) inquiry would require Jaime\u2019s joinder if his absence would leave any of the parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple or otherwise inconsistent obligations. Following the reasoning of Judge Hall in <em>Cortez </em>and as set forth above, there is no risk of double or multiple liability to defendants in this case because Jaime\u2019s parents claim damages under their independent cause of action established by section 376 of the California Code of Civil Procedure. Thus, I conclude Jaime is not a person who should be joined in this action and, therefore, an analysis of whether the equities of the case require dismissal pursuant to Rule 19(b) is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-5\">I would adopt the decision of Judge Hall in <em>Cortez v. County of Los Angeles, </em>96 F.R.D. 427 (C.D.Cal.1983), and reverse the district court and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
