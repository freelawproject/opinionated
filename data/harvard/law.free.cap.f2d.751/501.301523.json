Carter, <em>Judge, </em>dismissing after a bench trial plaintiff-appellant Financial Information Inc.\u2019s complaint charging defendant-appel-lee Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. with copyright infringement and unfair competition. The court first found that the information gathered was copyrightable under the \u201ccompilation\u201d provision of the copyright law, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 (1982). Then, in dismissing the action, the district court found that the fair use doctrine, codified in 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107 (1982), shielded Moody\u2019s from liability on the federal copyright infringement allegations, and that there could be no unfair competition under state law since the parties were not competitors and because plaintiff could show no injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">One week after the judgment below was entered, the Supreme Court decided <em>Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 774, 78 L.Ed.2d 574 (1984), which now represents the leading exposition of the fair use doctrine. In light of <em>Sony, </em>and in view of other considerations discussed below, we reverse and hold that Moody\u2019s copying was not protected by the fair use doctrine. This holding on the federal cause of action necessarily entails a correlative holding that the state cause of action is preempted under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 (1982). But it also entails an examination of the copyrightability issue, as to which we wish further elaboration on the facts and reconsideration. We remand to the district court for such elaboration and reconsideration and a determination of damages, if that issue is reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">Financial Information Inc. (\u201cFII\u201d) is a publisher of financial information. It produces five separate works, including its \u201cFinancial Daily Called Bond Service,\u201d from which it alleges Moody\u2019s stole copyrighted material.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">FII\u2019s Financial Daily Called Bond Service (\u201cDaily Bond Cards\u201d) consists literally of packets of 4\" x 6\" index cards on which are printed information regarding municipal bonds which the issuer has elected to redeem, or \u201ccall.\u201d The information typically includes the identity of the issuing (and, of course, calling) municipal authority, the series of bonds being called, the date and price of the redemption, and the name of the trustee or paying agent to whom the bond should be presented for payment. FII obtains this information principally by having its employees read newspapers from all over the country, looking for and clipping the paid notices of calls that issuers place in the local press. Occasionally, FII employees telephone issuers for information, and sometimes other commercial bond redemption services \u2014 such as Moody\u2019s \u2014 are consulted. There is apparently little, if any, editorial skill or creative discretion involved; the cards are essentially a compilation of financial facts collected from various sources, the key facts being those selected for publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-13\">The Daily Bond Cards seek to report all United States municipal redemptions. The packets are mailed each day to roughly 500 subscribers, who are generally large financial institutions who own numerous municipal bonds and who would find it difficult to monitor all relevant redemptions. The cost of the service is $279 per year, which includes an annual cumulative volume and a filing cabinet.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-14\">Defendant-appellee Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d) is also in the business of selling financial information. Among its products is its Municipal and Government News Reports (\u201cNews Reports\u201d), a bi-weekly supplement to a yearly publication called the Municipal and Government Manual.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-15\">Like FII\u2019s Daily Bond Cards, Moody\u2019s News Reports provide institutional sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>scribers with the essential data connected with bond redemptions, including the date and price of the call and the name of the trustee or agent. Despite the apparent overlap, the publications differ in at least two ways. First, while FII endeavors to report all municipal redemptions, Moody\u2019s coverage is restricted to those securities it also rates, which, we are told, are roughly 90% of the total class of municipal bonds. Secondly, Moody\u2019s News Reports provide a significant amount of information not offered by FII\u2019s cards, such as Moody\u2019s own ratings of the debt securities and notices of securities recently offered. Moody\u2019s total package costs $840 per year and includes, in addition to the bi-weekly News Reports, the Municipal and Government Manual, a comprehensive work which contains a substantial amount of financial information about governmental entities, and which serves as a reference source for libraries and government agencies, as well as for financial institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">According to FII, in 1980 it noticed a \u201ccoincidence of Moody\u2019s errata publishing after FII,\u201d and began to suspect that Moody\u2019s was simply copying information from its cards. In December of that year, in an attempt to confirm its suspicions, FII fabricated and planted an error \u201credeeming\u201d some bonds that had, in fact, been called a year earlier. The fake redemption was picked up and published by Moody\u2019s. While FII did not plant any more errors \u2014 it was, after all, in jeopardy of sacrificing its reputation with its customers for credibility and reliability \u2014 FII did compare Moody\u2019s reports with its own in cases where FII had made unintentional errors. It was ultimately determined \u2014 and Moody\u2019s does not contest \u2014 that in 1980 seven of ten FII errors were reproduced by Moody\u2019s, while in 1981, all eight FII errors were copied by Moody\u2019s.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> FII then instituted this action for copyright infringement and unfair competition under the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101-810 (1982), and for unfair competition under New York law.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">At trial, FII\u2019s expert witness, Professor Herbert Robbins, Professor of Mathematical Statistics at Columbia University, testified that based on the incidence of FII errors which appeared in Moody\u2019s News Reports it was more than 95% certain that Moody\u2019s had copied at least 40-50% of FII\u2019s information in the years 1980 and 1981. Professor Robbins further testified that in 1981, where eight of eight FII errors appeared in the News Reports, the probabilities were 51% that Moody\u2019s copied 91% of FII\u2019s Daily Bond Cards. At a \u201cconfidence level,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>probability, of 95%, Professor Robbins put the percentage of Moody\u2019s copying in 1981 at 68%.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">Moody\u2019s presented evidence at trial of what it calls its \u201cindependent creation\u201d of its News Reports. According to the testimony of Moody\u2019s employees, the research effort that went into the News Reports included the reading of over two dozen newspapers and the monitoring of four wire services. Moody\u2019s maintained that nine employees were directly, though not necessarily exclusively, involved in the production of the News Reports, and that the \u201ctotal accrued annual costs allocable\u201d to the News Reports, including research effort costs, varied from between $700,000 to $1,000,000. In addition, Moody\u2019s sought to counter the expert testimony of Professor Robbins by showing through reference to publication deadlines and schedules that more than half of its bond redemption notices simply could not have been copied from FII\u2019s cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">The Decision Below</p>\n<p id=\"AUn\">In the post-trial opinion dismissing the complaint, the district court found, as a preliminary matter, that FII\u2019s Daily Bond Cards were copyrightable, thus confirming the substance of the decision on appellee\u2019s prior motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 599 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>F.Supp. 994. The district court then expressly found that Moody\u2019s had \u201ccopied from plaintiff\u2019s cards from time-to-time.\u201d It noted, however, that such copying did not \u201cend the matter,\u201d since Moody\u2019s had \u201casserted the fair use doctrine as a defense to its use [of] plaintiff\u2019s materials.\u201d Conceptualizing the test for the applicability of the fair use doctrine as four hurdles for Moody\u2019s to \u201covercome,\u201d the district court made four key findings in Moody\u2019s \u201cbehalf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">After stating that the fact of a commercial use of copyrighted material does not in and of itself defeat a fair use defense, the district court noted that in some instances, Moody\u2019s publication served as legal notice of a bond\u2019s redemption and that many institutions were \u201ceager\u201d to have this information. The court then found that Moody\u2019s was performing a \u201cpublic function\u201d by \u201cmaking available this needed financial information.\u201d Thus, the fulfillment of this public function brought Moody\u2019s \u201cclearly ... within the ambit of the first requirement for fair use protection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The district court then focused on what it called \u201cthe simplest hurdle for Moody\u2019s to overcome,\u201d namely the nature of the copyrighted work. The court stated that since FII\u2019s cards represented a mere compliation of factual material, the scope of permissible fair use was greater than it would be with respect to a \u201ctruly creative work,\u201d and held that Moody\u2019s thus met \u201cthe second yardstick.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The third factor analyzed was the \u201camount and substantiality of the portions copied.\u201d Despite Professor Robbin\u2019s testimony, the court held that FII \u201cfailed to establish substantial use of its work\u201d by Moody\u2019s. Apparently, the basis for the rejection of the expert statistical evidence was the crediting of Moody\u2019s evidence of significant simultaneous or even prior publication of the call data. The district court was also impressed by the fact that Moody\u2019s received more newspapers than FII, and monitored four wire services. The judge then stated that he could not \u201cmake the leap that 8 of 8 proven instances shows copying by defendant 91% of the time,\u201d and found instead that Moody\u2019s had copied FII cards \u201cin some 20-24 instances throughout a given year,\u201d a finding which, according to FII, translates into a copying rate of just 1 to 2%.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">Turning to the \u201cfinal and most important factor,\u201d the district court found no evidence that Moody\u2019s use of FII\u2019s materials tended to diminish or prejudice the potential sale of plaintiff\u2019s work. The judge based this finding on his view that the parties \u201cserviced separate, discrete markets,\u201d and on the lack of any evidence showing a decline in the number of FII subscribers or an increase in the number of Moody\u2019s subscribers resulting from the copying.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">Having found that Moody\u2019s cleared all four hurdles, the court held that the fair use doctrine operated as a complete defense to FII\u2019s claims under the Copyright Act. The court then stated that the only New York state unfair competition action viable on the facts was that of misappropriation, but held that given the absence of a showing of competition and injury, the claim necessarily failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-13\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b618-14\">\n<em>Copyrightability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b618-15\">Moody\u2019s made below, as it makes here, two basic arguments why the called bond data that FII publishes each day cannot receive copyright protection: first, that the daily data are facts and therefore not copyrightable and, second, that the daily data are not compilations and are therefore not copyrightable as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-16\">As the district court held, of course, Moody\u2019s is quite accurate that facts are not copyrightable. <em>See, e.g., Miller v. Universal City Studios, Inc., </em>650 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>1365, 1368 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>Hoehling v. Universal City Studios, Inc., </em>618 F.2d 972, 974, 979 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 841, 101 S.Ct. 121, 66 L.Ed.2d 49 (1980); <em>Rosemont Enterprises, Inc. v. Random House, Inc., </em>366 F.2d 303, 309 (2d Cir.1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 1009, 87 S.Ct. 714,17 L.Ed.2d 546 (1967); 1 M. Nimmer, <em>The Law of Copyright </em>\u00a7 2.11[A], at 2-157 (1984) (hereinafter \u201cNimmer\u201d). In <em>Hoehling, </em>for example, we rejected the appeal of the author of a history about the Hindenberg dirigible who asserted that his copyright was infringed by a television studio that used his book as one of its historical sources in making a screenplay about the dirigible. The court said that \u201cfactual information is in the public domain[,]\u201d 618 F.2d at 979, and that \u201cthe protection afforded the copyright holder has never extended' to history, be it documented fact or explanatory hypothesis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 974. What is protected is \u201cthe author\u2019s original expression of particular facts.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">While facts have not been given copyright protection, as the district court pointed out, compilations of such facts traditionally have been. <em>See, e.g., Schroeder v. William Morrow &amp; Co., </em>566 F.2d 3 (7th Cir.1977) (directory of nurseries); <em>Leon v. Pacific Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>91 F.2d 484 (9th Cir.1937) (telephone directory); <em>Hartfield v. Peterson, </em>91 F.2d 998 (2d Cir.1937) (cable and telegraphic code); <em>Jeweler\u2019s Circular Publishing Co. v. Keystone Publishing Co., </em>281 Fed. 83 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>259 U.S. 581, 42 S.Ct. 464, 66 L.Ed. 1074 (1922) (jeweler\u2019s directory); <em>List Publishing Co. v. Keller, </em>30 Fed. 772 (C.C.S.D. N.Y.1887) (social register); <em>see also </em>1 Nimmer \u00a7 2.04[B], at 2-40. <em>Jeweler\u2019s Circular Publishing Co. </em>stated the rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">\u201cA man\u2019s name, his occupation, his place of business, and his residence are none of them subjects of copyright.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4F\">But, if a man compiles a book containing such information about the residents of a particular place, he may ... copyright it as a whole, notwithstanding the fact that the separate parts of which it is composed are not copyrightable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">281 Fed. at 87. <em>See also Schroeder v. William Morrow &amp; Co., supra, </em>566 F.2d at 5 (\u201cAn original compilation of names and addresses is copyrightable even though the individual names and addresses are in the public domain and not copyrightable\u201d). The Copyright Act of 1976 incorporates the common law by expressly providing for the protection of compilations, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(a), defining a \u201ccompilation\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">a work formed by the collection and assembling of preexisting materials or of data that are selected, coordinated, or arranged in such a way that the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original work of authorship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">Thus the law of copyrights defies the laws of logic, or, as one commentator puts it, \u201cthe dictates of algebra,\u201d since it \u201caffords to the summation of one hundred or one million [individual facts and their unadorned expression] a significant measure of protection\u201d while affording none to the facts themselves. <em>See </em>Denicola, <em>Copyright in Collection Facts: A Theory for the Protection of Nonfiction Literary Works, </em>81 Colum.L.Rev. 516, 527 (1981) (hereafter Denicola). The whole of a compilation is thus greater than the sum of its parts. It is not surprising, therefore, that there are opposing lines of cases and competing theories advanced by the commentators, or that this case has caused the district court and ourselves much difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">The competing respectable lines of authority are exemplified by those that seemingly make copyrightability turn on the labor or effort expended in assembling the data, <em>e.g., Leon v. Pacific Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>91 F.2d 484, 486 (9th Cir. 1937) <em>(citing Jeweler\u2019s Circular Publishing Co., </em>supra) (telephone directory copyrightable), and those that evidently look exclusively to arrangement of the data as the keystone of protection, <em>e.g., Triangle Publications, Inc. v. Sports Eye, Inc., </em>415 F.Supp. 682 (E.D.Pa.1976); <em>Simms v. Stanton, </em>75 Fed. 6, 13 (C.C.N.D.Cal.1896). While the commentators agree that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>can be no copyright protection of individual facts, one would condemn \u201csweat of the brow\u201d analysis, Nimmer \u00a7 2.04[B] n. 16 at 2-42 (criticizing language of Judge Carter in this ease), while another would suggest that \u201cauthorship in the act of aggregating isolated pieces of information\u201d is the key, Denicola, 81 Colum.L.Rev. at 530, thereby concluding that \u201cthe particular collection of data contained in a compilation may be considered a copyrightable element of the overall work.\u201d Our court,, focusing on the statutory language, \u201cselected, coordinated, or arranged,\u201d has taken the following position in <em>Eckes v. Card Prices Update, </em>736 F.2d 859, 862-63 (2d Cir.1984) (upholding copyrightability of baseball card guide referring to 18,000 or so different baseball cards because authors exercised \u201cselection, creativity and judgment\u201d in choosing 5,000 of them as \u201cpremium cards\u201d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aou\">we have been particularly restrictive in the protection of non-fiction works indicating, for example, that the fruits of another\u2019s labor in lieu of independent research obtained through the sweat of a researcher\u2019s brow, does not merit copyright protection absent, perhaps, wholesale appropriation____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-4\">Nevertheless, our cases do not hold that subjective selection and arrangement of information does not merit protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 862.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The statement of abstract principles, however, may assist in, but usually does not compel, the determination of concrete cases. <em>See </em>Soper, <em>On the Relevance of Philosophy to Law: Reflection on Acker-man\u2019s </em>Private Property and the Constitution, 79 Colum.L.Rev. 44, 64-65 (1979); R. Dworkin, <em>Taking Rights Seriously, </em>ch. 4 (\u201cHard Cases\u201d), at 81-130 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Thus, the \u201cpivotal question\u201d as the district court put it is \u201cwhether FII\u2019s daily called bond data can be considered a compilation.\u201d Recognizing Moody\u2019s argument as, in essence, \u201cthat FII, in publishing its bond data index cards, records only public information about single public occurrences, i.e., bond calls, and does so without adding any \u2018peculiar skill and judgment,\u2019 \u201d the court nevertheless held the argument unavailing on the basis that \u201c[i]n publishing ten or twelve index cards each day, fifty [or] sixty each week, and some 2,500 in each year\u2019s cumulative volume, FII is unquestionably \u2018assembling, connecting and categorizing disparate facts which in nature occurred in isolation,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c[t]he FII employees who put together the daily called bond service assemble into one handy compilation disparate information about thousands of calls by hundreds of municipalities and other governmental entities in dozens of states.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Thus, \u201c[i]n amassing its bond data, FII is not just assembling a handful of statistics about a single, solitary occurrence, but is instead weaving together into a handy, coherent entity thousands of facts that \u2018occurred in isolation.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">And the district court went on to conclude:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-11\">To accord copyright protection to the annual compilation but deny it to each daily component would negate the value of the protection accorded the yearly compilation. If a competitor were to be able to copy each day\u2019s quantum of FII\u2019s called bond cards with impunity, the copyright protection given to the annual volume would be rendered meaningless as to that copying competitor____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-13\">Just as an annual aggregation of called bond data should be considered a compilation, so, too, should each serial ingredient \u2014 be it the quarterly, monthly, weekly, or daily component \u2014 be considered a species of compilation. If a cumulative volume warrants copyright protection as a compilation, then so do the serial components that ultimately comprise the cumulative tone \u2014 so long as there is adequate copyright notice on each component.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-14\">While Judge Carter\u2019s analysis has considerable appeal \u2014 why should the serial thief of the data being developed for a compilation go scot-free while the fellow who waits for the compilation to be complete before he steals it does not \u2014 and sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>port by at least one commentator, Denicola, 91 Colum.L.Rev. at 530-35, there nevertheless is now-updated Second Circuit precedent to be taken into account, <em>Eckes, supra. </em>Thus, on the remand which we order for reasons below stated, questions to be addressed will include whether the data used on the FII cards involved a modicum of selection, coordination, or arrangement on FII's part, sufficient to meet the rather broad copyrightability standard of originality which is phrased in terms of \u201cindependent creation\u201d rather than the narrower, inapplicable standards of \u201cuniqueness\u201d or \u201cnovelty\u201d or \u201cingenuity,\u201d 1 Nimmer \u00a7 2.01[A] at 2-6, \u00a7 3.04 at 3-19; <em>L. Batlin &amp; Son v. Snyder, </em>536 F.2d 486, 490 (2d Cir.1976) (en banc); <em>Eckes v. Card Prices Update, </em>736 F.2d at 862-63. They will also include the question, not answered on the record to our satisfaction, whether the annual bound volume, the ultimate compilation, serves a real or merely trivial purpose to the user; if the immediacy of the information as to bond calls is basically the only thing valuable to the buyer of the FII service, arguably there is little reason for looking at the ultimate compilation at all even while the focus on the daily cards makes their simplicity, their readability, and hence the selection and arrangement of facts on the cards of greater moment. In this regard, the court should determine what other facts about the called bonds that could be included or might conceivably have some use to a potential purchaser of the service have been omitted, to determine the degree of \u2018selectivity\u2019 involved. And the court should consider whether any selection, <em>coordination, </em>or arrangement is involved in terms of the called bond issues which are reported on. Perhaps these, or other, areas will be explored by the district court so as to give us, if the case returns to this court, a further clue or clues to resolving a conundrum in the copyright law: if \u201cfacts\u201d are not copyrightable but a \u201ccompilation\u201d of them is, does utilization of the facts by another as they are collected constitute an infringement of the \u201ccompilation,\u201d as the district court and Denicola suggest, or does the law of copyright only become operative when the compilation is complete? \u2014 or is this a question which cannot even be asked in the framework of the fact/compilation dichotomy? Put another way, is the surface illogic inherent in the proposition that facts alone are not copyrightable while a collection of them is, penetrable in this case by resort to the \u201cselection\u201d-\u201ccoordination\u201d-\u201carrangement\u201d route where the compiler publishes his \u201cfacts\u201d as he collects them?</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">\n<em>Fair Use</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">Copyright protection \u201csubsists ... in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression____\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a). But, as the Supreme Court has recently reiterated, copyright protection \u201chas never accorded the copyright owner complete control over all possible uses of his work.\u201d <em>Sony Corporation of America v. Universal City Studios, </em>104 S.Ct. at 784 (footnote omitted). One of the most significant exceptions to the copyright monopoly is the common law concept of \u201cfair use,\u201d codified by Congress in 1976. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">As we have stated, the fair use doctrine \u201coffers a means of balancing the exclusive right of a copyright holder with the public\u2019s interest in dissemination of infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>mation affecting areas of universal concern ____\u201d <em>Meeropol v.

Wall Street Transcript Corp., </em>558 F.2d 91. (2d Cir.1977), the doctrine \u201cpermits the limited use of copyrighted material without the author\u2019s consent for purposes \u2018such as criticism, comment, news, reporting, teaching ..., scholarship, or research____\u2019\u201d <em>Harper &amp; Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, </em>723 F.2d 195, 206 (2d Cir.1983) (citing 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2655, 81 L.Ed.2d 362 (1984). At the same time, fair use \u201cis not a license for corporate theft, empowering a court to ignore a copyright whenever it determines the underlying work contains material of possible public importance.\u201d <em>Iowa State University Research Foundation, Inc. v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., </em>621 F.2d 57, 61 (2d Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">In <em>Sony, </em>Justice Stevens, writing for the majority, emphasized that a court must employ an \u201cequitable rule of reason\u201d analysis to determine whether fair use operates in a given case as a shield against claims of infringement. 104 S.Ct. at 792. The four factors which the fair use statute identifies as relevant to a determination of whether the doctrine applies \u2014 the purpose and character of the use; the nature of the copyrighted material; the amount of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and the effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work \u2014 are equitable considerations to be assessed and weighed by the court;' they are not simply hurdles over which an accused infringer may leap to safety from liability. Rather than a sequence of four rigid tests, the fair use analysis consists of a \u201csensitive balancing of interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 795 n. 40. On this basis alone, it would not be inappropriate were we to remand for purposes of conducting the required balancing.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-15\">But the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sony </em>makes a remand on the fair use issue unnecessary. <em>Sony </em>repeatedly stresses that the \u201cfirst factor\u201d \u2014 whether the use is commercial or nonprofit \u2014 not only must necessarily be a part' of a court\u2019s analysis, but must also, if the use proves commercial, give rise to a presumption of unfair use. The Court could hardly have been more lucid on this point, stating that \u201cevery commercial use of copyrighted material is presumptively an unfair exploitation of the monopoly privilege that belongs to the owner of the copyright____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 793.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-16\">There is no argument and of course can be no doubt but that Moody\u2019s use is commercial, and thus presumptively unfair. The district court, of course, not having the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sony, </em>noted with respect to Moody\u2019s for-profit use of the copyrighted material only that that fact was not dispositive on the question of liability. To the degree that the district court's discussion of the \u201cpublic function\u201d of Moody\u2019s use was intended to address the first factor, we must state our disagreement with its characterization. The fact that large financial institutions are willing to pay considerable sums of money to receive information hardly qualifies the selling of that information (again, for a substantial amount of money) as a public function. This information on bond redemptions is not, after all, information that is widely disseminated, and to the degree that it is circulated, it may reach more individuals through their newspapers, where the call announcements first appear, than through any publication that Moody\u2019s produces. To classify Moody\u2019s sales of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>News Reports as a public function would, it seems to us, state a rule that whenever there is a market for information, the paid delivery of goods to that market rises to a public function. While perhaps sound as a matter of economic theory, such a construction would distort the statutory \u201cfirst factor\u201d of fair use in the copyright context. We note, in addition, that presumably FII is able and willing to sell its Daily Bond Cards to anyone, and thus that no one with $279 per year need do without.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><em>Sony </em>requires that we recognize a presumption of unfair use by Moody\u2019s arising from its commercial use of the copyrighted material. As we engage in the required \u201crule of reason\u201d analysis mandated by <em>Sony, </em>we are persuaded that Moody\u2019s cannot rebut that presumption, and that if anything, the other specified equitable factors support, rather than undermine, the conclusion that Moody\u2019s use was not protected by the fair use doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">With respect to the second factor \u2014 the nature of the copyrighted material \u2014 it is true, as appellee argues, that FII\u2019s Daily Bond Cards do require a minimum of editorial skill or judgment, and consequently may be more susceptible to fair use than would be a truly creative work. <em>Harper &amp; Row Publishers v. Nation Enterprises, </em>723 F.2d at 208. We are disinclined to place great importance on this factor, however, given that the use that Moody\u2019s seeks to make of the material is similarly \u201cnon-ereative\u201d and purely commercial. In other words, were a songwriter or playwright to copy from a compilation of information regarding municipal bond redemptions in order to, say, enhance the verisimilitude of his art, we might be more easily persuaded that the factual nature of FII\u2019s copyrighted material should significantly cut against it in a fair use balancing. Given the equitable nature of the fair use analysis, we are somewhat unmoved by the pot here calling the kettle black.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Far more significant to the present case is the evidence of substantial, if not wholesale copying by Moody\u2019s from FII, evidence which we fear the district court failed adequately to credit. From the district court\u2019s opinion, it appears that it understood the expert testimony of Professor Robbins to be an assertion that Moody\u2019s must have copied from FII \u201c91% of the time,\u201d a leap the court refused to make from the established fact that eight of eight errors were copied in one year. But, as we have indicated above, Professor Robbins did not testify that 91% was copied, he merely presented a continuum of what Moody\u2019s might have copied from FII, expressed along with the probability or \u201cconfidence level\u201d associated with each possible copying level. The 91% figure referred to was, as appellant readily concedes, at the \u201cstatistical fringe.\u201d More to the point was Professor Robbins\u2019s testimony that it was statistically certain <em>(i.e., </em>95-99% probable) that Moody\u2019s had copied at the 40-50% level.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">In this connection, it is important to note that Moody\u2019s never seriously attacked or challenged the expert statistical testimony; it offered no expert witness of its own, and instead sought to prove at trial that it could not have copied <em>more </em>than 50%, due to publication schedules and the like. But as FII correctly notes, Moody\u2019s insistence that one half of what it published could not have been taken from FII is entirely consistent with FII\u2019s proof that Moody\u2019s did steal the other 50%, and FII is also correct to note that the 91% figure attacked by Moody\u2019s is a \u201cstraw man.\u201d At oral argument, Moody\u2019s could neither defend nor explain the apparent misunderstanding of the statistical evidence on the part of the district court, nor offer any rebuttal as to why the 40-50% copying figure was not accurate. Accordingly, we simply cannot agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Moody\u2019s copying was \u201climited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">Finally, with respect to the fourth fair use factor, that of the effect of Moody\u2019s use upon the potential market for or value of FII\u2019s Daily Bond Cards, we again must reject the analysis of the court below that the parties \u201care not competitors.\u201d It is true that Moody\u2019s News Reports and FII\u2019s Daily Bond Cards differ somewhat in scope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>and coverage, and that Moody\u2019s product is more expensive than FII\u2019s; but as appellant correctly notes, the law does not require \u201cidentity of products in nose-to-nose rival sales.\u201d It is clear that if Moody\u2019s were unable merely to copy from the Daily Bond Cards, FII might be in a position to license that use for a fee. <em>See Iowa State, </em>621 F.2d at 62; <em>D.C. Comics Inc. v. Reel Fantasy, Inc., </em>696 F.2d 24, 28 (2d Cir.1982). In addition, as the Supreme Court stated in <em>Sony, </em>when an intended use is for commercial gain, harm to the copyright owner \u201cmay be presumed.\u201d 104 S.Ct. at 793.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">In sum, on the record before us Moody\u2019s does not make \u201cfair use\u201d of the material it copied from FII.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">\n<em>Preemption of State Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">As noted above, we do not agree with the district court that the parties do not compete, a finding which served as the basis for the dismissal of the state claim. Nonetheless, the Copyright Act, by express terms, preempts state actions with respect to rights \u201cequivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 301(a). FII has alleged in essence that Moody\u2019s unlawfully misappropriated its copyrighted material. If FII does prevail on its federal claim, the New York state claim will be preempted; if it does not prevail, the state claim will have to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Remand for a calculation of damages.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b617-5\">.

There is a question whether the issue of the copyrightability of the Daily Bond Cards was preserved on this appeal. In a footnote in its brief on appeal Moody\u2019s does note that it \"argued below,\u201d and states that it \"maintains,\u201d that the Daily Bond Cards are not copyrightable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>The question was not briefed by FII or really by Moody\u2019s \u2014 was not in fact even mentioned in the main text of Moody\u2019s brief \u2014 and does not appear in its \u201cIssues Presented for Review.\u201d We will assume that the issue has been preserved.

NEWMAN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AAh\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">Agreeing with all of what Judge Oakes has written on the fair use aspect of this appeal and with most of his observations on the issue of copyrightability, I concur in the decision to remand for further findings. The usefulness of the remand may be enhanced by some brief further elaboration of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">The basic question on the copyright issue is whether the Daily Called Bond Cards, published by Financial Information, Inc. (\u201cFII\u201d), are a \u201ccompilation\u201d within the meaning of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(a) (1982). Preferring not to extend copyright protection to all collections of facts, Congress has defined a \u201ccompilation\u201d as \u201ca work formed by the collection and assembling of preexisting materials or of data that are <em>selected, coordinated, or arranged </em>in such a way that the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original work of authorship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 101 (emphasis added). Thus, the primary task for the District Court is to determine whether the data appearing on the Daily Called Bond Cards have been \u201cselected, coordinated, or arranged\u201d so as to constitute an original work of authorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">I do not share the view that Congress, in establishing these criteria, or this Court, in insisting that they be satisfied, has defined the laws of logic or of algebra. The \u201cwhole\u201d of a copyrightable \u201ccompilation\u201d is not greater than the sum of its \u201cparts.\u201d If its \u201cparts\u201d are only the discrete items of data that have been collected, the resulting work is not copyrightable. It may receive a valid copyright only if something has been added to the data: the \u201cauthorship\u201d of the compiler in making the requisite selection, coordination, or arrangement of the data. The fact that some language in early cases, <em>see Jeweler\u2019s Circular Publishing Co. v. Keystone Publishing Co., </em>281 F. 83, 87 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>259 U.S. 581, 42 S.Ct. 464, 66 L.Ed. 1074 (1922), and, perhaps, even some results reached in those cases, <em>e.g., Leon v. Pacific Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>91 F.2d 484 (9th Cir. 1937), have supported a view that copyright protection should be extended solely because of laborious effort is no reason for us to disregard the statutory criteria that Congress articulated in 1976 when it enacted the current statute. The \u201csweat of the brow\u201d rationale is no substitute for meeting one of those statutory criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-13\">A second aspect of the copyright issue arises in this litigation because of the fact that the Daily Called Bond Cards are initially issued daily as individual cards and subsequently issued annually in a bound volume. This fact poses issues of procedural compliance with copyright registration requirements and substantive entitle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>ment to copyright protection. The procedural issue is whether the cards, as issued on a daily basis with notice of copyright, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 401, were required to be registered with the Copyright Office pursuant to 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 408, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 411 (prohibiting infringement suit prior to registration of copyright claim), or whether registration of the annual volume sufficed, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 408(c)(1) (authorizing regulations to permit single registration for group of \u201crelated works\u201d). We have not yet resolved that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">If annual registration sufficed, the substantive issue is whether the statutory criteria of a protectable \u201ccompilation\u201d must be satisfied by each card or only by the series of cards that constitute FII\u2019s called bond \u201cservice\u201d and are collected in the annual volume. I am not as sure as Judge Carter that the copyrightability of the annual volume (assuming for the moment that such can be established) necessarily requires copyright protection for the daily cards. The annual volume may satisfy the statutory criteria of a \u201ccompilation\u201d even though the daily cards do not. Congress has recognized that the copyright in a compilation \u201cextends only to the material contributed by the author of such work, as distinguished from the pre-existing material employed in the work____\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(b). Just as the cards might be copyrightable though the data on them are not, so the annual volume might be copyrightable even if the daily cards are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">It remains to be determined what copyright protection, if any, the copyright in the annual volume confers upon the daily cards. I doubt that protection of each card may arise simply because denial of protection would impair the value of the copyright in the annual volume. That argument seems to be boot-strapping. However, the daily components of a serial publication perhaps might be copyrightable because of their relationship to each other as issued, as distinguished from their relationship to each other as collected in an annual volume. For example, a mystery story published in the form of daily clues might secure protection for each clue because of its relationship to what has previously appeared and perhaps even to what will appear. The application of that approach to reported facts like those appearing on FII\u2019s cards is arguable, though doubtful since these facts appear to have primary significance as issued each day.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">By copying FII\u2019s daily cards, Moody\u2019s is not necessarily a copyright infringer or a \u201cserial thief.\u201d Though it would be liable for conversion if it had stolen from FII\u2019s office the sheets on which the daily data are assembled for publication and might be liable for unfair competition if it appropriated for competitive purposes material not entitled to copyright,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it has not committed copyright infringement unless the* material it has copied is entitled to copyright protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">Whether such protection exists cannot be determined until further facts have been found. Principal among these are the facts concerning whatever selection, coordination, or arrangement of the data on the cards may have occurred. I therefore concur in the decision to remand for further inquiry.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-12\">. If the Daily Called Bond Cards are not copyrightable compilations, FII\u2019s unfair competition claim under state law might not be preempted either because FII would not be asserting rights \"that are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright\u201d or because the cards are not \"works of authorship,\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 301. <em>See </em>1 <em>Nimmer on Copyright </em>\u00a7 1.01 [B] at 1-22 (1984) (\u201cif a work does not constitute a 'work of authorship,' ... as a compilation ... under Section 103, then there is no federal preemption\u201d) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
