Ernest R. Zerman, a lawyer, appeals from an order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Edward Weinfeld, <em>J.) </em>that denied his Rule 60(b) motion to set aside that court\u2019s order, which confirmed an arbitration award and entered judgment in favor of defendants Bache Halsey Stuart Shields Inc., the name of which has been changed to Prudential Bache Securities Inc. (\u201cBache\u201d), and two of its officers. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b197-17\">Plaintiff Zerman originally brought this action in June 1980 alleging claims under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, and state and common law in connection with a margin securities account he maintained with defendant Bache. Bache counterclaimed. The substance of plaintiff\u2019s claims were discussed in detail in an opinion by the district court. <em>See Zerman v. Jacobs, </em>510 F.Supp. 132 (S.D.N.Y.), <em>aff'd, </em>672 F.2d 901 (2d Cir.1981). In that opinion the district court stated that \u201cplaintiff, seizing upon a mere computer error, is attempting to convert it into a claim of fraud under the federal securities laws.\u201d <em>Zerman, </em>510 F.Supp. at 134. Concluding that Zerman \u201cfailed to state a proper claim under any provision of the federal securities laws,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 135, the district court granted Bache\u2019s motion to compel arbitration on the state and common law claims based upon plaintiff\u2019s agreement to arbitrate all claims arising out of his brokerage account. We affirmed the district court\u2019s decision by summary order. <em>Zerman, </em>672 F.2d 901.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-18\">Zerman thereupon proceeded to file a series of motions in an effort to resist arbitration. After he had engaged in twenty months of delaying tactics, the district judge enjoined him from filing further motions until his claims were resolved in arbitration. Again plaintiff took an appeal that was unsuccessful. <em>Zerman v. Jacobs, </em>No. 80 Civ. 3570 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 12, 1982), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>729 F.2d 1443 (2d Cir. 1983). In January 1983, when plaintiff failed to appear at the scheduled arbitration, the arbitrators awarded Bache $47,-234.57 with interest on its counterclaim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>On March 8, 1983 the district court confirmed the arbitration award and entered judgment against plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Over a year later, in April 1984, plaintiff moved before the district court under Rule 60(b) to set aside the final judgment. Zer-man argued that a newly promulgated SEC Rule, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.15c2-2 (1984), constituted \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d under Rule 60(b)(2), and that legal arguments made by defendant\u2019s counsel as to the applicability of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Wilko v. Swan, </em>346 U.S. 427, 74 S.Ct. 182, 98 L.Ed. 168 (1953), constituted \u201cmisrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party\u201d under Rule 60(b)(3). The district court, its patience tried by plaintiff\u2019s \u201ccourse of harassing litigation,\u201d denied the motion. Judge Weinfeld\u2019s conclusion was concise: \u201cThe grounds asserted for vacatur of the judgment are so patently frivolous as to merit no discussion. The application is denied.\u201d <em>Zerman v. Jacobs, </em>No. 80 Civ. 3570 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 1984). Undaunted by the district court\u2019s message, plaintiff appeals again.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">SEC Rule 15c2-2, promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.15C2-2,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> does not constitute \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d that justifies granting relief from the judgment within the meaning of Rule 60(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Nor does this Rule issued in 1983 retroactively invalidate the 1977 agreement between Zerman and Bache. <em>See </em>SEC Rule 15c2-2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-12\">SEC Rule 15c2-2, in any event, is not applicable here. In <em>Wilko v. Swan </em>the Supreme Court held that an agreement between a broker and customer to arbitrate federal securities law claims is unenforceable. The district court concluded, and we agreed, that Zerman could not avoid the arbitration provision of his customer agreement under <em>Wilko v. Swan </em>because he had failed to state a proper claim under any provision of the federal securities laws. <em>Zerman v. Jacobs, </em>510 F.Supp. at 134-35. SEC Rule 15c2-2, restating the rule of <em>Wil-ko v. Swan, </em>only addresses the situation involving disputes between broker and customer \u201carising under the Federal securities law.\u201d SEC Rule 15c2-2(a). It therefore cannot serve as a basis for setting aside this judgment under Rule 60(b)(2). In light of the district court\u2019s holding that Zerman\u2019s complaint fails to state a claim under the federal securities laws, and our affirmance of that order, defense counsel\u2019s argument that <em>Wilko v. Swan </em>has no application to this case obviously does not constitute \u201cmisrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party\u201d within the meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Rule 60(b)(3). Thus, there is no basis for setting aside the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">This appeal is frivolous. Plaintiff, having kept this lawsuit going for over four years, is making his third trip to this Court. He continues to relitigate the same issue that the district court decided and we affirmed in 1981.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiff has cast his line one time too many. As a consequence, Zerman is assessed double costs in this Court plus $2,500 damages for taking a frivolous appeal, payable to Prudential Bache Securities Inc. within fourteen days of the issuance of this order. <em>See </em>Fed.R. App.P. 38.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b198-7\">. \u00a7 240.15c2-2 Disclosure regarding recourse to the courts notwithstanding arbitration clauses in broker-dealer customer agreements.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">(a) It shall be a fraudulent, manipulative or deceptive act or practice for a broker or dealer to enter into an agreement with any public customer which purports to bind the customer to the arbitration of future disputes between them arising under the Federal securities laws, or to have in effect such an agreement, pursuant to which it effects transactions with or for a customer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, until December 31, 1984 a broker or dealer may use existing supplies of customer agreement forms if all such agreements entered into with public customers after December 28, 1983 are accompanied by the separate written disclosure:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-10\">Although you have signed a customer agreement form with FIRM NAME that states that you are required to arbitrate any future dispute or controversy that may arise between us, you are not required to arbitrate any dispute or controversy that arises under the federal securities laws but instead can resolve any such dispute or controversy through litigation in the courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-14\">(c) A broker or dealer shall not be in violation of paragraph (a) of this section with respect to any agreement entered into with a public customer prior to December 28, 1983 if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-15\">(1) Any such public customer for whom the broker or dealer has after July 1, 1983 (i) carried a free credit balance, or (ii) held securities for safekeeping or as collateral, or (iii) effected a securities transaction is sent, no later than December 31, 1984, the disclosure prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-16\">(2) Any other public customer is sent upon the completion of his next transaction pursuant to such agreement, the disclosure prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b199-15\">.
