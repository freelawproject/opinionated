In 1978 MPA filed suit in federal district court challenging the authority of the Secretary of Labor to require the Association to file reports under Section 203(b) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 433(b) (1976) (LMRDA) (the Act) (the Statute). The Secretary responded by seeking an injunction to compel compliance. The suits were consolidated in the form of cross motions for summary judgment and the lower court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>granted the Secretary\u2019s motion. On appeal this court reversed, concluding that an unresolved factual dispute existed over whether MPA\u2019s activities fell within the scope of \u00a7 203(b). Following a trial, the district court ruled on remand that MPA\u2019s activities were covered by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">MPA appealed for a second time, arguing that the district court\u2019s findings were erroneous and that \u00a7 203(b) was unconstitutional because it violated MPA\u2019s first amendment rights. We affirmed the lower court\u2019s factual findings, but remanded for an initial determination of the constitutional questions. On remand for the second time, the district court concluded that \u00a7 203(b) was constitutional. MPA now appeals that decision. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">MPA\u2019s membership consists of approximately 5,000 employers who employ about 200,000 employees. Local associations recruit new members, who then become automatically affiliated with MPA, and arrange for participation in various MPA programs. One such project is MPA\u2019s Craftmanship Program, initiated in 1950 to recognize and reward employee excellence through awards of Craftsmanship certificates to experienced workers nominated by their employers and positively evaluated by an expert panel. Roughly one-fifth of the MPA membership (900 employers) participates in this program; there are currently about 12,000 certified Craftsmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-13\">Craftsmen receive a permanent free subscription to the MPA-edited magazine, \u201cInsight,\u201d a quarterly some 14-16 pages in length featuring items of general interest to the printing industry. \u201cInsight\u201d goes directly to employees\u2019 homes, at addresses furnished by their employers. In a pamphlet for employers entitled \u201cHow MPA Serves You,\u201d the subjects of \u201cInsight\u201d are said to encompass \u201ctechnological improvements ..., trends of products or processes, profit facts, advantages of the open shop, human-interest stories, awards events, and similar articles.\u201d Among its other publications MPA produces some documents, distributed to employers and employees, with strong anti-union focus.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-14\">Section 203(b) of the Act requires any person who enters an agreement with an employer to engage in union or open shop \u201cpersuader activity\u201d to disclose the arrangement by filing appropriate forms with the Secretary of Labor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When we remanded this case for the first time, the district court concluded that MPA and the employer-participants in the Craftsmanship Program had entered into a persuader agreement that subjected MPA to the reporting requirements of the Act. The court found that the persuader articles appearing in \u201cInsight\u201d were \u201cunabashedly anti-union,\u201d and rejected as incredible \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>employers\u2019 asserted lack of awareness and lack of concern about the content of a publication which they know goes directly to their employees\u2019 homes at the employer\u2019s direction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">On the second appeal MPA did not limit its challenge to the validity of these findings. Rather, the association charged that the statutory reference to persuader activity in the Act was unconstitutionally vague; the registration requirement amounted to content-based prior restraint; the disclosure requirements infringed MPA\u2019s freedom of association; and Section 203(b) had been improperly applied to the Association\u2019s pure speech. Following our decision to remand for a second time MPA refined its constitutional claims and presented new evidence to support those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">The Association presented essentially three arguments to the district court. First, it contended that the Act infringed its first amendment rights of speech and association by creating \u201ca substantial deterrent effect on continued MPA membership by numerous employers.\u201d MPA offered evidence that in recent years union leaders had depicted the trade association as a \u201cunion busting organization.\u201d Forced disclosure of membership and contribution lists, MPA contended, would deter current members from participating in MPA programs, jeopardize efforts to recruit additional members, and thereby unconstitutionally burden its speech activity. Second, MPA argued that the Statute was void for vagueness. An \u201cInsight\u201d columnist, Mr. Doesburg, testified that since the outset of the lawsuit he had avoided writing any articles dealing with labor-management disputes because he could not determine what constituted \u201cpersuasion\u201d under \u00a7 203(b). In MPA\u2019s view, therefore, the Act violated its due process rights because it failed \u201cto provide explicit standards\u201d for those applying the disclosure provisions. <em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 109, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2299, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972), <em>quoting Speiser v. Randall, </em>357 U.S. 513, 526, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 1342, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958). Moreover, the ambiguity of the statutory language, according to MPA, had a chilling effect on the Association\u2019s freedom of speech, insofar as it forced \u201cInsight\u201d to \u201csteer far wider of the unlawful zone ... than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Third and finally, MPA argued that the reporting requirements of \u00a7 203(b) constituted a prior restraint on free speech because they required compliance \u201cprior to publication, regardless of the timing or actual contents of the magazine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">After reviewing the evidence the district court concluded that MPA had failed to establish a violation of its first amendment rights. The court found that the Act was sufficiently precise to serve notice of its requirements and that any \u201cchilling effect\u201d suffered by Doesburg and MPA was \u201cmore an admission that he [and \u201cInsight\u201d] is unable to write an article that is merely informative ... without at the same time taking a position in which he undertakes to persuade his readers.\u201d The court viewed with \u201cskepticism\u201d the claim advanced by MPA\u2019s witnesses that disclosure would have a \u201cdeterrent effect\u201d on membership, but it concluded that even if the disclosure requirements did encroach on MPA\u2019s first amendment rights of speech or association, the governmental interests served by the Act far outweighed the harm suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">The court rejected out of hand MPA\u2019s prior restraint argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">The Supreme Court has recognized that \u201ccompelled disclosure of affiliation with groups engaged in advocacy\u201d may infringe first amendment rights. <em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 65-66, 96 S.Ct. 612, 656-657, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976); <em>Gibson v. Florida Legislative Investigation Committee, </em>372 U.S. 539, 83 S.Ct. 889, 9 L.Ed.2d 929 (1963); <em>NAACP v. Alabama, </em>357 U.S. 449, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488 (1958). <em>See also Marshall v. Stevens People &amp; Friends, for Freedom, </em>669 F.2d 171, 176 (4th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 940, 102 S.Ct. 1432, 71 L.Ed.2d 651 (1982). Disclosure laws that \u201csignificant[ly] en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>croach\u201d on first amendment rights \u201ccannot be justified by a mere showing of some legitimate governmental interest.\u201d <em>Buckley, </em>424 U.S. at 64-65, 96 S.Ct. at 656-657. Rather, the state\u2019s interests must survive \u201cexacting\u201d scrutiny,- and the state must establish a \u201crelevant correlation\u201d or \u201csubstantial relation\u201d between the governmental interest and the information sought through disclosure. <em>Id. </em>Exacting scrutiny is required even if the infringement on first amendment rights arises \u201cnot through direct government action, but indirectly as an unintended but inevitable result of the government's conduct in requiring disclosure.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ad-\">To assess the Association\u2019s first claim that the LMRDA\u2019s disclosure requirements violate the first amendment rights of speech and association, therefore, our analysis must focus on four factors: the degree of infringement on first amendment rights; the importance of the governmental interest protected by the Act; whether a \u201csubstantial relation\u201d exists between the governmental interest and the information required to be disclosed; and the closeness of the \u201cfit\u201d between the Act and the governmental interest it purports to further. After weighing these factors, it will be possible to determine whether the burden imposed on MPA\u2019s freedoms of speech and association \u2014 if such a burden exists \u2014 is sufficiently justified by the interests the Act seeks to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"alk-dedup-1\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"A_x\">[2] A finding of a substantial \u201cchill\u201d on protected first amendment rights requires a showing that the statutory scheme will result in threats, harassment, or reprisals to specific individuals. <em>Buckley, </em>424 U.S. at 74, 96 S.Ct. at 661; <em>NAACP, </em>at 357 U.S. at 462-63, 78 S.Ct. at 1171-72 (1958). In <em>NAACP v. Alabama, </em>for example, the Court refused to grant the state\u2019s request for disclosure of an NAACP membership list because the NAACP had made an \u201cuncontroverted showing that on past occasions revelation of the identity of its rank and file members has exposed these members to economic reprisal, loss of employment, threat of physical coercion, and other manifestations of public hostility.\u201d Given this record the Court concluded that cornpelled disclosure was likely to \u201caffect adversely the ability of petitioner [NAACP] and its members to ... foster their beliefs ... in that it may induce members to withdraw from the Association ... or dissuade others from joining.\u201d 357 U.S. at 462-63, 78 S.Ct. at 1171-72. Similarly, in <em>Buckley </em>court refused to hold that disclosure provisions of the Federal Election CamPaign Act, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 431 (1976), violated first amendment rights of minor parties an&lt;^ independent candidates because no appellant in this case has tendered record evidence of the sort proffered in <em>[NAACP Alabama. </em>424 U.S. at 71, 96 S.Ct. at 659. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the Court stated that \u201cthe evidence offered need show only a reason-ab^e probability that the compelled disclosure of a Party\u2019s contributors\u2019 names will sub\u00edect them to threats- harassment, or reprisals, the Court also made clear that [w]here it exists the type of chill and harassment identified in <em>[NAACP v.] Alabama </em>can be shown. <em>Id. </em>at 74, 96 S.Ct. at 661</p>\n<p id=\"avj-dedup-0\">We do not believe that the evidence and allegations of first amendment infringement here constitute the sort of threat of physical harm and loss of employment found in <em>NAACP v. Alabama </em>and its progeny. MPA offered testimony indieating that disclosure would enable printing industry competitors to gain unfair advantage over MPA members and would \u201ccause the added annoyance of harassment\u201d by unwanted solicitors, but this evidence was entirely speculative. MPA also offered tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>timony that where membership has been publicized, employers have discontinued their contributions to MPA\u2019s voluntary action program and \u201chave considered withdrawing completely from MPA.\u201d This testimony, however, was not based on a careful documentation of MPA\u2019s recent membership statistics, but rather rested on a casual reference by MPA\u2019s general counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-5\">Q: In your opinion would the disclosure of those contributions, voluntary contributions, by individual MPA members to that have any effect on the continuation of those contributions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuKM\">A: It already has. We have several cases in which the unions have come out and publicized to certain employees in an organization campaign amounts which were given to the Voluntary Action Program or paid into MPA, and as a result they were exaggerated. The company answered those results \u2014 answered those accusations, but discontinued any further payments in the Voluntary Action Program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">(J.A. 83)</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">The skepticism with which we view this evidence of encroachment on MPA\u2019s first amendment rights is supported by several facts pointed out by the district court. First, knowledgeable persons in the industry already know which shops are unionized and which are not. Second, it is unlikely that competitors could derive useful information from knowing the amount of dues an employer pays to MPA. Finally, MPA itself concedes that the affiliation of employers who participate in the Craftsmanship Program is already known to their employees. Thus it is difficult to take seriously MPA\u2019s fears that disclosure will force a decline in membership.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">We conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 203(b)\u2019s disclosure and reporting requirements do not substantially burden MPA\u2019s rights of speech and association. Although we do not foreclose the possibility that on different facts the Act might create a substantial chill on a given organization\u2019s first amendment rights, we do not believe that MPA has established the type of record evidence <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of encroachment required to establish a \u201cdeterrent effect\u201d under <em>Buckley </em>and <em>NAACP v. Alabama.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-14\">Our conclusion that the district court did not clearly err in finding that MPA failed to establish a substantial burden on its first amendment rights is not the end of the inquiry. The allegations of chill here, while they are not substantial, are also not entirely inconsequential. A serious claim of infringement has been made. To survive the \u201cexacting scrutiny\u201d required by the Supreme Court, therefore, the government must show that the disclosure and reporting requirements are justified by a compelling government interest, and that the legislation is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is to these considerations that we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>i</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">The Supreme Court has \u201cacknowledged that there are governmental interests sufficiently important to outweigh the possibility of infringement, particularly when the \u2018free functioning of our national institutions\u2019 is involved.\u201d <em>Buckley, </em>424 U.S. at 66, 96 S.Ct. at 657, <em>quoting Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, </em>367 U.S. 1, 97, 81 S.Ct. 1357, 1411, 6 L.Ed.2d 625 (1961). Among the interests recognized by the Court as compelling are the \u201cdeterrence of actual corruption,\u201d 424 U.S. at 67, 96 S.Ct. at 657, and \u201cthe government\u2019s power to inform itself through investigations \u2018in order to act and protect its legitimate and vital interests.\u2019 \u201d <em>Marshall, </em>669 F.2d at 178 <em>quoting Gibson v. Florida Legislative Investigation Committee, </em>372 U.S. 539, 544, 83 S.Ct. 889, 892, 9 L.Ed.2d 929 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The legislative history and purpose behind the enactment of the LMRDA has been exhaustively reviewed by this Court in <em>Marshall v. Stevens People &amp; Friends, for Freedom, </em>669 F.2d 171 (4th Cir.1981), and by the Seventh Circuit in <em>Donovan, </em>699 F.2d 370 (affirming and adopting the opinion of the district court, 532 F.Supp. 1140 (N.D.Ill.) (1983). In <em>Marshall </em>we noted that the need for compelled disclosure under the Act grew out of Congressional findings that \u201cunion busting\u201d management middlemen were working with employers to undermine employee efforts to exercise their \u00a7 7 rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Senate committee conducting the investigation concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIxL\">[Fjrom recent investigations in the labor and management fields [we conclude] that there have been a number of instances of breach of trust, corruption, disregard of the rights of individual employees, and other failures to observe high standards of responsibility and ethical conduct which require further and supplementary legislation that will afford necessary protection of the rights and interests of employees and the public generally as they relate to the activities of labor organizations, employers, labor relations consultants, and their officers and representatives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-12\">[T]he enactment of this chapter [\u00a7 203(b)] is necessary to eliminate or prevent improper practices on the part of labor organizations, employers, labor relations consultants, and their officers and representatives which distort and defeat the policies of the Labor Management Relations Act____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-13\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401(b), 401(e) (declaration of findings, purposes, and policy).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-14\">Recognizing the corruption and bribery that these middlemen had been involved in,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and recognizing as well that the \u201cper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>suader business\u201d boded ill for an area of law that was already \u201cpervasively regulated\u201d to prevent a return to the \u201ceconomic warfare of the nineteenth century,\u201d <em>Donovan, </em>532 F.Supp. at 1148; <em>Price v. Wirtz, </em>412 F.2d 647 at 650 (5th Cir.1969), the Senate Committee recommended a comprehensive disclosure law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-5\">The committee believes that employers should be required to report their arrangements with these union-busting middlemen. Further, the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare has received evidence in prior hearings showing that large sums of money are spent in organized campaigns on behalf of some employers for the purpose of interfering with the right of employees to join or not to join a labor organization of their choice, a right guaranteed by the National Labor Relations Act. Sometimes these expenditures are hidden behind committees or fronts; however the expenditures are made, they are usually surreptitious because of the unethical content of the message itself____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-7\">Similarly, expenditures have been made in the past by employers surreptitiously and through labor spies, to obtain information about employees and unions. This type of activity certainly is not conducive to sound and harmonious labor relations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, S.Rep. No. 86-187, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. (1959), <em>reprinted in </em>[1959] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 2318, 2326-2327. The committee reasoned that even if all of the activity engaged in by management middlemen was not illegal, compelled disclosure would have a much needed remedial effect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-13\">All of the activities required to be reported by this section are not illegal nor are they unfair labor practices. However, since most of them are disruptive of harmonious labor relations and fall into a gray area, the committee believes that if an employer or a consultant indulges in them, they should be reported.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AT9\">S.Rep. at 2328.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-14\">It is clear from the Act\u2019s legislative history, therefore, that \u00a7 203 was enacted for the purpose of serving the twin \u201ccompelling\u201d governmental interests of deterring actual corruption and bolstering its own ability to investigate \u201cin order to act and protect.\u201d <em>Gibson, </em>372 U.S. at 544, 83 S.Ct. at 892.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, if in fact MPA has suffered a minimal infringement on its first amendment rights, that infringement is the consequence of government efforts to protect legitimate and important societal interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-15\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b821-16\">The governmental interests identified by Congress and enacted by the Secretary are unquestionably \u201csubstantially related\u201d to the disclosure scheme embodied in \u00a7 203. As a general matter, the Supreme Court has recognized that disclosure is an effective means of countering actual corruption and the appearance of corruption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-17\">Publicity is justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial diseases. Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light is the most efficient policeman.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-18\"><em>Buckley, </em>424 U.S. at 67, 96 S.Ct. at 657, <em>quoting </em>L. Brandeis, <em>Other People\u2019s Money </em>72 (1933). The disclosure requirements of \u00a7 203 provide much needed \u201csunlight\u201d in several ways. First, disclosure helps em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>ployees, \u201clike voters in an election,\u201d to understand the source of the information that is distributed. <em>Donovan, </em>532 F.Supp. at 1150. This type of exposure discourages potential abuse and dramatically reduces the appearance of impropriety in an area where there has been a demonstrated propensity for wrongdoing. Second, as the district court in <em>Donovan </em>noted, the LMRDA scheme ensures that the Secretary has the means to gather data and detect violations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-4\">The annual report serves as a crosscheck on the accuracy of the 30 day reports and serves to notify the Secretary of relationships between a persuader and employer which may give rise to a duty to file a 30 day report.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-5\"><em>Donovan, </em>532 F.Supp. at 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">iii</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">MPA insists that even if compelling government interests exist that are substantially related to the information required to be disclosed, the Act is not carefully tailored to achieve its purpose. According to MPA, employees who receive \u201cInsight\u201d know it is an MPA publication and appreciate the nature of MPA. Nothing is gained, therefore, by requiring the additional burden of comprehensive financial disclosure. In addition, MPA points out that although over 5,000 employers could be affected by \u00a7 203, only 900 companies were actually participating in the Craftsmanship Program at the time disclosure in this case was sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">We find these arguments unpersuasive. In enacting the LMRDA, Congress foresaw that only extensive, detailed exposure of covert management activities would limit abuses by middlemen. Reviewing the purposes behind the LMRDA in <em>Wirtz v. Fowler, </em>372 F.2d 315 (1966), the Fifth Circuit made this point effectively:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-13\">\u201cThis exposure [e.g. disclosure] was to include not only the fact that the consultant was paid by management, but why he was paid, how much he was paid, and the practices he engaged in to earn his pay. The aim was disclosure, but the method almost uniformly adopted to attain the end was reporting of these details, not the mere verbal acknowledgement by the consultant that he was hired by management as a persuader, a fact few employees would be too insensitive to grasp.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-14\"><em>Wirtz, </em>372 F.2d at 325.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is difficult to imagine how the Act could be effective if it required only disclosure of identity and not disclosure of financial information. Full financial disclosure, in our view, therefore, is not overkill; to the contrary, it is absolutely essential if the purposes behind the Act are to be fulfilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-15\">Similarly, we find little significance in the fact that the number of employers potentially affected by the disclosure requirement exceeded the number of companies enrolled in the Craftsmanship Program at the time compliance was sought. Congress believed management persuaders as a group were inherently suspect. In order to deter both actual corruption and the appearance of corruption, Congress concluded that it would be necessary to require the disclosure of a wide-ranging number of employers and activities, even if it meant reporting activities that were not improper. S.Rep. 187, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. at 10, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number><em>reprinted, in </em>[1959] U.S.Code &amp; Admin. News 2318, 2328 (1959). Clearly, those who participate in the Craftsmanship Program may be more likely to have conspired with MPA to persuade than those only tangentially involved in the \u201cpersuader business,\u201d but that is not a reason to restrict arbitrarily the scope of the disclosure \u201cspotlight.\u201d Indeed, if anything, the need for wide-ranging disclosure may be even more critical in the labor context because of the difficulty of distinguishing between persuader and nonpersuader activities. <em>See Price v. Wirtz, </em>412 F.2d 647, 650 (5th Cir.1969).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">In contrast to the position taken by MPA, we are impressed by the precision with which \u00a7 203(b) has been tailored to serve its purpose. The annual report, which deals with the less sensitive area of labor relations advice or services, does not require full disclosure of MPA\u2019s financial structure or of the content of the advice rendered. Only those receipts and disbursements specifically related to labor relations advice or services need be reported. Nor does \u00a7 203(b) require MPA to designate which employers named in the annual report are members and which are not. In the suspect area of actual persuasion, however, the Statute employs the 30 day report to ensure a more detailed and immediate disclosure. With each type of report the Statute requires only the information necessary to inform employees and the Secretary of the consultant\u2019s labor relations activities. In this way an individual or organization need provide no more than is absolutely necessary to further the twin goals of deterring corruption and permitting the government- to \u201cinform itself through investigations \u2018in order to act and protect its legitimate and vital interests\u2019.\u201d <em>Marshall, </em>669 F.2d at 178, <em>quoting Gibson v. Florida Legislative Investigation Committee, </em>372 U.S. 539, 544, 83 S.Ct. 889, 892, 9 L.Ed.2d 929 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">Our conclusion that \u00a7 203(b) is not over-broad is strongly supported by <em>Buckley, </em>for as the district court in <em>Donovan </em>pointed out, the LMRDA\u2019s disclosure scheme is \u201cremarkably similar\u201d to parts of the Federal Election Campaign Act that were held constitutional by the <em>Buckley </em>Court. Both statutes recognize that although most persuader activity or campaign contributions have no corrupting influence on labor relations or the political process respectively, rigorous and comprehensive reporting and record keeping requirements are necessary to combat the appearance of corruption. Thus both statutes impose a variety of requirements on virtually all types of campaign contributions and persuader activity respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-11\">Likewise, both statutory schemes implicitly recognize that if voters in an election or employees in a labor setting are to have some knowledge of where the information in a political or union election comes from, and if agencies charged with enforcement are to possess the means to detect violations of the FECA and LMRDA respectively, comprehensive disclosure requirements are essential. Thus both schemes require complete disclosure in the belief that \u201cgoldfish-bowl publicity\u201d, 412 F.2d at 650, will aid the government in \u201ccurbing the evils of [public] ignorance and corruption.\u201d 424 U.S. at 68, 96 S.Ct. at 658.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-12\">Finally, it is important to note that courts have been loathe to hold disclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>requirements overbroad with the same degree of frequency reserved for other laws that seek to restrict particular types of speech. Disclosure laws perform the important function of deterring actual corruption and avoiding the appearance of corruption, but unlike other types of restrictive laws they actually promote speech by making more information available to the public and thereby bolstering the \u201cmarketplace of ideas.\u201d <em>See First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, </em>435 U.S. 765, 791-92 at n. 2, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 1423-24 at n. 2, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978); <em>Kania v. Fordham, </em>702 F.2d 475 (4th Cir.1983).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">We now turn to MPA\u2019s second major contention that \u00a7 203(b) is impermissibly vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Vague laws may be found unconstitutional either because they violate basic principles of due process or because they impermissibly limit free speech. Due process may be offended in one of two ways: <em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 109, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2299, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972) (footnotes omitted). Free speech, in turn, may be offended if the uncertainty of the meaning of the statute causes a citizen to \u201csteer far wider of the unlawful zone ... than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked.\u201d <em>Grayned, </em>408 U.S. at 109, 92 S.Ct. at 2299, <em>quoting Speiser v. Randall, </em>357 U.S. at 526, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 1342, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Anp\">First, because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. Vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning. Second, if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them. A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">Here MPA argues that the vagueness of the term \u201cpersuade\u201d, as used in \u00a7 203(b), violates both its due process and first amendment rights. According to MPA, the statute does not make clear whether \u00a7 203(b) requires disclosure only if the merits of a particular union organizing campaign are discussed in an \u201cInsight\u201d article which is sent to employees involved in that particular campaign, or if disclosure is also required should \u201cInsight\u201d authors undertake to write about an organizing dispute in nonspecific terms. In MPA\u2019s view, the ambiguity of the statute violates due process because it is impossible for the Association to anticipate whether the distribution of \u201cInsight\u201d to employer members will be reportable. This \u201cvagueness\u201d also violates the Association\u2019s first amendment rights because, as MPA puts it, \u201cInsight\u201d writers have been forced to \u201csteer far wider of the unlawful zone\u201d than if the applicability of the statute had been clearly defined. MPA insists that the ambiguity has caused \u201cInsight\u201d writers to engage in \u201cself-censorship\u201d or \u201crefrain [entirely] from publishing articles which deal in any way with unions\u201d, even though some of the planned articles \u201cwould undoubtedly have fallen within the area of protected speech.\u201d 408 U.S. at 109, 92 S.Ct. at 2299.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>We are not convinced that \u00a7 203(b), as written, is impermissibly vague. A statute is not vague if \u201cit conveys sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices.\u201d <em>United States v. Petrillo, </em>332 U.S. 1, 8, 67 S.Ct. 1538, 1542, 91 L.Ed. 1877 (1947). The term \u201cpersuade\u201d meets this standard. As the district court found, \u201cpersuade is a common every day word \u2014 easily capable of being understood. Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary defines persuade as meaning \u201cto move by argument, entreaty, or expostulation to a belief, position, or course of action.\u201d We find nothing ambiguous or confusing about this definition. Indeed, in <em>Douglas v. Wirtz, </em>353 F.2d 30 (4th Cir.1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>383 U.S. 909, 86 S.Ct. 893, 15 L.Ed.2d 665 (1966), we noted that the term \u201cpersuade\u201d is commonly \u2014 and properly \u2014 used in many situations where reports are required by law. <em>Wirtz, </em>353 F.2d at 33-34. <em>See generally NLRB v. Gissel Packing, </em>395 U.S. 575, 620, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 1943, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969) (not unconstitutional or unreasonable to require an employer to distinguish among types of persuasive speech).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">The context in which the term is placed in the Statute is equally clear. Persuasion will trigger disclosure if it is made \u201cpursuant to any agreement or arrangement with an employer\u201d; if it is aimed at an employee; and if the subject of the persuasion is the exercise of an employee\u2019s right to organize or bargain collectively. By the plain terms of the Statute \u201cpersuasion\u201d can potentially be communicated through publication of an article discussing organizing on a theoretical level, or an article discussing the specifics of a particular organizing campaign. What matters is not the precise union dispute that is discussed, but rather whether the article is distributed pursuant to an agreement with an employer, and whether it is published with the <em>intention </em>to persuade employees about the merits of union organizing and collective bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-10\">MPA was well aware that it had entered into specific agreements with various employers to distribute \u201cInsight\u201d magazine. We find preposterous the suggestion made by MPA that its relationship to the employer-employee recipients of \u201cInsight\u201d is no different than that enjoyed by the <em>Wall Street Journal, Readers Digest, </em>and <em>U.S. News and World Report. </em>Clearly the Association remains on notice that any articles designed to \u201cpersuade\u201d employees one way or the other about open-shop arrangements will trigger disclosure, <em>regardless </em>of whether the persuader activity involves specific or theoretical organizing efforts, and regardless of whether the particular shop that received the material is the subject of the persuader material.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-11\">When MPA\u2019s vagueness argument is stripped to its essentials, it becomes nothing more than an admission that, in the words of the district court, \u201cInsights\u2019 \u201d authors are \u201cunable to write an article that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>merely informative ... as to conditions and technical advances in the industry, without at the same time taking a position in which [they] undertake] to persuade [their] readers.\u201d Given MPA\u2019s track record as an \u201cunabashedly anti-union\u201d trade association, we find it rather disingenuous for it to argue seriously that it is unable to distinguish speech designed to persuade from speech that is merely informational. As the district court so aptly put it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-4\">It may well be that an article containing [MPA\u2019s] point of view, written in a persuasive manner or factual information in the context of supporting that point of view, is more interesting than pure uneditorialized facts. But that [MPA\u2019s inability to distinguish the two] is not a problem of constitutional dimension.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-15\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-16\">Finally, MPA argues that the 30 day reporting requirements constitute an impermissible \u201cprior restraint\u201d on free speech. The district court held that the \u201cpersuader agreement\u201d occurs when MPA\u2019s members join the Craftsmanship program. Because a report must be filed under \u00a7 203(b) by MPA within 30 days after the member has joined the Craftsmanship program, and because this filing may be required before \u201cInsight\u201d is actually published, in certain circumstances MPA may in fact be required to comply with the reporting requirements \u201ceven when \u2018Insight\u2019 turns out to be totally innocuous.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief at 18. In MPA\u2019s view, therefore, requiring the Association to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>termine in advance of a publication date whether to make \u201cburdensome financial disclosure\u201d amounts to a prior restraint. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">We find no merit in this argument. As a general matter, prior restraints have only been held to exist where there is a direct restraint on speech. Commonly that restraint takes the form of a court order enjoining speech activity. <em>See Nebraska Press Association v. Stuart, </em>427 U.S. 539, 96 S.Ct. 2791, 49 L.Ed.2d 683 (1976); <em>New York Times Co. v. United States, </em>403 U.S. 713, 91 S.Ct. 2140, 29 L.Ed.2d 822 (1971); <em>Near v. Minnesota, </em>283 U.S. 697, 51 S.Ct. 625, 75 L.Ed. 1357 (1931).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This case simply does not involve a direct restraint. The Secretary does not seek to enjoin speech activity, but rather merely seeks disclosure. MPA remains free to distribute whatever it wants, provided it complies with the reporting and disclosure requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">The Supreme Court has never analyzed a disclosure law that may require persons to file reports before engaging in speech as a prior restraint. The Federal Election Campaign Act, for example, upheld in <em>Buckley, </em>requires committees and candidates to file reports of contributions received in excess of $1000 within 10 days of the calendar quarter in which the contributions are accepted. 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 434(a). The Act also imposes certain time limits for independent expenditures made after the fifteenth day before the election. 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 434(e). The filings must be made before the candidate or committee engages in \u201cspeech\u201d activity. The <em>Buckley </em>court held that the burdens imposed by these provisions, specifically \u00a7 434(e), were \u201cno prior restraint, but a reasonable and minimally restrictive method of furthering first amendment values by opening the basic processes of our federal election system to public view.\u201d <em>Buckley, </em>424 U.S. at 82, 96 S.Ct. at 664. Similarly, in <em>United States v. Harriss, </em>347 U.S. 612, 74 S.Ct. 808, 98 L.Ed. 989 (1954), the Supreme Court upheld the Federal Regulation of the Lobbying Act, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 261 <em>et seq., </em>which requires lobbyists (as defined in the statute) to register and make disclosure \u201cbefore doing anything in furtherance of this object.\u201d 347 U.S. at 616, n. 2, 74 S.Ct. at 811, n. 2. Clearly by the plain language of its opinion the Court refused to view the disclosure requirements as a prior restraint. We find nothing in the provisions of the LMRDA that leads this court to conclude that the disclosure provisions at issue here should be subjected to any different analysis than that employed by the Supreme Court in <em>Harriss </em>and <em>Buckley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-11\">The LMRDA was not conceived in haste. It represents a carefully considered and crafted legislative response to chronic and serious problems that have persistently plagued union-management relations and threatened the chances for industrial peace. The disclosure and reporting requirements of \u00a7 203(b) are an integral part of that effort to promote harmonious labor relations. Designed to deter corruption in an area that Congress concluded was \u201cinherently suspect\u201d and \u201csubject to abuse,\u201d these provisions are remarkably similar to other disclosure and reporting schemes upheld by the Supreme Court in related contexts. Just as the Federal Elections Campaign Act reviewed in <em>Buckley </em>and the Lobbying Act upheld in <em>Harriss </em>provided much needed sunlight in two areas prone to corrupt activity, so the disclosure provisions of the LMRDA expose \u201cpersuader activity\u201d to the effective \u201cdisinfectant\u201d of public scrutiny. <em>Buckley, </em>424 U.S. at 67, 96 S.Ct. at 657, <em>quoting </em>L. Brandeis, <em>Other People\u2019s Money </em>72 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-12\">Section 203(b) achieves its goal of disclosure in a manner that does not unconstitutionally burden first amendment rights of speech and association. When the four factors of the <em>Buckley </em>balancing test are carefully weighed, it is clear that the government\u2019s interests in the Statute are compelling, the degree of infringement is minimal, the purpose of the Statute is substantially related to its requirements, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>the level of disclosure required is carefully-tailored to the goals of the Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Likewise, \u00a7 203(b) defines the conduct that will trigger the disclosure and reporting requirements with sufficient precision to \u201cgive the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited,\u201d and when triggered the Statute does not impose a direct restraint on speech. Thus the Statute achieves its purpose without denying to MPA due process and first amendment rights protected under the vagueness doctrine, and without imposing a prior restraint on MPA\u2019s protected speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">For these reasons the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-7\">. Section 203(b) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act states in full that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-8\">Every person who pursuant to any agreement with an employer undertakes activities where an object thereof is, directly or indirectly\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-9\">(1) to persuade employees to exercise or not to exercise, or persuade employees as to the manner of exercising, the right to organize and bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-10\">(2) to supply an employer with information concerning the activities of employees or a labor organization in connection with a labor dispute involving such employer, except information for use solely in conjunction with an administrative or arbitral proceeding or a criminal or civil judicial proceeding; shall file within thirty days after entering into such agreement or arrangement a report with the Secretary, signed by its president and treasurer or corresponding principal officers, containing the name under which such person is engaged in doing business and the address of its principal office, and a detailed statement of the terms and conditions of such agreement or arrangement. Every such person shall file annually, with respect to each fiscal year during which payments were made as a result of such an agreement or arrangement, a report with the Secretary, signed by its president and treasurer or corresponding principal officers, containing a statement (A) of its receipts of any kind from employers on account of labor relations advice or services, designating the sources thereof, and (B) of its disbursements of any kind, in connection with such services and the purposes thereof.

Briscoe, </em>619 F.2d 391 (5th Cir.1980), as an example of a disclosure statute, allegedly similar to this one, that was found to infringe impermissibly on protected first amendment activity. We have already noted some of the differences between this case and <em>Familias Unidas. </em>See note 4 <em>supra. </em>To those considerations we add the observation that unlike the state statute in <em>Familias Unidas, </em>\u00a7 203(b) does not make membership in an organization grounds for disclosure. Rather it hinges disclosure on the existence of a relationship involving the supplying of labor relations advice between a persuader and an employer. Insofar as the purpose of \u00a7 203(b) is to focus public attention on all labor relations activities of persuaders, the reporting and disclosure provisions at issue here are more carefully tailored to the purposes of the underlying statute than those involved in <em>Familias Unidas.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b825-5\">. The district court made this point somewhat differently, but in our opinion, no less accurately when it took the position that as long as an agreement with a specific employer exists, persuader activity should be considered directed at the recipient employees even if the subject of the writing is a general anti-union discussion. In the district court\u2019s view, \u00a7 203(b) does not need the further limiting construction sought by MPA, for it is already specific enough in its application to specific employees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-6\">MPA argues under <em>Buckley </em>that the definition of \"persuade\" should be limited \u201cto activities directed towards a particular company\u2019s employer or to a specific union organizing campaign.\u201d Under \u00a7 203(b), however, the term \u201cpersuade\u201d is used only in connection with one who has entered into an \"agreement\u201d with an employer. Admittedly, \"Insight\" acts to \"persuade\u201d employees of the member employer under \u00a7 203(b) by publishing anti-union articles perhaps having another employer or union, or labor-management relations in general, as its subject matter. Nevertheless, MPA\u2019s having made an agreement with the member employer makes the publication\u2019s persuasive articles applicable to that specific employer and his employees. As far as adequately informing the plaintiff of its strictures, the statute meets any constitutional requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-13\">(J.A. at 10). Implicit in the district court\u2019s position is the same conclusion reached by this Court: namely, that if the term \"persuade\u201d is clear standing on its own, the use of that term in the context of the statute does not give MPA a valid claim under the vagueness doctrine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b826-5\">. MPA relies on <em>Thomas v. Collins, </em>323 U.S. 516, 65 S.Ct. 315, 89 L.Ed. 430 (1944), to argue that the term \"persuade\u201d is no more specific than the term \"solicit\u201d which was found \"imper-missibly vague\u201d by the Supreme Court in <em>Collins. </em>In <em>Collins </em>the State of Texas imposed a restraining order on a union organizer to prevent him from speaking to potential union members because he had not obtained a registration card. The relevant Texas statute required \u201c[a] II labor union organizers ... to file with the Secretary of State, before soliciting any members for his organization, a written request ... for an organizer\u2019s card____\u201d The Supreme Court held that because it would have been impossible for Thomas to give a speech advocating the union\u2019s cause without \"lauding unionism\u201d and thereby \"inviting\u201d or \"soliciting\u201d membership, the statute had the effect of restricting the content of Thomas\u2019 speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\"><em>Collins </em>is distinguishable from this case in several respects. First, the term solicit, as used in the Texas statute, had many plausible meanings, some of which overlapped with protected speech:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-9\">A speaker in such circumstances could avoid the words \"solicit\", \"invite\", \u201cjoin\u201d. It would be impossible to avoid the idea ____ How one might \u201claud unionism\u201d, as the State and the State Supreme Court concede Thomas was free to do, yet in these circumstances not imply an invitation, is hard to conceive. This is the nub of the case____ The feat would be incredible for a national leader, addressing such a meeting lauding unions and their principles, urging adherence to union philosophy, not also and thereby to suggest attachment to the union by becoming a member.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-14\"><em>Thomas, </em>323 U.S. at 534-35, 65 S.Ct. at 324-25. \"Persuade\", as defined in \u00a7 203(b), is far more precise. \"Persuader activity\u201d only triggers the statute if it takes place pursuant to an agreement with an employer, addresses itself to the subject of employee organizing rights and collective bargaining, and is directed at employees of an employer. In our view, the key term of \u00a7 203 is as carefully delineated, defined, and articulated as one could reasonably expect within a statutory framework. There is simply no comparison to the ambiguity surrounding the term \"solicit\u201d in the Texas statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-18\">Second, and more important, the consequence of triggering the Texas statute was to enjoin all speech: \"The threat of the restraining order, backed by the power of contempt, and of arrest for crime, hung over every word.\" <em>Id. </em>at 534, 65 S.Ct. at 324. A finding of \"persuader activity\u201d in the LMRDA context only triggers disclosure requirements. Thus even if protected speech were to trigger the statute, that speech would still be heard. Given the stark choice between an injunction or speech, a heavier burden rested on the drafters of the Texas statute to articulate the compelling government interests at stake and define terms as carefully as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-19\">Indeed, the vast majority of cases where the Supreme Court has found statutes to be imper-missibly vague involve situations where the statutory sanctions at issue curtailed all speech, or involve terms so vague as to proscribe inadvertently an extended range of activity. <em>See, e.g., Coates v. Cincinnati, </em>402 U.S. 611, 91 S.Ct. 1686, 29 L.Ed.2d 214 (1971) (striking down ordinance punishing individuals for conducting \"themselves in such a manner annoying to persons passing by ...\u201d); <em>Cox v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 536, 85 S.Ct. 453, 13 L.Ed.2d 471 (1965) (striking down ordinance prohibiting one from agitating \"to arouse from a state of repose, to molest, to interrupt, to hinder, to disquiet.\"). This clearly is not our case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b827-7\">. <em>Thomas v.
