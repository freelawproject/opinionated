R. 12(J) appeals by the state of Ohio from the granting of a motion to suppress evidence in a trial of the defendant on a charge of the possession of criminal tools, prohibited by R. C. 2923.24. Case C-76170 represents a purported direct appeal and Case C-76171 is before us pursuant to our granting of a motion for leave to appeal filed by the state, the two otherwise identical appeals being consolidated for purposes of argument and disposition herein. Preliminarily, we note the substantive deficiency in C-76170, the attempted direct appeal, and <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss the same on authority of <em>State </em>v. <em>Waller </em>(1976), 47 Ohio St. 2d 52. However, since the same issues are before use in C-76171, no impediment to the full resolution of the questions raised by the state is presented by such dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Proceeding next to the merits of the appeal by leave, the state presents a single assignment of error for review: that the trial court erred in granting the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. A review of the record received during the hearing on the motion to suppress reveals that two officers of the Cincinnati Police Department, while on routine patrol during the early morning hours of October 15, 1975, observed a 1973 white Thunderbird automobile traveling at an excessive rate of speed. After clocking the automobile for one-tenth of a mile at 44 m.p.h. in a 25 m.p.h. zone, the officers stopped the speeding ear with the intention of citing its operator for a speeding offense. After requesting the driver to exit from the car and noting his nervousness, one of the two officers recognized the oper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>ator as the defendant, a man whom he had a year earlier arrested for possession of bnrglar tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">As the defendant stood next to his ear, one of the officers noticed a bulge in the left trouser pocket of his \u201csnug\u201d clothing, which resembled a knife or weapon to the officer, and which occasioned some apprehension on the part of the officer, who then patted the defendant down. The officer testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">\u201cWhen I patted him down, I could feel the sharp end of this, and that\u2019s when I reached into his pocket and took it out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Upon removing the object, the officers found, instead of a knife, a tool which one of them recognized as a home-made device utilizing adjustable bent bobby pins in slots along a metal shaft designed to be used as a lock pick on coin operated machines. The defendant was thereupon placed under arrest for the possession of criminal tools, and a further search of his person was made. In addition, an inventory search of the automobile interior was made before the officers released the Thunderbird for towing to an impoundment area and, later, another search of the locked trunk was made, allegedly with the defendant\u2019s consent. Various incriminatory items of evidence were discovered and seized in these subsequent searches, all of which, together with the tool first recovered from defendant\u2019s pocket, were sought to be suppressed under the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">After hearing the above evidence,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the court granted the motion to suppress, stating its reason for the ruling, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">\u201cI don\u2019t think that factually there is any question that this was a proper action on the part of the police officers initially when they were stopping this defendant for violation of a traffic offense * * * I think also that at that time both officers had a right to conduct a personal search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>of the defendant * * * upon the theory that it is important to law enforcement that the individual police officer\u2019s safety be protected. For that reason, even.without a physical arrest, he is entitled to conduct such a search as will settle that question in his mind. Now, that is exactly what the police officer in this ease did. When they did conduct that search and they found that there was no dangerous instrument, their safety was not jeopardized and they weren\u2019t in peril.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-4\">\u201cThat is the end of the search. You can\u2019t go on from there, just because you find something else that predicated what your future conduct is.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Having thus found that the initial search and seizure of the tool to have been an unreasonable intrusion into the defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights, the trial court concluded that the balance of the evidence seized in subsequent searches automatically fell as fruit of the poisonous tree, without the necessity of an individual examination into the propriety or reasonableness of these later searches and seizures. The question here is therefore limited to the area ruled upon by the trial court \u2014 the correctness of the court\u2019s dispositive ruling on the admissibility of the initial search and seizure of the lock-pick tool.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">As to that issue, it is apparent that while the trial court believed the initial search to have been reasonable under the doctrine of <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1968), 392 U. S. 1, he concluded that the seizure of a non-weapon discovered during the course of the \u201cpat-down\u201d search was unreasonable. We disagree. The correct rule, which we believe to be sustained by both reason and authority, is that where a search is consistent in its inception with the dictates of the Fourth Amendment, a law enforcement officer may seize any contraband unearthed in the course of such a lawful search. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bell </em>(E. D. N. Y. 1971), 335 F. Supp. 797, 804. Here, the uncontradicted testimony of the police officer placed the initial pat-down search indisputably within the scope of <em>Terry, supra. </em>During the course of the pat-down, the officer felt the presence of a sharp knife-like object in the defendant\u2019s pocket, and removed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>it, as he had both the right and duty to do. Having so removed and examined it, he was under no duty we can discover to ignore the evidence provided by his senses that the article was contraband, and thence to return it to the defendant\u2019s pocket. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1947), 331 U. S. 145, overruled on other grounds; <em>Chimel </em>v. <em>California </em>(1969), 395 U. S. 752. On the contrary, having first lawfully uncovered the contraband pursuant to a reasonable search, the articles could properly be seized and subsequently used in evidence against the subject without doing violence to his Fourth Amendment rights. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moreno </em>(C. A. 5, 1973), 475 F. 2d 44, <em>certiorari denied, </em>414 U. S. 840; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bell, supra, certorari denied, 409 </em>U. S. 991; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lindsey </em>(C. A. 3, 1971), 451 F. 2d 701, <em>certiorari denied, </em>405 U. S. 995. The officers were under no compulsion to ignore one form of contraband merely because they expected to find, another. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bell, supra, </em>at 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\">It follows that the trial court erred in granting the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence of the lock-pick tool removed from the defendant\u2019s pocket, and in suppressing, as fruit of the poisonous tree, the balance of the articles seized.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s assignment of error is, therefore, well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b226-6\">Shannon, P.

S. 385, to work a suppression of evidence derivatively seized. <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>unreported, No. C-76480, First District Court of Appeals, decided December 20, 1976, n. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
