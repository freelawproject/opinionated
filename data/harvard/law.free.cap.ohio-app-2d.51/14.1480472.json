We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-11\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b32-12\">The state\u2019s evidence came from two police officers and three admitted prostitutes. The officers testified: that the defendant\u2019s bar, known as the Chatnoir Lounge, was a \u201chang-out\u201d for known prostitutes. The officers also stated that each of the prostitutes was known to them as prostitutes and that they had seen them operating in the area where the Chatnoir is located. One officer testified to seeing each of the girls go in and come out of the Chatnoir. The prosecuting witness, Shirley Johnson, and her friends, Rosetta Adkins and Una Mathews, admitted' being prostitutes with conviction records for soliciting. All three testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>fied that from, mid June to late July of 1974 Abe Katz charged them ten dollars per week for using his bar as a pickup place. for their patrons. They acknowledged that they paid some of the money during that period of time and successfully solicited patrons in the defendant\u2019s bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\u25a0 <em>Assignment of Error No.l</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-6\">\u201cThe trial court committed reversible error in denying Katz\u2019s motion for acquittal after the city rested because the city failed' to present corroborative evidence of the specific crime alleged as required in order to meet its burden of proof as provided in <em>Akron City Code </em>\u00a7606.23 (d).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">The. law in Ohio is that a \u201cconviction may be based upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, <em>except where otherwise specifically provided by </em>statute.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Flonnory </em>(1972), 31 Ohio St. 2d 124, paragraph 3 of the syllabus. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">Akron Ordinance 606.23(d) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-9\">\u201cNo person shall be convicted of complicity under this section solely upon the testimony <em>of an accomplice, </em>unsupported by other evidence.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">This ordinance is worded identically with E. C. 2923.-03. Therefore, corroborating testimony is necessary. It was supplied by the testimony of Una Mathews and Eosetta Adkins. They were not accomplices to the crimes of Shirley Johnson, which the defendant allegedly aided and abetted. They supplied the corroboration by connecting Katz to Johnson by offering proof that he was charging prostitutes ten dollars per week to operate in his bar. <em>State </em>v. <em>Starr </em>(1970), 24 Ohio App. 2d 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-11\">\n<em>Assignment of Error No. 2</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-12\">\u201cThe trial court committed reversible error in denying Katz\u2019s motion for acquittal because the proof presented by the city as a matter of law did not show a violation of <em>Akron City Code </em>\u00a7606.23.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-13\">Judge Washburn, in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>State </em>(1931), 41 Ohio App. 64, 67, stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-14\">\u201cMere approval or acquiescence, without expressed concurrence or the doing of something to contribute to an unlawful act, is not an aiding or abetting of the act, <em>State </em>v. <em>Peasley, </em>79 Wash., 99, 141 P., 316.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>\u201cWithout previous connection with the transaction, one is not an aider or abettor unless1 he knowingly does something which he ought not to do, or omits to do something he ought to do, which assists or tends in some way to affect the doing of the thing which the law forbids; in order to aid or abet, whether by words, acts, encourage-ment, support or presence, there must be something more than a failure to object unless one is under a legal duty to object. ###\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">While we are in accord with this as \u00e1 general statement of law, its application to the instant case is predicated on a factual determination that this defendant did not express \u201cconcurrence or [do] something to contribute to an unlawful act\u201d Whether the defendant charged- the prostitute ten dollars for the privilege of soliciting patrons in defendant\u2019s business establishment was proper jury question. We will not substitute our judgment for that of the jury, which is supported by credible evidence. See, 3 Ohio Jurisprudence 2d 817, Appellate Review, Section 820. We hold that the act of charging a prostitute a sum of money and then, after payment, allowing her to solicit patrons in one\u2019s bar constitutes an expression of encouragement and support. Such act is sufficient to-be the \u201cconcurrence or the doing of something to contribute to an unlawful act\u201d for which a conviction for complicity will lie under Akron Ordinance 606.23. Both assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b34-6\">Victor, P. J., and Brenneman, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
