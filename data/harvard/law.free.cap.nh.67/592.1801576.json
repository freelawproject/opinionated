It being found that one of the defendants, with the approval of the others, in attempting the removal of the fence, injured the plaintiff by a want of due care in striking the rail against which she was leaning, the plaintiff recovered judgment.</summary>\n\n<attorneys id=\"b620-12\"><em>Fling </em>if- <em>Chase, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b620-13\"><em>George A.
