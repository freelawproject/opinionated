The mandate was filed in the Court of Claims and application was made for judgment without the interest. Before the court acted upon this application, the act of February 13, 1895, authorizing the original judgment, was repealed, and the Court of Claims declined to enter judgment as prayed for. The claimant thereupon applied to this court for a mandamus to require the Court of Claims to enter jrrdgment.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b686-8\">The application for a writ of mandamus is denied. The Supreme Court holds that the effect of the repealing act was to take away the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims to proceed further in any case founded upon the repealed act; but that this court did not intimate by this decision that that court would not have jurisdiction to entertain and grant a motion on the part of the petitioner to reinstate the original judgment.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b686-9\">Mr. Justice Peckham</author>\n<p id=\"AFp1\">delivered the opinion of the Supreme Court, May 10, 1897.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
