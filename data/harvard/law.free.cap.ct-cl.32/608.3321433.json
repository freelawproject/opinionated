Upon tbis item the court below is reversed on the ground that it was the intent of the statute that for the purpose of making up the record as a history of the case the entire record shall be taken as one instrument.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-5\">The next disputed item was the allowance of a fee of $2 \u201cin a cause where issue is joined but no testimony is given.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-6\">The defendants claim that a plea of not guilty having been withdrawn, a plea of guilty subsequently entered and judgment entered on such plea, the allowance was illegal.
