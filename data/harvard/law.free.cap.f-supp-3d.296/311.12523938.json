Plaintiffs identify themselves as about four B Pool growers and approximately forty-seven independent cranberry growers located in Oregon, Wisconsin, and Massachusetts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In their Fourth Amended Complaint, plaintiffs bring three claims: (1) that Ocean Spray engaged in unfair and deceptive acts in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, \u00a7 11, thereby injuring the independent growers (Count I); (2) that Ocean Spray engaged in a pattern of anti-competitive conduct in violation of section 2 of the Sherman Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , thereby injuring both B pool and independent growers (Count II); and (3) that Ocean Spray retaliated against certain plaintiffs in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, \u00a7 11 (Count III). Docket # 253, at 21-26. Ocean Spray moves for summary judgment on Counts I and II. Docket # 254. A number of plaintiffs move for partial summary judgment on Count I. Docket # 260. Ocean Spray moves to defer or deny plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. Docket # 268.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As relevant to the instant motions, the cranberry industry is composed of three groups: growers, handlers, and consumers. Growers produce raw cranberries. Handlers process raw cranberries into consumer products (such as juice and sweetened dried cranberries) and commodity ingredients (such as cranberry concentrate or frozen cranberries). They then sell the resulting products. Consumers are either households or food processing companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ocean Spray, a cooperative comprised of more than 700 grower members,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   is the largest cranberry handler in North America. It sells both branded cranberry products, including Craisins\u00ae and Ocean Spray beverages, and unbranded commodity ingredients, including cranberry concentrate. The Ocean Spray cooperative divides growers into two \"pools\": the A Pool and B Pool. Both pools deliver raw cranberries to Ocean Spray. A Pool growers deliver fruit that is largely used for Ocean Spray's branded products for which they receive a share of the net proceeds arising from these products; B Pool growers deliver cranberries and then receive a share of Ocean Spray's net proceeds from its resulting unbranded commodity ingredients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Growers outside of the Ocean Spray cooperative (\"independent growers\") deliver cranberries to \"independent handlers.\" These handlers generally purchase the cranberries from the growers for a specific price, though the price may not be agreed at the time the growers deliver the fruit. One independent handler, Cranberries Limited, Inc. (\"CLI\"), has a Toll Processing Agreement (\"TPA\") with Ocean Spray. Under the TPA, Ocean Spray processes CLI's cranberries into concentrate at an Ocean Spray facility for a fee. Ocean Spray then returns the concentrate to CLI who markets it. The TPA provides that Ocean Spray will buy back whatever concentrate CLI cannot sell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Beginning in 2009, Ocean Spray began selling concentrate through auctions. At these auctions, Ocean Spray offers a fixed amount of concentrate at a given price, and buyers submit bids for a given volume at that price. If the total volume of concentrate bids exceed the volume offered at the auction, the auctioneer raises the price, and the buyers submit new bids. This process continues until the aggregate volume of the bids is less than or equal to the volume of concentrate offered at the auction. At this point, each buyer purchases its bid volume at the auction's closing price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 27, 2012, \"John Doe Growers 1-7\" and \"John Doe B Pool Grower 1\" filed a putative class action with seven counts against Ocean Spray. Docket # 1. The procedural history of the case since then is lengthy and involved. To summarize, plaintiffs amended their complaint a number of times, adding, inter alia, named plaintiffs and additional counts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket ## 28, 29, 34, 44. Ocean Spray moved to dismiss all counts, Docket # 47, a motion I allowed in part and denied in part, Docket # 78. Subsequently, plaintiffs sought partial summary judgment on two of the remaining counts, Docket # 102, and Ocean Spray moved for summary judgment on all remaining counts, Docket # 115. I denied plaintiffs' motion, and I allowed Ocean Spray's motion in part and denied it in part, allowing three of plaintiffs' claims to go forward. Docket # 143.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs moved to certify a proposed class of \"[a]ll domestic independent cranberry farmers and all B-Pool members of Ocean Spray who received payment during the period August 2009 to the present for cranberries delivered to a handler for the purpose of processing the cranberries into\n   concentrate.\" Docket # 195. I denied their motion on May 10, 2016. Docket # 222. Following the denial of class certification, plaintiffs further amended their complaint, ultimately resulting in the current Fourth Amended Complaint. Docket # 253.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Specifically, Ocean Spray argues that plaintiffs complain that the manipulation occurred in the handler-consumer concentrate market through the auction, while plaintiffs' alleged injury occurred in the grower-handler market. Accordingly, Ocean Spray claims that any injury plaintiffs suffer \"is merely 'collateral damage' flowing out of alleged anticompetitive conduct in a market in which plaintiffs do not participate.\" Docket # 255, at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   To be clear, as I explained in my 2015 decision, the relevant claim here is one for monopsonization, the consolidation of a market into one buyer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket # 143, at 8, 11 n.7. The claim is that Ocean Spray, as a \"buyer,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   fixed the price of fruit below the market price and below the growers' cost of production.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket # 253, at \u00b6 24. This is a distinct claim from plaintiffs' monopolization claim: that Ocean Spray-as a handler or seller-fixed the price of concentrate. I allowed Ocean Spray's motion for summary judgment on the monopolization claim in 2015; it is no longer before me. For purposes of plaintiffs' monopsonization claim, suppliers (such as the B pool growers) walk in the same shoes as customers in a traditional monopolistic market. Docket # 143, at 11. And consumers in the monopolistic market are among the \"presumptively ... proper plaintiffs to allege antitrust injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Serpa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1753171\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/199/6/#p9\">\n    199 F.3d at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, at least the B pool growers, as suppliers, would presumptively have standing to pursue their monopsony claim. Ocean Spray's assertion seems to be that because the amount of proceeds it gives its growers is directly tied to the auction price for concentrate, and the auction takes place in a different market, the growers should not have standing.

However, even employing a narrow reading of\n   <em>\n    McCready\n   </em>\n   , I find that for purposes of avoiding summary judgment, B pool plaintiffs have established a potential antitrust injury.

Accordingly, for purposes of their\n   <em>\n    monopsonization\n   </em>\n   claim, the plaintiffs can contend that they participated \"in the very market directly distorted by the antitrust violation,\"\n   <em>\n    SAS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7407100\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/48/39/#p43\">\n    48 F.3d at 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Nonetheless, Ocean Spray maintains that because the auction, which is the means by which it allegedly fixed cranberry prices, occurred in the handler-consumer market, the growers cannot show antitrust injury in the grower-handler market. It relies in part on a case from the Second Circuit,\n   <em>\n    In re Aluminum Warehousing Antitrust Litigation\n   </em>\n   , which held that \"to suffer antitrust injury, the putative plaintiff must be a participant in the very market that is directly restrained,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4352261\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/151/#p161\">\n    833 F.3d 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 161 (2d Cir. 2016).

For purposes of this motion, I count each of the bullet points in the \"Parties\" section as a plaintiff, totaling fifty-one plaintiffs.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Plaintiffs contend that Ocean Spray should not be considered an agricultural cooperative because it does not attempt to maximize returns for all of its members.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Docket # 283, at 2. Rather, plaintiffs maintain that Ocean Spray is a \"Consumer Products Company.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204083333\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Because Ocean Spray has cooperative marketing agreements with its growers, under which growers deliver fruit and Ocean Spray agrees to market 100% of the fruit, I refer to Ocean Spray as a cooperative, regardless of whether Ocean Spray does indeed try to maximize profits for all of its members. Further, Ocean Spray maintains it is a qualified cooperative under Subchapter T of the Internal Revenue Code.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    As explained in my 2015 Memorandum of Decision, monopsonization describes consolidation of a market into one buyer, and like monopolization, is a violation of section 2 of the Sherman Act.

Ocean Spray then tells the individual bidders on how much concentrate they are allowed to bid. After the auction closes, plaintiffs claim, Ocean Spray sells bidders additional concentrate.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    In their complaint, plaintiffs allege that \"[t]he Board is dominated by A Pool growers-eight of the thirteen member-directors have exclusively A Pool acreage. The five remaining member-directors have acres in the A Pool and the B Pool and all have a sizable majority in the A Pool.\" Docket # 253, at \u00b6 30.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Ocean Spray has previously moved for summary judgment on this basis,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Docket # 115, and I denied its motion with respect to plaintiffs' monopsonization count, Docket # 143, at 13. Ocean Spray maintains that \"[s]ince that time, the parties have undertaken discovery that establishes, beyond dispute, that [plaintiffs'] allegations are not true.\" Docket # 255, at 9. In addition, Ocean Spray relies on recent case law from the Second Circuit, which Ocean Spray claims \"makes clear that plaintiffs here lack antitrust injury in addition to alleging injuries that are too remote.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 9-10.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Ocean Spray also moves for summary judgment on the basis that \"as a matter of economic reality,\" it cannot be a monopsonist because it is not a \"buyer\" of cranberries but rather gives the growers proceeds from the products it sells. Docket # 255, at 22-23. Here, the nature of the alleged conspiracy is that Ocean Spray allegedly artificially depressed concentrate prices at least in part to generate lower returns for B pool growers. That is, it allegedly functioned as a purchaser of cranberries, compensating growers using the proceeds from the auction. Whether plaintiffs will ultimately prevail on their theory at trial, absent case law to support Ocean Spray's contention, Ocean Spray is not entitled to summary judgment on this issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    At the July 13, 2017, hearing, Ocean Spray maintained that there were no B pool growers left in the case, notwithstanding that plaintiffs' Fourth Amended Complaint includes two B pool growers as plaintiffs. Ocean Spray has provided no evidence that these plaintiffs are not B pool growers or explanation of why their claims are no longer relevant. Accordingly, I analyze whether these B pool growers have standing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    <em>\n     See supra\n    </em>\n    note 6.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Relying on this decision and its reasoning, the district court later held that first level purchasers of aluminum did not suffer an antitrust injury either.\n    <em>\n     In re Aluminum Warehousing Antitrust Litig.\n    </em>\n    , No. 13-md-2481 (KBF),\n    <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205818585\">\n     2016 WL 5818585\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *1, *8 (S.D.N.Y.
