Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On June 25, 2015, Plaintiff Douglas Reeves, a trades helper in the City of Philadelphia Street Lighting Department, was injured in a car accident while a passenger in a city-owned truck. At the time of the accident, he was on his way from a work meeting to that day's job site. After settling a personal injury claim against the driver of the other car, he sought underinsured motorist benefits from Defendant Travelers Companies, which were denied. The Court now\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's motion for summary judgment (ECF 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   From 2012 to the date of the accident on June 25, 2015, Plaintiff Douglas Reeves (\"Plaintiff\") worked as a \"trades helper\" assisting electronic technicians in the City of Philadelphia Street Lighting Department (\"Department\"). (ECF 17-2 at 65). At the time of the accident, Plaintiff lived in Philadelphia with his mother. A 2006 Mercury Mariner was jointly titled in Plaintiff's and his mother's names, insured by Defendant Travelers Companies (\"Defendant\") pursuant to Policy No. 984318670 101 1 (\"the Policy\") (ECF 17-2 at 1). Plaintiff testified that although only his mother was listed on the Policy and paid the premiums, he alone drove the Mariner. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59-61).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On a typical work day, he would drive to the Department offices and maintenance facility at 701 Ramona Street, where a supervisor would pass out a \"trouble report\" describing an issue with street lighting somewhere in the city of Philadelphia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 70-74). After assembling the necessary supplies, such as light bulbs, from a warehouse, he would load a Department truck to travel to the job site. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 74-75). At the time of the accident in June 2015, the fleet consisted of roughly seventeen vehicles of various types: seven bucket trucks, two utility trucks, two line trucks, and six pickup trucks. (ECF 17-3 at 48). Plaintiff, who did not use the same truck every day, was assigned by one of his superiors to one of these trucks depending on the task to be done. (ECF 17-2 at 77). Plaintiff estimated that he stayed\n   behind at the Ramona Street location only once or twice per month; on all other work days he worked at remote job sites. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He also estimated that he would drive city-owned trucks \"maybe once or twice\" a month, or 10% of the time; the remainder of the time he rode as a passenger. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 83-84). Because he lacked a commercial driver's license, he was unable to drive all but a few of the trucks in the fleet. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 84-85).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On the day of the accident, Plaintiff was a passenger in a city-owned truck driven by a co-worker. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 89). While stopped on JFK Boulevard, the truck in which Plaintiff was traveling was struck by another vehicle, causing a lower back injury and nerve damage to Plaintiff, for which he is still being treated. (ECF at 17-3 at 31). Plaintiff subsequently missed some five weeks of work. (ECF 17-2 at 93).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff settled a tort claim against the driver, and then sought underinsured motorist benefits from Defendant under the terms of the Policy on January 7, 2016 (ECF 17-4 at 3). On February 4, 2016, Defendant denied coverage by letter to Plaintiff, invoking the \"regular use exception\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    EXCLUSIONS\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   B.

Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On November 9, 2016, Plaintiff filed suit in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, alleging breach of contract and bad faith in handling his insurance claim. (ECF 1 at 13-60). Defendant timely removed to this Court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-11). On April 11, 2017, the Court denied Defendant's motion to bifurcate proceedings and stay proceedings on the bad faith claim. (ECF 15, 16). Defendant's motion for summary judgment is presently before the Court. (ECF 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A court \"shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Plaintiff\n   argues that the regular use exception nevertheless should not apply because he performed his core duties as a trades helper outside the truck in which he was riding at the time of the accident, and was allowed to drive only three out of seventeen vehicles in the Department fleet. Although situations often arise where an insured, such as a police officer, is injured while riding in a vehicle in which he carries out essential job functions, courts have applied \"regular use\" exceptions where the insured was injured while traveling to a job site where the work would be performed outside the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%20603416\">\n    2004 WL 603416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *1 (park employee, who was not allowed to drive park commission vehicles, injured on the way to a job site);\n   <em>\n    Costello v.

Pa. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Even were that not the case, summary judgment is warranted on Plaintiff's bad faith claim. Under the Pennsylvania bad faith statute, 42 Pa. Const. Stat. \u00a7 8371, the party \"seeking to prove a bad faith claim must establish by clear and convincing evidence that the insurance company acted in bad faith without a reasonable basis for denying the claim, and\n   that it knowingly or recklessly disregarded its lack of a reasonable basis to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Lockhart v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

See (ECF 17-4 at 1-5). In such circumstances, there is no basis for finding that Defendant acted in bad faith, and summary judgment is proper.\n   <em>\n    Costello\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%201254273\">\n    2010 WL 1254273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.

An appropriate order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Plaintiff further argues that this situation did not represent a situation of \"uncompensated risk\" because Defendant knew that he worked for the City of Philadelphia and knew or should have known that he would have to drive to job sites across the city. However, he does not provide any record support for this assertion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
