He received a $262,500 loan (the \"Subject Loan\") from lender Taylor, Bean &amp; Whitaker Mortgage Corp. (\"TBW\").

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-16\">\n      In June 2016, Stewart filed this lawsuit against Independent and Lewis. Stewart asserted claims for breach of contract and negligence against Independent based on Independent's alleged failure to record the Subject DOT.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 32-45.

The Court ordered that all pleadings and dispositive motions filed by Stewart, as they relate to the breach of contract claim against Lewis, be deemed adopted by Independent.
