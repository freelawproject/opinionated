BATES, United States District Judge <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"195\" href=\"#p195\" id=\"p195\">*195</a>Independent Settlement Services, LLC, (\"Independent\") alleges that Jimmy Lewis failed to make payments required under a promissory note that he executed when he refinanced a property in Washington, D.C. Independent has moved for summary judgment on the only remaining claim in this action, i.e., the breach of contract claim against Lewis. Because there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and Independent has shown that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the Court will grant the motion.</p><p id=\"p-10\"><em><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></em></p><p id=\"p-11\"><strong>I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong></p><p id=\"p-12\">In November 2007, Lewis decided to refinance a property that he owned in Washington, D.C. He received a $262,500 loan (the \"Subject Loan\") from lender Taylor, Bean &amp; Whitaker Mortgage Corp. (\"TBW\"). In return, he executed a promissory note (the \"Subject Note\") that memorialized the terms of the loan and a deed of trust (the \"Subject DOT\") to secure repayment of the Subject Note with a lien against the property. <em>See</em> Subject Note, Ex. 2 to Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. [ECF No. 25-3]; Subject DOT, Ex. 3 to Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. [ECF No. 25-4]. Independent conducted the closing and issued a title insurance commitment to TBW, which committed Stewart Title Guaranty Company (\"Stewart\") to insure the Subject DOT as a lien against the property. <em>See</em> Am. Compl. [ECF No 10] \u00b6 11; Independent's Answer to Am. Compl. [ECF No. 18] \u00b6 11. Although Independent received funds for the payment of recording fees and taxes, <em>see</em> Am. Compl. \u00b6 13; Independent's Answer to Am. Compl. \u00b6 13, the Subject DOT was not recorded in the District of Columbia land records, <em>see</em> 1st Aff. of J. Thurbee, Ex. 4 to Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. [ECF No. 25-5] \u00b6 8.</p><p id=\"p-13\">In or around May 2013, Lewis sold the property to Elston Johnson. 1st Aff. of J. Thurbee \u00b6 10. Lewis continued to make monthly payments on the Subject Loan through July 2013, at which point his outstanding balance was $243,785.36. 2nd Aff. of J. Thurbee, Ex. 1 to Pl.'s Reply [ECF No. 28-1] \u00b6 4. Thereafter, he made no further payments and, according to Stewart's calculations, he now owes more than $300,000, including unpaid principal, interest, and late fees. <em>Id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.</p><p id=\"p-14\">In November 2013, Cenlar (then the holder of the Subject Note) submitted a claim for coverage under the title insurance commitment when it discovered that the Subject DOT had not been recorded. 1st Aff. of J. Thurbee \u00b6 9; <em>see</em> Notice of Title Claim, Ex. 5 to Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. [ECF No. 25-6].<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After Stewart confirmed that the Subject DOT was not recorded, <em>see</em> 1st Aff. of J. Thurbee \u00b6 10, it contacted Independent to inquire whether there was any factual or legal reason that it should not settle the claim. Independent advised that there was no factual or legal defense, <em>see</em> Ex. 6 to Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. [ECF No. 25-7]; consequently, Stewart settled the claim by paying Nationstar $262,500 in exchange for an assignment of the Subject Note. Nationstar executed an allonge transferring the Subject Note to Stewart, and delivered the original copy of the Subject Note to Stewart. 1st Aff. of J. Thurbee \u00b6\u00b6 12-14; Sale &amp; Assignment Agreement, Ex. 7 to Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</strong></p><p id=\"p-16\">In June 2016, Stewart filed this lawsuit against Independent and Lewis. Stewart asserted claims for breach of contract and negligence against Independent based on Independent's alleged failure to record the Subject DOT. <em>See</em> Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 32-45. Stewart asserted a claim for breach of contract against Lewis based on his alleged failure to make required payments under the terms of the Subject Note. <em>Id.</em> \u00b6\u00b6 46-51. Stewart moved for summary judgment on its claims, <em>see</em> Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. [ECF No. 25], and Independent and Lewis separately opposed the motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-17\">After the summary judgment briefing was completed, Stewart and Independent entered a settlement agreement and Stewart voluntarily dismissed with prejudice all claims against Independent. <em>See</em> Stip. of Dismissal with Prejudice [ECF No. 31]. Pursuant to the settlement, Stewart transferred its interest in the breach of contract claim against Lewis to Independent. <em>See</em> Feb. 16, 2018 Order [ECF No. 37] at 2. Independent filed a motion to substitute \"in the place and stead of Stewart\" as plaintiff in this action, <em>see</em> Consent Mot. to Substitute [ECF No. 32], and the Court granted that motion, <em>see</em> Feb. 16, 2018 Order at 3. The Court ordered that all pleadings and dispositive motions filed by Stewart, as they relate to the breach of contract claim against Lewis, be deemed adopted by Independent. Feb. 16, 2018 Order at 3. The sole issue, then, is whether Independent is entitled to summary judgment on the breach of contract claim against Lewis.</p><p id=\"p-18\"><em><strong>LEGAL STANDARD</strong></em></p><p id=\"p-19\">Summary judgment is appropriate where \"the movant shows there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). \"The mere existence of some factual dispute is insufficient on its own to bar summary judgment; the dispute must pertain to a 'material' fact.\" <em>Etokie v.

Hence, \"[o]nly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.\" <em>Anderson v.

Summary judgment may not \"be avoided based on just any disagreement as to the relevant facts; the dispute must be 'genuine,' meaning that there must be sufficient admissible evidence for a reasonable trier of fact to find for the non-movant.\" <em>Etokie</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12179802\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/202/139/#p145\">202 F.Supp.3d at 146</extracted-citation> (quoting <em>Anderson</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">477 U.S. at 248</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">106 S.Ct. 2505</extracted-citation> ).</p><p id=\"p-20\">\"A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support that assertion by\" either \"citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits, ... or other materials\" or \"showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute ....\" Fed.

Conclusory assertions offered without any factual basis in the record <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"197\" href=\"#p197\" id=\"p197\">*197</a>cannot create a genuine dispute. <em>See</em> <em>Ass'n of Flight Attendants-CWA v.

Cir. 2016).</p><p id=\"p-21\">When deciding a motion for summary judgment, a court must regard the non-movant's statements as true and accept all evidence and make all inferences in the non-movant's favor. <em>See</em> <em>Anderson</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">477 U.S. at 255</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">106 S.Ct. 2505</extracted-citation>. Moreover, a court may not \"make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence.\" <em>Lopez v. Council on American-Islamic Relations Action Network, Inc.</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310496,4324771\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/492/\">826 F.3d 492</extracted-citation>, 496 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (citation omitted). Ultimately, a court must determine \"whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\" <em>Anderson</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">477 U.S. at 251-52</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">106 S.Ct. 2505</extracted-citation>.

J. at 11. To prevail on a claim for breach of contract under District of Columbia law, a plaintiff must establish: (1) a valid contract between the parties, (2) an obligation or duty arising out of the contract, (3) breach of that obligation or duty, and (4) damages caused by that breach. <em>See</em> <em>Brown v. Sessoms</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4285265,4340868\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/1016/\">774 F.3d 1016</extracted-citation>, 1024 (D.C.

His statements that he has \"complied with all Federal, State, and Local laws with respect to this matter,\" and that the \"[l]egal records reveal nothing whatsoever on [his] behalf to precipitate this predicament,\" Lewis' Am. Opp'n to Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 1, are conclusory assertions offered without any factual basis in the record-thus, they do not create a genuine dispute of material fact, <em>Ass'n of Flight Attendants-CWA</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4239272,7329999\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/564/462/\">564 F.3d at </extracted-citation>465-66 ; <em>Hussain v.

Cir. 2006) (conclusory allegations contained in a party's own affidavit do not create a genuine issue of material fact). His bare assertion that all of Independent's stated material facts are \"disputed,\" <em>see</em> Lewis' Opp'n to Mot. for Summ. J. at 1, does not cite any record evidence that shows a genuine dispute of fact. A party cannot render a fact \" 'disputed' by merely labeling it so.\" <em>Louis v.
