(\"StoneMor\") which provides funeral and cemetery services and products. Defendants include StoneMor; StoneMor G.P.; StoneMor GP's parent company, American Cemeteries Infrastructure Investors, LLC (\"ACII\"); and the controlling shareholder-executives (\"Defendants\"). CAC \u00b6 25-37, ECF No. 67. Plaintiffs are investors who purchased common units of StoneMor between March 15, 2012 and October 27, 2016 (the \"Class Period\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. The Amended Complaint contains two counts. Count One alleges violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10(b)5 promulgated thereunder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 101. Count Two alleges violations of Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 102.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On February 21, 2017, the Court appointed Fremont Investor Group (\"FIG\") as lead counsel, and approved FIG's selection of counsel. ECF No. 64. On April 24, 2017, FIG filed an amended consolidated class action complaint (\"Complaint\"). ECF No. 67. On June 8, 2017, Defendants moved to dismiss. ECF No. 68. For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff alleges the following facts, all of which are presumed to be true for purposes of resolving the motion to dismiss. During the Class Period, Defendants issued materially false and misleading statements regarding its business and financial performance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 130-31, 136, 209-10. The alleged purpose of these statements was to create the appearance that Defendants were economically able to meet \"their\n   <em>\n    primary corporate purpose\n   </em>\n   : the regular, quarterly distribution\" of available cash to investors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1 (emphasis in original). Plaintiffs claim that, unbeknownst to investors, StoneMor was actually \"severely cash-strapped\" during the Class Period, and only able to pay its generous distributions through \"an elaborate financial ruse.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2. In essence, the \"ruse\" was that StoneMor paid the distributions from its revolving credit facility, which in turn was paid down through\n   the proceeds from a series of equity offerings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that they were misled into believing that the primary source of distribution funds was \"operating cash flow,\" when, in reality, cash to fund distributions was \"almost entirely dependent\" on StoneMor's \"ability to sell equity in the capital markets.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. StoneMor's business plan was to aggressively acquire cemeteries and immediately build a \"pre-need\" sales program by selling to customers who are still alive, but want to pre-arrange their own funeral arrangements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. However, state law requires that the majority of the total pre-need sales proceeds be kept in trust until the actual burial services are performed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Thus, StoneMor could not access most of the cash from pre-need sales until after the customer died.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Because pre-need sales were such a large portion of StoneMor's business strategy, the inaccessibility of cash from them created a substantial disparity between overall sales and actual incoming cash.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. Under GAAP\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   principles, cash from pre-need sales would not be represented as assessable cash.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. However, StoneMor did not rely solely on GAAP metrics to court investors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. Instead, StoneMor also presented investors with non-GAAP figures it had created, which showed sales and costs for each period, but did not subtract the cash in trust.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 7, 11-12, 14. According to the Plaintiffs, the difference between the actual available cash and the non-GAAP measures of apparently available cash (that was still in trust) was unknown to investors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. Plaintiffs further claim that the difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP measures \"intentionally gave the impression that StoneMor was generating sufficient operating cash flow to justify...the cash distributions\" and concealed the \"material divergence between the cash distribution payments and the amount and timing of revenue and cash flows generated from operations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14, 69. But, accurate GAAP measurements consistently appeared alongside the non-GAAP ones.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs allege that StoneMor's financial \"house of cards\" came down when StoneMor issued corrective disclosures concerning previously publically-filed financial statements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 17-19. The corrections stated that recent auditing had revealed \"material weaknesses\" in certain sets of internal controls.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 198. This curtailed StoneMor's access to capital markets, which caused StoneMor to cut its distribution by approximately half.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 201-06. Plaintiffs claim that because StoneMor slashed its distribution, StoneMor's unit price dropped by almost forty-five percent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 202-204.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In sum, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants concealed how StoneMor's distributions were, indirectly, funded with the use of debt/equity, which allegedly concealed the risk that distributions would be cut significantly if StoneMor's access to the capital markets was ever impaired.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 136, 166. The allegedly false and misleading statements can be broken down into four categories:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Category A\n   </em>\n   : Statements lauding StoneMor's strength or health in connection with a particular quarter's distribution announcement;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Category B\n   </em>\n   : Statements regarding the connection between operations and distributions;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Category C\n   </em>\n   : Statements that equity offerings were used to pay down StoneMor's debt facility; and\n   <em>\n    Category D\n   </em>\n   : Certification statements required by statute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants now move to dismiss the Complaint, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), and the heightened pleading standard of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (\"PSLRA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

CAC \u00b6 137, EFC No. 67. The plain language of this statement goes beyond an unactionable statement of optimism, because it purports to state actual facts regarding how StoneMor funded distributions. Because Plaintiffs allege that StoneMor actually relied on equity proceeds to fund the distributions, (rather than operation performance) and its ability to do so was \"almost entirely dependent on its ability to sell equity in the capital markets,\" (thus arguably not on \"Available Cash\") these statements are arguably false or misleading as plead. Pl. Resp. to Def. Mot. at 2, 19, ECF No. 74. Therefore, some of the Category A statements are at least arguably false or misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Category B Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Category B statements pertain to the connection between StoneMor's operations and distributions. StoneMor stated to investors and analysts that \"[StoneMor's] primary source of cash from which to pay partner distributions...is operating cash flow.\" CAC \u00b6\u00b6 129, 155, ECF No. 67. Further, Defendants allegedly told investors, \"you can feel comfortable that [StoneMor] generate[s] enough cash flow to pay a distribution in this period.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 182. Plaintiffs argue that this was false, because the distributions were paid using equity sales as opposed to operating cash, as Defendants stated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17. However, those statements referred to the non-GAAP earnings and cash flows, which exceeded distributions because they included the case from pre-need sales that were in trust.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 11, 155, 172, 182.

Because StoneMor's Category B statements referred to non-GAAP metrics, and were accurate portrayals of those metrics, they are not false. Similarly, because StoneMor also disclosed the GAAP metrics, and disclosed that GAAP-based operating revenues and cash flows were lower than cash distributions, the Category B statements were not misleading. Therefore, none of the Category B statements are sufficient to state a securities fraud claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Category C Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Next, regarding the Category C statements, Plaintiffs claim that Defendants made actionable misstatements about how StoneMor intended to use funds from its equity offerings.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 143, 148, 156, 159, 162-63, 165, 170, 176, 179, 184, 186, 189, 191-92. For example, StoneMor allegedly denied that it paid distributions using the funds obtained from its equity offerings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 191-92. But Plaintiffs do not contend that StoneMor actually paid distributions directly from equity offerings.

For instance, the keystone of Plaintiff's claims is that the alleged misstatements \"obscured the fact that the [StoneMor] paid the distribution[s] from its revolving credit facility, which in turn was paid down through the proceeds of a series of equity offerings.\" CAC \u00b6 2, ECF No. 67. Plaintiffs claim that this \"sleight of hand was furthered by reliance on arcane, non-GAAP accounting methods,\" which purportedly obscured the fact that, under GAAP accounting, StoneMor \"actually generated only a small fraction of the revenue needed to pay [the distributions.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3-9.

However, all of this information was repeatedly disclosed. StoneMor disclosed that its ability to pay distributions depended on its revolving credit facility, which was paid down with equity offerings. Def. Mot. Ex. 15, ECF No. 68-2. StoneMor also disclosed its GAAP financials, as well as a reconciliation between its GAAP and non-GAAP financials. CAC \u00b6 16, ECF No. 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Further, StoneMor disclosed that its GAAP revenues and operating cash flows were lower than cash distributions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3,7,9,77,87-97.
