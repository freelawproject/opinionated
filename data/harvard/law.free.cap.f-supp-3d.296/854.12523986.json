The Court held a hearing on November 7, 2017. For the reasons stated on the record and below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the City's motion for protective order and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Cratty's motion to compel and to extend discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

[ECF No. 16]. In his response, Cratty noted that he had testified to discussing his case with Mayor Peterson in 2010, and that Peterson told Cratty that he would have cases against him (Cratty) dismissed. [ECF No. 19]. The City replied that it would withdraw its request to bar Mayor Peterson's deposition with respect to his discussions with Cratty, but that Peterson is otherwise entitled to legislative and deliberate process privileges. [ECF No. 22]. The City asks the Court to order that Mayor Peterson's deposition be \"confined to topics solely related to his alleged interactions with Plaintiff and the relevant citations, arrests, and prosecutions at issue.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID 444].

And in response to Cratty's motion to compel, the City argues that requiring it to produce the citations would cause it an undue burden because the requested discovery is not reasonable accessible. [ECF No. 472]. Problematically, the City provided the Court with no evidence regarding the burden or accessibility of the requested tickets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A party objecting to a request for production of documents as burdensome must submit affidavits or other evidence to substantiate its objections.\n   <em>\n    In re Heparin Products Liab.

Ohio Mar. 2, 2016). And while a party ordinarily is protected from bearing the expense of producing electronically stored evidence that is not reasonable accessible, the City has the burden of actually showing that the information sought is not reasonably accessible. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(2)(B). Here, the City has provided no information whatsoever regarding how the tickets from 2007 and 2008 were stored and what would be required to access them. At the hearing, the attorney for the City asserted that it will soon produce tickets from January 1 through January 2, 2008, but he did not reveal the steps necessary to retrieve those tickets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Furthermore, the source of the purported seven-year limitation is unknown; under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 34(a)(1), a party is required to produce evidence within its \"possession, custody, or control\" without any time-period limitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   For all of these reasons, the only meaningful objection set forth in response to the request to produce at issue is relevance. The Court's analysis will thus turn to that issue and the remaining proportionality factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Under Rule 26(b)(1), \"Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party's claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case\" after consideration of several factors, which are identified as \"the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties' relative access to relevant information, the parties' resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the\n   proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Cratty argues that the tickets at issue are relevant to the claim in his complaint that the City had \"an illegal policy, custom and/or practice in that it permitted violations of the law and Plaintiffs' [sic] rights to occur by its highest policy makers in the City, and engaged in an allowed for retaliation against Plaintiff in violation of the law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   [ECF No. 2, PageID 27]. He also argues that the requested tickets are relevant to his claim that the City conspired with others to unlawfully harass, retaliate against, maliciously prosecute and target him. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID 33-34]. At the hearing, Cratty asserted that the requested evidence will show that few, if any, other residents received \"tinted window\" and \"fail to signal turn\" tickets during the period at issue, demonstrating that he was singled out for harassment and prosecution. The Court finds that this argument satisfies the \"extremely low bar\" for demonstrating relevance under Federal Rule of Evidence 401.\n   <em>\n    In re Ford Motor Co.

Generally, an action to vindicate a citizen's civil rights is considered of high importance. Hon. Elizabeth D. Laporte, Jonathan M. Redgrave,\n   <em>\n    A Practical Guide to Achieving Proportionality Under New Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26\n   </em>\n   , 9 Fed. Cts. L.

Ind. Jan. 27, 2016) (importance of issues at stake high in civil rights action in which plaintiff was wrongfully arrested, interrogated and prosecuted for murder Plaintiffs after an alleged wrongful arrest, interrogation, and prosecuted for murder). This factor weighs in Cratty's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   With respect to the second factor-the amount in controversy-Cratty has demanded an amount in excess of $75,000. [ECF No. 2, PageID 35]. That is the minimum jurisdiction amount for an action in federal court based upon the diversity of citizenship of the parties,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), but the relatively low amount in controversy is not determinative when an important legal right is implicated. Laporte, 9 Fed. Cts. L. Rev. at 60-61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The next two factors are the parties' relative access to relevant information and their resources. There is no dispute that the City has greater access to the tickets at issue, and has greater resources than Cratty. And at the hearing, Cratty argued that the factor of the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues weighs in his favor because, if the City issued a substantial number of tinted window and turn signal tickets, his case will be weak; if it issued few or none, his case would be strengthened. The City argued in response that tickets issued to other residents is\n   irrelevant to whether Cratty's rights were violated. The Court finds that Cratty's argument on this issue is stronger, as the lack of tickets similar to those served on Cratty could support his claim that he was targeted by the City's officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The last factor is whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. \"[A] responding party still must meet its burden of explaining how costly or time-consuming responding to a set of discovery requests will be, because that information is ordinarily better known to the responder than the requester.\"\n   <em>\n    State Farm Mut.

Mich. July 21, 2017). See also Rule 26 advisory committee notes (2015) (\"A party claiming undue burden or expense ordinarily has far better information-perhaps the only information-with respect to that part of the determination.\"). As noted, the City has made no showing of the burden of producing the tickets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   After considering the Rule 26(b)(1) factors, the Court finds that the requested tickets from 2007 and 2008 are discoverable. However, because the City has not disclosed whether it will be able to produce copies of those tickets, the City will be provided with two options: the City must produce either (1) the requested tickets, or (2) other evidence sufficient to show the date of each ticket, to whom each ticket was written, who wrote the tickets, and the ticket number and/or docket number for each ticket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Cratty next moves to compel answers to deposition questions that defense counsel ordered Officers Torolski and Sadowski not to answer. As an initial matter, the Court takes issue with defense counsel's instruction that witnesses not answer questions based upon grounds of relevance; the only basis upon which a witness may be instructed not to answer is privilege. Rule 30(c)(2). Nonetheless, the City will be ordered to produce only Officer Torolski for a continued deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Cratty's counsel asked Officer Torolski to render an opinion regarding whether having five officers on a driving while license suspended case was excessive. [ECF No. 21-5, PageID 400-01]. Counsel for the City objected: \"He's not giving opinion testimony today, sir. Don't answer the question.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID 401]. In response to Cratty's motion to compel, the City argues that Officer Torolski's opinion is not relevant to the issues at hand, and that the foundation for his opinion has not be established under Federal Rule of Evidence 701. Rule 701 requires that a witness's lay opinion be \"(a) rationally based on the witness's perception; (b) helpful to clearly understanding the witness's testimony or to determining a fact in issue; and (c) not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.\" As a trained police officer with specialized knowledge of law enforcement practices particularly within the City of Wyandotte, Federal Rule of Evidence 702 is likely more applicable. That rule allows a \"witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education [to] testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise\" if the testimony meets foundational requirements described in the rule. Regardless of which rule would apply, should Cratty seek to admit Officer Torolski's opinion into evidence at trial, information within the scope of discovery \"need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.\" Rule 26(b)(1). The analysis required at this juncture is under Rule 26(b)(1), not under Rules 701 or 702.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Evidence that an unusual number of officers were involved in issuing a ticket to Cratty is relevant to the question regarding whether he was targeted. The analysis of the Rule 26(b)(1) factors of the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties' relative access to relevant information, and the parties' resources is the same as stated above. The importance of Officer Torolski's opinion in resolving the issues in unclear, but the City has asserted no burden from him offering his opinion. The instruction from counsel for the City that Officer Torolski not testify as to his opinion was patently erroneous, and the City is ordered to produce the officer to address that question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On the other hand, the Court will not order the City to produce Officer Sadowski for a continued deposition. The City's attorney ordered Officer Sadowski not to answer questions regarding handwritten notes that the officer took in firearms arrest a month prior to the deposition; Cratty was not the subject of this arrest. [ECF No. 21-6, PageID 409-12]. The City's attorney objected that the firearms arrest in 2017 was irrelevant to Cratty's arrest in 2008, and that the prosecution related to the 2017 arrest may still be pending. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID 412]. At the hearing, Cratty argued that he needed to understand Officer Sadowski's recordkeeping processes and compare it to the note-taking in his case. But during the deposition, the City's attorney asserted that Officer Sadowski was not the reporting officer during Cratty's 2008 arrest. [ECF No. 21-6, PageID 410]. Despite the Court's warning to defense counsel that it should not order witnesses not to answer questions except with respect to issues of privilege,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   any testimony regarding Officer Sadowski's note-taking on the firearms case in 2017 is too far afield for an order requiring him to answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The last issue is whether discovery should be extended. For the reasons stated on the record, and with defense counsel concurring during the hearing, the Court will extend discovery until\n   <strong>\n    December 8, 2017,\n   </strong>\n   for the limited purposes of:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \u2022 Taking the depositions of Mayor Peterson, Officers Reed and Kresin, and the continuing deposition for Officer Torolski (whose deposition will be limited to answering the opinion question described above);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \u2022 The City producing the requested tickets from 2007 and 2008, or other evidence sufficient to show the date of each ticket, to whom each ticket was written, who wrote the tickets, and the ticket number and/or docket number for each ticket,\n   <strong>\n    no later than November 28, 2017\n   </strong>\n   ; and,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \u2022 Completing any discovery that has already been served.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   No other discovery is allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The production of the tickets must take place before the specified depositions. During the hearing, the parties stated that they intend to complete those deposition during the first week of December.
