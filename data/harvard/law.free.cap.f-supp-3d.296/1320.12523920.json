Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As an initial matter, substantial evidence supports Commerce's decision to apply facts available. The statute provides that Commerce shall rely on the facts available when a respondent withholds requested information, \"significantly impedes a proceeding,\" or provides information after the deadline for submission. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a)(2). Here, Commerce relied on facts available on the basis of POSCO's inaccurate questionnaire responses and the \"conflicting information discovered at verification.\" I &amp; D Mem. at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   There is no dispute that POSCO withheld information regarding its cross-owned input suppliers in its questionnaire responses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   POSCO AQR at 4-5; POSCO 2nd Suppl. QR at 1. At verification, Commerce discovered that POSCO's affiliates supplied limestone, scrap, ferro-molybdenum, and high purity ferro-manganese for use in producing POSCO's cold-rolled steel. POSCO Verification Report at 5-17; POSCO Verification Ex. 3 at ECF pp. 92-94. POSCO's inaccurate questionnaire responses\n   and untimely submission of new factual information at verification prevented Commerce from fully examining the extent to which POSCO's affiliates benefitted from subsidies attributable to POSCO.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I &amp; D Mem. at 64-65. There is, thus, substantial evidence on the record demonstrating that POSCO withheld information, failed to timely provide information, and impeded the proceeding pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Substantial evidence further supports Commerce's decision to apply an adverse inference, which was otherwise in accordance with law. Commerce \"may use an inference that is adverse to the interests of [a respondent] in selecting from among the facts otherwise available\" when the respondent \"fail [s] to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability to comply with a request for information.\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b)(1)(A). Here, Commerce concluded that POSCO had failed to act to the best of its ability because it \"failed to report the necessary information and only after discovery at verification did it report on the last day that some of the inputs provided by ... affiliated companies were, in fact, used in the production of the subject merchandise.\" I &amp; D Mem. at 68-69 &amp; nn.327-31 (citing\n   <em>\n    Nippon Steel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9109445\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/337/1373/#p1382\">\n    337 F.3d at 1380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1382 ; POSCO Verification Report at 5-17);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10 (an adverse inference was merited because, \"[d]espite repeated requests, POSCO failed to identify or provide necessary information as to its respective cross-owned companies\").

In\n   <em>\n    Lumber from Canada\n   </em>\n   , Commerce declined to attribute subsidies when \"less than 30 percent of [the affiliate's] timber sales [were] made to [the lumber producer]\" and \"all other sales [were] made to unrelated customers.\"\n   <em>\n    Lumber from Canada\n   </em>\n   , I &amp; D Mem. at 23. Accordingly, relative sales of the input to the respondent is not Commerce's only consideration in the analysis of whether an input is primarily dedicated, and POSCO's failure to report its affiliated input suppliers prevented Commerce from investigating and obtaining other pertinent information. Further, the respondents in\n   <em>\n    Washers from Korea\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lumber from Canada\n   </em>\n   timely provided the information, thereby affording Commerce the opportunity to examine or verify it and allowing the agency, not the respondent, to make the decision on primary dedication.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Washers from Korea\n   </em>\n   , I &amp; D Mem. at 3;\n   <em>\n    Lumber from Canada\n   </em>\n   , I &amp; D Mem. at 23.

Congress has directed Commerce to base its selection of the subsidy rate-highest or not-on an \"evaluation ... of\n   <em>\n    the situation\n   </em>\n   that resulted in the [agency] using an adverse inference.\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(d)(2) (emphasis added). Thus, the statute contemplates a case-specific evaluation as part of Commerce's selection from among a range of rates. Moreover, because the requirement for this evaluation was added to the pre-existing statutory requirements for using adverse facts available, clearly some additional evaluation is required beyond that which justified the adverse inference. Otherwise, Congress could simply have stated that Commerce \"may apply any of the countervailable subsidy rates or dumping margins specified under that paragraph, including the highest such rate or margin,\" and omitted the remaining text.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/#p842\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1677e(d)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again, something more-i.e., an evaluation of the specific situation-is required.

That the facts merited the use of an adverse inference does not necessarily mean that those same facts merited selection of the highest rate. Moreover, the court may not weigh the evidence justifying a particular decision in the first instance; that is Commerce's province.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bowman Transp., Inc. v.

Although the SAA permits Commerce to \"employ adverse inferences ... to ensure that the party does not obtain a more\n   favorable result by failing to cooperate than if it had cooperated fully,\" SAA at 870, the SAA does not state or suggest that only the highest rates will achieve that goal.

POSCO has, however, omitted two key sentences from Commerce's explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   First, immediately before the first sentence of the first paragraph quoted above, Commerce explains that \u00a7 1677e(c)(1)\"provides that, when the [agency] relies on secondary information rather than on information obtained in the course of an investigation or review,\n   <em>\n    it shall, to the extent practicable, corroborate that information\n   </em>\n   from independent sources that are reasonably at its disposal.\" I &amp; D Mem. at 15 (emphasis added). Additionally, immediately before the first sentence of the second paragraph quoted above, Commerce explains that, \"[w]ith regard to the reliability aspect of corroboration, unlike other types of information, such as publicly available data on the national inflation rate of a given country or national average interest rates, there typically are no independent sources for data on company-specific benefits resulting from countervailable subsidy programs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341667\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/802/1339/#p1354\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, although Commerce could have been clearer, the agency is plainly cognizant of its statutory obligation to corroborate secondary information \"to the extent practicable.\" Moreover, Commerce's reference to the \"inapplicab[ility]\" of corroboration is reasonably understood to refer to the \"typical[ ]\" lack of independent sources of data on company-specific benefits for Commerce to use to measure the reliability of the selected rates. In other words, the lack of benefits-related data means that Commerce is limited in its ability to corroborate the selected rates pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(c)(1)\"from independent sources that are reasonably at their disposal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   This understanding of Commerce's explanation is supported by the Ministerial Error Memorandum. Therein, Commerce explains that its ability to \"use a countervailable subsidy rate applied for a similar program in a [CVD] proceeding involving the same country ... is significant[ ] because ... with regard to the reliability aspect of corroboration, ... there typically are no independent sources for data on company-specific benefits resulting from countervailable subsidy programs.\" Ministerial Error Mem. at 4. Under those circumstances, Commerce implements its duty to corroborate \"to the extent practicable\" by selecting \"[a]ctual rates calculated based on actual usage by Korean companies\" that were \"calculated in the context of an administrative proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341667\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/802/1339/#p1354\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As to relevance, Commerce \"strive[s] to assign AFA rates that are the same in terms of type of benefit ... because these rates are relevant to the respondent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341667\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/802/1339/#p1354\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To that end, Commerce first\n   identifies rates associated with the identical subsidy program in the investigation or a CVD proceeding involving the same country; if such rates are unavailable, Commerce identifies rates associated with a similar program in a CVD proceeding involving the same country; or, finally, absent rates from a similar program, Commerce will use a rate associated with a program identified in a CVD proceeding from the same country \"that could conceivably be used by the non-cooperating [respondent].\" I &amp; D Mem. at 12.
