Wright, United States District Judge\n   In this declaratory judgment action, the parties dispute whether a golf cart driven by Defendant Gary Lynn Graeser qualifies for liability coverage under Graeser's automobile insurance policy with Plaintiff Progressive Preferred Insurance Company. Because a golf cart is neither an \"auto\" under Graeser's automobile insurance policy nor a \"motor vehicle\" under the Minnesota No-Fault Automobile Insurance Act, the Court grants Progressive's motion for summary judgment and denies Defendants Shawn Heath Wilson and Kelly Wilson's cross-motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case arises from Graeser's operation of his privately owned golf cart on the city streets of St. Francis, Minnesota, on July 9, 2013. Two others accompanied Graeser on the golf cart's bench seat while Shawn Heath Wilson stood in the rear cargo rack next to a set of golf clubs. As Graeser turned at the corner of 235th Avenue Northwest and Crocus Street Northwest, Shawn Heath Wilson fell and sustained injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   When the accident occurred, Graeser was the named insured on an automobile insurance policy (Policy) issued by Progressive. The Policy lists three automobiles on its declarations page; Graeser's golf cart is not listed. The Policy contains a section titled \"PART I-LIABILITY TO OTHERS,\" which provides that Progressive \"will pay damages for bodily injury and property damage for which an insured person becomes legally responsible because of an accident.\" An \"insured person\" is a named insured or that person's relative (as defined by the Policy) \"with respect to an accident arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of an auto.\" The Policy defines \"auto\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \"Auto\" means a land motor vehicle:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   a. of the private passenger, pickup body, or cargo van type;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-14\">\n   b. designed for operation principally upon public roads;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n    c. with at least four wheels; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n    d. with a gross vehicle weight rating of 12,000 pounds or less, according to the manufacturer's specifications.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    The Policy also contains the following exclusion:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n    <em>\n     EXCLUSIONS\n    </em>\n    -READ THE FOLLOWING EXCLUSIONS CAREFULLY, IF AN EXCLUSION APPLIES, COVERAGE WILL NOT BE AFFORDED UNDER THIS PART I.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n    Coverage under this Part I, including [Progressive's] duty to defend, will not apply to any insured person for:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n    ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n    10. bodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of any vehicle owned by [a named insured] or furnished or available for [a named insured's] regular use, other than a covered auto for which this coverage has been purchased. ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    A \"covered auto\" under the Policy is \"any auto ... shown on the declarations page,\" any \"additional auto,\" or any \"replacement auto.\" An \"additional auto\" is one that a named insured becomes the owner of \"during the policy period that does not permanently replace an auto shown on the declarations page\" so long as the named insured notifies Progressive within 30 days of becoming the owner and pays any additional premium. A \"replacement auto\" is \"an auto that permanently replaces an auto shown on the declarations page.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    Graeser's golf cart is an E-Z-Go RXV Freedom model. The golf cart has no doors, is open on all sides, and is not equipped with a speedometer, seatbelts, or turn signals. The owner's guide of the E-Z-Go RXV Freedom model provides that \"[t]hese vehicles are designed and manufactured for off-road use. They\n    <strong>\n     DO NOT\n    </strong>\n    meet the federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards of the United States of America (USA) and are not equipped for operation on the public streets.\" The owner's guide expressly states that \"E-Z-Go will NOT approve Distributor, Dealer or customer changes\" to modify an E-Z-Go RXV Freedom model into a vehicle subject to federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Graeser purchased the golf cart for his personal use several years prior to the July 9, 2013 accident and stored the golf cart in his garage. Graeser never registered the golf cart or obtained a permit from St. Francis to operate the golf cart on public roads.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    Following the July 9, 2013 accident, Shawn Heath Wilson and Kelly Wilson (the Wilsons) filed a civil suit in Minnesota state court, alleging that Graeser operated the golf cart negligently at the time of the accident. Progressive subsequently filed this action for a declaratory judgment that Graeser's golf cart does not qualify for liability coverage under the Policy. The Wilsons filed a counterclaim for a declaration of coverage. Both Progressive and the Wilsons now move for summary judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    <strong>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    The Declaratory Judgment Act provides for a declaration of \"the rights and other legal relations of any interested party ... whether or not further relief is or could be sought.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a).

The \"LIABILITY TO OTHERS\" provision provides coverage when \"an insured person becomes legally responsible because of an accident.\" According to the Wilsons, this provision is \"not limited by what vehicle [the] insured person (Graeser) uses\" and expressly covers\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    type of accident. But this argument ignores a salient portion of the provision. The \"LIABILITY TO OTHERS\" provision applies to circumstances in which \"an insured person\" is legally responsible for an accident. The Policy defines an \"insured person\" as a named insured who is involved in an accident \"arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of an\n    <em>\n     auto\n    </em>\n    .\" (Emphasis added.) Because Graeser was involved in an accident as the named insured, coverage depends on whether the July 9, 2013 accident arose out of Graeser's use of an \"auto.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    The Policy defines \"auto\" as a land motor vehicle \"designed for operation principally upon public roads.\" The term \"designed\" means \"to plan or produce with\n    <strong>\n     special intentional adaptation\n    </strong>\n    to a specific end.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Nelson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365976\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/109/1085/#p1089\">\n     109 F.Supp.3d at 1090\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting\n    <em>\n     Stepec v.

E-Z-Go, the manufacturer of Graeser's golf cart, expressly disclaims such a design intention in the owner's guide, which states that the golf cart is \"designed and manufactured for off-road use\" and is \"not equipped for operation on the public streets.\" The owner's guide also advises that the golf cart would require significant modifications to comply with federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. The golf cart has no doors, speedometer, seatbelts, or turn signals for example. But the owner's guide provides that E-Z-Go will not approve\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    modifications in an effort to make the golf cart comply with federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. For these reasons, no genuine dispute of material fact exists as to whether the golf cart was designed for operation principally on public roads.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Accordingly, the Wilsons fail to establish a prima facie case for coverage under the Policy.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    <strong>\n     II.

A vehicle is not a \"motor vehicle\" under the No-Fault Act unless it \"(a) is required to be registered pursuant to chapter 168, and (b) is designed to be self-propelled by an engine or motor for use primarily upon public roads, highways or streets in the transportation of persons or property.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11243447\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/616/273/#p277\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 65B.43, subd. 2.

The No-Fault Act's definition of \"motor vehicle\" therefore contains the same requirement as the Policy.
