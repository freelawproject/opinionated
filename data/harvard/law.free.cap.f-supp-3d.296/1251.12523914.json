Specifically, the parties dispute whether an\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   money judgment is available to the Government in light of the Supreme Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Honeycutt v. United States\n   </em>\n   , 581 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604669\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1626/\">\n    137 S.Ct. 1626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604669\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1626/\">\n    198 L.Ed.2d 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). The Government moves the Court to enter preliminary and final orders of forfeiture including an\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   money judgment against Defendant which encompasses both proceeds from Defendant's crimes and property used to facilitate those crimes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Mot. 6, ECF 300. Defendant and Federal Public Defenders (\"FPD\") as amicus curiae object, arguing in relevant part, that\n   <em>\n    Honeycutt\n   </em>\n   foreclosed on imposing such a money judgment and limits forfeiture to only the actual property that Defendant acquired. In other words, Defendant argues that forfeiture can only be ordered against the actual tainted assets themselves as opposed to an\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   money judgment against Defendant himself that could be used to collect Defendant's future untainted assets. After reviewing the parties' briefs, the record in this case, and the relevant law, the Court concludes that\n   <em>\n    Honeycutt\n   </em>\n   does not prohibit the Government from seeking an\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   money judgment against Defendant. Accordingly, the Government's motion is granted in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After an eleven-day trial, a jury found Defendant guilty of one count of sex trafficking conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking, and one count of obstruction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Verdict Form, ECF 281. The Second Superseding Indictment also included criminal forfeiture allegations stating that Defendant shall forfeit under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201594\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \"any property, real or personal, that was used or intended to be used to commit or to facilitate the commission of such violations, and any property, real or personal, constituting or derived from any proceeds obtained, directly or indirectly, as a result of such violations.\" Second Superseding Indictment 3, ECF 104. The Government submitted an Amended Bill of particulars identifying twenty-six assets as subject to criminal forfeiture.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Bill of Particulars, ECF 265. In addition to Defendant's specific forfeitable assets, the Government also indicated that it would separately seek a money judgment against Defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Mem.

In reaching this conclusion, the Court spoke broadly about how the general criminal forfeiture statute should be construed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Traditionally, forfeiture was an action against the tainted property itself and thus proceeded\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   ; that is, proceedings in which \"[t]he thing [was] primarily considered as the offender, or rather the offence [was] attached primarily to the thing.\" The forfeiture \"proceeding\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   st[ood] independent of, and wholly unaffected by any criminal proceeding\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   \" against the defendant. Congress altered this distinction in enacting \u00a7 853 by effectively merging the in rem forfeiture proceeding with the\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   criminal proceeding and by expanding forfeiture to include not just the \"thing\" but \"property ... derived from ... any proceeds\" of the crime. \u00a7 853(a)(1). But as is clear from its text and structure, \u00a7 853 maintains traditional\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   forfeiture's focus on tainted property unless one of the preconditions of \u00a7 853(p) exists. For those who find it relevant, the legislative history confirms as much: Congress altered the traditional system in order to \"improv[e] the procedures applicable in forfeiture cases.\" S.Rep. No. 98-225, p. 192 (1983). By adopting an\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   aspect to criminal forfeiture, and providing for substitute-asset forfeiture, Congress made it easier for the Government to hold the defendant who acquired the tainted property responsible.

Defendant interprets\n   <em>\n    Honeycutt\n   </em>\n   as standing for the proposition that forfeiture can only be sought against the tainted property itself or substitute property under \u00a7 853(p) ; by contrast, an\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   money judgment against a criminal defendant that could reach future untainted assets is not within the plain text of forfeiture statutes and is therefore prohibited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court disagrees and finds that\n   <em>\n    Honeycutt\n   </em>\n   's holding is not as broad as Defendant claims and is inapplicable to the instant case.\n   <em>\n    Honeycutt\n   </em>\n   is factually and legally distinguishable from the forfeiture matter currently before the Court. The issue before the Supreme Court was whether \u00a7 853 supported the imposition of joint and several liability for forfeiture purposes. The Supreme Court considered whether the defendant could be held financially accountable for proceeds from the charged criminal sales that his brother obtained. In that case, however, the proceeds from those sales never passed through the defendant's hands. \"The District Court declined to enter a forfeiture judgment, reasoning that [the defendant] was a salaried employee who had not personally received any profits from the iodine sales.\"\n   <em>\n    Honeycutt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604669\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1626/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, because the defendant did not personally receive any proceeds from his crime, the Supreme Court held a money judgment against him for those proceeds was improper.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604669\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1626/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Here, by contrast, the Court finds that Defendant has personally obtained proceeds as a result of his crimes. The Court is convinced that the Government has established by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendant obtained proceeds from his crimes of conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Mot. 8-27 (reciting testimony from trial demonstrating that Defendant obtained proceeds from his crimes). The Government estimates, based on the evidence adduced at trial, that Defendant obtained at least $312,700 in proceeds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Mot. 26-27. The Government was only able to locate $3,445 in proceeds seized from Defendant in his 2012 arrest and $6,360.81 seized from Defendant in 2014 to be used as a substitute asset.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Defendant urges the Court to read\n   <em>\n    Honeycutt\n   </em>\n   to mean that the Government can only seek forfeiture of the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   , i.e. the actual physical money that Defendant obtained, as opposed to seeking an\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   money judgment against Defendant for the amount of tainted proceeds. Under Defendant's reading of\n   <em>\n    Honeycutt\n   </em>\n   , criminal defendants could benefit from their ill-gotten gains by simply spending their proceeds\n   or otherwise putting them beyond the government's reach. The Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Honeycutt\n   </em>\n   does not require such a result.\n   <em>\n    Honeycutt\n   </em>\n   does not espouse a broad rule categorically barring\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   money judgments; rather, it prohibited the Government from imposing an\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   money judgment against a co-conspirator who never received or possessed profits from his crimes. In other words,\n   <em>\n    Honeycutt\n   </em>\n   does not require that Defendant still be in possession of his ill-gotten proceeds, it merely limits forfeiture to proceeds that he obtained at some point from his crimes. Had the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Honeycutt\n   </em>\n   obtained money from the illegal sales, then the government could have sought a money judgment against him for that amount. In this case, Defendant obtained proceeds from his sex-trafficking crimes and it is proper for the Government to seek a money judgment against him for those proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In sum,\n   <em>\n    Honeycutt\n   </em>\n   did not overrule the universally recognized rule among the federal courts of appeals permitting\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   money judgments against criminal defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Moreover, cases decided since\n   <em>\n    Honeycutt\n   </em>\n   show that its holding was intended to resolve issues of joint and several liability. For example, in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Brown\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit concluded that\n   <em>\n    Honeycutt\n   </em>\n   applied with equal force to another forfeiture statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20982\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 982\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=694%20Fed.%20Appx.%2057\">\n    694 Fed.

This decision was based on the similarities between \u00a7 982(a)(2) and \u00a7 853 limiting forfeiture to property \"constituting\" or \"derived from\" proceeds obtained \"directly or indirectly\" from a crime. The Third Circuit also found that the statute's use of the term \"obtained\" showed that forfeiture was limited in terms of personal possession or use.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=694%20Fed.%20Appx.%2057\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Likewise, in\n   <em>\n    Gjeli\n   </em>\n   the Third Circuit reversed the district court's imposition of joint and several liability for forfeiture.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275281\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/418/#p426\">\n    867 F.3d at 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court finds this remand order instructive in that it focuses on the amount of proceeds attributable to the defendant rather than concluding that money judgments are unavailable under\n   <em>\n    Honeycutt.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   These decisions are contrary to Defendant's contention that forfeiture is limited only to the obtained proceeds themselves as opposed to a money judgment against the individual who obtained the tainted proceeds. Cases considering\n   <em>\n    Honeycutt\n   </em>\n   have all involved co-conspirator liability. Some of those courts have denied or reversed money judgments where it was not shown that the co-conspirator actually obtained the proceeds of the criminal conspiracy. Consistent with those opinions, other courts have permitted money judgments where such a showing was made. None of the cases that the Court reviewed, however, concluded that it was improper to impose an\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   money judgment against a criminal defendant where it was shown that the defendant obtained proceeds from his crimes. Accordingly, the Court concludes that\n   <em>\n    Honeycutt\n   </em>\n   requires that a criminal defendant must have \"obtained\" the forfeitable proceeds in order to be liable for the amount of those proceeds. Forfeiture is not limited to the physical proceeds themselves, which in most cases will be unobtainable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Defendant's Constitutional Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Defendant also claims that his waiver of a jury determination on forfeiture was premised on the Government seeking forfeiture of specific assets. Had Defendant known that the Government would be seeking an\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   money judgment, Defendant argues that he would not have stipulated to a waiver of his right to a jury. Further, Defendant argues that the Government failed to provide constitutionally adequate notice that it would seek a personal money judgment. The Court finds that these arguments are without merit. A review of Defendant's waiver shows that it was not conditional on the Government limiting its forfeiture requests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stip. &amp; Waiver of Jury Trial Regarding Forfeiture. Prior to filing that waiver, the Government had stated in its briefing that it would be \"separately seeking a money judgment against [Defendant]\" in addition to the other specific forfeitable assets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Mem. Regarding Applicable P. for Forfeiture 5. In its Motion, the Government argued that under Ninth Circuit precedent and Rule 32.2, a jury was not needed to determine forfeiture of a personal money judgment and the Court must determine the amount of money that Defendant will be ordered to pay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Christensen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4335799\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/828/763/#p822\">\n    828 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   821-21 (citing Rule 32.2 to hold that a jury is not required to determine\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   money judgment forfeiture); Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.2(b)(1)(A) (\"If the government seeks a personal money judgment, the court must determine the amount of money that defendant will be ordered to pay.\"). Accordingly, the Court concludes that the Government provided constitutionally adequate notice of its intent to seek an\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   money judgment against Defendant and Defendant has\n   waived his right to a jury determination on this issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

The Government bears the burden of establishing forfeitability by a preponderance of the evidence.

The Court's calculation includes proceeds and facilitating property of Counts 1, 2, and 3 of the Second Superseding Indictment. The money judgment amount is supported by the jury's guilty verdict, the evidence presented at trial, as well as the evidence submitted by the Government at the forfeiture hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   With respect to proceeds, the Government has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendant directly or indirectly obtained $222,700 in proceeds from sex trafficking victims A.F.W., T.H., A.C.W., C.H., and D.J. Regarding A.F.W., the Government extrapolated from her testimony that she made \"$30K in 30 days\" for Defendant, that she made $300,000 over the course of 300 days in a year. Gov't Mot. 10-11. The Court finds that the evidence adduced at trial shows that A.F.W., more likely than not, earned a lesser amount for Defendant, approximately $210,000 ($700 a day for 300 days). The Court further finds that the remainder of the Government's calculations as to T.H., A.C.W, C.H., and D.J. are supported by a preponderance of the evidence and are accurate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Regarding facilitating property, the Court finds that the Government has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendant used or intended to use $600,000 to commit or facilitate the commission\n   of the sex trafficking conspiracy. The Government reduces that figure \"by the amount of proceeds to avoid double counting,\" and seeks a \"facilitating property money judgment of $287,300 ($600,000 minus $312,700).\" Gov't Mot. 17. The Court adjusts the facilitating property figure to $377,300 to reflect the Court's reduced proceeds calculation above ($600,000 minus $222,700). Property used to facilitate Defendant's crimes of conviction includes: rent paid on Defendant's \"employee condo\" and Victory P.R. offices; hotel and motel rent and costs; money that Defendant received from Konia Prinster that he used to facilitate the sex trafficking conspiracy; and money Defendant used to recruit and retain sex trafficking victims. The evidence adduced at trial as well as the evidence presented at the forfeiture hearing prove that it was more likely than not that Defendant used or intended to use the property identified above to facilitate the sex trafficking conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In sum, the Court finds that the government has demonstrated that an\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   money judgment against Defendant in the amount of $600,000 is supported by a preponderance of the evidence ($222,700 in proceeds from sex trafficking victims and $377,300 in facilitating property).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Government's motion for an\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   money judgment against Defendant is GRANTED in part. The Court finds that an\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   money judgment against Defendant in the sum of $600,000 is warranted. A preliminary order of forfeiture pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.2 will be issued separately. In the preliminary order of forfeiture, the dollar amount of any substitute property subject to forfeiture will be subtracted from the amount of the\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   money judgment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    \"Based on the evidence adduced at trial, the Government estimates the amount of funds used to facilitate sex-trafficking offenses to be at least $600,000, and after reducing this figure by the amount of proceeds to avoid double counting, the government is therefore seeking facilitating property money judgment of\n    <strong>\n     $287,300\n    </strong>\n    ($600,000 minus $312,700.\" Gov't Mot. 17.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The Court also rejects Defendant's argument that a personal money judgment constitutes an excessive fine in violation of the Eighth Amendment. As discussed above, personal money judgments are proper where the dollar amount of tainted property exceeds the defendant's assets. The Ninth Circuit in\n    <em>\n     Newman\n    </em>\n    recognized that \"although Defendants must pay both restitution and criminal forfeiture, the result is not an impermissible 'double recovery.' \"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3839081\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/659/1235/#p1240\">\n     659 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1241 (citing\n    <em>\n     McGinty\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695390\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/610/1242/#p1246\">\n     610 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1247-48 ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
