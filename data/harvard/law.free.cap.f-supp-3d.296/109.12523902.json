(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Def.'s Mot.\"), ECF No. 36; Pl.'s Renewed Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Pl.'s Mot.\"), ECF No. 37.) DOJ argues that the government properly withheld all of the information at issue in this case pursuant to Exemptions 3 and 7(E) (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 18-23), and that the classified material in the Congressional reports and FISC filing is further properly withheld under Exemption 1 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-16).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   DOJ also contends that the government has released all non-exempt, reasonably segregable portions of the records that EPIC has requested. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24.) EPIC's cross-motion insists that the fact that some of the material that DOJ initially withheld as exempt has now been released suggests that DOJ is acting in bad faith with respect to the withheld materials. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. at 12-14.) EPIC further asserts that none of the information that the government has withheld is properly deemed classified (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-19), nor is it specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-21), nor do the materials satisfy the Exemption 7(E) criteria for protected law-enforcement information (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-23). EPIC also argues that the government has failed to release all reasonably segregable information. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 30, 2017, this Court issued an order that\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   DOJ's motion for summary judgment, and also\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   EPIC's Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment without prejudice. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 45.) This Memorandum Opinion explains the reasons for that order. In sum, and as discussed fully below, the Court has conducted an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the relevant materials, and it concurs with DOJ's contention that FOIA Exemption 3 was properly invoked with respect to the Westlaw printouts and the redacted portions of the Congressional reports that EPIC is challenging in this action. (\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Sec. III.A.1.) It is also clear to the Court that the government has identified an Executive order that specifically authorizes it to maintain the secrecy of the material at issue in the interest of national defense, and that the challenged withheld material is properly classified pursuant to that order; therefore, the government is\n   also entitled to rely on Exemption 1 to withhold the requested information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Notably, however, DOJ's general success in establishing that the disputed information can be withheld comes with a caveat: the Court has identified at least three redactions in the Congressional reports that DOJ has categorized as undisputed (i.e., \"outside the Remaining Challenges\") but that do appear to fit within the categories of disputed redactions still at issue in this case. Given this mischaracterization, DOJ has not provided any reasons for the government's withholdings with respect to these particular redactions; therefore, this Court is in no better position to evaluate the appropriateness of these particular redactions than it was prior to the government's supplemental submissions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    EPIC II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20447426\">\n    2016 WL 447426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (remarking that \"the current sworn statements are too general in scope\" and that \"because the declarations fail to home in on the specific withholdings now at issue, they are manifestly inadequate to assist the Court in determining whether the declarants have made a reasonable assessment\" under the FOIA). The Court has also identified two other aspects of the government's withholdings with respect to the congressional reports-a footnote on page 57 of Document 126 and a notation on page 59 of Document 127-that require further clarification, as explained below. Consequently, the accompanying Order requires DOJ to submit one or more supplemental declarations with respect to the congressional reports, in order to address the issues identified herein, and the Order also sets a schedule for submission of renewed motions for summary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Thus, only a brief recounting of the relevant background details is necessary here. In short, EPIC submitted a FOIA request to DOJ on October 3, 2013, seeking certain records that pertain to the United States government's prior surreptitious use of PR/TT devices under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (\"FISA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201841\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 46 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   1.

EPIC filed the instant lawsuit, along with a motion for a preliminary injunction, when DOJ did not respond to this FOIA request by the statutory deadline. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After this Court denied EPIC's motion for a preliminary injunction,\n   <em>\n    EPIC I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222231\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/15/32/\">\n    15 F.Supp.3d 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , DOJ proceeded to process EPIC's FOIA request, and in doing so, referred certain documents to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") and the National Security Agency (\"NSA\") for review and a withholding determination. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bradley Decl. \u00b6 7.)\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2016.4\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 16.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(i) (\"When the component processing\n   the request believes that a different component, agency, or other Federal Government office is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, the component typically should refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record, as long as the referral is to a component or agency that is subject to the FOIA.\"). The government completed processing EPIC's FOIA request by late summer of 2014, and the parties then proceeded to brief cross-motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On October 31, 2014, DOJ submitted its opening summary judgment brief and supporting declarations from declarants of DOJ, the NSA, and the FBI, and it also filed a\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index that contained 92 entries and invoked Exemptions 1, 3, 6, 7(C), and 7(E).\n   <em>\n    EPIC II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20447426\">\n    2016 WL 447426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. (\n   <em>\n    See Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index, Ex. A to 2d Decl. of Mark A. Bradley (\"Bradley Decl.\"), ECF No. 22-3, at 8-24.) Then, during the course of the remaining briefing of the summary judgment motions, the number of documents at issue shrank substantially, until at a motion hearing that this Court held on January 21, 2016, counsel for EPIC represented that only two issues remained for this Court to resolve: (1) whether the government has properly withheld the Westlaw printouts that are attached to\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index Document 68, which is a classified legal brief that the government once submitted to the FISC, and (2) whether the government properly redacted from the Semi-Annual Reports that DOJ made to Congress regarding use of FSIA PR/TT devices (hereinafter, the \"SARs\") information that consisted of summaries of FISC legal opinions, descriptions of the scope of the FISC's jurisdiction, and discussions of FISA process improvements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. Importantly, upon its consideration of the parties' briefs and supporting materials, this Court found \"that the declarations that DOJ has submitted in support of its motion for summary judgment do not address these withholdings\n   <em>\n    in particular\n   </em>\n   \" and, thus, DOJ's evidence was insufficient to enable the Court to determine whether the government had properly invoked FOIA exemptions to withhold the information in dispute.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original). Consequently, the Court denied the parties' cross-motions without prejudice, and required DOJ to submit additional declarations that were tailored to the withholdings at issue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. The Court also mandated that DOJ submit the two categories of contested documents for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Current Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On March 18, 2016, DOJ filed an updated\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index and unclassified declarations from David M. Hardy of the FBI and David J. Sherman of the NSA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Revised\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index; Hardy Suppl. Decl.; Sherman Suppl. Decl.) On that same day, DOJ also lodged with the Classified Information Security Officer classified versions of the Hardy and Sherman supplemental declarations, as well a copy of Document 68 (the FISC brief) and the attached Westlaw printouts, and unredacted copies of the five contested SARs, which are documents 124-127 and 129 on the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Classified Lodging; Classified Hardy Suppl. Decl.; Classified Sherman Suppl. Decl.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On April 8, 2016, the parties filed renewed cross-motions for summary judgment based on this significantly narrowed range of documents. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot.; Pl.'s Mot.) These are the motions that are presently before this Court. In its motion, DOJ argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because the government properly invoked FOIA Exemption 1 to withhold the Westlaw printouts attached to Document 68 and the redacted portions SARs, given\n   that these materials contain classified NSA or FBI information. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 13-16.) DOJ also contends that it was appropriate for the government to rely on FOIA Exemption 3, which permits the withholding of records that are \"specifically exempted from disclosure by [a] statute [that] ... establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld[,]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 16-21.) In this regard, DOJ maintains that the withheld material contains classified information regarding United States communications intelligence activities, or pertains to the NSA's operations, and is thus exempted from disclosure under Section 102A(i)(1) of the National Security Act of 1947,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203024\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 3024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(1) (exempting \"intelligence sources and methods\" from disclosure), or Section 6 of the National Security Agency Act of 1959,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203605\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 3605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (authorizing the withholding of information that relates to \"the organization or any function of the [NSA], or any information with respect to the activities thereof\"), or\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20798\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 798\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) (prohibiting disclosure of \"classified information... concerning the communication intelligence activities of the United States\"). (Def.'s Mot. at 18-21). DOJ further insists that the Westlaw printouts and the Congressional reports were \"compiled for law enforcement purposes[,]\" and thus fall within the protective ambit of FOIA Exemption 7(E) (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23), and that the government has released all non-exempt, reasonably segregable portions of records that are responsive to EPIC's FOIA request (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   For its part, EPIC argues that by continuously releasing materials that it originally withheld, DOJ has called into question not only the propriety of the initial withholdings but also the government's continued withholding of the material that remains at issue in this case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. at 13-15.) EPIC also challenges DOJ's Exemption 1 arguments, asserting that the material at issue is not \"properly classified\" given its nature (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16 (citations omitted)), and that the government's withholding of otherwise publicly available Westlaw printouts is especially \"absurd[ ]\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17). With respect to the government's reliance on Exemption 3, EPIC contends, first, that the government invoked Exemption 3 belatedly and in bad faith; and second, that affidavits from the FBI and the NSA are legally insufficient to justify the Exemption 3 withholdings because\n   <em>\n    DOJ's National Security Division\n   </em>\n   (\"NSD\") created and controls the documents at issue, and NSD is not a member of the intelligence community that is permitted to invoke the National Security Act for purposes of Exemption 3. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-21). EPIC also strenuously objects to DOJ's Exemption 7(E) arguments (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-23), and insists that \"it is implausible that entire legal opinions\" such as the Westlaw printouts \"would be devoid of reasonably segregable material\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24). Similarly, EPIC states that the summaries of FISC opinions, FISC jurisdiction, and FISA procedures are reasonably segregable, non-exempt material that must be disclosed (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The parties' cross-motions for summary judgment are now ripe for this Court's review.

(\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section I.B.) The FBI seeks to withhold the Westlaw printouts and to make redactions on 20 pages of the SARS, and it relies on a single statute to justify all of these withholdings under Exemption 3-Section 102A(i)(1) of the National Security Act of 1947,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203024\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 3024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(1), which requires the \"Director of National Intelligence\" (\"DNI\") to \"protect from unauthorized disclosure intelligence\n   sources and methods.\" (Hardy Suppl.

Thus, the question this Court must address is whether the withheld material at issue here falls within the scope of these statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   With respect to the portions of the SARs that the FBI has withheld and that are discussed in the unredacted materials that the government has submitted, this Court finds that withheld material pertains to specific surveillance techniques (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Document 124 at 3-4, 47, 50; Document 125 at 3-5, 50-52; Document 126 at 56-60; Document 127 at 58-61), or discusses particular strengths or limitations of the FISC process in relation to surveillance techniques, and thus the reactions broadly pertain to intelligence methods that must be protected from disclosure under Section 102A(i)(1). Turning to the Westlaw printouts, this Court likewise finds that, given the context in which the printouts exist in this litigation-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , as part of a classified brief submitted to the FISC-the printouts also constitute intelligence sources and methods for purposes of Section 102A(i)(1), and therefore the FBI properly withheld those materials. With respect to the portions of the SARs that the NSA has redacted, this Court's own\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the unredacted text of the material reveals that the withheld material discusses a particular classified NSA surveillance method (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Document 129 at 51), and thus is protected from disclosure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In light of its own\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review and the submitted declarations, the Court\n   readily finds that the material falls within the ambit of each cited statute-specifically, the withheld information pertains to intelligence sources and methods and NSA activities within the scope of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203024\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(1) and 3605, and also contains classified information concerning communication activities within the ambit of 18 U.S.C \u00a7 798.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    DOJ Is Entitled To Invoke Exemption 3 Based On Affidavits From The FBI And The NSA Under The Circumstances Presented Here\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   EPIC does not contest that the statutes that the government relies upon are withholding statutes, nor does it appear that EPIC rejects the prior substantive analysis-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that the withheld information at issue in this case can properly be withheld under Exemption 3. Indeed, it has made no argument to the contrary. But EPIC does vigorously maintain that DOJ has not followed the right\n   <em>\n    procedure\n   </em>\n   for establishing the applicability of Exemption 3 with respect to the withholdings at issue. Specifically, EPIC maintains that a division of DOJ-the NSD-\"created and controls the records at issue\" (Pl.'s Mot. at 19), yet there is no declaration from NSD to justify any of the withholdings; rather, the only declarations the government has provided are from the FBI and NSA (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203024\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). Continuing along this track, EPIC argues that \"[i]t is a matter of first impression in this Circuit whether a non-[Intelligence Community] agency can assert an Exemption 3 claim based on [Section 102A(i)(1) of] the National Security Act.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.) EPIC further maintains that DOJ has asserted Exemption 3 belatedly and in bad faith, and that DOJ in fact waived the exemption by not asserting it during the prior round of summary judgment briefing in this matter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19; Pl.'s Opp'n at 10-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court will address this last alleged procedural deficiency first: given the convoluted procedural history of the instant case, EPIC's argument that the government has waived the right to rely on Exemption 3 by failing to invoke that exemption in its earlier\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index is not well-founded. The parties here have engaged in two rounds of summary judgment briefing before this Court, and at this Court's request, the government has now provided a more detailed explanation of its withholdings, asserting Exemption 3 along with the previously-raised Exemptions 1 and 7(E). The Court does not perceive the government as having acted in bad faith, nor does it view the government's filings as providing post-hoc rationalizations for withholdings already made. Rather, the document-production process is a fluid one at the district-court level, and it often includes contemporaneous review and continuous production determinations by agency-defendants. Thus, in this Court's view, the government is entitled to articulate fully all of the justifications for the withholdings that it makes prior to the Court's ruling on summary judgment-and this is especially so when the Court has expressly invited it to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   To be sure, the D.C. Circuit's precedent prohibits an agency from invoking new FOIA exemptions when the proceeding is before the district court\n   <em>\n    after remand\n   </em>\n   , following an appeal, as EPIC points out. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 10 (citing\n   <em>\n    Maydak v.

And no such problem is present here, because the Court never reached the merits of the parties' initial summary judgment motions, and there have not yet been any appellate proceedings. What is more, as far as this Court can tell, EPIC has not been prejudiced in any meaningful sense by the delay in the government's assertion of Exemption 3, nor has it provided any\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   of bad faith with respect to the government's timing on this issue.

The record clearly reveals that DOJ followed a\n   <em>\n    referral\n   </em>\n   process when it responded to EPIC's FOIA request, consistent with the agency's regulations. Specifically, DOJ's regulations expressly provide that, when a DOJ component that is processing a FOIA request \"believes that a different component, agency, or other Federal Government office is best able to determine whether to disclose [a certain] record, the component typically should refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record, as long as the referral is to a component or agency that is subject to the FOIA.\" 28 C.F.R. 16.4(d)(2)(i).

Notably, in section 1.4, the Executive order references eight specific categories of information that \"could reasonably be expected to cause identifiable or describable damage to the national security[,]\" including information pertaining to \"intelligence activities (including covert action) [and] intelligence sources or methods, ... foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, ... [or] vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, infrastructures, projects, plans, or protection services relating to the national security[.]\" E.O. 13,526 \u00a7 1.4(c), (d), (g). Thus, if information that is responsive to a FOIA request fits into any of the eight categories, and if an original classifying authority has\n   designated the information classified based on that authority's determination that the unauthorized disclosure of the information reasonably could be expected to result in damage to the national security, the information has properly been deemed \"classified\" and the government can invoke Exemption 1 to withhold the information from disclosure under the FOIA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Larson v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. at 16-18.) This Court disagrees.

Section 1.4(c) of Executive Order 13,526 provides that information can be deemed classified when \"it pertains to ... intelligence activities (including covert action), intelligence sources or methods, or cryptology[,]\" E.O. 15,526 \u00a7 1.4(c) (emphasis added), and both Sherman and Hardy declare that the redacted portions of the SARs satisfy this requirement.

In this regard, the redacted declarations do appear largely conclusory, but the unredacted versions of their statements provide additional detail in support of this contention, and as noted, the national security-related opinion of qualified government officials is entitled to substantial deference in the classification realm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Larson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641880,7330200\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/857/\">\n    565 F.3d at 864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   EPIC appears to concede that, insofar as the withheld materials concern pen registers, \"a pen register is a 'method' of intelligence gathering\" (Pl.'s Mot. at 16), but it maintains that the \"particular\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    pretation\n   </em>\n   of the FISA pen register provision\n   <em>\n    by the FISC\n   </em>\n   is not itself a 'source' or 'method' of intelligence gathering, but a legal judgment\" (Pl.'s Mot. at 17 (emphasis added).) This argument misses the mark entirely.

Adding to this the Court's review of the classified versions of the Hardy and Sherman Supplemental Declarations, the Court notes that the unredacted declarations contain detailed and logical explanations of the plausible harm that might flow from revealing to potential targets the details about the surveillance methods and techniques that are discussed in the challenged records (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Classified Hardy Suppl.

That is, even if Congress has determined that FISC opinions should generally be made public, as EPIC argues, that this is not an iron-clad statutory mandate, for the statute also establishes that the Director of National Intelligence can\n   <em>\n    waive\n   </em>\n   this disclosure requirement if he or she determines that waiver \"is necessary to protect the national security of the United States or properly classified intelligence sources or methods[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201872\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1872\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). What is more, the FREEDOM ACT was enacted in June 2015-well\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the reports at issue here were created-and there is nothing to indicate that Congress intended the statute to apply retroactively to prior FISC decisions.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fernandez-Vargas v.

Decl. \u00b6 2), which satisfies prong two; and (3) the printouts pertain to the FBI's intelligence methods and activities (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. at 17), which satisfies the third prong of the applicable framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The parties' dispute thus centers around the risks of harm associated with disclosure of these printout outs, which are otherwise publicly available on Westlaw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   EPIC maintains that the Westlaw printouts cannot themselves be withheld under Exemption 1 because their public status dispels any risk of harm from disclosure in this matter. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   (\"The DOJ's argument that publicly available Westlaw printouts are also exempt from disclosure reveals the absurdity of the agency's position.\").) The government acknowledges that the Westlaw printouts may appear \"otherwise innocuous[,]\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n at 13), but it insists that the printouts must be evaluated\n   <em>\n    in the context in which they exist\n   </em>\n   for the purpose of the instant FOIA request-i.e., as attachments to a classified brief submitted to the FISC-and, when so viewed, the printouts may properly be withheld as classified (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500303\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/30/#p37\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). In this regard, the government's core contention is that, \"when read or viewed within the context of other available documents and information,\" even seemingly innocuous, publicly available information can \"reveal highly sensitive information to sophisticated adversaries, such as critical details about important investigative methods and techniques used by the FBI in national security investigations.\" (2d Decl. of David M. Hardy, ECF No. 24, \u00b6 37; Mot. Hr'g. Tr. at 29 (\"That the MPD here in D.C. may use a pen register trap and trace or some more specific technique under its authority under criminal law to apprehend drug dealers or whoever else here in D.C. is not the same as the FBI acknowledging or confirming that the FBI or the U.S. intelligence community or otherwise uses this authority to interdict or apprehend terrorists[.]\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In this Court's view, the government has the better of this argument. Indeed, the Executive order that governs classification of information expressly contemplates a situation in which otherwise unclassified materials may nevertheless be deemed classified depending on the context in which they are retrieved-it states that \"[c]ompilations of items of information that are individually unclassified may be classified if the compiled information reveals an additional association or relationship that: (1) meets the standards for classification under this order, and (2) is not otherwise revealed in the individual items of information.\" E.O. 13,526 \u00a7 1.7(e). Furthermore, the D.C. Circuit has long held that, in the context of reviewing classification of information, courts must keep in mind that \"[e]ach individual piece of intelligence information, much like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle, may aid in piecing together other bits of information even when the individual piece is not of obvious importance in itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Halperin v.

In this regard, the Court accepts the government's assertion that the Westlaw printouts and the main brief to which they are attached are rightfully construed as a single document, and that disclosure of the attachments would elucidate the substance of the main (undeniably classified) document, such that the government is entitled to withhold the attachments themselves.\n   <em>\n    Mobley v.

No Reasonably Segregable Information Exists In The Withheld Documents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   To the extent that EPIC's argument regarding the government's withholding of the Westlaw printouts can be cast as a general segregability contention (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. at 24), the argument misunderstands the unseverable relationship between the classified FISC brief and its attachments, and thus fails for the reasons explained in Part III.B.2 above. EPIC's more pointed assertion that at least some portion of the Westlaw printouts themselves should have been released on segregability grounds (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 18 (arguing that \"it is implausible that entire legal opinions would be devoid of reasonably segregable material\")) is also misguided, because release of any portion of a Westlaw document carries with it the reasonable risk that anyone with access to public electronic databases such as Lexis and Westlaw could proceed to search for the released language and thereby locate a full copy of the document the government seeks to protect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   As for the SARS, this Court has conducted a careful\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the information that the government has withheld as well as its classified supplemental declarations, and it finds that the government has satisfied its obligation \"of demonstrating that no reasonably segregable material exists in the withheld documents[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Barouch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3877301\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/962/30/#p56\">\n    962 F.Supp.2d at 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Stated simply, the SARS redactions are\n   narrowly tailored, and the Court agrees with the government that it is not possible for any additional information to be released without disclosing the very information that the government seeks to protect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mobley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326779\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/924/24/#p73\">\n    924 F.Supp.2d at 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Government Must Explain Certain Challenged Redactions That Are Not Adequately Addressed In The Supplemental Submissions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   All that said, this Court's in camera review revealed certain inconsistencies in the redactions that the government must address. First, the government appears to have mistakenly labeled certain material as\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   being within the Remaining Challenges identified in\n   <em>\n    EPIC II\n   </em>\n   , when it appears to fall within the categories of information that are still in dispute. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , pages 53-54 of Document 124, under the heading \"Other Legal Interpretations under FISA by the FISC\"; page 56 of Document 124, under the heading \"FISA Process Improvements\"; and page 69 of Document 127, under the heading \"FISA Process Improvements.\") Based on its review of the unredacted text, the Court believes that this material may in fact be within the Remaining Challenges, and therefore, the government must either explain why the Court's reading is incorrect, or submit a supplemental declaration that provides an explanation for why the information is exempt from disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Second, the government has labeled at least one footnote as outside the Remaining Challenges even though the footnote pertains to text that the government admits is within the Remaining Challenges. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Document 126, page 57.) The Court will require the government to explain this discrepancy in its supplemental submission, and if the government agrees that the material is within the Remaining Challenges, it must provide a declaration that addresses the text of the footnote and why it is exempt from disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Third, and finally, on page 59 of Document 127, there is a notation that material is \"within the remaining challenged withholdings,\" even though no redactions appear on the page, and the government will therefore be required to explain the notation that it has made on this page.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   After careful consideration of the parties' briefings and DOJ's ex parte and classified submissions, and as set forth in the accompanying Order, the Court upholds the government's general invocations of Exemptions 1 and 3 to withhold the remaining items at issue in this lawsuit. Therefore, as set forth in its Order of September 30, 2017, DOJ's motion for summary judgment has been\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and EPIC's motion for summary judgment has been\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   without prejudice with respect to the withholding addressed in the supplemental declarations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Court will provide the government with one final opportunity to support the withholdings outlined above in Section III.D, and it will require supplemental submissions as outlined in the Order that accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    As explained herein (\n    <em>\n     see infra\n    </em>\n    Part III.A.1), in the course of evaluating the response to EPIC's FOIA request, DOJ referred particular responsive documents to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") and the National Security Agency (\"NSA\") for review and exemption determinations. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Decl. of Mark A. Bradley (\"Bradley Decl.\"), ECF No. 22-3, \u00b6 7.) The NSA and the FBI are not parties to this lawsuit; however, the Remaining Challenges involve withholding determinations that these agencies made. Therefore, the Court will collectively refer to those two agencies, along with DOJ (the named defendant), as \"the government\" when discussing the various withholdings.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Page numbers cited herein refer to those that the Court's electronic case filing system automatically assigns.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Section III.B\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , further explains why the redacted material either constitutes intelligence sources and methods, or is classified, or has otherwise been properly withheld.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    This is for good reason, as it makes little sense to instruct an agency to refer documents to another agency for the latter agency to make exemption determinations (or, if the consultation process is used, to consult with another before making its own release determination), but at the same time circumscribe the ability of either agency to invoke an otherwise-applicable FOIA exemption as a result of the referral or consultation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    EPIC's own brief provides an example of just how such reverse-search-engineering is done. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n at 7-8 &amp; n.3 (noting that EPIC was able to determine which unnamed district court case the government was discussing in a memorandum submitted to the FISC where that case was the only one \"according to a Westlaw search, that includes the same language quoted in the NSD's Verified Memorandum of Law\").) Thus, because release of any portion of the case printouts would disclose the exact information that DOJ seeks to protect, no reasonably segregable material exists in the withheld documents.\n    <em>\n     Barouch\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3877301\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/962/30/#p56\">\n     962 F.Supp.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    56 ;\n    <em>\n     Mobley\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326779\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/924/24/#p73\">\n     924 F.Supp.2d at 73\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
