Plaintiff William Saintcome (\"Saintcome\" or \"plaintiff\") asserts that two defendant correctional officers, Officer Jason Tully (\"Tully\") and Officer C. Perrin (\"Perrin\"), deprived him of his civil rights. Saintcome alleges that while he was awaiting release from the segregation unit of the Billerica House of Corrections (\"BHOC\") in Billerica, Massachusetts, the defendant officers used improper, excessive force against him in violation of his constitutional rights under the Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. He also alleges state tort claims of assault and battery against both defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending before the Court are defendants' motion to dismiss and plaintiff's motion to appoint counsel. For the reasons that follow, plaintiff's motion to appoint counsel will be denied and defendants' motion to dismiss will also be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff is a prisoner at Massachusetts Correctional Institution-Concord appearing pro se. Prior to his incarceration in that facility, he was imprisoned awaiting trial at the BHOC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Saintcome alleges that on November 12, 2014, he was scheduled to be released from the BHOC's segregation unit. Defendant Perrin and a third corrections officer, Officer Corindina (\"Corindina\"), had placed Saintcome in restraints before his daily recreation time. When time came to remove the restraints, defendant Tully appeared. Saintcome requested that Corindina, rather than Tully, remove the restraints. He did so because of a prior verbal confrontation with Tully, when the officer allegedly denied him a meal that satisfied his religious dietary restrictions and Tully made derogatory remarks about plaintiff's Islamic faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to the complaint, when Saintcome requested that Corindina remove his restraints, Tully slammed his head into the cell wall and pushed him onto the bunk where his head hit the metal frame. Perrin then allegedly entered the cell and elbowed Saintcome four times in the face before Corindina intervened and commanded Tully to leave, at which time Tully allegedly engaged in another tirade of racial and religious epithets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 14, 2016, plaintiff filed a complaint alleging violations of his civil rights against Officers Tully and Perrin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Pursuant to Fed.

Given that Saintcome was restrained at the time of the incident, a factfinder could plausibly infer that the alleged acts of Tully and Perrin did not constitute an objectively reasonable use of force. Furthermore, plaintiff has alleged that the motivation for the force was racial and religious animus on the part of Tully, rather than a desire to preserve order and discipline. Thus, plaintiff has properly stated a claim of excessive force against both defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When a pretrial detainee makes an allegation of excessive force, there is an open question concerning the specific civil right which has been infringed.

For the purpose of this motion, we accept as pled the plaintiff's uncontested claim that the civil right implicated in this instance of purported excessive force was his right to be free of unreasonable seizure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendants maintain that the use of force described in the complaint cannot rise to the level of a constitutional violation because the quantum of force used was\n   <em>\n    de\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    minimis\n   </em>\n   .

Because, at the time of the incident, plaintiff was not convicted of a crime but rather was a pre-trial detainee, it is the Fourth, not the Eighth, Amendment that is implicated. The proper standard in this case is to examine whether, in the context of the incident, the level of force used against Saintcome was objectively reasonable. See\n   <em>\n    Kingsley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590968\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2466/#p2473\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . An attempt to quantify the harm suffered by plaintiff has little bearing on whether the force was necessary or reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Taking these facts as true, plaintiff has pled facts that plausibly constitute a claim of excessive force.
