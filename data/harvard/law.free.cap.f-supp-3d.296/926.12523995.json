Currently before the Court is Defendant's motion [17] to transfer venue to the Central District of California pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). For the reasons explained below, Defendant's motion is granted.

Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff is a Danish makeup artist. [1 \u00b6 4.] Since 2010, Plaintiff has developed and sold a line of luxury organic beauty products, including cosmetics, makeup, and skin care products, through her licensee Kjaer Weis, LLC. [\n   <em>\n    I\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    d.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 28.] These products have been featured in several national publications and are available for purchase at various retail outlets. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-31.] In connection with this product line, Plaintiff owns several registered trademarks for stylized versions of her initials (\"KW\") and her full last name (\"Kjaer Weis\"). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-14.] All of Plaintiff's beauty products are branded with Plaintiff's marks. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.] Plaintiff lives in New York, New York, and her company is also based there. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant is a California loan-out corporation with a principal place of business in Woodland Hills, California. [1 \u00b6 17; 19 at 4.] Defendant has no offices or employees in Illinois. [19 at 4.] Defendant is owned by television personality Kim Kardashian West (\"Kardashian\"). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Through Defendant, Kardashian endorses various products and services, including beauty and cosmetics products, which are branded with her name and/or her initials. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; 1 \u00b6 37.] Kardashian is a resident of Calabasas, California, and she does not live in or own property in Illinois. [19 at 4; 19-1 \u00b6 2.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This dispute involves a cosmetics line called \"KKW Beauty\" that was released publicly in June 2017. [1 \u00b6 38; 19 at 4.] Kardashian endorses and sponsors this brand, and the products are branded with Kardashian's initials (\"KKW\"). [19 at 4.] KKW Beauty products are sold exclusively online and are available to consumers across the United States (including those in Illinois). [1 \u00b6\u00b6 22-23; 19-1 \u00b6 7.] Seed Beauty (a third party not named as a defendant) designs, manufactures, and distributes the KKW Beauty products. [1 at Ex. J; 32 at 9.] Seed Beauty is based in Oxnard, California. [19 at 5; 32 at 9.] Kardashian's manager Kris Jenner was responsible for negotiating the agreements underlying Kardashian's involvement with KKW Beauty products. [19 at 5; 19-1\n   \u00b6 11.] Ms. Jenner resides in Los Angeles County, California. [19-1 \u00b6 11.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendant is a direct competitor in the beauty product market and that Defendant's \"KKW\" designations on KKW Beauty products are confusingly similar to Plaintiff's marks. [1 \u00b6\u00b6 18-24, 37-43.] Plaintiff further alleges that because of this similarity, consumers will likely be confused and mistakenly believe that her beauty products are affiliated with Kardashian. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24, 33-36.] Plaintiff filed this action on July 25, 2017, asserting claims for trademark infringement under the Lanham Act, unfair competition under the Lanham Act, violation of the Illinois Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, common law trademark infringement, and common law unfair competition. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44-75.] Plaintiff seeks both damages and equitable relief. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-17.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant has moved pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) to transfer this case to the Central District of California. [See 17.] Defendant argues that the Central District of California is a more appropriate forum because it provides better access to documents and witnesses, it is the situs of the acts of alleged infringement, and California has a stronger interest in adjudicating this dispute than Illinois. Plaintiff counters that venue is proper in Illinois, material events occurred in Illinois, and it would be inconvenient for Plaintiff and Plaintiff's witnesses to travel to California. [See 24.] Alternatively, Plaintiff argues that if transfer is considered appropriate, this action should be transferred to the Southern District of New York instead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Section 1404(a) provides that, \"[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought or to any district or division to which all parties have consented.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Section 1404(a) authorizes the Court to transfer matters based on an \"individualized, case-by-case consideration of convenience and fairness.\"\n   <em>\n    Stewart Org., Inc. v. Ricoh Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774917\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/22/#p29\">\n    487 U.S. 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774917\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/22/#p29\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774917\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/22/#p29\">\n    101 L.Ed.2d 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988).

The Court may transfer a case under section 1404(a) when: \"(1) venue is proper in the transferor district; (2) venue is proper in the transferee district; (3) the transfer will serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses; and (4) the transfer will serve the interests of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Hanover Ins.

Considering the five factors together, the Court concludes that Defendant has met its burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Plaintiff's Choice of Forum\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This factor weighs slightly against transfer to the Central District of California. \"[P]laintiff's choice of forum is generally given substantial weight, particularly when it is the plaintiff's home forum.\"\n   <em>\n    Aldridge v.

Ill. 1999). Plaintiff does not live in Illinois, nor is her business based in this state. [See 1 \u00b6 4.] Plaintiff argues that her choice of this District is still entitled to some weight because relevant conduct took place in Illinois: the allegedly infringing KKW Beauty products were advertised and sold here. [24 at 6-7.] But these products were equally available for sale in\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   other states through the KKW Beauty website, and \"[s]ales alone are insufficient to establish a substantial connection to the forum if the defendant's goods are sold in many states.\"\n   <em>\n    Anchor Wall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11585713\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/55/871/#p874\">\n    55 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   874 ; see also\n   <em>\n    Bodum USA, Inc. v.

The Relative Ease of Access to Sources of Proof\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The third factor, relative ease of access to sources of proof, weighs slightly in favor of transfer. This factor typically focuses on documentary evidence, as the convenience of witnesses is assessed separately. See\n   <em>\n    Qurio Holdings, Inc. v.
