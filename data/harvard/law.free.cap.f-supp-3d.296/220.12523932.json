Her complaint seeks $20 million in punitive damages, $300,000 in compensatory damages, $300,000 in interest, a pay raise, and any reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. Her case comes before me on the Defendant's motion to dismiss in part and for summary judgment. Because there is no genuine dispute of material fact and the Defendant is entitled to summary judgment, the Defendant's motion will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   According to the complaint, Ms. Hinds an African-American woman who was initially hired by the Federal Government on June 19, 1992 at the GS-7 level. Compl. \u00b6 10. Ms. Hinds alleges that, in the 21 years between that time and the time that she began her current job as an examiner for the CFPB, she worked at a number of federal agencies, where she received numerous promotions and was never reprimanded.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-11. During her time at the CFPB, Ms. Hinds alleges, she has been denied promotion, reprimanded, and otherwise subjected to race and sex discrimination in violation of Title VII.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-25. Ms. Hinds also alleges that she has been repeatedly subjected to retaliation for opposing Title VII violations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-40. Each allegation will be discussed below, in connection with its merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   However, one allegation may be worth mentioning at the outset, given that Ms. Hinds has emphasized it in at least nine subsequent filings and because it provides some context for the allegations that follow. Ms. Hinds claims that her then-manager, Marsha Vaughn, \"inappropriately distributed a violent image to the Plaintiff and other employees who reported to her.\" Compl. \u00b6 36. Ms. Hinds' filings repeatedly refer to this \"\n   <strong>\n    [e]mail containing a horrifically violent image depicting the overkill [of] a snowman that was slaughtered by five machetes\n   </strong>\n   that the Plaintiff's former manager, Marsha Vaughn, sent to her and all of the employees who report to her.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the complaint, the fact\n   that Ms. Vaughn sent this email supports Ms. Hinds' view that the CFPB was retaliating against her by assigning her to work under Ms. Vaughn.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The record reflects that, on February 3, 2015, someone sent an email titled \"winter\" to several people, including Ms. Hinds and Ms. Vaughn.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The email asks, \"Joe-is this your thoughts?\" and contains the following image:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3575311,5742599\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/1191/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Vaughn's reply to the group states, \"I love this!!\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although the interpretation\n   of Ms. Vaughn's reply email could perhaps be subjective, Ms. Hinds appears to see the specter of the slaughtered snowman as a particularly pointed and chilling example of her mistreatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ms. Hinds initially contacted the CFPB's Equal Employment Opportunity (\"EEO\") Office in September 2013, but she did not have sufficient evidence to lodge a formal complaint at that time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. On March 28, 2014, Ms. Hinds again contacted the EEO Office, and on May 15, 2014, she filed her formal EEO complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. A at 1. The CFPB's Office of Civil Rights investigated Ms. Hinds' complaint, which it permitted her to amend four times during the course of the investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On November 9, 2016, an initial adjudicator issued a decision granting the Defendant's motion for summary judgment on several grounds, including that there was no evidence of discriminatory or retaliatory intent, that there was no evidence linking the alleged harassment to Ms. Hinds' race or sex, and that the preponderance of the evidence did not show that the Defendant's legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for the allegedly retaliatory actions were pretextual.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. The decision noted that \"most of Ms. Hinds' claims were petty disputes about agency policy or objection[s] to minor and rote activities taken by the agency\" and that Ms. Hinds appeared to have read a report related to the CFPB's diversity and to have \"conclude[d] that she was a victim of discrimination before she reported to work on her first day.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The CFPB adopted the decision's findings and analysis in a final agency order on November 18, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After receiving the CFPB's final order, Ms. Hinds filed a timely complaint in this court. The Defendant filed a motion to dismiss in part and for summary judgment on April 4, 2017. The motion is now ripe, and I conclude that it should be granted for the reasons explained below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The record reflects that Ms. Hinds emailed Ms. Vaughn at the end of a period of bereavement leave to let her know that she would be taking a sick day on May 3, 2015, taking a leave day on May 4, 2015, and returning to work on May 5, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex.

Ms. Vaughn offered no objection, but asked Ms. Hinds what she would be working on off-site.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Rather than answering the question, Ms. Hinds replied, \"When I am assigned to exam, I am under the supervision of the Portfolio FM and the EIC. I believe that they are both responsible enough to make certain that my workload is appropriate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Whatever insights this exchange may give into Ms. Hinds' amenability to supervision, this incident is not actionable under Title VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Ms. Hinds' fourteenth retaliation claim is that Ms. Vaughn retaliated against her by failing to conduct a promotion review within 30 days of May 5, 2015. Compl. \u00b6 40. Ms. Hinds alleges that such review was required by CFPB policies and procedures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, the Defendant has explained that the CFPB's promotion policy, as quoted in the complaint itself, required a promotion review within 30 days of May 5, 2014. Def.'s Memo. ISO Mot. Summary Judgment at 33.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Defendant has explained Ms. Vaughn's failure to conduct a promotion review on the legitimate grounds that CFPB policy did not call for her to conduct a promotion review, Ms. Hinds did not ask for her to conduct a promotion review, and Ms. Hinds had written to Ms. Vaughn stating, \"Regarding my plan to reach [promotion], I will not be discussing that particular issue with you.

Even drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor, the Court is left with a very different conclusion: that Ms. Hinds has ascribed unlawful motives to run-of-the-mill workplace annoyances and well-meaning efforts by her colleagues to supervise and train a difficult employee. Racial discrimination is a persistent and invidious threat to our society's welfare, but like pulling a fire alarm for kicks in a nursing home, false allegations of discrimination impose high costs on us, too.

According to Ms. Hinds, this insinuation was made in \"Defendant's summary Judgment\" (presumably a document or decision related to the administrative proceedings that preceded this case), which stated as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n    Complainant's argument that no one from the Southeast Region should supervise her is even more farfetched, and it is contradicted by the Complainant's simultaneous assertion that she should have been assigned to Mr. Chicorikas-a supervisor [in] the Northeast Region, which also has EEO activity, including Complainant's own complaints.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3575311,5742599\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/1191/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    I do not believe this statement insinuates that Ms. Hinds filed an EEO complaint against Mr. Chicorikas. In any event, whether or not Ms. Hinds filed an EEO complaint against Mr. Chicorikas is irrelevant to the analysis above and has no impact on the disposition of this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Ms. Hinds also failed to exhaust this claim, which provides an alternative basis for summary judgment as discussed above.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    This is the last of Ms. Hinds' unexhausted claims. The Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on this claim due to Ms. Hinds' failure to exhaust as well as for the reasons explained here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Ms. Hinds also alleges in this paragraph of her complaint that the Defendant responded to her EEO complaint in part by stating (presumably in a filing), \"Complainant's allegation that this request was somehow retaliatory defies common sense ....\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3575311,5742599\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/1191/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Ms. Hinds notes that \"the requirements for filing an EEO Complaint do not mandate common sense as a prerequisite\" and alleges that the Defendant's statement associates \"filing an EEO complaint with the lack of common sense,\" thereby deterring employees from protected conduct.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3575311,5742599\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/1191/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    However, the statement in question clearly refers to a specific allegation as defying common sense and not to the activity of filing an EEO complaint as defying common sense. I make no comment regarding her claim that \"[t]he CFPB supposedly has controls in place in their hiring procedures to weed out applicants without common sense.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3575311,5742599\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/1191/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Ms. Hinds' complaint about not being promoted at that date is discussed above.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Ms. Hinds makes five discovery requests.

At that time, the CFPB sent Ms. Hinds a letter stating that, due to an official's inadvertent failure to maintain appropriate calendar access controls, other CFPB personnel could have improperly accessed limited information related to her that was contained in eight calendar entries for phone calls or meetings.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Ex.
