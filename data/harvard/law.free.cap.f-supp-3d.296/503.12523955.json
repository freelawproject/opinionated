Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   After a four-week trial and complex jury verdict, this memorandum and order addresses pre-and post-verdict Rule 50 motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The case involves: (1) a simple contract question of whether critical terms of an agreement were in effect assented to by the consistent conduct of the parties; on this point the jury verdict, granting damages to the plaintiffs, is set aside; (2) whether employees working and classified as independent entities, but under individual contract and control of the employer were entitled to the protection of state and federal wage laws; on this point the jury verdict, finding the wage laws applicable, is affirmed; and (3) whether employees working or \"on-call\" for their employer after they physically leave the employer's office, while they are at home and under conditions that impede them from going about their normal life, are entitled to overtime pay; on this point the jury's verdict, finding that they were at work while at home, is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Defendants' Product and Nature of Industry\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Defendant Aqualife USA, Inc., (\"Aqualife\") sells and services water filtration systems to the Russian speaking community in New York City and its environs. Trial Tr. 1191:21. The company was formed in 2004, along with its subsidiary Aqualife, Inc. Trial Tr. 1190:3-11. It is owned and operated by defendants Yakov Sionov, Vladimir Gorbach, and Alexander Gitelman. Trial Tr. 1190:3-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The company employs a number of salespeople, who are paid commissions, as well as office staff, who are paid hourly wages and perform clerical and \"telemarketing\" work under direction of management. Trial Tr. 1192:1-9. Some employees\n   are required to create independent corporate entities through which they are paid for the services they render. Trial Tr. 1192:15-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   All individual plaintiffs were under contract with Aqualife, but were paid through their personal corporations. Plaintiffs Victoria Leevson and her husband, Michael Leibzon, are owners and operators of Matana Enterprises, Inc. (\"Matana\"). Trial Tr. 1199:1-6. Plaintiff Katherine Tsigel and her husband Vadim Tsigel (who is not a party to this suit) own and operate VadKat, Inc. (\"VadKat\"). Plaintiff Vladislav Pustov is the owner and operator of Imperial Enterprise Services, Inc. (\"Imperial\"). Trial Tr. 1197:6-1198:22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Each individual plaintiff and their corporation sues Aqualife USA, Inc., Aqualife, Inc., and owners Alex Gitelman, Yakov Sionov, and Vladimir Gorbach, individually, jointly and severally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   They assert claims that they were not paid commissions and wages, in breach of their individual contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Plaintiffs Victoria Leevson and Katherine Tsigel also individually claim under state and federal labor laws that they were not paid wages earned and overtime, and not provided with proper wage statements and notices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Jury Verdict and Rule 50 Motions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   After four weeks of trial and thousands of pages of exhibits, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs on their claims for commissions and wages, overtime pay, and lack of wage statements and notices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App. E, Jury Instructions and Verdict Sheet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Jury Verdict\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   For breach of contract, the jury awarded: $5,982 for commissions to Matana; $4,056 for commissions to VadKat; $77,500 for commissions to Imperial; $25,680.54 for hourly compensation and $87,989 for commissions to Victoria Leevson; $5,982.60 for commissions to Michael Leibzon; $48,320.45 for hourly compensation and $159,691.89 for commissions to Katherine Tsigel; and $77,500 for commissions to Vladislav Pustov. Mr. Pustov and his company Imperial were awarded \"residual commissions\" through 2026.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App. E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Under the FLSA and the NYLL, the jury awarded: $2,500 for wage notice violations, $2,500 for wage statement violations, and $25,680.54 for overtime pay to Victoria Leevson; and $2,500 for wage notice violations, $2,500 for wage statement violations, and $48,320.45 for overtime pay to Katherine Tsigel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Rule 50 Motions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The defendants orally and in writing made the following motions pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a)-(b) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   (1) Motion for judgment as a matter of law on plaintiffs' FLSA and NYLL claims, ECF No. 164, Aug. 17, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   (2) Motion for judgement as a matter of law on plaintiffs' breach of contract claims on the ground that plaintiffs assented to the contract terms offered by defendants, ECF No. 165, Aug. 17, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   (3) Motion for judgement as a matter of law on plaintiffs' breach of contract claims for residual commissions as barred by the statute of frauds, ECF No. 166, Aug. 17, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   (4) Letter in support of motion for judgment as a matter of law on plaintiffs' breach of contract claims, ECF No. 167, Aug. 17, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   (5) Reply to plaintiffs' memorandum in opposition to defendants third motion for judgment as a matter of law, ECF No. 181, Aug. 23, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   (6) Fourth motion for judgment as a matter of law on plaintiffs' breach of contract claims against the individual defendants, ECF No. 183, Aug. 27, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   (7) Fifth motion for judgment as a matter of law on plaintiffs' FLSA and NYLL claims against defendants, ECF No. 184, Aug. 27, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   (8) Sixth motion for judgment as a matter of law on the grounds that plaintiffs Leevson and Tsigel are exempt from overtime requirements as commissioned salespersons, ECF No. 187, Aug. 28, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   (9) Motion for judgment as a matter of law, motion for new trial, ECF No. 200, Sept. 29, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   (10) Reply in support re motion for judgment as a matter of law, ECF No. 211, Oct. 22, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Plaintiffs filed responses to defendants' motions as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   (1) Memorandum in opposition to defendants' first motion for judgment as a matter of law, ECF No. 170, Aug. 21, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   (2) Memorandum in opposition to defendants' third motion for judgment as a matter of law, ECF No. 178, Aug. 23, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   (3) Response to defendants' fifth motion for judgment as a matter of law, ECF No. 185, Aug. 28, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   (4) Motion for judgment as a matter of law post-verdict, ECF No. 202, Sept. 29, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   (5) Memorandum in opposition re motion for judgment as a matter of law, ECF No. 210, Oct. 17, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   (6) Memorandum in support of plaintiffs' motion for judgment as a matter of law, ECF No. 212, Oct. 23, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The court reserved judgment on all Rule 50 motions. After the verdict the court adjourned the case so the parties could fully brief and argue all the issues raised in their motions; it requested submission of a form and amount of judgment, including costs, disbursements, interest, penalties, and legal fees. ECF No. 194, Sept. 1, 2017;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 199, Sept. 26, 2017 (Court order directing the contents of parties briefing).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Testimony and Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Aqualife's Independent Business Owner Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Aqualife required every salesperson and most workers to sign an Independent Business Owner (\"IBO\") contract. The relevant terms of the contract state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   1. IBO is not [Aqualife's] employee or representative. He is an independent legal person, who is familiar with the rules and regulations of the company.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   5. IBO is entitled to receive commission fees and profit as per marketing plan of the company.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   7. The company reserves the right to change the conditions, prices, marketing plan at any time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   App. A, IBO Contract, Vladislav Pustov.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Marketing Plan\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The parties produced different versions of the marketing plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App. B, Defendants' Plan; App. C, Plaintiffs' Plan. The provenance of both are dubious. Both, however, are irrelevant because the invariable practice of the parties defined the critical terms of the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Vladislav Pustov\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Plaintiff Vladislav Pustov met defendant Yakov Sionov in 2005; soon after, he signed an IBO agreement to sell water filtration systems for Aqualife. Trial Tr. 55:17-18; App. A. Mr. Pustov testified that based on a verbal agreement with Mr. Sionov, he was to receive a thirty-five percent commission-without deductions-of\n   all sales he made. Trial Tr. 71:8-13. He also would receive a \"residual commission\" of five percent a year, in perpetuity, from each client that requires yearly maintenance of their filtration system. Trial Tr. 79:1-83:17. Nevertheless, deductions were consistently taken out of his commission for fees, presents and expenses. Trial Tr. 91:1-96:5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   On cross-examination, Mr. Pustov was shown a marketing plan produced by defendants. He testified that he received this plan in 2006, but that it did not contain the language in the bottom right corner, describing deductions to be taken from the salesperson's commissions. Trial Tr. 161:7-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   After the close of the defendants' case, Mr. Pustov was called as a rebuttal witness and produced for the first time what he claimed was the original version of the marketing plan that he was given when he was first hired, and that contained no language about deductions. Trial Tr. 1613:6-1614:7; App. C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Michael Leibzon\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Michael Leibzon signed an IBO agreement with Aqualife to begin selling water filtration systems in 2009. Trial Tr. 223:6-9. He testified that he was told by Vladimir Gorbach that he would be paid \"35 percent straight\" commission on each system he sold; he also would receive an extra five percent commission on sales he booked himself, and a yearly five percent residual commission, in perpetuity, from payments for maintenance of the systems. Trial Tr. 227:7-10; 242:15-243:12. He never received a marketing plan. Trial Tr. 231:8-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Mr. Leibzon testified that \"from the very first check [he] received\" deductions were taken out of his commissions. Trial Tr. 330:10-16; 379:14. He routinely objected to the defendants about his payment, and, in 2012, Mr. Leibzon quit working for Aqualife because he believed he was being improperly compensated. Trial Tr. 255:8-12; 267:10-269:16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Katherine Tsigel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Katherine Tsigel was hired in 2006 to work in Aqualife's telemarketing department where she would schedule appointments for technicians, resolve complaints, and perform other clerical work. Trial Tr. 448:16-22; 452:22-453-4. She testified that Aqualife's owners agreed to pay her ten dollars hourly, plus ten percent commission for each sale she assisted with and a separate commission for any repairs made to filtration systems.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In 2011, her pay was raised to eleven dollars an hour. Trial Tr. 578:9-17. Management controlled her work schedule and she \"punched\" in and out on the office \"time clock\" each day. Trial Tr. 793:16-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Ms. Tsigel never signed an IBO agreement, and never made outside sales for Aqualife. Trial Tr. 451:1-13. Through their company VadKat, Ms. Tsigel and her husband, who was a salesperson for Aqualife, claimed large deductions on their income tax returns for work as independent contractors. Trial Tr. 611:6-618:18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   She testified that she was paid every week for many years, but was never paid the proper wages or commissions, and was always paid through VadKat. Trial Tr. 738:11-19. She claims roughly $1,000 per week in unpaid wages over a period of six years. Trial Tr. 577:15-578:25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Ms. Tsigel was required by her employer to be available to receive calls at home before and after her regular work hours to assist technicians and salespersons with completing and financing their sales. Trial Tr. 504:9-505:2; 720:7-22. After she received these calls she would often continue to do work on her laptop to assist in the sale and then call the technician back to help complete the transaction. Trial Tr. 807:21-808:19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Victoria Leevson\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Victoria Leevson began working for Aqualife as a salesperson in 2009. Trial Tr. 820:14-15. She testified that Vladimir Gorbach agreed to pay her a thirty-five percent commission without deductions, plus five percent for self-booking, and a five percent yearly residual commission from maintenance to the filtration systems. Trial Tr. 828:4-11. Ms. Leevson says she was regularly paid less than thirty-five percent commission from each sale because of deductions taken for gifts, installation fees and other costs. Trial Tr. 833:10-11; 837.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   After resigning in June 2010, Ms. Leevson was re-hired as an office employee in August of 2011. Trial Tr. 847:23-848:4. In her new role, Ms. Leevson answered phone calls, assisted technicians with sales, and dealt with customer cancellations and complaints. Trial Tr. 875:2-7. She worked daily in the office from nine to seven, and was to be paid ten dollars hourly and ten percent commissions on any sales she assisted with. Trial Tr. 879:2-5; 848:9-25. She \"punched\" in and out each day. Trial Tr. 1000:21-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Ms. Leevson testified that in her second period of employment she received payments for commissions and wages, but it was always less than the correct amount. Trial Tr. 872:2-13; 879:16-18. She claims that her wages were underpaid by $1,240 per week over a period of one year. Trial Tr. 869:16-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   After leaving the office each day, Ms. Leevson was required to continue to assist the technicians and salespeople while at home and answer her phone late into the night.

Under the FLSA, a line has been drawn where an employee is either working or not working. While this division may be convenient, it is imprudently rigid and, by its very terms, unable to equitably account for the realities of on-call employment relationships. During congressional hearings on the FLSA, the statute's chief advocate, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, spoke of ensuring that a person would receive a \"fair day's pay for a fair day's work.\" Indeed, a central motivation for enacting\n   the FLSA was to ensure that people received compensation based, at least in part, on the value of their services. Against this backdrop, this Comment submits that an equitable employment relationship is one in which an employee is compensated at a level that is roughly commensurate to the benefit that the employee provides to his employer per their employment agreement. Under a strict dichotomy in which an employee's time is considered either fully-compensable work or non-compensable leisure time, the establishment of an equitable on-call employment relationship proves largely elusive.

For plaintiffs Victoria Leevson and Katherine Tsigel, this contract also included a sum of wages. Compensation under these contracts, however, was invariably paid out by defendants at less than the agreed upon rates, and acquiesced to by the plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   Plaintiffs testified that during their entire employment they consistently received a thirty-five percent commission on the sales price, after deductions for expenses, presents and fees. They testified that this practice was invariable and continued for years, that the defendants informed them that they were deducting the fees from their commissions, and that they continued to work for the defendants under these terms. While they complained, they accepted these payments and continued working.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   Leevson and Tsigel, testified that they never received the proper payment of their wages, and typically could not distinguish whether they were receiving payment for their hourly wages or commissions.

Because the FLSA claims comprised roughly half of plaintiffs' counsels' work in this case, the fees are reduced by one-half. Plaintiffs' attorney, Svetlana Sobel, is entitled to $107,250 in attorney's fees and $12,900 in \"travel time.\" Her co-counsel is awarded $9,450 and her paralegal $10,200.
