The alleged conduct occurred two days into a course, in which the Plaintiff was enrolled along with his accusers. The plaintiff was placed on temporary suspension pending a disciplinary hearing. Following the hearing held on June 22, 2015, the Campus Discipline Committee unanimously found the plaintiff guilty of three of four charges-Defamation, Threats, Extortion; Disruption; and Academic and Speech Freedom-and recommended the plaintiff's expulsion. The plaintiff appealed the decision to the Campus President, who on July 1, 2015, affirmed the Committee's decision and proposed sanction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiff filed an administrative complaint with OCR, alleging that MDC (1) discriminated against him on the basis of his disability when he was expelled, and (2) retaliated against him because of his prior complaints to OCR when it failed to investigate his complaint of discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following an investigation, OCR determined with regard to the discrimination\n   claim that MDC had violated Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act by failing to conduct an individualized threat assessment before expelling the plaintiff for threatening conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   OCR further determined that MDC's direct threat procedures were not in compliance with Section 504 and Title II, and also raised concerns about the handling of the plaintiff's retaliation claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Res.
