Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Two legal issues are central to this civil rights opinion: first, is it ethical for a government defense attorney to fail to correct plaintiff's counsel's misconception about the proper defendant; and second, should the relation back of an amendment adding a new defendant be allowed\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   to avoid a statute of limitations defense pursuant to the standards of the Supreme Court and the New York Court of Appeals rather than the more rigid standards sometimes applied in cases decided in the Second Circuit. The answer to the first question is \"no,\" such a practice of holding back the identity of the proper defendant is neither ethical nor allowed in the Eastern District of New York under local and national rules. And to the second, \"yes,\" the more flexible standards of the two highest courts allow a\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   amendment avoiding the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff has alleged serious civil rights violations by a New York City police officer. He filed suit the day before the expiration of the statute of limitations naming the wrong police officer in his complaint about his prosecution for robbery. The City's attorney representing the named officer possessed, or should have possessed, knowledge about which police officer was involved in the investigation leading to Plaintiff's prosecution for robbery. When Plaintiff finally learned the name of the officer who was responsible for the alleged harm, the attorney for the City claimed it was too late to amend the complaint to name the proper party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff's amended complaint naming the proper police officer is allowed, with a relation back to the time the original complaint was filed. Defendants' motion for summary judgement on the grounds of a statute of limitations defense is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff was accused of three crimes in 2007: homicide, escape, and robbery. He was acquitted of the homicide and escape by a jury, and the robbery charge was shortly after dismissed. This suit is based primarily on a theory that the police lacked probable cause to bring charges and prosecute Plaintiff for the robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The homicide and escape charges are unrelated to the robbery. Oct. 23, 2017 Hr'g Tr. 12:12-20. Plaintiff was accused of committing a murder on July 28, 2007,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   16:12-20, and it was alleged that while in custody for the homicide charge, Plaintiff, while under the supervision of Detective David Shapiro, escaped from the police precinct,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   9:25-10:6. Eventually, Plaintiff was sent to jail on the homicide and escape charges.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   16:12-17:8; Am. Compl. \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The robbery charge that forms the basis of the present civil suit is based on a different set of facts. On the evening of July 28, 2007, an armed man entered a retail sports store, threatened and assaulted employees, and forcibly removed $4,600 from the cash register. Plaintiff's Response to Defendants' Statement Pursuant to Local Rule 56.1 (\"56.1 Stmt.\") at \u00b6 1, ECF No. 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   About a month later, on August 29, 2007, one of the robbery victims, Mohammad Sarwar, was watching the news on television and saw a picture of Plaintiff on a\n   wanted poster related to the homicide and escape accusations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 3. Mr. Sarwar believed that Plaintiff was the person who robbed the store the previous month; he contacted the 106\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Precinct Detective Squad.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A day later, he met with Detective Fortunato Tranchina, the lead detective responsible for investigating the robbery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4-5. Mr. Sarwar was shown a photo array at the precinct and again identified Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7. The photo array contained a photograph from the wanted poster that Mr. Sarwar had seen the day earlier-the same photograph that prompted him to come forward to the police.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Two other eyewitness-victims of the robbery were also there, Anita Saunders and James Cadawan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They had seen the same wanted poster that Mr. Sarwar saw the prior day, but they expressed some uncertainty about whether Plaintiff was the perpetrator of the robbery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On March 11, 2008, Mr. Sarwar, Ms. Saunders, and Mr. Cadawan returned to the precinct to view a lineup.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8. Mr. Sarwar identified Plaintiff as the guilty person.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. Saunders and Mr. Cadawan viewed the lineup, but did not identify Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. Saunders identified a different person with 80% confidence and Mr. Cadawan told the police that he did not recognize any of the people in the lineup.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On April 24, 2008, Detective Tranchina arrested Plaintiff, who was already in jail on the other charges-homicide and escape-and signed a criminal court complaint charging him with two counts of Robbery in the First Degree.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11. Plaintiff was, on May 15, 2008, indicted by a Grand Jury for one count of Robbery in the First Degree, one count of Robbery in the Second Degree, two counts of Assault in the Second Degree and one count of Criminal Possession of a Weapon (in the robbery) in the Fourth Degree.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13. On September 3, 2008, a criminal court judge determined that the indictment was not defective.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   After spending several years in jail on the robbery, homicide, and escape charges, Plaintiff was tried and acquitted of the homicide and escape. Am. Compl. \u00b6 22. That same day he was released from jail on his own recognizance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23. A month later, on September 6, 2012, the robbery charges were dismissed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Detective Tranchina was the lead detective on the robbery case, which forms the basis of this lawsuit. Plaintiff and his counsel were under the mistaken notion that Detective Shapiro, the officer who was involved in the murder investigation, and from whose custody Plaintiff allegedly escaped, was in charge of the robbery investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. Plaintiff filed suit on this assumption, and named as defendants Detective Shapiro along with twenty John and Jane Doe officers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff believed that Shapiro had orchestrated his arrest for the robbery as payback for his alleged escape. Oct. 23, 2017 Hr'g. Tr. 9:16-10:13. In discovery, Plaintiff found no evidence that this theory was true, but learned of the extensive involvement of Detective Tranchina in the robbery prosecution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiff filed suit on September 5, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. As amended, the complaint asserts claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for deprivation of federal civil rights, malicious abuse of process, malicious prosecution, municipal liability, and a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress under New York state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. at 5-10. The original complaint named The City of New York, David Shapiro, a detective,\n   and twenty John and Jane Doe defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On February 26, 2016, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the action for failure to state a claim. Plaintiff then amended his complaint on March 18, 2016, mooting the motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   April 19, 2016 Order, ECF No. 21. On June 3, 2016, Defendants answered Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Answer, ECF. No. 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   After engaging in discovery, on January 9, 2017, Plaintiff filed a motion to amend his complaint for a second time to add a new defendant, Detective Tranchina, determined in discovery to have been the lead detective in the robbery prosecution at the heart of the instant case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. Am., EFC No. 46. Defendants opposed the motion on the ground that the statute of limitations had run and that the amended pleading did not relate back to the filing of the original complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n Am., ECF No. 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Magistrate judge Mann agreed with Defendants. She issued a Report and Recommendation on February 10, 2017 recommending that Plaintiff's motion to amend his pleadings and add Detective Tranchina be denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. &amp; R., ECF. No. 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   For the reasons indicated below, the statute of limitations does not bar the suit. Relation back is permitted. The report of the magistrate judge recommending denial of permission to amend is reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standard of Review from Objections to Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The magistrate judge issued a Report and Recommendation on the issue of whether Plaintiff should be granted leave to amend his complaint and whether that amendment relates back to the original pleading. Although this is a Report and Recommendation on a motion to amend a pleading, the magistrate judge recognized that it was effectively a dispositive motion because denial would \"foreclose plaintiff's potential claims against Tranchina.\" R. &amp; R. at 2 n.2, ECF. No. 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Since this report is dispositive of Plaintiff's claims, the court reviews it\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ.

Jan. 7, 1999) (\"A dispositive matter is one that disposes of, or terminates, a claim or defense. Because Magistrate Judge Peck's order denying Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint foreclosed the potential claims against P.O. Lorenzo and Lt. Ahearn, it was dispositive.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   A party has fourteen days to object to a Report and Recommendation. Fed. R. Civ. P. 72. Plaintiff did not file an objection.\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grassia v.

The court's review was well within its discretion.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   While a failure to timely object may at times lead to a waiver of a right to review, the court here reviews\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   because of the serious ethical and other considerations that were revealed by Defendants' summary judgment motion. The parties have long been on notice that the court was considering this issue. On March 7, 2017 the court informed the parties that it would hear argument on Plaintiff's motion\n   seeking to amend his complaint along with Defendants' motion for summary judgement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mar. 7, 2017 Order, EFC No. 62. In a later scheduling order the court informed Defendants that \"[c]ounsel for the defendants, the defendants, and prospective defendants may be questioned about their litigation conduct in failing to bring plaintiff's counsel's error to the timely attention of plaintiff's counsel, if that was a failure.\" May 17, 2017 Order, ECF No. 71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

To properly apply a statute of limitation, it is necessary to understand the purposes underlying it. The purposes underlying statutes of limitation of the state of New York is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Statutes of limitation are essentially creatures of the legislative rather than of the judicial process. Although isolated instances of time limitations upon the institution of suits existed prior to the seventeenth century, the genesis of modern comprehensive prescription of time limitations is generally ascribed to the English Limitation Act of 1623.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Statutes of limitation are among the more anomalous creatures of the law. They often operate arbitrarily upon passage of the specified period of time to bar justified as well as unjustified claims, and typically apply whether the delay in bringing suit was justifiable or, indeed, could have been avoided at all. They represent a legislative judgment that such occasional hardship is outweighed by the advantages of barring stale claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   A number of interrelated policy considerations are advanced as the \"advantages\" that outweigh these occasional hardships.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Perhaps most fundamental, certainly most deeply rooted in the \"instinct of men,\" are the considerations that underlie\n   the common appellation of limitation statutes as \"statutes of repose.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   It seems harsh that misdeeds and obligations perhaps long forgotten should remain a source of uncertainty and concern, if those harmed do not seek vindication within a reasonable time. Expectation are developed., with the passage of time, that the slate has been wiped clean of ancient obligations, or even that they have been forgiven, and it is not unreasonable to seek security to mold one's affairs in the light of these expectations. So long as the injured person is given a reasonable time and opportunity to seek any desired redress for personal grievance, and is aware of the bar by the passage of time, concern for that person need not conflict with this policy of repose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   The policy consideration most frequently articulated by courts, however, and the one that has had the greatest effect in shaping the law of limitations, concerns the effect of the passage of time upon the availability and reliability of evidence, and the consequent prejudice to fair and accurate determination of factual disputes. Fairness to the defendant is primarily stressed, but concern for the effectiveness of judicial machinery is also apparent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Less often articulated, but certainly a related element of justification for time limitations, is the experiential knowledge that meritorious claims will usually be pressed within a reasonable period of time, which leads to a presumption of sorts that the probability of merit is less in a stale than a fresh claim. An English judge may have had the probability, as well as the policy of repose in mind, in stating that \"Long dormant claims have often more of cruelty than of justice in them.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   In addition to these general policy considerations, statutes of limitation are often used to implement a legislative attitude toward particular types of actions or particular classes of litigants. The short slander period reflects disfavor of this type of action; the two-year and six months medical malpractice period evidences special favorable treatment of a particular class of defendants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   1 J.

The fact that a plaintiff is represented by counsel in a specific lawsuit does not mean that she was represented the entire time between the events giving rise to the lawsuit and the expiration of the statute of limitations, nor that the representation was adequate. That concern applies with equal force to a civil rights plaintiff who retains counsel shortly prior to filing a complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Limiting\n   <em>\n    Valentin\n   </em>\n   's scope to\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   litigants would also impermissibly afford\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   litigants greater rights than plaintiffs who retained counsel.

The thrust of\n   <em>\n    Valentin\n   </em>\n   is the informational asymmetry between a civil rights plaintiff and the government. This is not a technical rule; this is a function of the structural difference between an individual with limited tools at her disposal to investigate her government, and a municipal lawyer, who has at her disposal a much greater wealth of knowledge and sources of information about City agencies. Representation by counsel does not in itself eliminate this disparity nor does it necessarily give rise to the inference that a plaintiff's interests are being adequately protected.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wechsler v.

A diligence requirement prior to running of statute of limitations in effect creates a pseudo-statute of limitations that can vary widely, chancellor's foot-like in its discretion, and does not comport with the certainty and uniformity necessary to ensure Section 1983's twin goals of deterrence and compensation. In a similar context the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has realized that \"where the facts are peculiarly within the possession and control of the defendant\" the plaintiff may plead the facts \"upon information and belief\" and then utilize discovery procedures to support her allegations.\n   <em>\n    Arista Records, LLC v.

Ethical Obligations of Government Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   A lawyer working for a municipality has many clients. She directly represents the municipality, its agencies, and its employees\n   whose actions might be imputed to their governmental employer. Often overlooked, but no less important, is the lawyer's representation of the resident of the municipality, whose votes and taxes guide and fund the government's activities. That representatives of the government are necessarily representatives of all the people is a hallmark of democratic governance.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Abraham Lincoln, The Gettysburg Address (Nov. 19, 1863) (urging that the American government remain a \"government of the people, by the people, for the people\"); The Federalist No. 22 (Alexander Hamilton) (Dec. 14, 1787) (\"The fabric of American empire ought to rest on the solid basis of THE CONSENT OF THE PEOPLE. The streams of national power ought to flow immediately from that pure, original fountain of all legitimate authority.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   It is uncontroversial that a lawyer representing the government in the criminal context has a heightened ethical obligation that extends beyond just representing the narrow interests of her most direct client; she also must endeavor to \"do justice.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Model Rules of Prof'l Conduct R. 3.8 cmt. 1 (Am.

A multi-tiered system of advocacy is deeply entrenched in the American legal system. It is beyond dispute that the prosecutor has a host of obligations above and beyond the private attorney. The preamble to the Model rules, as explained above, now also expressly recognizes that government lawyers have obligations and autonomy larger than the private attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   A former New York City Corporation Counsel, Michael Cardozo, has supported the position that government attorneys owe an obligation to only government institutional interests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Michael A. Cardozo,\n   <em>\n    The Conflicting Ethical, Legal, and Public Policy Obligations of the Government's Chief Legal Officer,\n   </em>\n   22 J. Prof. Law. 4 (2014). Michael Cardozo recognizes that some \"feel deeply uneasy whenever the government takes on a sympathetic citizen in court,\" but he believes that this is an \"inevitable byproduct of the adversarial system through which the victim of an alleged wrong must seek compensation from the government.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   There is nothing inherent in an adversarial system that prevents the government from dealing justly with its citizens who have legitimate claims to compensation. A prosecutor too deals within an adversarial system but must put the interests of the citizenry and justice ahead of winning at all costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Supportive of Michael Cardozo's position, and relevant to this case, is the history of New York General City Law \u00a7 20(5), which provides that a city \"shall have no power to waive the defense of the statute of limitations.\" The seeming harshness of this rule has been ameliorated by the New York Court of Appels. The Court has limited this rule by noting that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-208\">\n   [a]n agreement to extend the Statute of limitations is not truly a waiver unless it is made after the statutory period has run. Thus, as a general rule a party who has not raised the Statute of Limitations as a defense in the answer or by a motion to dismiss is held to have waived it. A city, as noted, lacks the power to waive the Statute of Limitations but is not otherwise precluded from granting an extension.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   <em>\n    John J.

Pl.'s Mot. Am., ECF No. 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   The Corporation Counsel's obligation to promptly provide Plaintiff with the identity of the correct officer does not stem solely from its ethical obligations, it is also derived from the discovery obligations explained by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Valentin v.

In\n   <em>\n    Valentin\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff filed his complaint the day before the statute of limitations expired. While the Second Circuit Court of Appeals did not reach the question of whether an amended pleading would relate back under the Rule 15(c), it took a strong position that the district court and municipal attorney had an obligation to assist the plaintiff in identifying the officer involved in the case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 74-76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   For months the City sat in silence while a resident it serves had a readily curable defect in his complaint that the Corporation Counsel now claims deprives him of his right to have his claim adjudicated on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   The Corporations Counsel did not adhere to its ethical and discovery obligations in this case. The Corporation Counsel has shown indifference to fairness of outcome and process. Because the Corporation Counsel has not complied with these obligations, it cannot assert the statute of limitations as a defense. Its conduct substantially contributed to plaintiff's failure to name the proper defendant prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

That Plaintiff waited until after deposing Detective Tranchina to amend his complaint should not be held against him. It was reasonable for Plaintiff to use the discovery devices available to ensure that he was naming the correct defendant, after mistakenly identifying the officer controlling the investigation. The burden on Defendants is minimal given that they delayed this case several times and were a cause of Plaintiff's failure to amend promptly. No prejudice is shown to the Corporation Counsel, the City, or Detective Tranchina, since the evidence in the case remains the same and all were aware of it from the beginning.

In\n   <em>\n    Krupski\n   </em>\n   the Supreme Court defined mistake as \"[a]n error, misconception, or misunderstanding; an erroneous belief.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641809,12454862\" index=\"297\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/538/\">\n    560 U.S. at 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641809,12454862\" index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/538/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the instant case, Plaintiff believed that Detective Shapiro led the investigation of the robbery charges against him, when in fact it was Detective Tranchina. This was clearly an erroneous belief, known to be erroneous by defense counsel. It is immaterial why he believed this. Detective Tranchina was never misled; the Corporation Counsel should have informed him of his jeopardy as soon as the Section 50-h hearing was held.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Parts V(A), (C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   The proper focus of the inquiry is on whether Detective Tranchina should have known that had there not been a mistake he would have been named in the complaint. The Corporation Counsel should have informed Detective Tranchina at the inception-or before-the lawsuit about these claims against him. The facts and circumstances of the case should have indicated to his potential attorney, the Corporation Counsel, that Detective Tranchina was the proper defendant, not Detective Shapiro.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   Plaintiff may amend his complaint to substitute Detective Tranchina for Detective Shapiro. Plaintiff's claim against Detective Tranchina is timely under the governing statute of limitations. The Corporation Counsel may not assert the statute of limitations as a defense; it did not adequately discharge its ethical and procedural duties to Plaintiff to disabuse him of his mistake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   The claim against Detective Tranchina relates back to the filing of the original complaint. Dismissing this claim on the basis of the statute of limitations would be inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Valentin v.
