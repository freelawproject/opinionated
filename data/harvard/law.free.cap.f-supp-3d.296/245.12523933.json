[Dkt. # 1], and filed an amended complaint on February 23, 2017, which added Big Bear Caf\u00e9 as a second plaintiff. Am. Compl. The amended complaint alleges the following facts, which the Court must accept as true for the purpose of resolving the pending motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 21, 2006, defendants loaned Davenport $80,000, and he executed a Note in their favor for $80,000 with interest, which had a maturity date of September 21, 2016. Am. Compl. \u00b6 14; Note. The loan was secured by Davenport's property at 1700 1st Street, NW, Washington, DC, the location of Big Bear Caf\u00e9. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 16, 21;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Note; Ex. 2 to Am. Compl. [Dkt. # 9-2] (\"Deed of Trust\"). Although the Note was made to Davenport individually and not to the Caf\u00e9, defendants and Davenport understood that Davenport would use the loan to pay off personal obligations, which would enable him to invest more in the business. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Under the terms of the Note, Davenport could not begin to pay the principal early, unless he paid it all at once. Am. Compl. \u00b6 18;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Note. He could and did pay interest early, though. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18, 29-30;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Note. For years, Davenport believed he was paying money that he owed on the Note, but he was actually paying ahead of schedule, thereby creating a credit with defendants towards future obligations. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 29-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Pursuant to the terms of the Note, Davenport would be in default if he failed to make a payment and that failure continued for four days. Am. Compl. \u00b6 25;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Note. If he was in default, defendants could foreclose on his property. Am. Compl. \u00b6 26;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Note. In January 2008, defendants informed Davenport that he was in default on the Note because he had fallen behind the payments on his first mortgage on the property, and that they were accelerating the Note and requiring him to pay the full principal by September 2008. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 36-38. These terms were not included in the Note, and Davenport was in fact not in default.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39, 44. Defendants threatened to foreclose on Davenport's property if he did not make a full \"lump sum\" payment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. They told Davenport repeatedly that he was required to make additional payments each month, and they demanded that he provide them with financial information about the Caf\u00e9.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-49;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. 11 to Am. Compl. [Dkt. # 9-11] (\"Emails\"). Davenport complied with most of these requests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 46. Defendants continued to make demands, though, and they persisted in their false accusation that Davenport was in default.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-53;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Emails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Davenport filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Columbia on September 2, 2009, which prevented defendants from foreclosing on his property. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 54-55. The bankruptcy court approved Davenport's bankruptcy plan, and he continued making early monthly payments to defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 63-66. During Davenport's first bankruptcy proceeding, defendants filed two proofs of claim, one on October 19, 2009, and the other on September 3, 2013, both asserting that Davenport owed only $80,000 under the Note.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58, 67;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. 3 to Am. Compl. [Dkt. # 9-3]; Ex. 4 to Am. Compl. [Dkt. # 9-4]. On November 17, 2014, defendants told Davenport he had been in default since November 2006. Am. Compl. \u00b6 73. It was at this point that Davenport obtained legal counsel, and realized\n   he had been over-paying defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On March 12, 2015, Davenport filed a Debtor's Corrected Application in his first bankruptcy case, alleging that defendants violated the bankruptcy court's orders when they demanded extra monthly payments. Am. Compl. \u00b6 76. Defendants contested this allegation, claiming that Davenport had been in default since the execution of the Note.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 77-79. The bankruptcy court denied Davenport relief and did not decide how much he owed under the Note; defendants took the position that he owed $114,568.07.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81-82;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. 5 to Am. Compl. [Dkt. # 9-5].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants attempted to foreclose on the property in September 2015. Am. Compl. \u00b6 90;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. 7 to Am. Compl. [Dkt. # 9-7]. On October 14, 2015, Davenport filed his second Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition to stay the attempted foreclosure sale. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 104-07. During the second bankruptcy case, defendants filed a proof of claim alleging that Davenport owed $121,813.88 under the Note.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 120. Davenport objected and argued that he owed only $54,435.00.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 121. The bankruptcy court held a trial to determine the amount due under the Note. It concluded that Davenport owed $53,557.10 due to a credit in his favor, that he had never been in default, and that defendants' representations regarding how much Davenport owed, his knowledge, and the claimed agreements between the parties contrary to the terms of the Note were not credible.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 123;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Bankr. Mem.; Bankr. Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The complaint alleges that throughout the parties' interactions, defendants have harassed Davenport, and that plaintiffs have suffered as a result of defendants' misrepresentations and actions regarding the Note.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 143-47, 156-57, 162, 176-77, 187-88, 193. Count I alleges wrongful foreclosure on Davenport's property. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 134-47. Plaintiffs allege that defendants initiated foreclosure when they knew or should have known that Davenport was not in default.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Counts II and VII allege that defendants breached their contract with Davenport and Big Bear Caf\u00e9 by instituting foreclosure proceedings when Davenport was not in default on the Note, and that they breached the duty of good faith and fair dealing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 148-153, 191-92.
