(Compl., Docket Entry No. 1.) On September 20, 2017, Plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction, seeking a Division II designation for the duration of this litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Pl. Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (\"Pl. Mot.\"), Docket Entry No. 3; Pl. Mem. in Supp. of Pl. Mot. (\"Pl. Mem.\"), Docket Entry No. 3-1.) Defendant United States Soccer Federation, Inc. (\"USSF\" or \"Defendant\") opposed the motion on October 16, 2017, and Plaintiff replied on October 23, 2017. (Def. Opp'n to Pl. Mot. (\"Def. Opp'n\"), Docket Entry No. 27; Pl. Reply to Def. Opp'n to Pl. Mot. (\"Pl. Reply\"), Docket Entry No. 30.) The Court heard oral arguments on October 31, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the Court finds that Plaintiff has shown irreparable harm, that the balance of hardships tips in its favor, and that an injunction would not harm the public interest, because as set forth below, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not made a clear showing of entitlement to relief, the Court denies Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff NASL is a men's professional soccer league located in the United States and Canada.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6 2.) NASL formed in 2009 when several teams broke away from the United Soccer Leagues, another men's professional league, due to differing visions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77; Stefan Szymanski Decl. in Supp. of Pl. Mot. (\"Szymanski Decl.\") \u00b6 76, Docket Entry No. 3-3.) At that time,\n   the United Soccer Leagues consisted of two divisions, USL First and Second Divisions (\"USL-1\" and \"USL-2\" respectively). (Sunil K. Gulati Decl. in Supp. of Def. Opp'n to Pl. Mot. (\"Gulati Decl.\") \u00b6 113, Docket Entry No. 26-1.) After the formation of the NASL, the remaining teams in the United Soccer Leagues later created the current existing United Soccer League Pro (\"USL\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) From its inception, NASL has been organized under a club-centric model with each individual team retaining ownership and decision-making power. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 77.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant USSF is a non-profit, membership organization which serves as the governing body for soccer in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16; Pl. Mem. at 1.) USSF asserts that it derives its authority to govern professional soccer from F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (\"FIFA\"), a private international soccer federation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 16, 59.) USSF also serves as the national governing body for U.S. Olympic and amateur soccer under the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act (\"Stevens Act\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59 n.3.) In both capacities, USSF's stated mission is to \"make soccer, in all its forms, a preeminent sport in the United States and to continue the development of soccer at all recreational and competitive levels.\" (Steven R. Peterson Decl. in Supp. of Def. Opp'n to Pl. Mot. (\"Peterson Decl.\") \u00b6 44, Docket Entry No. 26-6.) The USSF membership is divided primarily into four categories: (1) a Youth Council, representing the interests of youth soccer; (2) an Adult Council, representing the interests of amateur soccer; (3) a Professional Council, representing the interests of professional leagues that are members of USSF; and (4) an Athlete's Council, representing soccer athletes. (Gulati Decl. \u00b6 33.) These four councils, along with a few other eligible voters, make up the National Council, the legislative body of USSF. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   USSF adopts, amends and applies the Professional League Standards (\"PLS\"), a set of requirements for professional soccer leagues seeking Division I, II, or III designation in the United States. Similar to the structure of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (\"NCAA\"), Division I status is the most desirable. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 2.) Division I status signifies the highest level of competition and overall status, conferring several competitive and financial benefits, including better positioning in international competitions and higher-quality sponsorships. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 41, 62-63.) NASL asserts that USSF adopted and applied the PLS in a discriminatory manner as part of a conspiracy to entrench Major League Soccer, LLC (\"MLS\"), a men's soccer league with long-standing ties to Defendant, and USL as the sole Division I and II soccer leagues in the United States, respectively.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4, 7, 23, 52, 122.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Development of MLS and ties to USSF\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Professional \"football\" or soccer has had a long, troubled history in the United States. While USSF itself was initially formed in 1913 in part in combination with the American Football Association, an organization \"compromised principally of professional leagues and teams,\" professional soccer leagues in the United States have failed to maintain lasting success. (Gulati Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 48, 69.) Until the 1990s, there were numerous leagues and teams, with the original North American Soccer League (\"Original NASL\") being most prominent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48; Compl. \u00b6 70.) Formed in 1968, the Original NASL folded in 1984, leaving a void in top-tier professional soccer leagues in the United States. (Compl. \u00b6 70; Gulati Decl. \u00b6 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 1988, FIFA awarded USSF the right to host the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States. (Gulati Decl. \u00b6 50.) In exchange, FIFA demanded that USSF \"facilitate the development of a sustainable first division outdoor professional men's soccer team.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50; Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 71-72.) With this mandate, USSF eventually formed World Cup USA 94 (\"USA 94\"), a separate legal entity, which was tasked with establishing first division professional soccer in the United States. (Gulati \u00b6\u00b6 52-54.) After review of plans submitted by three groups, the USSF Board of Directors (the \"Board\") selected Major League Professional Soccer, Inc. (\"MLPS\"), an entity backed by Alan I. Rothenberg, the then-President of USSF, to develop the league. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54, 90; Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 71-74.) After the 1994 World Cup, MLPS was reorganized into MLS. (Gulati Decl. \u00b6 58.) With the help of a five-million-dollar loan from the United States Soccer Foundation, an entity created to manage the assets generated from the 1994 World Cup, MLS began league play in 1996. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 56-59, 65; Compl. \u00b6 74.) Given soccer's lack of popularity in the United States, USSF prioritized \"stability and the avoidance of consumer confusion\" in helping MLS take hold. (Gulati Decl. \u00b6 64.) Thus, USSF made a conscious decision \"to not sanction any other league as a first division (Division I) men's professional outdoor league until MLS had finished its second full season in 1997-to give it a 'runway' of sorts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.) MLS began league play with ten teams in 1996 and has operated continuously as a Division I league. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65; Compl. \u00b6 21.) In contrast to NASL, MLS began play under a single-entity structure, reserving ownership and management power in the league itself. (Compl. \u00b6 75.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   MLS and USSF have also maintained a business relationship, most notably through Soccer United Marketing (\"SUM\"), the marketing affiliate for MLS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 32; Gulati Decl. \u00b6 227.) In 2004, after \"negotiations that were conducted at arms-length, [and] were lengthy and occasionally testy,\" USSF granted SUM sponsorship and broadcast rights to the Men's and Women's National Team games over which it controls.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Gulati Decl. \u00b6 229.) These rights were then \"bundle[d]\" with MLS' rights to obtain a much more lucrative sponsorship and broadcast deal than MLS and Defendant could have gained standing alone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 230.) SUM negotiated an eight-year, $720 million broadcasting agreement with ESPN in 2014 for USSF's\n   and MLS' joint package to run through 2022. (Compl. \u00b6 106.) In 2015, USSF extended its marketing relationship with SUM for another eight-years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Gulati Decl. \u00b6 231.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    b. History of PLS and governance structure of USSF\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The PLS were first developed in 1995, a year prior to MLS' inaugural season.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 74, 78.) \"The Division I PLS were adopted in 1995 and the Division II and III PLS were adopted in 1996.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78.) The PLS were revised in 2008, 2010 (for only Division II) and in 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78; Szymanski Decl. \u00b6 63.) There were also proposed changes in 2015 that were never implemented due to objections by NASL. (Gulati Decl. \u00b6 78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Since 2008, the Professional League Standard Task Force (the \"Standard Task Force\") has been responsible for reviewing and proposing amendments to the PLS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.) The Standard Task Force is comprised of individuals that USSF believes are \"familiar with professional soccer,\" excluding Board members and others \"then-associated with any professional leagues.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.) The Standard Task Force's recommendations are first submitted to the \"then-existing\" professional leagues for review and comment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80.) After reviewing the comments provided by the leagues, the Standard Task Force provides the Board with a final set of proposed amendments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80.) The Board then reviews and votes on the proposals, but excludes from voting all members who have a \"then-current relationship\" with any professional leagues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Since at least 2009, USSF has required professional leagues to apply annually for a divisional designation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 108.) As part of this process, the leagues must submit an \"annual report,\" including \"the status of compliance\" with the PLS, requests and reasons for any waivers if necessary, and a plan to fully comply. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) These reports and applications are submitted to the Professional League Task Force (the \"Application Task Force\") for review. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 109.) After review, the Application Task Force submits its recommendation for approval or denial to the Board. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 111.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Board, which ultimately votes on amendments to and applications of the PLS, consists of fifteen directors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) The Board is comprised of a cross-section of soccer interests in the United States, including representatives of athletes, amateurs, and professionals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The National Council elects three independent directors, in addition to the USSF President and Vice President. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.) The professional leagues officially have two votes on the Board in the form of the Chairman of the Professional Council and one additional Professional Council delegate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) Given the voting structure of the Professional Council, which considers the number of teams and season attendance at games for each league, MLS has had the voting power to control who represents the Professional Council on the Board. (Compl. \u00b6 17; Roger Pielke, Jr. Decl. in Supp. of Pl. Mot. (\"Pielke Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 32, 58, Docket Entry No. 30-25.) Plaintiff asserts that MLS has thus controlled the official recommendations made by the Professional Council to the Board with regard to its divisional designation. (Compl. \u00b6 17.) Plaintiff also contends that given the personal ties between USSF and MLS, the latter has been able to exert influence on\n   the Board in a more informal manner. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Amendments to the PLS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The PLS operated in its original form from 1996 to 2008. (Gulati Decl. \u00b6 78.) In 2008, however, Sunil Gulati, the then-USSF President, asked Burton Haimes, a Board member elected by the Youth Council, to form the Standard Task Force to \"revisit\" the standards. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82.) After review, the Standard Task Force proposed amendments to the \"time zone requirement\" which had previously required Division I leagues to operate in at least three time zones and Division II leagues to do so in at least two time zones. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The proposed change required the time zones be \"in the continental United States.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Compl. \u00b6 125.) The proposal was adopted by the Board after review and comment by the then-existing professional leagues. (Gulati Decl. \u00b6 86.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In 2010, in response to the \"issues created by NASL and USL-1,\" Gulati appointed another Standard Task Force to revisit the Division II PLS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90.) This time the Standard Task Force recommended that the Division II PLS be revised to require \"each team to post a $750,000 performance bond, with a league maximum of $15 million,\" to cover the cost of a team's operations in case it defaulted mid-season. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91.) The individual team bond could be reduced to $500,000 and the league maximum to $10 million if all the teams agreed to make the bonds joint and several. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) These proposals were adopted by the Board. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Sometime in \"late 2012,\" USSF decided to take a more \"comprehensive review\" of the PLS because \"the sport of soccer [had] beg[u]n to experience growth and momentum.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94; Steven Davidoff Solomon Decl. in Supp. of Def. Opp'n to Pl. Mot. (\"Solomon Decl.\") \u00b6 73, Docket Entry No. 26-7.) However, before changes were implemented, NASL announced expansion plans in mid-2013. (Compl. \u00b6 134.) A few months later, on November 18, 2013, USSF officially announced that it would be revising the PLS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) While the Standard Task Force proposed a number of amendments, those most relevant to this dispute are as follows: (1) increasing the minimum number of teams from ten to twelve, with fourteen required by year three in Division I; (2) requiring teams to occupy three time zones in the continental United States, specifically for the first time in the Eastern, Central and Pacific time zones in Division I and Division II (after six years in operation); and (3) requiring each team to have a \"principal owner\" with an individual net worth of at least $40 million dollars, in addition to the existing $70 million combined net worth and $1 million per-team performance bond requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 136-43; Gulati Decl. \u00b6 96.) These proposals were provided to all the then-existing professional leagues for review and comment. (Gulati Decl. \u00b6 97; Nov. 18, 2013 USSF Memo re: PLS, annexed to Gulati Decl. as Ex. 9.) In response, Bill Peterson, the then-Commissioner of NASL sent USSF a letter focusing primarily on Division II PLS that were adopted in 2010, asking for a reduction in the performance bond requirements for NASL teams and the league as a whole. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98; Nov. 27, 2013 NASL Letter re: PLS, annexed to Gulati Decl. as Ex. 10.) Without any further comments\n   from the NASL, the proposed amendments were adopted by the Board on February 28, 2014. (Gulati Decl. \u00b6 99; Compl. \u00b6 136.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Despite the amendments in 2014, Gulati and USSF believed more changes were necessary as early as December 2014. (Compl. \u00b6 147; Gulati Decl. \u00b6 101.) Gulati \"expressed [ ] concern\" that the grant of too many waivers \"to NWSL\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   , NASL, and USL\" were having a negative impact on the credibility of the PLS. (Gulati Decl. \u00b6 101.) Accordingly, Gulati \"ask[ed] the Standard Task Force to once again look at strengthening the standards.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) But before any amendments were proposed, NASL submitted a Division I application to USSF for the first time on May 31, 2015. (Compl. \u00b6 146.) A few weeks later, on June 24, 2015, the Standard Task Force recommended a number of changes, the most relevant to this dispute are as follows: (1) increasing the minimum team requirement from twelve to sixteen for Division I; (2) strengthening the market size requirement so that seventy-five percent of the league's teams had to play in metropolitan markets of at least 2,000,000 people, doubling the previous 1,000,000 people requirement for Division I; (3) increasing the combined net worth requirement from $70 to $80 million per team for Division I; and (4) requiring each league to present annual plans for expansion and growth. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 147-54; Gulati Decl. \u00b6 104.) In response to these proposed changes, NASL submitted a letter that largely mirrors the Complaint in this dispute. (Gulati Decl. \u00b6 141; July 23, 2015 NASL Letter re: PLS, annexed to Gulati Decl. as Ex. 18.) Following NASL's letter, the amendments were never submitted to the Board and never adopted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Gulati Decl. \u00b6 105.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Challenges to the application of the PLS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   NASL has had designs to compete with MLS in Division I from the very beginning of its existence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 126-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Despite such expectations, NASL first applied for Division II sanctioning for the 2010 season after breaking away from the United Soccer Leagues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 129; Gulati Decl. \u00b6 114.) At the same time, the teams remaining in USL-1 also applied for a Division II designation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Application Task Force found both applications lacking, including the failure of both leagues to meet the minimum eight team requirement. (Gulati Decl. \u00b6 116.) Both leagues were thus denied an independent Division II sanction for the 2010 season and instead were allowed to compete jointly in 2010 as a USSF-run league under a Division II designation. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 129, 133.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   NASL applied for an independent Division II sanction for the 2011 season. (Gulati Decl. \u00b6 118.) Despite NASL's failure to comply with all of the PLS Division II requirements, the Board approved the Application Task Force's recommendation to grant NASL \"provisional\" membership and sanction as a Division II league. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This provisional status was revoked, however, after questions arose regarding the financial viability of several NASL teams. A month after USSF revoked NASL's Division II designation, the NASL re-applied, despite failing to comply with the PLS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Board again granted NASL a \"provisional\" Division II status for the 2011 season. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 120, 125.) During this time, USSF granted USL Division III status. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 119.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In 2011, Plaintiff applied to change its \"provisional\" Division II status to full membership. Despite NASL's failure to comply with the PLS, the Board adopted the Application Task Force's recommendation to grant the application with various waivers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 126-27; Compl. \u00b6 134.) At the same time, the Board re-sanctioned MLS as a Division I league and USL as a Division III league, both without any waivers. (Gulati Decl. \u00b6 127.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The following year, in 2012, the Board again granted NASL's application for Division II status with the necessary waivers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 128-29.) At the same time, the Board re-sanctioned MLS with a single waiver and re-sanctioned USL without any waivers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 129.) In contrast, in 2013, NASL's application was granted without any waivers while MLS and USL were each approved with the need for several team waivers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In 2014, the Board re-sanctioned MLS without any waivers and sanctioned both NASL and USL with several team waivers.

In its application, NASL asserted that it satisfied all Division I standards\n   <em>\n    except\n   </em>\n   for those that it deemed illegitimate and anticompetitive. (Compl. \u00b6 146; Gulati Decl. \u00b6 138.) NASL thus requested waivers for the requirements it did not meet. (Compl. \u00b6 146.) On October 30, 2015, NASL sent a letter to USSF again reiterating its request for a Division I sanction. (Gulati \u00b6 149; Oct. 30, 2015 NASL Letter re: PLS and Division I Sanction, annexed to Gulati Decl. as Ex. 24.) USSF responded on November 6, 2015 by stating that it would consider NASL's letter as a request for necessary waivers to obtain a Division I sanction. (Gulati Decl. \u00b6 150.) NASL later requested an opportunity to give a presentation to the Application Task Force on the merits of its application, including the illegitimacy of the parts of the PLS it did not meet, eventually making its presentation on December 5, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 155-56; Nov. 23, 2015 NASL Letter re: Application Task Force, annexed to Gulati Decl. as Ex. 30.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After discussion and negotiation on both issues, the Board finally voted to reject NASL's Division I application on March 8, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 169-70.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 158.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Unlike 2015, NASL only requested a Division II sanction in 2016, seeking three waivers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 185; Compl. \u00b6 179.) NASL had suffered several setbacks in 2016, including the defection of several teams to the USL, and financial difficulty for others.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Gulati Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 176, 180-81.)

Given these issues, representatives for the NASL requested that the Board delay its consideration of the divisional status of the NASL. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 187.) Due to these and other concerns, the Application Task Force recommended that NASL's application for Division II status be rejected. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 195; Compl. \u00b6 179.) During this time, the Application Task Force also recommended that USL's Division II application be rejected. (Gulati Decl. \u00b6 195.) Despite these recommendations, the Board voted to grant both leagues a provisional sanction for Division II subject to several conditions, including a showing of improvement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 203; Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 180-81.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In August of 2017, both Plaintiff and USL submitted their applications to the Application Task Force for 2018 sanctioning. (Gulati Decl. \u00b6 207; Letter re: 2018 Division II Application (\"2018 Application Letter\"), annexed to Gulati Decl. as Ex. 55; Compl. \u00b6 183.) NASL's application sought two waivers for (1) the minimum team requirement and (2) the time zone requirement to have teams in the Eastern, Central and Pacific time zones. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 183-85.) NASL alleged that it was in \"advanced discussions\" with various potential ownership groups. (Gulati Decl. \u00b6 208.) However, NASL did not provide much detail as to these discussions and conceded that two of its eight existing teams had not committed to return, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; 2018 Application Letter annexed to Gulati Decl. as Ex. 55.), and Defendant later discovered that the North Carolina team had been wavering in its commitment.

First, Plaintiff alleges that it will likely cease to exist absent injunctive relief. (Pl. Mem. at 16.) In support, several current team owners have submitted declarations\n   attesting to Plaintiff's dire circumstances. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Riccardo Silva Reply Decl. in Supp. of Pl. Mot. (\"Silva Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, 8, 11, Docket Entry No. 30-21; Capriotti II Reply Decl. in Supp. of Pl. Mot. (\"Capriotti II Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, 8, 11, Docket Entry No. 30-22; Robert J. Watkins Reply Decl. in Supp. of Pl. Mot. (\"Watkins Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, 8, 11, Docket Entry No. 30-23.) The owners allege that Division III status is fundamentally at odds with the Plaintiff's business model. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Silva Decl. \u00b6 8; Capriotti II Decl. \u00b6 8; Watkins Decl. \u00b6 8.) Division III status allegedly does not provide sufficient revenues to continue operations \"in a manner consistent with [Plaintiff's] plans,\" likely leading to the departure or closure of several teams. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Silva Decl. \u00b6 8; Capriotti II Decl. \u00b6 8; Watkins Decl. \u00b6 8; Rocco B. Commisso Decl. in Supp. of Pl. Mot.

Plaintiff asserts that USL's success as a Division III league may be attributable to factors that are inapplicable to NASL, including a \"reserve-league relationship with MLS.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Pl.

In addition, Defendant itself acknowledges the importance of its divisional designations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 63; Def.

While those with present and past-relationships with MLS may partake in deliberations and have an informal influence on decision-making, the Court is mindful that membership associations inherently include some degree of conflicts of interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SD3\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341066\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/801/412/#p437\">\n    801 F.3d at 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Similarly, it is not problematic, standing alone, for market participants to try to influence the standard-setting process through the organization's ordinary procedures.\"). Besides, as Defendant points out, Steve Malik, a NASL owner, served as a Board member in 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, the Plaintiff may have valid concerns about the involvement of Alan Rothenberg on the Standard Task Force. (Pielke Decl. \u00b6 47.) But the Court notes that the Standard Task Force traditionally has three to four other members who\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   have been screened out for any then-existing conflicts of interests. (Gulati Decl. \u00b6 109.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Although Plaintiff alleges that all Board members are inherently conflicted because of Defendant's ties to MLS through SUM, this concern appears to be guarded against by Defendant's fiduciary duties to its members. (Pielke Decl. \u00b6 50.) As Defendant's expert explains, directors \"must 'act in the corporation's best interest.' \" (Solomon Decl. \u00b6 44.) Because of the substantial financial benefits conferred by the licensing deal with MLS and SUM, the Board\n   may be compelled to maximize the benefits from the arrangement in order to act in the \"best interests\" of Defendant, which in turn may require acting in favor of MLS. But as a constituent-based organization, the Board also owes \"fiduciary duties to [its] members.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Given these safeguards, even if so motivated, members of the Board and the Standard Task Force may not blindly benefit MLS to the detriment of NASL or other professional leagues. Because Plaintiff's claims rely so heavily on Defendant's alleged financial motives, the Court's conclusion on this factor also undercuts somewhat the other proffered evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Int'l Distribution Centers, Inc. v.

Since its creation, the PLS have been amended in 2008, 2010 (for Division II), and 2014. (Gulati Decl. \u00b6 78; Szymanski Decl. \u00b6 63.) There were also proposed amendments in 2015 that were never adopted. In particular, the timing of the 2014 Amendments and the proposed 2015 Amendments appear to best support Plaintiff's argument of \"an escalation\" of the PLS for the purpose of keeping MLS as the sole Division I league. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 124-56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    A. 2014 amendments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In 2014, Defendant made the PLS more stringent for Division I sanctioning, including an increase in the minimum number of teams, less choice in time zones, and higher financial requirements for owners. (Compl. \u00b6 136-43; Gulati \u00b6\u00b6 94, 96.) Plaintiff asserts that this \"escalation\" was in response to its \"continued efforts to compete with MLS,\" and specifically its mid-2013 announcement of planned expansion. (Compl. \u00b6 134.) Defendant disputes Plaintiff's timeline and asserts that it had decided in \"late 2012\" that it was \"time for a comprehensive review\" of the PLS. (Gulati Decl. \u00b6 94.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   While a periodic review of the PLS appears appropriate, Defendant fails to provide a specific reason for the necessity of such a review at that time other than a conclusory assertion that \"the sport of soccer [had] beg[u]n to experience growth and momentum.\" (Solomon Decl. \u00b6 73.) Nevertheless, as Defendant indicates, Plaintiff did not appear concerned nor surprised about the timing of the 2014 amendments, given its lack of opposition through the review and comment process. (Gulati Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 98-99.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    B. 2015 proposed amendments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In contrast, Plaintiff objected to the proposed 2015 amendments for Division I. (Compl. \u00b6 146.) The proposed changes included an increase in the minimum number of teams, much more limited options for markets, and heightened financial obligations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 147-54; Gulati Decl. \u00b6 104.) Plaintiff contends that these proposals were a direct response to its Division I application filed on May 31, 2015. (Compl. \u00b6 146.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   While Defendant asserts that there had been plans to revisit the PLS since December\n   2014, both the timing and the proffered reason are suspect. (Gulati Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 101-02). According to Defendant, Gulati, the then-president of USSF, \"expressed [ ] concern\" that the grant of too many waivers \"to NWSL, NASL, and USL\" were having a negative impact on the credibility of the PLS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101.) Thus, Gulati \"ask[ed] the Standard Task Force to once again look at strengthening the standards.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The circulated proposals, however, do not appear to address this concern.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    H. L. Moore Drug Exch. v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1185394\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/662/935/#p939\">\n    662 F.2d 935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 939 (2d Cir. 1981) (analyzing evidence suggesting policy at issue was a \"mere pretext or 'sham' \"). Although there were many proposed amendments, there were only cosmetic changes to the standards directly concerning waiver.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June 24, 2015 Memo re: PLS, annexed to Gulati Decl. as Ex. 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Nevertheless, the Standard Task Force is expected to act objectively in proposing amendments. As Plaintiff's own governance expert explained, it would be improper for Gulati and the Board to dictate to the Standard Task Force\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   to revise the PLS. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pielke \u00b6 56.) Once called, the Standard Task Force should have the autonomy to recommend changes it deems appropriate, on any standard, without consideration of external pressures. Given this structure, absent more evidence, the Court cannot conclude that the 2015 proposals were more likely than not borne out of a desire to impede NASL from achieving its goal to be sanctioned as a Division I league.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Application of the PLS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiff also asserts that the PLS have been applied in a discriminatory manner favoring MLS and USL. In particular, Plaintiff argues that its 2015 Division I and 2017 Division II applications were unfairly denied. According to Plaintiff, the 2015 application was denied because it directly challenged MLS's monopoly in Division I. (Compl. \u00b6 146.) Similarly, the 2017 application was allegedly denied to create a monopoly for USL in Division II. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) In addition, Gulati, the current USSF President, has admitted that Defendant has been willing to apply the PLS to favor MLS in the past.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Prior discriminatory application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Gulati admits that Defendant had in the past decided \"to not sanction any other league as a first division (Division I) men's professional outdoor league until MLS had finished its second full season in 1997-to give it a 'runway' of sorts.\" (Gulati Decl. \u00b6 64.) The Court finds Gulati's admission that the PLS would not have been applied faithfully in MLS's infancy troubling.\n   <em>\n    Ross v. Am. Exp.

The original PLS may very well have been adopted based on objective criteria for a procompetitive purpose. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Solomon Decl. \u00b6 27 (\"[T]he USSF implemented the Professional Standards to mitigate the risk of league and team failure to promote the growth of soccer at all levels.\").) Moreover, Gulati did state that USSF only meant to limit Division I sanctioning to one team until 1998 because of the history of failed leagues in the United States up to that time. Thus, later amendments and applications of the PLS may not be an extension of this earlier misconduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    B. NASL's 2015 application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Plaintiff's 2015 application was denied for failure of two PLS requirements-the lack of United States based teams in three different time zones and failure to have all its teams play in stadia with at least 15,000 seating capacity. (Compl\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85.) To demonstrate the unfairness of the denial, Plaintiff asserts that MLS's Division I status was maintained from 2009 until 2015 despite MLS' failure to meet the same standard. (Pl. Mem. at 13.) Plaintiff also argues that Defendant discriminated against it by failing to decide its application \"for over nine months\" and ultimately declining to grant the NASL the necessary waivers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The denial letter to NASL explains that a waiver for the stadia requirement was considered, but not approved, because \"the\n   <em>\n    overwhelming\n   </em>\n   majority of the [Plaintiff's] teams play in stadia that seat\n   <em>\n    far less\n   </em>\n   than 15,000.\" (USSF Letter re: NASL Division I Application, annexed to Gulati Decl. as Ex. 40) (emphasis added). As the letter indicates, Plaintiff's requested waivers may have been qualitatively different from those granted to MLS. In addition, as to the delay in deciding its 2015 application, because Plaintiff asserted in the application that the parts of the PLS it failed to meet were \"not a legitimate basis to exclude a league from Division I,\" \"it seemed reasonably clear\" to Defendant that Plaintiff \"was posturing towards litigation.\" (Gulati Decl. \u00b6 137, 139; NASL 2015 Division I Application, annexed to Gulati Decl. as Ex. 17.) As a result, the parties engaged in discussion and negotiation over the appropriateness of the PLS, culminating in a presentation by Plaintiff to the Application Task Force on December 5, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 155-56.) Further, a few days before the submission of the application, Traffic Sports, an entity with \"substantial ownership interest in the [NASL] as well as a financial interest in several NASL teams,\" was indicted for \"racketeering, conspiracy, money laundering and fraud.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 124, 144.) While the application was pending, the parties discussed at length Traffic Sports' continuing relationship with NASL into January 2016. Based on this record, the Court has no basis to infer discriminatory intent to the delayed decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    C. NASL's 2017 application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Plaintiff's 2017 application was rejected for failure to meet the minimum number of teams and the time zone requirements. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 183-85.) According to Plaintiff, the denial is unjustified because the USL received a month reprieve to bring its teams into compliance while Plaintiff was not given the same opportunity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 186-87.) Plaintiff further claims that the\n   USL needed as many as twenty waivers to be granted provisional Division II status for 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 187.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Defendant disagrees and asserts that NASL's application was denied because Plaintiff failed to show improvement towards meeting the Division II standards, a condition under Plaintiff's 2017 Provisional Division II status. (Gulati Decl. \u00b6 211.) Even in its application, Plaintiff conceded that two of its eight existing teams had not committed to return, (Gulati Decl. \u00b6 208; 2018 Application Letter, annexed to Gulati Decl. as Ex. 55.), and Defendant later discovered that the North Carolina team had also been wavering in its commitment. (Gulati Decl. \u00b6 208.) Plaintiff also failed to provide information to determine whether the proposed replacement teams met the PLS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Moreover, Plaintiff failed to provide any concrete information about its search for new teams, a continuing problem since its application for Division II status for 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; 2018 Application Letter, annexed to Gulati Decl. as Ex. 55) (\"[T]he NASL is in discussions with a number of other groups, including those in Atlanta and Detroit, to finalize their admission into the league for 2018.\"). Rather than providing a concrete plan for eventual compliance, Plaintiff in a conclusory fashion asserted that \"[t]he NASL's intention is to grow past [twelve] clubs heading into the 2019 Season and to feature at least one club in each of the Eastern, Central and Pacific times zones during the 2019 Season.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, Defendant asserts that any waivers that may be granted to USL would be \"team specific\" rather than a league-wide requirement. According to Defendant, the two types of waivers are qualitatively different, the latter being concerned with \"the fundamental requirements for a national league.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 210.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Defendant also notes, and the Court also finds significant, that the Application Task Force, the body charged with initially reviewing divisional status applications, is designed to function as a neutral body separate from the Board, as evidenced by the Board's willingness, on occasion, to decline to adopt its recommendations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   Through these procedures, Defendant has granted Plaintiff Division II status from 2011 through 2017\n   <em>\n    with waivers\n   </em>\n   in every year except 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 118, 128-31.) Moreover, when the Board has chosen to disregard the recommendation of the Application Task Force, it has done so in ways benefiting Plaintiff. For example, despite the Application Task Force's initial recommendation to deny Plaintiff Division II sanctioning for 2017, the Board voted to grant NASL a provisional Division II sanction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 203.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Because the evidence \"does not tend to exclude the possibility of [ ] independent [action]\" the Court concludes that Plaintiff has failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits, let alone a \"clear showing\" of entitlement to relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    AD/SAT\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11658864\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/181/216/#p234\">\n    181 F.3d at 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    iii.

(Peterson Decl. \u00b6 16.) While the procompetitive purposes of standards are \"disputable,\" as discussed below, the Court finds that Defendant has provided plausible bases to conclude that the PLS have procompetitive effects.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DM Research\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11585054\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/170/53/#p57\">\n    170 F.3d at 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Merely to say that the standards are disputable or have some market effects has not generally been enough to condemn them as 'unreasonable' under the Sherman Act.\"). The dispute over the PLS centers around the following five standards: (1) minimum number of teams; (2) time zone or geographic dispersion; (3) market size; (4) stadium capacity; and (5) financial validity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Defendant first asserts that requiring a minimum number of teams is procompetitive because an increase in the number of teams helps \"sustain fan interest\" by limiting \"repetitive matchups.\" (Peterson Decl. \u00b6 58.) As argued by Defendant,\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   minimum number of teams is necessary and Plaintiff's dispute is really about \"where the number is set.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.) In addition to increasing output by encouraging investment in expansion teams, this requirement may also provide stability as \"larger leagues are more likely to survive ... setbacks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The time zone and market size requirements allegedly work together to generate \"broad fan interest\" and also the interest of national broadcasters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 65, 68.) By mandating geographic dispersion, the time zone requirement is designed to help soccer \"compete with the four major U.S. sports, all of which have national footprints.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) According to Defendant, American consumers and national broadcasters expect major professional sports to have a country-wide presence. (Def. Opp'n at 20-21; Peterson Decl. \u00b6 65.) Likewise, having teams in larger markets naturally promotes soccer to a broader audience which also attracts the interest of national broadcasters. (Peterson Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 70-71.) Armed with larger fan bases and media platforms, larger markets may also provide more resources to improve the quality of teams leagues can field. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Similarly, Defendant asserts that the stadium capacity requirement promotes quality by ensuring that \"fans' experiences at top-tier soccer matches meet their expectations of what a top-tier sporting event should be like.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.) As Defendant argues, the quality of team facilities likely impacts fans' experiences and perceptions of the team and the league as a whole. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Sub-par facilities such as high school fields may reduce fan interest and investment in the league and soccer more generally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Finally, Defendant asserts that the various financial viability requirements need to be considered in light of the history of failures of soccer leagues in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78). In doing so, Defendant points to Plaintiff's former CEO who stated in 2011: \"106 teams have played in division two or three since 1996 and of those 84 folded. Fans don't want to follow a team who's in a league with those sort of stats and that much turnover.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Failure of teams, especially mid-season, may diminish fan interest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 78, 80.) The net worth requirement specifically helps protect the financial viability of leagues as a whole because it prevents any owner from \"underfund[ing] teams and free rid[ing] on the investment of others.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In short, Defendant has satisfied its burden by offering evidence that the PLS have procompetitive effects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

The Court conceives of two ways to make such a showing: (1) a completely different model to regulate professional soccer in the United States or (2) amendments to the PLS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Plaintiff has not expressly proposed any less restrictive alternatives other than the\n   <em>\n    elimination\n   </em>\n   of the parts of the PLS in dispute. Essentially, Plaintiff argues that the standards are inherently anticompetitive, offering little to no procompetitive benefits, and that the\n   <em>\n    free\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    market\n   </em>\n   itself is a better alternative.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Szymanski Decl. at 35-49 (discussing the anticompetitive effects and lack of procompetitive effects of the PLS).) But as discussed above, Defendant has proffered plausible bases and evidentiary support to conclude that the PLS have procompetitive effects. The history of professional soccer in the United States both before and after the PLS also appears to substantiate Defendant's assertions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Capital Imaging\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513363\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/996/537/#p543\">\n    996 F.2d at 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The history of the restraint, the evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant facts.\") (citation omitted). As Defendant argues, the PLS may have been necessary and directly responsible for the growth of soccer in the United States. While Plaintiff may ultimately be correct in its assessment that the PLS create more harms than benefits, the Court cannot conclude, based on the evidence thus far, that Plaintiff has demonstrated a clear showing of entitlement to relief on these grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Although Plaintiff fails to expressly provide any other alternatives, Plaintiff's various challenges to the amendment of the PLS may be construed as arguing that the\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   versions of the PLS, before their alleged \"escalation,\" are the less restrictive alternatives.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the minimum team requirement, Plaintiff asserts that, even if necessary, the standard has been raised only after \"MLS was significantly above it.\" (Szymanski Decl. \u00b6 94.) Whatever benefits this standard may confer, Plaintiff questions the necessity of requiring twelve teams (after six years in existence) for Division II when eight was sufficient for Division I\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   and II for a number of years. Plaintiff similarly questions the specific need to have teams in the Eastern, Central, and Pacific time zones when geographic dispersion is the end goal. As Plaintiff explains, NASL currently has teams in the Eastern, Pacific, and\n   <em>\n    Atlantic\n   </em>\n   time zones. (Pl. Reply at 10 (emphasis added).) Further, in 2015, the Standard Task Force itself recommended the elimination of the requirement to have teams in the Eastern, Central, and Pacific time zones for Divisions I and II, suggesting that it is an unnecessary requirement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 Gulati 104.) Finally, Plaintiff asserts that the financial viability amendment in 2014, requiring the principal owner to have an individual net worth of $40 million, was unnecessary in light of preexisting protections. (Compl. \u00b6 141-44.) Plaintiff argues that the already existing $70 million combined net worth and the $1 million performance bond requirements are sufficient to \"ensure that any given team w[ould] remain stable throughout a season.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 142.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   However, because Plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to adequately assess whether the prior iterations of the PLS provide the same procompetitive benefits as the current version, the Court instead reviews the existence or lack\n   thereof of \"meaningful safeguards\" in the private standard-setting process, i.e., in the process of revising the PLS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allied Tube\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219741\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/492/#p501\">\n    486 U.S. at 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219741\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/492/#p501\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Am.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 157-74.) In support of its theory, NASL points to the minimum stadium requirement and two player development requirements. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 157.) NASL asserts that the 15,000 minimum seating requirement is anticompetitive because new entrants often have difficulty securing stadiums in compliance. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 159.) Given its status as a Division II or \"minor league,\" NASL has struggled to convince government officials to help finance compliant facilities. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 161-62.) NASL further asserts that even the English Premier League, a recognized world-class soccer league, could not have satisfied the stadium requirement. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 164.) NASL further asserts that MLS failed to meet this requirement for all its teams from 2009 to 2015. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 165.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    Plaintiff similarly challenges two 2014 Division I PLS player development requirements. The first, dating back to 1995, states that \"[e]ach U.S.-based team must demonstrate a commitment to a player development program,\" which \"may be satisfied by supporting either an amateur or professional reserve team competing in a USSF-sanctioned league or by the league itself.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 167.) The second requirement, dating back to 2008 and building off of the 1995 PLS, states that \"[e]ach U.S.-based team must maintain teams and a program to develop players at the youth level,\" which \"may be satisfied by fielding teams in a Federation academy program.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Plaintiff asserts that non-Division I leagues have great difficulty convincing players and teams to be in a \"minor league for a minor league.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 170-71.) Plaintiff, however, has not referred to the development requirements of the PLS in its motion papers.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    As a direct consequence, Plaintiff asserts that several teams decided to leave the NASL, with several teams joining MLS.

In\n    <em>\n     North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners\n    </em>\n    , the Board at issue regulated the practice of dentistry in North Carolina.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 364. The Board \"consisted of six licensed dentists, one licensed hygienist, and one 'consumer member.' \"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 365. At issue was the Board's collusive actions to exclude all non-dentists from providing \"teeth whitening services.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Because of the status of most of the Board members as practicing dentists, they had a \"personal financial interest in excluding non-dentist[s]\" from the market.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 371.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    Plaintiff argues that the Fourth Circuit's decision supports a conclusion that \"an agreement among organization members (even when it takes the form of a vote) qualifies as concerted action\" and that \"[n]othing more than that agreement is needed to satisfy the concerted action requirement.\" (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl. Letter in response to Def. Sur-reply (\"Pl. Letter\") 2, Docket Entry No. 48.) Plaintiff, however, cites to the Fourth Circuit's reference to the underlying FTC decision which specified that there was direct evidence of a concerted action because \"[o]n several occasions, the Board discussed teeth whitening services provided by non-dentists and\n    <em>\n     then\n    </em>\n    voted to take action to restrict these services.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 373 (emphasis added). The FTC's interpretation of the significance of the \"vote ... to restrict [ ] services\" was informed by the fact that there was a discussion about \"teeth whitening services\"\n    <em>\n     prior\n    </em>\n    to the vote.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Thus, the vote or outcome in and of itself was not sufficient direct evidence as Plaintiff argues. Unlike the USSF Board members, the Board in\n    <em>\n     North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners\n    </em>\n    met prior to voting, agreed on what action to take, and\n    <em>\n     then\n    </em>\n    formalized that action through a vote.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    The FTC's original opinion fully supports this interpretation. For example, the FTC explained that there was \"direct evidence of\n    <em>\n     advance\n    </em>\n    discussion and formal approval by Board members.\"\n    <em>\n     In the Matter of the N. Carolina Bd. of Dental Examiners\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=152%20F.T.C.%2075\">\n     152 F.T.C. 75\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%2011798452\">\n     2011 WL 11798452\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *69 (July 14, 2011) (emphasis added). The FTC further found \"significant\" that the \"content ... as well as [the]\n    <em>\n     purpose\n    </em>\n    [ ] [of the official action taken by the Board] was discussed and unanimously approved by Board members in advance.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *70 (emphasis added). For example, one of the Board members specifically sought help from the Cosmetology Board to \"assist [ ] in [ ] efforts regarding non-dentist teeth whitening services.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *51. The Board member then instructed counsel to prepare an article for the Cosmetology Board after discussing the issue with Board members.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Soon after, the Board had a closed session meeting where they \"formally approved\" the course of action.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    The FTC's opinion suggests that Board members had made an\n    <em>\n     agreement to agree\n    </em>\n    prior to the formal vote. Plaintiff has provided no similar direct evidence. To the extent the case can be read to suggest a vote in of itself is sufficient direct evidence of an agreement, the Court finds contrary authority more persuasive.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     SD3\n    </em>\n    , 801 F.3d at 437.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"29\">\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    The Court recognizes that parallel action and plus factors are usually used for horizontal agreements (involving restraints between competitors) and not vertical agreements (involving restraints between entities at different levels of competition) as alleged in this case.
