Moreover, because the documents at issue list international agreements alphabetically by nation, redacting information relating only to existence-classified agreements would not suffice to protect the classified information, as an analyst could discern at least some of the nations with which the United States has concluded existence-classified agreements by seeing where within the alphabetical list the redacted information appears.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.

The plaintiff instead argues that the defendant can produce many, if not most, of the classification levels in the nine documents at issue without disclosing the identities of nations which the United States has concluded existence-classified agreements. Pl.'s Opp'n at 11-14. The plaintiff acknowledges that an enterprising foreign analyst could use publicly-available information to ascertain the identities of those nations in each document with which the United States has concluded unclassified agreements, and then identify nations with which the United States has concluded existence-classified agreements where such existence-classified agreements fall between two unclassified agreements with the same nation, as in the following illustration:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-55\"><strong><em>Classification Status</em></strong> <strong><em>Nation</em></strong> <strong>Unclassified</strong> <strong>[redacted] [Lalaland, filled in by researcher]</strong> <strong>Existence-Classified</strong> <strong>[redacted]</strong> <strong>Unclassified</strong> <strong>[redacted] [Lalaland, filled in by researcher]</strong></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.

Even where such conditions obtain, the plaintiff argues, \"the agency could easily engage in a partial redaction of the classification levels\n   on those pages, redacting this information in enough entries to throw off the alphabetic deduction, while releasing the classification levels on the others.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. As such, the plaintiff says, the defendant's assertion that it cannot segregate and release any information that these documents contain is \"patently overbroad.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At a minimum, the plaintiff asserts, the documents should be inspected\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   to \"determine whether the agency's hypothetical conditions are actually present.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Spirko v.

Moreover, disclosure of agreements' classification levels could damage the national security even where such disclosure would not enable an analyst to identify with certainty the nations with which the United States has concluded existence-classified agreements, because the defendant \"has the right to assume that foreign intelligence agencies are zealous ferrets\" who may draw useful inferences from partial bits of information that form a larger mosaic.\n   <em>\n    Larson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641880,7330200\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/857/\">\n    565 F.3d at 864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gardels v.

The plaintiff also fail to account for the reality that the United States is not equally likely to conclude an agreement, let alone an existence-classified agreement, with every nation; as such, the possibility that any nation in the world might be counter-party to a particular existence-classified agreement does not adequately protect the counter-party nation's identity, given that the actual pool of potential counter-parties is more limited.

The plaintiff's settlement offer is irrelevant to the validity of the defendant's withholdings, as any count of the number of agreements of each classification category would have constituted a new record that FOIA does not oblige the defendant to create.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Forsham v.

The plaintiff observes that \"quick Google searches reveal that the U.S. has bilateral agreements with each of those [five] countries,\" and argues that \"[i]t is thus unclear, at best, how one could make an informed guess as to the identity of the particular country in that example.\" Pl.'s Reply at 4 (internal quotation marks omitted). This is probative of little-the plaintiff identifies no evidence that the United States is materially likelier to have concluded an existence-classified agreement with a nation with which the United States has concluded an unclassified agreement than with a nation with which the United States has not concluded an unclassified agreement. In any event, foreign analysts presumably have at their disposal more advanced analytical tools for identifying nations with which the United States has concluded existence-classified agreements than Google Search.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Larson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641880,7330200\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/857/\">\n     565 F.3d at 864\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
