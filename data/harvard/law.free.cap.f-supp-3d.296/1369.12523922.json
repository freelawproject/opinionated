Further, although the role of\n   <em>\n    amicus curiae\n   </em>\n   was historically to serve as an impartial friend of the court, rather than an adversarial party in interest, some courts \"have recognized a very limited adversary support of given issues through brief and/or oral argument.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The COALITION is not seeking to serve as a real party in interest to these proceedings, but rather seeks to brief the court on a different viewpoint on a central issue to the case.

Indeed, an\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   brief will assist the court more in instances \"in which the would-be amicus has a direct interest in another case that may be materially affected by a decision in this case[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Voices for Choices v.

Although the court takes seriously the GOC's concern that the COALITION is seeking\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   status in order to essentially \"pre-litigate\" its own case that is currently at the agency level,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   GOC's Opp'n Br. at 2, the COALITION will present an analysis of this issue not already represented by the parties in this action. That objective is a legitimate reason to seek\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   status and weighs in the court's consideration of granting the motion, as the analysis could potentially assist the court in its comprehensive consideration of the issue. Ultimately, the grant or denial of a motion is by the court's discretion, after considering all relevant factors. Given the factors that weigh in favor of granting the motion, the parties' opposition does not outweigh the usefulness of the COALITION's participation as\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Although counsel to the parties are certainly capable of presenting their sides of the argument in support of their respective positions, the COALITION has presented an alternate analysis of the jurisdictional question that is in opposition to the positions presented by the parties. The court requested that the parties provide clarification of the statute which authorizes Commerce to promulgate\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.214\">\n    19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k), Commerce's procedures for conducting an expedited review in a CVD proceeding. Court's Letter at 3-4, Dec. 28, 2017, ECF No. 46. The parties grounded their responses in the statutory provisions which implement the Uruguay Round Agreements, with Plaintiff and Plaintiff-Intervenors responding that Commerce's authority to promulgate a regulation for expedited CVD reviews lies in sections 101 through 103 of the Uruguay Round Agreement,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203511\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 3513, and Defendant responding that the authority lies in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203513\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 3513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), which authorizes Commerce to promulgate the necessary regulations to ensure compliance with the Uruguay Round Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp.

The COALITION presents an alternate analysis, contending that none of the statutory provisions cited by the parties authorizes Commerce to conduct expedited reviews in CVD proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Proposed Amicus Br. at 2-17. The COALITION presents the position that it is, in fact, \"unclear what legal authority in U.S. law supports [expedited CVD] proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201675\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201675\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This position is in stark contrast to the position presented by the parties. An\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   brief will assist the court in its review of the issues when it \"present[s] ideas, arguments, theories, insights, facts, or data that are not to be found in the parties' briefs.\"\n   <em>\n    Voices for Choices\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9103003\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/339/542/#p545\">\n    339 F.3d at 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, an\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   brief will assist the court more in instances in which, inter alia, \"the amicus has a unique perspective or specific information that can assist the court beyond what the parties can provide.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9103003\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/339/542/#p545\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Org. for Women, Inc. v.

Such is the case here. This factor weighs in favor of granting the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The last two factors, the strength and usefulness of the information and argument presented by the potential\n   <em>\n    amicus curiae\n   </em>\n   's interests, are intertwined. The proposed\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   brief presents a thorough and reasoned analysis of an alternative viewpoint on this issue and therefore is useful. That this argument and analysis is not currently represented by any party to the action renders the COALITION's comments useful to the court's review of this jurisdictional issue of first impression. The COALITION is offering additional information to the court and serving the proper role of an\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   ; that is, to assist the court in its review of the issues by \"presenting ideas, arguments, theories, insights, facts, or data that are not to be found in the parties' briefs.\"\n   <em>\n    Voices for Choices\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9103003\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/339/542/#p545\">\n    339 F.3d at 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
