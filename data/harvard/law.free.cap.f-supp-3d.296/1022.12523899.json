CONLEY, District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case illustrates some of the perils of going into business with family members, including the obvious risks of intermingling business and personal relationships, but also the less obvious risks associated with using a family name as a trademark. Here, plaintiff Fabick, Inc., asserts claims of trademark infringement under both federal\n   and state common law against defendant FABCO Equipment, Inc., and JFTCO, Inc., based on defendants' use of the \"Fabick CAT\" name beginning in July 2015. The parties' cross motions for summary judgment are before the court. (Dkt. ## 90, 117.) For the reasons that follow, the court will deny both motions, with one exception: defendant FABCO's motion for judgment in its favor on any claim of\n   <em>\n    direct\n   </em>\n   trademark infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   PRELIMINARY ISSUES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Motion to Strike Defendants' Affirmative Defenses (dkt. # 195)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In a prior order, the court granted defendants' motion to dismiss count I of plaintiff's first amended complaint and directed plaintiff to file a second amended complaint (dkt. # 88), which it did (dkt. # 143). In response, defendants filed their respective answers. (Dkt. ## 144, 145.) Plaintiff now moves to strike two defenses which it contends were raised for the first time in the amended answers without leave of court: (1) a fair use defense under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201115\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4), and (2) a fraudulent procurement defense under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201115\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In opposing the motion, defendants contend generally that the motion should be denied solely \"because a plaintiff's new complaint wipes away prior pleadings, [and, therefore,] the amended complaint opens the door for defendants to raise new and previously unmentioned affirmative defenses.\" (Defs.' Opp'n (dkt. # 207) 1-2 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Chasensky v. Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4033689,3825953\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/740/1088/\">\n    740 F.3d 1088\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1094 (7th Cir. 2014) ).) More precisely, however,\n   <em>\n    Chasensky\n   </em>\n   and other cases like it stand for the proposition that in answering the amended complaint, a party may respond to\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   allegations with\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   affirmative defenses. Similarly, if the amended complaint does not contain new allegations giving rise to new defenses, then the defendant must seek leave to amend its answer to add those new defenses.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   6 Charles Alan Wright,\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Fed.

(dkt. # 143) \u00b6 54 (\"FABCO asserts that prior to selling its assets to JFTCO, and in spite of FABCO having previously sold the Fabick stock and the FABICK Marks to Jay Fabick, that FABCO had a common law 'fair use' right to use the 'Fabick' name in FABCO's business operations.\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   1st Am. Compl. (dkt. # 32) (containing no reference to \"fair use\").) As such, the court finds that defendants reasonably added a fair use defense in their respective answers to the second amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants' new affirmative defense of fraudulent procurement under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201115\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), however, presents a different situation. With respect to this defense, defendants do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   argue that new allegations in plaintiff's second amended complaint open the door to this defense; rather, defendants argue that they \"did not have a basis to plead that Plaintiff fraudulently procured its trademark rights at the outset of this case.\" (Defs.' Opp'n (dkt. # 207) 4.) Instead, defendants maintain they only learned of the availability of this defense during Jay Fabick's deposition in this lawsuit, when he purportedly testified that he was award of the prior use of the Fabick mark by the John Fabick Tractor Company. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) While perhaps this justified granting leave to amend their respective answers under Rule 15(a)(2), defendants\n   did not seek leave to add this new defense either before or at the time they filed their respective amended answers. Still, the court is reluctant to exalt form over substance, particularly when answering an amended complaint may have seemed a convenient (if somewhat underhanded) opportunity to add this new defense. As such, the court will treat defendants' opposition as a motion for leave to amend their answers to add a defense under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201115\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Typically, leave to amend should be \"freely\" given. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). Notwithstanding this \"liberal attitude towards the amendment of pleadings, courts in their sound discretion may deny a proposed amendment if the moving party has unduly delayed in filing the motion, if the opposing party would suffer undue prejudice, or if the pleading is futile.\"\n   <em>\n    Soltys v. Costello\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702546\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/737/#p743\">\n    520 F.3d 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 743 (7th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation omitted). Accepting defendants' contention that they did not know of the availability of this defense until Jay Fabick's deposition, the deposition was held on March 14, 2017, while defendants' respective answers were not filed until June 28, 2017, more than three months later. Admittedly, defendants' answers to the second amended complaint were not due until that date, but defendants offer no reason for not seeking to amend more promptly, a particularly poor choice since even defendants concede the fraudulent procurement defense was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   triggered by new allegations in the second amended complaint. In sum, defendants could have (and should have) sought leave to add this new defense shortly after Jay Fabick's deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Still, three months is not an inordinate delay absent some prejudice to plaintiff, and that is where plaintiff's opposition stalls.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dubicz v. Commonwealth Edison Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9215184\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/377/787/#p792\">\n    377 F.3d 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 792 (7th Cir. 2004) (\"Delay, standing alone, may prove an insufficient ground to warrant denial of leave to amend the complaint; rather, the degree of prejudice to the opposing party is a significant factor in determining whether the lateness of the request ought to bar filing.\" (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)). As far as the court can discern, defendants' unclean hands defense touches on the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   factual allegations as those that would support a fraudulent procurement defense, and other than complaining generally about its need to conduct discovery relative to these defenses, plaintiff has identified no way in which its discovery efforts or trial preparations would be prejudiced by the late addition of this defense.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   6 J.

Reserved Portion of Motion to Compel (dkt. # 211)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants filed a motion to compel discovery or, alternatively, to preclude evidence and argument at trial on advice of counsel. (Dkt. # 211.) After hearing argument from the parties on that motion, the court previously: (1) granted it in part by striking plaintiff's reliance on an advice of counsel defense in its summary judgment briefing and precluding certain related testimony at trial; (2) denied it in part by refusing to compel production of one of the categories of privileged documents; and (3) reserved on compelling production of the other category of documents to defendant\n   JFTCO pending additional briefing from the parties. (10/5/17 Order (dkt. # 215).) Having now reviewed certain of the withheld documents\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   and considered the parties' additional briefing, the court agrees with defendants that FABCO's right to attorney-client privilege transferred at the time of JFTCO's acquisition of substantially all of FABCO's assets. Accordingly, the court will direct plaintiff to produce the \"first category\" of documents identified in the court's prior order and filed by plaintiff for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As set forth in defendants' supplemental briefing, a corporation's rights and authority with respect to the attorney-client privilege passes to the new management along with control.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n v.

Ill. 2007) (recognizing that following\n   <em>\n    Weintraub\n   </em>\n   , \"several courts have recognized that assignees or transferees of most, if not all, of a corporation's assets will have the authority to assert or waive the attorney-client privilege\" (internal citations omitted)). (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Suppl. Br. (dkt. # 217) 2-3 &amp; n.3 (citing other cases in support).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In response, plaintiff does not cite any legal authority to the contrary, but instead argues that any attorney-client privilege attaching to the documents at issue had transferred from FABCO to plaintiff Fabick, Inc., at the time of the 1997 transfer of Fabick stock to Jay Fabick, and therefore had already been lost\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the 2015 asset acquisition by JFTCO. (Pl.'s Opp'n (dkt. # 218) 1.) The argument presumes that the attorney's involved in the creation of these communications from approximately 1993 to 1996 was solely representing Fabick's interest, when in fact the representation was plainly a joint one in which the law firm of Foley &amp; Lardner was acting in the collective interest of two clients-FABCO and Fabick-meaning both had the right to the privilege. As a result, in transferring its ownership interests to Fabick in 1997, FABCO only transferred those interests held by Fabick, including Fabick's attorney-client privilege, but\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   that owed to FABCO. Indeed, this is the only way to interpret Foley &amp; Lardner's agreeing to do the work of Fabick, Inc.,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   its far longer-standing, ongoing representation of FABCO, as Fabick's subsidiary entity. This is also the only way to make sense of plaintiff's position that FABCO was intimately involved in the trademark application process by securing representation by Foley &amp; Lardner and paying the fees and expenses incurred as part of that process. Plaintiff simply cannot have it both ways.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Finally, in its supplemental brief, plaintiff reiterates its argument that even if FABCO retained a\n   <em>\n    joint\n   </em>\n   privilege after\n   1997, it still cannot unilaterally transfer that privilege to a third-party without\n   <em>\n    Fabick's\n   </em>\n   consent. True enough, but there are at least two problems with that argument on the facts here. First, JFTCO is not a typical third-party; rather, it sits in FABCO's shoes in light of its acquisition of substantially all of FABCO's assets. The question then is whether Fabick had a reasonable expectation that FABCO would not be allowed to transfer the joint privilege to a successor entity. For the most part, courts have concluded that the privilege transfers to the successor corporation even when that privilege arises out of a joint representation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    625 Milwaukee, LLC v.

In addition, as defendants point out, and plaintiff fails to respond, the privilege was effectively waived in light of Fabick's suing FABCO under the adverse litigation exception to joint representation privilege.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Teleglobe Commc'ns Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1091072,3510189\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/493/345/\">\n    493 F.3d 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 366 (3d Cir. 2007),\n   <em>\n    as amended\n   </em>\n   (Oct. 12, 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Accordingly, the court will grant defendants' motion to compel in part, and will order plaintiff to produce promptly to defendants the documents identified by the court in its prior order as the \"first category.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   SUMMARY JUDGMENT OPINION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    UNDISPUTED FACTS\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Overview of the Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff Fabick, Inc., is a Wisconsin corporation, with its principal place of business in Madison, Wisconsin. Fabick is in the business of developing, selling and applying protective coatings and sealants for various construction, commercial, industrial, mining, agricultural, equipment, containment, maritime, military and automotive uses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant FABCO Equipment, Inc., was a Wisconsin corporation, with its principal place of business in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. On July 1, 2015, co-defendant JFTCO, Inc., purchased substantially all of the assets of FABCO. Also on that date, FABCO changed its name to FEI Legacy, Inc., and that entity was dissolved on June 29, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before July 1, 2015, FABCO operated as the exclusive Caterpillar dealer for Wisconsin and certain counties comprising the Upper Peninsula (\"UP\" of Michigan). In that capacity, FABCO was engaged in the business of selling, renting, servicing and repairing Caterpillar branded heavy equipment for use in a variety of industries including construction, agriculture, demolition and mining.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   JFTCO, Inc., was organized as a Delaware corporation on March 13, 2015, and it is registered as a foreign corporation in the state of Wisconsin, effective June 5, 2015. JFTCO is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the John Fabick Tractor Company, which is a Caterpillar dealership headquartered\n   in Fenton, Missouri. On July 1, 2015, JFTCO began operating in Wisconsin and Northern Michigan as the exclusive Caterpillar dealership under the name \"Fabick CAT.\" JFTCO's primary business is the same as that previously engaged in by FABCO. Indeed, its assigned Caterpillar dealership territory is identical. Until July 1, 2015, the John Fabick Tractor Company was the Caterpillar dealer for an area encompassing parts of Missouri and Illinois, one county in Oklahoma and one county in Kansas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. History of FABCO\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The history of FABCO begins with a falling out between siblings in the previous generation of Fabicks, particularly John Fabick's sons Joseph Fabick, Sr. (\"Joe\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and his brothers. In 1982, the John Fabick Tractor Company acquired two pre-existing Caterpillar dealerships serving Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan with the intent that Joe could ultimately own a separate newly-formed Caterpillar dealership. Prior to acquiring these dealerships, Joe had worked with his brothers for the John Fabick Tractor Company, which ran a highly successful Caterpillar dealership serving its designated territory. So, in 1982, Joe moved to Wisconsin, founded FABCO, and served as President and CEO of FABCO from 1982 until 2001 over its own highly successful dealership. Joe then turned over FABCO to his son Jer\u00e9 Fabick (\"Jer\u00e9\") and assumed the title of Chairman of FABCO, until his retirement in 2002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   FABCO continued to operate the Caterpillar dealership at multiple retail locations in Wisconsin and the UP of Michigan until it was sold on June 30, 2015. Within its territory, FABCO had three different types of location: (1) FABCO Equipment, primarily dealing with Caterpillar equipment and machines; (2) FABCO Power Systems, primarily dealing with Caterpillar engines and generators; and (3) FABCO Rents, which provided contractors with daily, weekly, monthly or longer-term rentals of equipment, usually the \"smaller end of the Caterpillar line of equipment.\" FABCO Equipment and FABCO Power Systems may have been combined in one location, but FABCO Rents locations were independent, standalone facilities. FABCO sold new and used Caterpillar equipment, including Caterpillar trucks (at least for a few years) and attachments for Caterpillar equipment, such as snow wings. FABCO also serviced equipment, sold parts for Caterpillar machines and installed those parts as a function of its service component. FABCO customers' industries covered farming, mining, manufacturing, government entities and municipalities, construction and contractors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Many of Joe's eight children were employed by FABCO at some point in time. Joseph Fabick, Jr. (\"Jay\") worked at FABCO from 1982 until December 31, 1997. Jay's brother Jer\u00e9 worked for FABCO from 1982 until its sale to JFTCO on June 30, 2015. Jer\u00e9 became the regional manager of FABCO's Madison and La Crosse branches in 1992 and held that position for about three years. From 1995 until 2001, Jer\u00e9 was the Executive Vice President of FABCO. In 2001, he became its President and CEO. Beginning in June 2002, Jer\u00e9 and his father Joe became the sole shareholders of FABCO; before that time, the shareholders included Joe, his eight children (including Jay and Jer\u00e9) and seventeen grandchildren.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In 2004, Jer\u00e9 became the sole shareholder of FABCO. Jer\u00e9 remained the President, CEO and sole shareholder of FABCO until FABCO ceased its operations and sold its assets to JFTCO. Currently, Jer\u00e9 is the President of the John Fabick Tractor Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, including JFTCO. He is also the Co-Dealer Principal of both the John Fabick Tractor Company and JFTCO. Doug Fabick is the current CEO and the other Co-Dealer Principal of the John Fabick Tractor Company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For over a decade, FABCO primarily used the following mark in commerce:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (Defs.'

History of Fabick, Inc.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Around the time that Jer\u00e9 became the heir apparent of FABCO, Fabick was formed and began operating as a division of FABCO, originally identified as FABCO Surface Protection for about a year before it was incorporated in December 1993. Fabick's business focused primarily on spray-on bedliners for pickup trucks and similar vehicles, though its products provide protection and coating in a variety of applications for an assortment of products, including products owned and operated by defendants' customers. At the time it was incorporated, FABCO owned 100% of Fabick's stock, and Joe was the majority shareholder of FABCO. At some point, Joe acquired 25% of the Fabick stock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Jay was instrumental in the startup and operation of Fabick, and he was centrally involved in the business from its inception, including taking a leave of absence from his FABCO duties in 1995 to concentrate his efforts on building Fabick. During this time, Jay remained employed by FABCO as the Vice President of Product Support. Plaintiff also contends that Joe was also involved in Fabick's startup, and according to Jay, Joe was \"probably the biggest supporter and promoter of Fabick, Inc.\" (Pl.'s Reply to PFOFs (dkt. # 175) \u00b6 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Tom Svetnicka, currently the Vice President of Marketing for JFTCO, held positions in marketing and advertising with FABCO dating back to 1987. Svetnicka was also involved in Fabick's startup, though the parties dispute the extent of his involvement. At a minimum, Svetnicka attended at least one business meeting with a business consultant regarding Fabick's startup, created a list of potential names for Fabick, though \"Fabick\" was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   on that list, was involved in creating and designing the original logo for Fabick, including the color scheme, and assisted in creating an advertisement for Fabick.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   While owned by FABCO, Fabick had access to and used FABCO's customer lists, marketing personnel and product service representatives (\"PSRs\") to build its\n   business.

Joe also sent a letter to PSRs, describing Fabick's business.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fabick similarly participated in FABCO customer meetings and seminars and FABCO trade shows, with Fabick displaying its own products and brochures. Fabick further sent direct mail pieces to FABCO's customer list, which promoted its products and services.

FABCO negotiated with Jay and ultimately offered him a severance package that included taking over Fabick, Inc., as its sole owner. On December 31, 1997, FABCO and Joe transferred 100% of the corporation's stock in Fabick to Jay. Since acquiring the stock, Jay has been the President and sole shareholder of Fabick.

In 2014, Jer\u00e9 began considering\n   a succession plan for FABCO. Specifically, in an effort to keep FABCO in the Fabick family, Jer\u00e9 considered approaching his cousin, Doug Fabick, the CEO of the John Fabick Tractor Company, which originally formed FABCO in 1982, about a possible acquisition or merger. Before approaching the John Fabick Tractor Company regarding a possible merger or acquisition, however, Jer\u00e9 first approached Caterpillar to get its approval. During the fall of 2014, FABCO and the John Fabick Tractor Company then engaged in discussions with Caterpillar to obtain final approval of the proposed acquisition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   A December 9, 2014, letter from Jer\u00e9 and Doug to Caterpillar, states that \"[t]he intent is to begin changing the 'FABCO' brand to 'FABCO-a Fabick family company' immediately and eventually moving to the Fabick brand.\" (Pl.'s PFOFs (dkt. # 93) \u00b6 152 (citing Dettmann, Decl., Ex. K (dkt. # 109-7)).) Jer\u00e9 testified at his deposition that this brand name change was \"intended to provide a smooth transition. You know, they know the Fabick family name, but probably to get the Fabick family name out a little bit more prominently in advance of-as part of the transition process.\" (Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s PFOFs (dkt. # 150) \u00b6 153 (quoting Jer\u00e9 Fabick Dep. (dkt. # 126) 108).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   By December of 2014, the decision was made to rebrand FABCO as \"Fabick CAT.\" JFTCO was then formed in 2015 in anticipation of the purchase of FABCO's assets for the purposes of operating the Caterpillar dealerships located in Wisconsin and Northern Michigan. Caterpillar approved the merger on January 27, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In February, the merger, including the planned rebranding to Fabick CAT, was communicated to employees, customers and partners of both companies. The latter announcement stated that: FABCO and the John Fabick Tractor Company \"have reached an agreement to join FABCO and Fabick CAT into one Caterpillar dealership\"; \"[o]ver the next several months, FABCO/Fabick teams will be working together to complete this transformation with an expected closing date of June 30, 2015\"; the \"the FABCO identity will transition over time to the Fabick Cat identity; [and] this change is expected to take place over the next 36 months.\" (Pl.'s PFOFs (dkt. # 93) \u00b6 163 (quoting Dettmann Decl., Ex. O (dkt. # 109-11).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   A February 2015 press release also used the \"Fabick CAT\" name and logo. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 166 (citing Dettmann Decl., Ex. M (dkt. # 109-9).) FABCO issued similar notices and advertisements between February and June 30, 2015, which referenced bringing \"Fabick family dealerships back together\" and used the phrase \"A Fabick Family Company.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 167-75.) Defendants do not dispute any of this, although they point out that any reference to \"Fabick\" by FABCO was only \"in a limited number of advertisements that were placed over a very brief period of time.\" (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s PFOFs (dkt. # 175) \u00b6 173.) Plaintiff also points out that Tom Svetnicka, the current Vice President of Marketing for JFTCO who held prior positions in marketing and advertising with FABCO dating back to 1987, created various iterations of the Fabick CAT logo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   While defendants originally intended to phase out FABCO and transition to Fabick CAT over a 36-month period, the John Fabick Tractor Company and JFTCO decided to accelerate the rebranding. Accordingly, as of July 1, 2015, the date JFTCO\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   began operating the Wisconsin and Northern Michigan Caterpillar dealership, FABCO logos were replaced with Fabick logos. JFTCO spent over $250,000 on new signage in 2015, and approximately $45,000 more in 2016. FABCO's websites are no longer operational. On certain signs in Madison, Wisconsin and Marquette, Michigan, the FABCO signs were replaced with signs containing only the word \"Fabick,\" without any reference to \"CAT,\" although after plaintiff's filing of this complaint, which referenced the \"Fabick\" sign on the Madison building facing the Beltline, JFTCO removed these signs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   On this record, defendants maintain that neither FABCO nor FEI Legacy used the Fabick CAT mark in commerce. Instead, the first use of the Fabick CAT mark in commerce occurred after the APA was consummated on July 1, 2015, and thus after FABCO ceased all operations. Defendants argue, therefore, that FABCO's responsibility is limited to using the Fabick name in announcements of the merger, which courts have generally found forms an insufficient basis to qualify as \"use in commerce.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sensient Techs.

(Pl.'s Opp'n (dkt. # 147) 4.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   To establish contributory infringement, however, a plaintiff must show intent on the part of the defendant and knowledge of the wrongful activities of the direct infringer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    David Berg &amp; Co. v.

Notwithstanding defendants' denials, moreover, there are factual disputes as to the extent of FABCO's knowledge, as described in the section of the opinion below dealing with defendant's unclean hands defense. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   Opinion \u00a7 IV.) In particular, there appears to be no dispute that FABCO was involved in arranging and paying for Fabick's legal representation in 1994 and 1995 to pursue the trademark applications, nor that Tom Svetnicka (a FABCO employee at the time and a current JFTCO employee) was involved in designing the Fabick mark. As such, plaintiff has raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether FABCO had actual knowledge of the Fabick trademarks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Alternatively, defendants argue that the decision to use the Fabick name was made by the John Fabick Tractor Company, consistent with its own, long-standing use of the Fabick name, and not by FABCO. But here, too, the record permits a contrary inference, including FABCO's involvement in the discussions with the John Fabick Tractor Company and Caterpillar on post-acquisition, re-branding plans. Moreover, Svetnicka contributed to the design of the Fabick CAT lock up, even if the contribution were limited to italicizing the Fabick name to resemble the FABCO mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   On this record, therefore, a reasonable jury could find that FABCO was involved in the decision to adopt the Fabick name, sufficient to hold it liable under a contributory infringement theory, although not that FABCO used the mark in commerce itself. As such, the court will grant judgment to FABCO on any direct infringement claim, but will deny it as to a claim for contributory infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Prior Use of \"Fabick\" Name\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Defendants separately seek summary judgment on plaintiff's claims on the basis that the John Fabick Tractor Company's extensive use of the Fabick name precludes plaintiff's claims. \"The party who first appropriates a mark through use, and for whom the mark serves as a designation of source, acquires superior right to it.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnny Blastoff v.

A decade later, the John Fabick Tractor Company was incorporated by John Fabick, Sr., and it was awarded an exclusive territory to sell Caterpillar tractors in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1927. Since its founding, that company has been led by Fabicks, first by John Fabick, Sr., then his sons John Fabick II and Francis Fabick, grandsons Harry Fabick and Jer\u00e9 Fabick, and then great grandson Doug Fabick (Harry's son). Joe, the founder of FABCO and Jay and Jer\u00e9's father, was the youngest son of John Fabick, Sr. As previously explained, Joe was also an executive for the John Fabick Tractor Company before acquiring his own Caterpillar dealership and forming FABCO, and would have been well aware of the extensive use of \"Fabick\" by that company as well at the time he was pursuing the trademark for FABCO and Fabick.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The John Fabick Tractor Company and its subsidiaries, including JFTCO, are engaged in the selling and servicing of Caterpillar branded heavy equipment.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 42-51.) Furthermore, sales data from the 1970s to 2002 show pipeline related sales in Wisconsin reaching in excess of half a million dollars in some years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Defendants further point to John Fabick Tractor Company's extensive history selling used equipment, which similarly involves no territorial restrictions. Here, too, defendants point to evidence that the Fabick name was used to promote used Caterpillar equipment in Wisconsin and Michigan. By at least the 1970s and continuing to the present time, the John Fabick Tractor Company was advertising its used equipment inventory throughout the Midwest, including in Wisconsin and Michigan. Specifically, the John Fabick Tractor Company has routinely advertised its used equipment in the Construction Equipment Guide since at least the 1990s.

In response to this fairly compelling evidence, plaintiff offers two core arguments: (1) JFTCO cannot rely on the John Fabick Tractor Company's prior use; and (2) even if JFTCO could rely on such use, it would have to demonstrate that the previously-used mark of the JOHN FABICK TRACTOR COMPANY is the legal equivalent of the current FABICK CAT mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As to the\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   argument, plaintiff contends that \"[w]hile use of a mark by a subsidiary may inure to the benefit of the parent entity, the converse is not true.\" (Pl.'s Opp'n (dkt. # 147) 10.)

Here, JFTCO is not relying on the John Fabick Truck Company's use of the \"Fabick\" mark for purposes of defending against a claim of abandonment or some other theory based on JFTCO's continued use; rather, JFTCO points to its parent company's use of the mark to establish superior rights.

(Note that JFTCO is simply the acronym of the John Fabick Tractor Company.) (Defs.' Add'l PFOFs (dkt. # 153) \u00b6 72.) These entities share the same websites, and the John Fabick Tractor Company and JFTCO share the same Board of Directors and officers. In the face of this evidence, plaintiff simply points to the fact that on its invoices, JFTCO requires payment to JFTCO.

Similarity of Products\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   As noted generally above, Fabick is in the business of selling coatings and sealants in a number of industries, including construction, industrial, agricultural, highway construction and road building, mining, automotive and original equipment manufacturing. Fabick offers a wide range of coatings, designed to be either sprayed or poured on, including some requiring application using specifically-designed equipment and methods. Fabick's sealants have been similarly developed to provide protection in a variety of applications and are most commonly used in the highway, parking, weather and traffic sensor markets. The coatings and sealants are used on projects ranging from industrial equipment, vehicles and machinery to rock or slope paving. For example, when used on the bed of a dump truck, the coating creates a bedliner that covers the entire area of the dump box, forming a smooth, seamless surface that promotes payload release, reduces material retention and protects from rust and abrasion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   As also noted above, JFTCO does not sell, nor has it ever sold,\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   chemical coating or sealant products, nor any bed liner products. Like FABCO, JFTCO continues to sell new and used Caterpillar equipment, including, dozers, dump trucks, skid steer loaders, among other types of equipment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s PFOFs (dkt. # 93) \u00b6 191.a.) Similarly, JFTCO sells new, used and remanufactured power systems parts for both Caterpillar and non-Caterpillar\n   equipment, and it provides repair services for that equipment. Some of the industries that purchase JFTCO's products and services include agriculture, construction, forestry, landscaping, mining, oil and gas, paving and road building and waste. JFTCO also has a rental arm called \"Fabick Rents-the Cat\u00ae Rental Store,\" which provides rental of Caterpillar machines. Plaintiff points out that the website also refers to itself simply as \"Fabick Rents\" without any reference to \"CAT.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   JFTCO's prices for purchasing a piece of equipment range from $20,000 to multiple millions of dollars. The vast majority of JFTCO's customers are either commercial entities or governmental bodies, and given the purchase prices, JFCTO customers often seek requests for proposals and review bids by JFTCO and its competitors before purchasing a piece of equipment. Parts and services are offered primarily with respect to Caterpillar equipment, often as a continuation of the dealer-purchaser relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   There is no dispute that the parties do not sell the same products.

Still, as defendants point out, a review of plaintiff's sales since 2010, reveal minimal, if any, sales applicable to JFTCO's line of business. Indeed, as defendants point out, plaintiff is now almost exclusively a chemical supplier, with its largest customer of chemical products being a furniture manufacturer that uses Fabick's product to coat its furniture. Plaintiff's highest selling product is its Pour-Pac product, which is used to protect traffic and weather sensors in the grooves of concrete and/or asphalt roadways. In contrast, plaintiff's bedliner products represents a very minor portion of plaintiff's current revenues. Even if there were confusion, it would likely inure to plaintiff's benefit, in that defendants' association with the mark is likely to strengthen consumer confidence in plaintiff's products, not weaken it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   From this review, the similarity of products factor would, therefore, appear to cut against a finding of likelihood of confusion, but the jury would need to assess how closely related Fabick's sealants and coatings are to the products lines sold and supported by JFTCO. Moreover, as explained above, even if the court were to find the factor undisputable, this factor is less significant than the similarity of marks, evidence of actual confusion and defendant's intent in adopting the alleged infringing mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Some of these sub-factors touch on the same issues described above in considering the similarity of the products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Plaintiff alleges trademark infringement based on defendants' use of the Fabick name in Wisconsin. Fabick markets and sells its products and services nationally and internationally, but Fabick's sole location is in Wisconsin, with over half of its sales to customers in Wisconsin. JFTCO currently has 19 locations in Wisconsin and one in Northern Michigan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   While there is no direct competition between plaintiff's and defendants' products, nor are the products sold at the same location, Fabick contends that the products are sold through the same marketing channels, to overlapping customers. In particular, Fabick represents that its \"coatings are routinely applied to the types of machinery and equipment sold by FABCO and JFTCO,\" including dump trucks, the fuel and hydraulic tanks of heavy machinery, the cabs and walk surfaces or wear times of heavy equipment and machinery to create an anti-skid surface, snowplow blades, buckets on front-end loaders and dozers. (Pl.'s PFOFs (dkt. # 93) \u00b6 103.) Moreover, since Fabick's coatings are customizable and sprayed or poured on to fit the specific application, Fabick's coatings could be applied to virtually any type of machinery or implement previously sold by FABCO and currently sold by JFTCO. Fabick has a fully-equipped mobile coating system, which allows it to apply coatings virtually anywhere and on any kind of service. For retail purposes, Fabick has outside applicators throughout Wisconsin that apply Fabick's coatings. Fabick also provides equipment for those outside applicators to use to apply the coatings and sealants, along with promotional items to market and advertise Fabick's products and services, including window stickers and template brochures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   While defendants do not appear to dispute that these type of applications are available, they contend that the application of plaintiff's products to the types of machinery and equipment sold by FABCO and JFTCO is \"unusual and not routine,\" directing the court to plaintiff's sales records from January 2010 to November 2016. (Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s PFOFs (dkt. # 150) \u00b6 103.) Apparently conceding the same with respect to its current business mix, plaintiff contends that it is \"actively seeking to expand its market share in providing off-highway dump truck bed coatings, as well as in providing anti-skid surfaces on a variety of heavy equipment that contains walk surfaces and wear items.\" (Pl.'s PFOFs (dkt. # 93) \u00b6 104.) Plaintiff also contends that it shares a \"number of common customers and vendors\" with defendants. (Pl.'s PFOFs (dkt. # 93) \u00b6 139.) Specifically, Fabick and JFTCO have at least 90 customers in common.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In response, defendants point out that many of the allegedly shared customers have not purchased any products or services from plaintiff since January 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Defendants further contend that the \"extent of the overlap between the customers is less than 3%.\" (Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s PFOFs (dkt. # 150) \u00b6 139.) While Fabick purports to dispute this calculation, it offers no basis for the dispute. (Pl.'s Reply to PFOFs (dkt. # 175) \u00b6 139.) Even so, the parties' shared customers in Wisconsin include Epic Corp., University of Wisconsin-Madison, Tri-North Builders, the Wisconsin Department of Corrections, the Dane County Regional Airport, Dane County, City of Madison, Capital Underground, McFarlane Manufacturing Co., Oil Equipment Company, Inc., and Monroe Truck Equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Under Jay's ownership since 1997, Fabick has also continued to market to defendants' customers and to the same industry groups served by defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   As detailed further in plaintiff's proposed findings of facts, Fabick and defendants have marketed their respective products in the same magazines, engaged in similar radio and television ad campaigns, and attended the same trade shows. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s PFOFs (dkt. # 93) \u00b6\u00b6 131-36.) Defendants do not dispute that the parties may share advertising strategies, but point out that Fabick has provided no proof of recent advertising; and more specifically, it has no advertising expenses in 2015. (Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s PFOFs (dkt. # 150) \u00b6 130.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Here, plaintiff has put forth evidence to demonstrate that both parties' business is focused in Wisconsin, they use (or, at least, historically have used) the same marketing channels, and have some overlapping (again, perhaps, just historically) customers. Still, factual issues remain as to whether Fabick and JFTCO currently share these same customers and channels, or have post July 2015, and again the\n   <em>\n    weight\n   </em>\n   to be placed on this factor, if any.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Degree of Care\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In considering this factor, the court \"must stand in the shoes of the ordinary purchaser, buying under the normally prevalent conditions of the market and giving the attention such purchasers usually give in buying that class of goods.\"\n   <em>\n    Luigino's, Inc. v.

While plaintiff contends that it has suffered some instances of forward confusion, the \"primary thrust of Fabick's case lies in the doctrine of \"reverse confusion,\" which occurs \"when a large junior user saturates the market with a trademark similar or identical to that of a smaller, senior user.\" (Pl.'s Br. (dkt. # 91) 10 (citing\n   <em>\n    Sands, Taylor &amp; Wood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=978%20F.2d%20947\">\n    978 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   957 ).) Here, plaintiff contends and presents evidence detailed below of confusion on the part of consumers, assuming that Fabick's sealants and coatings is the same or related to JFTCO's business. In such a reverse confusion case, \"the junior user does not seek to profit from the good will associated with the senior user's mark.\"\n   <em>\n    Sands, Taylor &amp; Wood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=978%20F.2d%20947\">\n    978 F.2d at 957\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Nonetheless, the senior user [may be] injured because ... it loses the value of the trademark-its product identity, corporate identity, control over its goodwill and reputation, and ability to move into new markets.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=978%20F.2d%20947\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   With that framework in mind, it is not clear that the degree of care factor supports plaintiff's infringement claim. In an attempt to bolster its position with respect to this individual factor, Fabick points to the low cost of some daily rentals and Caterpillar parts in an apparent attempt to downplay the importance of the purchase decision and therefore the degree of care exercised by the consuming public. There appears no dispute, however, that JFTCO's customers are sophisticated, professional buyers of expensive products and services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that the level of sophistication among professional buyers varies greatly, specifically directing the court to the declaration of Keith Walsh, a sales manager for one of Fabick's primary outside applicators, who apparently believed that Fabick's spray-on truck bedliners were produced by the company \"off the beltline,\" referring then to JFTCO. Based on this, plaintiff argues that evidence of confusion among individuals working in sales is strong evidence of consumer confusion more generally. (Pl.'s Opp'n (dkt. # 147) 56 (citing\n   <em>\n    Polo Fashions, Inc. v.

Putting aside defendants' challenges to Walsh's declaration, which came to light during his deposition, the record reflects that JFTCO's customers exert significant care in their purchase decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In light of the degree of care exercised by JFTCO's customers and the odd application of this factor in a reverse discrimination claim, the court is certainly inclined to weigh this factor in favor of defendants, not so heavily as to find that it warrants summary judgment in either party's favor, although the likelihood that plaintiff has generally benefitted from any lack of care by customers again makes this a close call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

For example, on May 24, 2006, Jay, Jack and James Fabick formed Fabick Equipment, LLC. (Jack and James are two of Jay and Jer\u00e9's brothers.) Fabick Equipment, LLC was a distributor of Hyundai construction equipment, though apparently the entity only sold three machines. Fabick Equipment utilized the web address www.fabick.net and had officers in Fabick's building located in Madison, Wisconsin. Other Fabick family companies that have operated or currently operate in Wisconsin using the FABICK Mark include Fabick Lawn Care, Fabick Marketing, Fabick Design, and The Fabick Farm. Plaintiff has not produced any licensing agreements or any documents suggesting that these entities paid royalties to plaintiff for use of the Fabick name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   From this, a reasonable fact finder would likely conclude that the Fabick mark is weak, though plaintiff contends that the mark is \"strong\" with respect to its customers without citing any support.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because this case primarily concerns reverse confusion, however, \"it may make more sense to consider the strength of the mark in terms of its association with the junior user's goods.\"\n   <em>\n    Sands, Taylor &amp; Wood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=978%20F.2d%20947\">\n    978 F.2d at 959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, the jury will need to consider the relative strength of the \"Fabick CAT\" mark vis-\u00e0-vis the smaller presence of the FABICK mark.

Add'l PFOFs (dkt. # 173) \u00b6 271.) This argument, however, simply supports a finding that any confusion was quickly resolved, not that there was no confusion in the first instance. What defendants are really arguing is that plaintiff cannot show lost sales because of the confusion, or much injury of any kind. For the most part, plaintiff does not dispute this, again pursuing a reverse confusion theory of infringement, whereby the public believes that Fabick is in the business of selling and renting heavy equipment, not that the public believes JFTCO is in the business of selling coatings and sealants. Defendants' criticism of this evidence is certainly relevant to a determination of damages, but it does not rebut a finding of actual confusion. On the undisputed record at summary judgment, therefore, a finding of likelihood of confusion is supported, but again the weight the jury may place on this factor, especially coupled with the lack of any apparent intent to infringe, precludes granting judgment in plaintiff's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   One final word on this actual confusion factor. In support of its motion, Fabick attempts to support a finding of actual confusion based on what it claims is a slowdown in its epoxy business. Fabick assumed that this business would grow in 2016 and 2017, but instead Fabick received no calls or requests for proposals for epoxy work through the first four months of 2017. As defendants point out, however, plaintiff's own sales records since\n   <em>\n    2010\n   </em>\n   reflect only a single slope-paving project for April and none for January through March. Plaintiff explains this work cannot be completed during the winter months,\n   but acknowledges that it does bid out paving jobs during those months. (Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s PFOFs (dkt. # 150) \u00b6 122; Pl.'s Reply to PFOFs (dkt. # 175) \u00b6 122.) Moreover, regardless of what plaintiff actually experienced (and is currently experiencing) in terms of a slowdown in its business, plaintiff puts forth\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   evidence that would support a finding that the alleged trademark infringement\n   <em>\n    caused\n   </em>\n   that slowdown. In other words, a jury could only speculate that calls seeking bids for Fabick's epoxy work were being deferred because of customer confusion with JFTCO. In fact, the evidence would appear to go the other way. On this record, therefore, the court places no weight on the epoxy business theory; and absent proof of causation, it will preclude plaintiff from pursuing this theory at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    G.

One reason for choosing the FABICK CAT identity for the combined dealership was that the John Fabick Tractor Company, which operated under the FABICK CAT identity, was the acquiring party. (As plaintiff points out, JFTCO is the acquiring party, but the John Fabick Tractor Company is the sole owner of JFTCO.) The name was also selected because of the over half a century history behind the Fabick name, as compared to the FABCO name, though plaintiff points out that the John Fabick Tractor Company did not begin operating under the FABICK CAT mark until at least 2002. Putting aside the dispute as to whether FABCO was actually aware of plaintiff's marks, there also appears no basis for a reasonable jury to find that defendants ultimately adopted the Fabick CAT mark with an intent to infringe Fabick trademarks or otherwise palm off its goods and services as Fabick's.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   In considering all of these factors, the court concludes that evidence of actual confusion weighs heavily in favor of plaintiff, but the other factors are either a wash, weigh in favor of defendants, or turn on fact issues (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , salient portion of the mark in assessing similarity or overlap in\n   customers and marketing channels, among other discrete factual disputes).

Here, defendants assert two discrete unclean hands defenses: (1) Jay signed declarations in support of the trademark and service mark applications in which he averred that he was not aware of the use of the claimed mark by others; and (2) Jay transferred the trademarks from Fabick, Inc., to a shell LLC without FABCO's authorization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   With respect to the\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   challenge, on March 22, 1994, Jay signed a declaration in support of Fabick, Inc.'s trademark application, as President of Fabick, and filed it with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In the declaration, Jay certified that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   no other person, firm, corporation, or association, to the best of his or her knowledge or belief, has the right to use such mark in commerce either in the identical form of the mark or in such near resemblance to the mark as to be likely, when used on or in connection with the goods of such other person, to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive, and that all such statements made of his or her own knowledge are true and all statements made on information and belief are believed to be true.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   (Defs.' Add'l PFOFs (dkt. # 153) \u00b6 119 (Schroeder Decl., Ex. C (dkt. # 125-3) 28).) Jay filed another declaration, also in his capacity as President of Fabick, in support of the service mark application, in which he made the same certification. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 128-29 (citing Schroeder Decl., Ex. T (dkt. # 125-20) 34).) Fabick also did not disclose the existence of the John Fabick Tractor Company-or the use of the \"Fabick\" name in connection with its Caterpillar dealership-to the USPTO during the prosecution of either the trademark or the service mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   At the time he signed the declaration, Jay was aware that the John Fabick Tractor Company used the stylized \"F\" mark, as depicted above (\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Opinion \u00a7 II). (Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' Add'l PFOFs (dkt. # 173) \u00b6 121 (citing Jay Fabick Dep. (dkt. # 69) 116-17; Defs.' Add'l PFOFs' (dkt. # 153) \u00b6 122 (citing Borlinghaus Decl. (dkt. # 134) \u00b6 21).) As previously discussed, Jay's knowledge of the use of the Fabick mark is hardly surprising given his history with the John Fabick Truck Company: Jay first worked for the John Fabick Truck Company in high school; held stock in the company before his interest was transferred to FABCO stock; and may even have used equipment supplied by the John Fabick Tractor Company and its subsidiaries when he was a heavy equipment operator himself on the Alaska Pipeline in the mid-1970s. Moreover, Jay worked for the John Fabick Tractor Company as a sales trainee in Fenton, Missouri from May 1976 to January 1977 and as a sales representative for one of its subsidiaries in Sikeston, Missouri, from February 1977 until he was terminated on August 17, 1981. The Fabick name was displayed prominently on the Sikeston building of the John Fabick Tractor Company where Jay worked. From these facts, defendants\n   argue convincingly \"[e]ither the representation Jay Fabick made to the United States Patent and Trademark office is true, in which case there is no likelihood of confusion, or he falsely represented the state of the market to acquire his registrations.\" (Dkt. # 119.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , in November 1997, Jay was informed that Fabick, Inc., was closing and that his employment with FABCO would end. On December 19, 1997, Jay created an entity named J.G. Fabick, L.L.C. (\"J.G. Fabick\"), which was held out as a \"real estate holding company,\" though Jay testified at his deposition that he could not recall if it ever owned any real estate. (Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' Add'l PFOFs (dkt. # 173) \u00b6 145.) The operating agreement provides that the management \"shall be vested in its sole member,\" and \"Joseph G. Fabick, Jr. is the sole initial Member of the Company.\" (Defs.' Add'l PFOFs (dkt. # 153) \u00b6\u00b6 146-47 (citing Schroeder Decl., Ex. VV (dkt. # 165-1) 1, 6).) On that same day, Jay transferred the Fabick trademark and service mark to J.G. Fabick.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Plaintiff does not dispute any of this, but instead argues confusingly that (1) J.G. Fabick gave Fabick, Inc., an implied license to use the Fabick mark,\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   (2) Fabick, Inc., actually retained the goodwill associated with the mark. Thus, plaintiff goes on, there was \"no transfer because it was an invalid assignment in gross.\" (Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' Add'l PFOFs (dkt. # 173) \u00b6 148).) At that time, while Jay was president, FABCO owned 75% of Fabick stock and Joe owned the other 25%. Moreover, there was no formal authorization by Fabick, Inc., to transfer the intellectual property to J.G. Fabick. Defendants further contend that Jay was not authorized to transfer the intellectual property owned by Fabick, Inc., though plaintiff disputes this based on Jay's position as president at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   At his deposition, other than mentioning that his action was probably recommended by an attorney, which the court disregards in light of plaintiff's invocation of the attorney-client privilege, Jay could offer\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   explanation for this transfer (Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' Add'l PFOFs (dkt. # 173) \u00b6 153; 10/5/17 Order (dkt. # 215)), although a reasonable inference in that Jay hoped to still control the mark should Fabick, Inc., be dissolved, rather than have it revert back to FABCO. On July 8, 2002, J.G. Fabick, L.L.C. transferred the Fabick marks back to Fabick, Inc., also without explanation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the time J.G. Fabick owned the marks, Fabick continued to hold itself out as owning the mark, entering into various licensing agreements with dealers under which it purported to transfer intellectual property rights in the mark to those dealers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Relying on statements by Jer\u00e9 and Tom Svetnicka, defendants also contend that \"[a]t the time of the stock transfer agreement, FABCO was not aware that Jay Fabick had registered \"Fabick\" as a trademark or service mark in Fabick, Inc.'s name.\" (Defs.' Add'l PFOFs (dkt. # 153) \u00b6 131.) In disputing this, plaintiff persuasively points to records showing that FABCO's CEO Joe and its marketing manager Svetnicka were\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   involved in the original discussions about registering Fabick's name, and they were aware of Fabick obtaining the registrations, as well as FABCO paying the associated attorneys' fees in\n   it doing so. (Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' PFOFs (dkt. # 173) \u00b6 131.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Because this defense seeks equitable relief (or perhaps more accurately the denial of equitable relief), the court assumes that it is a question for the court, and not for the jury. The parties, however, fail to provide any guidance. Regardless, the court concludes that the merits of this defense cannot be decided at summary judgment. With respect to the\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   basis, the defense touches on the jury's determination as to whether the John Fabick Tractor Company's earlier use of the Fabick mark constitutes prior use. If the jury finds that the mark is somehow distinct from the Fabick mark adopted by plaintiff, then that finding would appear to undercut defendant's contention that Jay's representation was false. Similarly, if the court finds that JFTCO established prior use of the Fabick mark, then plaintiff's trademark claims fail, and the court need not take up an unclean hands defense. Even putting aside the relationship between this defense and the jury's determination of prior use, the defense also requires\n   <em>\n    intent\n   </em>\n   on the part of Jay that is best assessed through live testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   As for the\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   basis for the defense, while Jay's conduct may have constituted malfeasance, defendants fail to offer a \"direct nexus\" between the alleged bad act of transferring the trademarks to a shell LLC and the trademark infringement plaintiff seeks to enjoin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shondel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"41902\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/775/859/#p868\">\n    775 F.2d at 869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 1985) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Int'l Union, Allied Industrial Workers v.

In other words, defendants fail to offer a plausible explanation as to how Jay's transfer of the trademarks in 1997 and subsequent return to plaintiff in 2002 is directly connected to the relief plaintiff now seeks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even assuming the nexus requirement can be satisfied, moreover, the court would again benefit from hearing Jay's testimony live and assessing his credibility before considering equitable relief, if any.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   As such, the court will deny defendants' motion for summary judgment. The parties should be prepared to present any testimony and exhibits specific to this defense outside of the presence of the jury during the course of the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Abandonment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Even if not material for purposes of defendants' unclean hands defense, this does not put an end to the possible importance of Jay's transfer of the Fabick marks to J.G. Fabick, L.L.C., on December 19, 1997, since that entity then held the marks for four and a half years until July 2002. On this basis, defendants argue separately that the undisputed record demonstrates that J.G. Fabick did not use the mark during that time and, therefore, the marks were abandoned under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

(dkt. # 105) \u00b6 27).) As for the transfer of the marks to J.G. Fabick, plaintiff argues it was without any legal consequence because Jay Fabick controlled the marks at all times and, in the alternative, the court could find an implied license between J.G. Fabick and Fabick during that four year period. (Pl.'s Opp'n (dkt. # 147) 74 (describing test for implied license).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Admittedly, because of Fabick's undisputed continued use of the FABICK mark, this is not a typical abandonment case. Indeed, defendants argue that J.G. Fabick abandoned the marks during the relatively short period of time when it owned the marks and despite authorizing Fabick's continued use, whether formally licensed or not. Curiously, as defendants point out in their reply, plaintiff defended against defendants' prior use defense by citing a decision that appears to rebut plaintiff's argument here that it can rely on its own use of the marks to defend against a claim of abandonment during the period in which J.G. Fabick owned the mark. Specifically, in\n   <em>\n    Noble House,\n   </em>\n   TTAB held that the registrant's failure to use the mark itself constituted abandonment, even though its parent company used the mark during the relevant period of time.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   Furnco International Corporation, the parent company, authorized its subsidiary, the Respondent, to be the owner of the registration at issue. We have not forgotten that Furnco International Corporation is the owner of Respondent and that it could be argued that Furnco International Corporation owned the registration all along. But the application for registration and the subsequent statement of use was not filed by Furnco International Corporation. Furnco International Corporation chose to structure its business using a legally distinct subsidiary, which counts as a \"person\" under the Trademark Act. Such a business structure may offer some advantages, but it also comes with some strictures, and the existence of a separate and distinct legal entity (e.g., in this case a limited liability company) cannot be turned on or off at will to suit the occasion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <em>\n    Noble House\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203357265\">\n    2016 WL 3357265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   As the\n   <em>\n    Noble House\n   </em>\n   decision explained, for Fabick to rely on its use during the time period in which J.G.

Section 1127, in turn, provides that \"[t]he term 'related company' means any person whose use of a mark is controlled by the owner of the mark with respect to the nature and quality of the goods or services on or in connection with which the mark is used.\" In light of Jay Fabick's total control of both entities for most, if not all, of the claimed period of abandonment, the evidence would strongly suggest that Fabick and J.G. Fabick are \"related parties\" as a matter of law, especially in light of the fact that a heightened standard of proof likely governs this defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3\n   <em>\n    McCarthy on Trademarks\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 17:12 at 17-25 to 17 - 26 (\"The majority of courts have interpreted the 'strictly proved' rule to mean that evidence of the elements of abandonment must be clear and convincing.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Still, given the uncertainty left in the wake of\n   <em>\n    Noble House\n   </em>\n   and the limited significance of this defense, because it would only foreclose plaintiff's claim under \u00a7 1114, the court will simply deny defendants' motion as to its abandonment defense, rather than take up the possible entry of summary judgment in plaintiff's favor\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.

In response, defendants clarify that-consistent with the limits of the defense-FABCO\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   claimed a right to use the Fabick name other than \"to show affiliation to the Fabick family, and lineage to John Fabick, Sr., who founded the first Fabick Company in 1997.\" (Defs.' Opp'n (dkt. # 146) 65.) As to that, there appears to be no dispute that FABCO used the Fabick name to reference this history and familial connection. (Pl.'s Br. (dkt. # 91) 55 (acknowledging that FABCO used the Fabick name to reference the family history).) In other words, defendants are not attempting to assert a fair use defense to rebut plaintiff's infringement claim with respect to JFTCO's use post July 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   This then moots plaintiff's second basis for summary judgment on this defense-that FABCO transferred its right to use the Fabick name to JFTCO as part of the sale of its assets. Regardless, the APA and Schedules rebut any claim that FABCO sold purported rights to the FABICK marks to JFTCO. Section 3.19 of the APA sets for the intellectual property assets that were transferred to JFTCO. \"Fabick\" does not appear on that schedule. (Defs.' Add'l PFOFs (dkt. # 153) \u00b6\u00b6 187-89 (also\n   noting that APA contains a merger clause).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Since FABCO's invocation of the defense is very narrow, limited to its use of the Fabick name for purposes of pointing out lineal, family history, the practical implications of this defense are unclear, the court sees no basis to grant plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, though defendants may not assert a fair use defense that extends beyond that articulated in opposition to plaintiff's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. Monetary Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Finally, defendants seek summary judgment on any claim for monetary relief. Defendants contends that plaintiff has failed to put forth evidence that it has suffered damages as a result of defendants' alleged infringement, much less attempt to provide a computation of each category of damage as required under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(1)(A)(iii).\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its motion, defendants also run through the full gambit of possible damages theories, arguing that none fit the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   The Lanham Act provides that a successful plaintiff may recover \"(1) defendant's profits; (2) any damages sustained by the plaintiff; and (3) the costs of the action.\"\n   <em>\n    Otis Clapp &amp; Son, Inc. v. Filmore Vitamin Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"288238\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/754/738/#p744\">\n    754 F.2d 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 744 (7th Cir. 1985) (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201117\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Taking them out of order, defendants contend that plaintiff \"cannot identify customer or sales that it lost as a result of any alleged confusion,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 272), and specifically points out that 2015 was plaintiff's best year and 2016 was its third best year. Moreover, other than the alleged slowdown in the epoxy business, which the court addressed above in considering plaintiff's evidence of actual confusion (\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Opinion \u00a7 III.F), plaintiff has failed to put forth any theory to support a damages award based on lost sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Still, there are other bases for awarding damages based on plaintiff's injuries. For example, the evidence of actual confusion supports a finding that plaintiff spent time dealing with such confusion, diverting its employees from its core business. Plaintiff need not put forth evidence that it had to hire additional employees to deal with these instances or other evidence of out-of-pocket expenses. Instead, a jury reasonably could fashion an award based on employees hours spent on addressing instances of confusion, coupled with opportunity costs associated with that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Furthermore, plaintiff may also be entitled to damages based on alleged harm to plaintiff's goodwill.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Skydive Arizona, Inc. v. Quattrocchi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3742079\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/673/1105/#p1112\">\n    673 F.3d 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1112 (9th Cir. 2012) (\"In measuring harm to goodwill, a jury may consider a plaintiff's expenditures in building its reputation in order to estimate the harm to its reputation after a defendant's bad acts.\"). Here, plaintiff contends that it has spent $740,000 in advertising expense since its inception. Of course, plaintiff will need to prove this amount or otherwise provide evidence to support a finding of the value of its goodwill. Plaintiff will also have to demonstrate that plaintiff's goodwill was injured by defendants' infringement, but the court finds no reason to cut off this possible avenue of damages at the summary judgment stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   The same cannot be said of plaintiff's claim to an award of damages based\n   on defendants' profits. Here, the court agrees that plaintiff has offered nothing to support such an award. While plaintiff states in its opposition brief that a defendant's profits may be awarded (Pl.'s Opp'n (dkt. # 147) 88), it fails to develop any theory as to why such an award would be appropriate here, much less evidence supporting its award. On the contrary, as already noted in discussing plaintiff's reverse confusion theory, the court is hard-pressed to understand\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   defendants were unjustly enriched by consumers assuming that Fabick's sealants and coatings business is the same or related to JFTCO's business.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   All of the other relief raised in this portion of defendants' motion turns on the court's determination of the equities (e.g., corrective advertising), including considerations where the court would benefit from a more complete record before issuing a decision (e.g., the basis for punitive damages). As such, the court will deny defendants' motion for summary judgment that plaintiff has\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   basis for an award of monetary damages, though restrict its claim to such damages as set forth above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   ORDER\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   IT IS ORDERED that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n   1) Plaintiff Fabick, Inc.'s motion for summary judgment (dkt. # 90) is DENIED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-176\">\n   2) Defendants FABCO Equipment, Inc., and JFTCO, Inc.'s motion for summary judgment (dkt. # 117) is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.

Initially, FABCO employees were either the direct recipient of letters from Foley &amp; Lardner attorneys or copied on those letters; whereas, as the representation progressed, the letters started to be addressed to a Fabick employee. Perhaps at some point, the representation was solely of Fabick and not a joint representation with FABCO, but plaintiff has not developed this argument sufficiently, nor is it of any use with respect to the remaining privileged documents, which take place during a period when Foley was still representing both companies. Moreover, such an argument is a double-edge sword for Fabick because it would undercut plaintiff's position that FABCO was involved in the trademark application process and knew of their issuance.

On the other hand, there is a strong case for finding the required nexus between the alleged misrepresentations in Jay's declaration to the USPTO effectively denying the John Fabick Tractor Company the benefit of its prior use of the Fabick name.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"30\">\n   <p id=\"p-211\">\n    The court agrees that anything that was not timely disclosed under Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(iii) cannot be sought at trial, but it is difficult to discern what has been disclosed under that rule and will expect plaintiff to set forth precisely when and what it disclosed as to its damages claims at the final pretrial conference.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"31\">\n   <p id=\"p-212\">\n    Similarly, the court also rejects plaintiff's claim to any damages based on FABCO's purported transfer of the FABICK mark as part of the asset purchase sale to JFTCO for the reasons provided earlier in the opinion.
