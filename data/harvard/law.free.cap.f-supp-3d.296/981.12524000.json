During the party, Ms. Sturgis was standing on a second story balcony when the balcony railing collapsed and Ms. Sturgis fell to the ground. As a result of the injuries she suffered, Ms. Sturgis brought suit against several individuals, including the landlord of the house and its ten tenants, alleging negligence.

R. Civ. P. 56(a). As the current version of Rule 56 makes clear, whether a party asserts that a fact is undisputed or genuinely disputed, the party must support the asserted fact by citing to particular parts of the record, including depositions, documents, or affidavits. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A). A party can also support a fact by showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute or that the adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(B). Affidavits or declarations must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant is competent to testify on matters stated. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4). Failure to properly support a fact in opposition to a movant's factual assertion can result in the movant's fact being considered undisputed, and potentially in the grant of summary judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the Court need only consider disputed facts that are material to the decision.

[\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 326-1 at 2\n   </em>\n   .] The House was constructed in or around the year 1921, and Timarron had owned the House since approximately 2002.

[\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 305-2\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    at 3\n   </em>\n   .] In addition to owning the House, Timarron also managed the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The House featured an area above the sunroom on the south side of the structure which was used as a porch or balcony. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 305-2 at 7\n   </em>\n   .] This area was surrounded on three sides by a redwood railing. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 305-2 at 9\n   </em>\n   .] Prior to Defendants renting the House, no previous tenants had complained about the condition of the balcony railing.

[\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 305-1 at 9\n   </em>\n   .] At the time, she did not know Defendants and did not know who lived at the House. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 305-1\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    at 9\n   </em>\n   .] She learned that a party was occurring at the House via a group chat between the members of her sorority pledge class. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 299 at 12\n   </em>\n   .] Once at the party, Ms. Sturgis voluntarily went out onto the balcony.

[\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 42\n   </em>\n   .] In the intervening two years, Ms. Sturgis settled her claims against Defendants' landlord, such that Defendants, along with Dylan Schwaber, are the only remaining defendants in this action. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 212\n   </em>\n   .] Subsequently, Defendants each filed separate Motions for Summary Judgment.

Mr. Silvers, Mr. Weingold, and Mr. Bodek do not provide any support for the proposition that the rule regarding page limitations constitutes state substantive law such that the Indiana Trial Rule should govern. To the contrary, the page limitations rule is quintessentially procedural in nature. Accordingly, the objections put forth by Mr. Silvers, Mr. Weingold, and Mr. Bodek are\n   <strong>\n    OVERRULED\n   </strong>\n   .

As such, the Court declines to find as a matter of law that Defendants' duty to Ms. Sturgis was limited or eliminated based on their locations at the time of the balcony collapse.

First, she posits that \"[e]ven if the railing was sturdy, a jury could reasonably conclude that it posed a danger to party guests under the circumstances because of overcrowding on the balcony\" because a defendant \"may be held liable even if he does not foresee the precise manner in which an injury occurs.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 325 at 13\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Del Signore v.

In doing so, she argues that this case presents a question of \"whether or not it is foreseeable that if you feed an unlimited, unsupervised supply of alcoholic beverages and make marijuana available and then allow people to go out on a second story balcony in large numbers, that said conduct could result in serious injury or harm.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 341 at 3\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Despite that argument, and based on the evidence presented, the Court concludes that this is a case concerning conditions on the premises. Notwithstanding her shifting theories of negligence, Ms. Sturgis has presented no evidence that her injuries occurred, \"due to\n   <em>\n    activities\n   </em>\n   on a landowner's\n   premises unrelated to the premises' condition.\"\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12143918\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/63/316/\">\n    63 N.E.3d at 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). The Court is not persuaded by Ms. Sturgis' repeated arguments concerning the availability of alcohol and illegal drugs at the party because she has presented no evidence that the character of the social gathering at issue impacted the injury she alleges. Ms. Sturgis has not, for example, raised a genuine issue of material fact as to any jostling or horseplay involving the railing, such that any reasonable jury could find that her injury was caused by activities rather than the condition of the premises. Based on the facts presented here, the same injury could have occurred if the railing had broken during an alternative type of social gathering on the balcony, such as a study group or book club.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   A case handed down by the Indiana Supreme Court the same day as\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   provides a helpful contrast as an example of an injury that the Court analyzed as having occurred as a result of activities on the premises. In\n   <em>\n    Goodwin v. Yeakle's Sports Bar &amp; Grill, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , three plaintiffs sued a bar after a patron shot them for allegedly making a derogatory remark about his wife. In determining whether to impose a duty upon the bar, the Court examined whether the injury was foreseeable.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12137688\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/62/384/#p394\">\n    62 N.E.3d at 393-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Goodwin\n   </em>\n   fits within\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   ' definition of a case involving injuries \"due to\n   <em>\n    activities\n   </em>\n   on a landowner's premises unrelated to the premises' condition,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12143918\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/63/316/\">\n    63 N.E.3d at 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because the injury at issue had nothing whatsoever to do with the bar's safety as a structure. The same cannot be said of Ms. Sturgis' injury and the House at which the injury occurred. Put simply, her injury was related to the premises' condition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Moreover, the mere act of standing on a balcony does not transform this case into one concerning activities on the land. On this point,\n   <em>\n    Burrell\n   </em>\n   is instructive. In\n   <em>\n    Burrell\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff was involved in an activity wherein he \"climbed up,\" and \"squatted on a rafter\" before he \"moved off the rafter and knelt\" on an item, which he then fell through, crashing to the floor and breaking his pelvis in three places.\n   <em>\n    Burrell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10988666\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/569/637/\">\n    569 N.E.2d at 638-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nonetheless, the Indiana Supreme Court definitively stated that\n   <em>\n    Burrell\n   </em>\n   \"involved an injury due to a condition on the land.\"\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12143918\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/63/316/\">\n    63 N.E.3d at 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, despite the fact that an activity was occurring at the time Ms. Sturgis was allegedly injured, the injury at issue involved a condition on the land-namely the latent instability of the balcony railing. Indeed, as Ms. Sturgis states in her briefs in opposition to summary judgment, \"[i]t is undisputed that the railing broke or collapsed during the party.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 325 at 10\n   </em>\n   .] As such, the Court will analyze Ms. Sturgis' claim consistent with the method set forth in \u00a7 343 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, as adopted by\n   <em>\n    Burrell\n   </em>\n   for cases involving injuries due to conditions of the land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Before doing so, the Court will briefly address several arguments throughout the parties' briefs in which the legal framework set forth by\n   <em>\n    Rogers v. Martin\n   </em>\n   is misapplied, misstated, or misunderstood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   First, one issue that dominates many of Defendants' reply briefs is the concept of foreseeability. Mr. Bodek and Mr. Silvers, for instance, argue that they \"owed a duty to Ms. Sturgis under Section 343 only if the risk of harm due to the dangerous condition is foreseeable.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 347 at 6\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 342 at 6\n   </em>\n   .] In this regard, Defendants appear to be responding to Ms. Sturgis' arguments concerning foreseeability in her response brief, in which she states that \"the question Plaintiff should draw to the Court's attention, however, is whether or not foreseeability is a component of defining a duty.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 341 at 2-3\n   </em>\n   .] But the Indiana Supreme Court already definitively answered Ms. Sturgis' question in\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   when it stated that the \"foreseeability component within the landowner-invitee duty is already explicit within Restatement (Second) of Torts section 343\" because \"that section subjects landowners to a duty only if the risk of harm due to a dangerous condition of the land was foreseeable.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12143918\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/63/316/\">\n    63 N.E.3d at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Court will not address foreseeability, except as it exists within the test set forth in \u00a7 343.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In addition, the test set forth by several Defendants, \"focuses on the general class of persons of which the plaintiff was (i.e. a party guest) and whether the harm suffered was of the kind normally to be expected (i.e. harm caused by a structural failure), without addressing the specific facts of the occurrence.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 347 at 6\n   </em>\n   .] However, as previously explained, this is the test for invitee duty in cases involving injuries due to activities on a landowner's premises unrelated to the premises' condition.\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12143918\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/63/316/\">\n    63 N.E.3d at 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Having concluded that this case involves injuries due to conditions of the land, the Court must apply the test set forth in \u00a7 343 to determine whether Defendants owed Ms. Sturgis a duty, rather than the foreseeability test to which the parties repeatedly refer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Finally, Ms. Sturgis and many Defendants draw the Court's attention to\n   <em>\n    Polet v. ESG Sec., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12143553\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/66/972/#p978\">\n    66 N.E.3d 972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Polet\n   </em>\n   was decided a few months after\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   , but presents a very different fact pattern in which the Indiana Court of Appeals considered the duty a security firm had with respect to a stage collapse in inclement weather.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12143553\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/66/972/#p978\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12143553\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/66/972/#p978\">\n    at 981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In determining the security firm's duty, the\n   <em>\n    Polet\n   </em>\n   Court noted several factors, including the content of an agreement involving the concert venue, the scope of work in said agreement, and the players involved in a meeting related to the weather.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12143553\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/66/972/#p978\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12143553\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/66/972/#p978\">\n    at 981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . None of these factors are applicable to Ms. Sturgis' case.\n   <em>\n    Polet\n   </em>\n   , therefore, is not determinative of the outcome of Ms. Sturgis' claims against Defendants. Instead, the Court will consider Ms. Sturgis' claims consistent with the methodology set forth by\n   <em>\n    Burrell\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    2.

As a result of this change, the duty that a landowner owes to a social guest was elevated to the \"highest duty\" under premises liability: the duty to exercise reasonable care for a social guest's\n   protection while she is on the landowner's premises.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10988666\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/569/637/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Now, twenty-six years after\n   <em>\n    Burrell\n   </em>\n   , reasonable care remains the applicable standard for social guests.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Daviess-Martin Cty.

But Ms. Sturgis presents no evidence other than her own conjecture to support the notion that there had, in fact, been deterioration of the railing since Defendants took possession of the property.

As such, the Court concludes that Defendants' possession of the rental house for 15 months does not constitute constructive knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Ms. Sturgis presents no other evidence that Defendants had constructive knowledge about the balcony's condition.

Given the Court's earlier finding that Defendants lacked both knowledge and constructive knowledge of the railing's condition, the Court will only examine the evidence surrounding Ms. Sturgis' comparative knowledge. On this point, Ms. Sturgis speculates that Defendants' comparative knowledge of the railing was greater than hers, stating that \"party guests undoubtedly obscured [her] view of the railing.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 325 at 13\n   </em>\n   .] However, the record shows that in her deposition testimony, Ms. Sturgis testified that she was standing near or directly leaning on the railing when it collapsed. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 299 at 10\n   </em>\n   (in which Ms. Sturgis testifies that she was \"most likely\" leaning against the railing when it broke and she didn't recall whether she was \"just standing near it\" or \"leaning on it\");\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 299 at 11\n   </em>\n   (in which Ms. Sturgis testifies that she voluntarily leaned on the railing on April 12) ]. She further testified that she did not see anything about the railing that made her think she should not lean on it, but that it was \"too small\" and \"too old\" to carry someone's weight. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 305-1 at 13-15\n   </em>\n   .] In short, Ms. Sturgis' deposition testimony shows that she could see the railing, was near it, and, at some point, leaned on it. She also observed some characteristics about its age. As such, the evidence directly contradicts her contention in her brief that her view of the railing was obscured by party guests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Viewing the facts and drawing inferences in the manner most favorable to Ms. Sturgis, the evidence in this case does not present a triable issue of fact regarding whether Defendants breached their duty of reasonable care to Ms. Sturgis. As such, even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that Defendants owed her a duty, based on the evidence before the Court, Defendants would nonetheless be entitled to summary judgment on the issue of breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The Court's inquiry regarding negligence ends where it began: with an observation quoted by the Indiana Court of Appeals over 100 years ago that when a Court rules that there is no evidence of negligence, it does \"something more than is embraced in an ordinary ruling that there is no evidence of a fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Cincinnati\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20N.E.%20613\">\n    34 N.E. at 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Holmes, Common Law at 115).
