Defendant now seeks summary judgment on both claims, contending that the undisputed factual record reflects that: (i) plaintiff did not engage in protected activity; (ii) defendant had no notice of any protected activity; and (iii) plaintiff was not terminated because of any alleged protected activity, but rather was terminated for legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons. Plaintiff opposes defendant's motion, arguing that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that plaintiff was terminated because of his reports to his supervisors, which, in plaintiff's view, constituted protected activity. Further, plaintiff argues that defendant's stated reason for plaintiff's termination is pretext for retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   With respect to the breach of contract claim, plaintiff and defendant dispute whether under Virginia law a legally enforceable oral contract was created where, as here, the parties agreed that the contract would be reduced to writing for signature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff, Jeffry Irving, is a resident of Alexandria, Virginia who formerly worked for defendant, PAE Government Services Inc. (\"PAE\"), a California-based government contractor that provides support services to U.S. government entities both domestically and internationally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant first hired plaintiff in 2010 as PAE Company International Security Manager/Chief of Security. In December 2014, plaintiff was hired as Deputy Program Manager (\"DPM\") on the BAS Contract based in Kabul, Afghanistan. Pursuant to the BAS Contract, defendant, in association with two subcontractors-GardaWorld and Olive Group North American (\"OGNA\"), provided mobile and static security services for the Department of State (\"DOS\"). In plaintiff's role as DPM, plaintiff was responsible for overseeing defendant's subcontracts, managing a group of employees who reported to him, and ensuring compliance with DOS contract requirements and other laws and regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At issue in this case are four sets of reports that plaintiff made to his supervisors during his employment as DPM of the BAS Contract, including: (i) reports concerning allegedly noncompliant body armor; (ii) reports concerning the use of government vehicles to transport alcohol; (iii) reports concerning the arming of BAS Contract employees; and (iv) reports concerning false time reporting on the BAS Contract. Each of these reports is addressed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff's reports with respect to body armor began in 2015. In early May 2015, OGNA conducted a field test on the body armor OGNA used on the BAS Contract and determined the body armor did not comply with OGNA's subcontract with defendant. In response to these test results, defendant directed OGNA to replace the body armor through a Corrective Action Request. Later that month, on May 19, 2015, plaintiff met with Janice Pfundheller (\"Pfundheller\"), defendant's Vice President of Governance and Institutional Development, and Devin Reynolds (\"Reynolds\"), defendant's BAS Static Security Chief, to discuss plaintiff's concerns about the OGNA body armor and the possibility of loaning defendant's body armor to OGNA. Plaintiff, Reynolds, and Pfundheller discussed the fact that defendant might need to obtain approval pursuant to International Traffic in Arms Regulation (\"ITAR\") prior to loaning defendant's body armor to OGNA. The day after the meeting, plaintiff, without first obtaining the ITAR approval, directed Reynolds to loan defendant's body armor to OGNA. After the loan of defendant's body armor to OGNA, plaintiff sought authorization from Brad Baldwin (\"Baldwin\"), defendant's BAS Senior Operations Specialist, for the body armor loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Shortly after loaning defendant's body armor to OGNA, plaintiff developed concerns about defendant's body armor, as well. Specifically, plaintiff was concerned that the body armor was not certified by the National Institute of Justice (\"NIJ\") pursuant to what plaintiff believed the\n   BAS Contract required.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff disclosed his concern about this body armor to Pfundheller. Then, without Pfundheller's approval or authorization,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   on May 21, 2015, plaintiff directed Reynolds to conduct a field test of defendant's body armor. The body armor passed a 9mm handgun test, and Reynolds concluded that \"the safety and protection of [the] team [was] not in jeopardy.\" Doc. 46 Ex. 24 at 2. Upon hearing about the unauthorized test of defendant's government-issued body armor, Stephen Easley, PAE's Senior Operations Manager, launched an investigation into the body armor issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In addition to plaintiff's reports about defendant's body armor, plaintiff reported to his supervisors that defendant's BAS Contract staff was using government-funded equipment-vehicles-to transport alcohol. Plaintiff also reported to his supervisors that members of the BAS Contract staff were not armed even though plaintiff believed that the BAS Contract required those staff members to be armed. Finally, plaintiff reported to his supervisors that he saw some contractors sitting in the courtyard during the workday and therefore was concerned that the contractors' billing might not be accurate. It appears from the record that plaintiff never examined or reviewed any time records and that plaintiff reported concerns about billing because he was concerned about defendant's reputation and profits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Dep. at 264:7-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On July 29, 2015, Easley arranged a meeting with plaintiff to discuss plaintiff's performance in his role as DPM. After the meeting, Easley formally documented and sent to plaintiff a list of plaintiff's performance issues including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (1) that plaintiff, without authorization, directed a test of body armor and that test involved the destruction of property belonging to the government;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (2) that plaintiff failed to follow Pfundheller's direction to obtain ITAR clearance prior to loaning defendant's body armor to OGNA;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (3) that plaintiff interacted negatively with other teams, subcontractors and partners;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (4) that plaintiff displayed a negative attitude about defendant as a company; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (5) that plaintiff's abused his subordinate staff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 46 Ex. 35 at 1-2. Thereafter, on September 14, 2015, Mark Hunter, BAS Mobile Security Chief, sent Easley an email, complaining about plaintiff. Easley forwarded Hunter's complaint to LaTanya D'Antignac (\"D'Antignac\"), a member of defendant's Human Resources Department, who conducted an investigation into the allegations in the complaint. As a part of the investigation, D'Antignac interviewed plaintiff and several of his subordinates, including: Hunter, Reynolds, Ralph Brugueras, Al Gopez, and Florencio Cortez. D'Antignac also interviewed two other DPMs, Mark Kennedy and Jon Dobre.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On October 12, 2015, after concluding her investigation, D'Antignac submitted her interview notes and investigative summary\n   to Easley, Pfundheller, and Kathleen Long, the Director of Human Resources. D'Antignac's investigation substantiated Hunter's allegations against plaintiff, including plaintiff's failure of leadership and intimidation or harassment of his subordinates. Specifically, D'Antignac found that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (1) plaintiff created a divisive workplace;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (2) plaintiff deliberately injured the feelings of and demonstrated a lack of respect for his employees;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (3) plaintiff did not demonstrate commitment to his leadership position on the BAS Contract;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (4) plaintiff had a reputation for being confrontational, hot-tempered and unreasonable;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (5) plaintiff failed to convey clearly assignments to his team resulting in poor or inadequate communication;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (6) plaintiff's continuous negative attitude created hostility and decreased employee engagement and satisfaction;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (7) plaintiff lacked the basic interpersonal skills needed to lead the BAS Contract effectively.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Easley Decl. Ex. 8 at 39-40. Ultimately, D'Antignac concluded that defendant should terminate plaintiff. Based on D'Antignac's report, Easley, Long, and Pfundheller jointly made the decision to terminate plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Thereafter, on October 19, 2015, Easley, Long, and Pfundheller met with plaintiff in Virginia and informed plaintiff that his employment would be terminated. During the October 19 meeting, Easley, Long, Pfundheller, and plaintiff discussed the terms of a severance package for plaintiff. All parties agreed that the severance package would be reduced to writing for the parties' signatures. The next day-on October 20, 2015-Long sent plaintiff a copy of a severance agreement for review and signature and officially terminated plaintiff's employment. There is no dispute that the parties agreed in the October 19 meeting that defendant would reduce the severance agreement to writing and present it to plaintiff the following day. Plaintiff contends that agreement on all severance terms was reached at the October 19 meeting and that the written agreement presented to plaintiff the next day did not reflect that agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On December 30, 2016, plaintiff filed the complaint in this action. The complaint's remaining claims\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   include: (i) that plaintiff was discharged in retaliation for reporting alleged violations of the FCA; and (ii) that defendant breached an oral agreement created at the October 19 meeting by not paying plaintiff his full salary in the final severance agreement. On September 8, 2017, defendant filed the motion for summary judgment at issue here with respect\n   to the remaining FCA retaliation and breach of contract claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In its motion for summary judgment, defendant argues that summary judgment is appropriate because (i) plaintiff's various complaints to his supervisors concerning body armor, alcohol transports, weapons, and time reporting did not constitute protected activity; (ii) defendant had no notice of any protected activity; and (iii) plaintiff was not terminated because of any protected activity. Instead, defendant contends that plaintiff was terminated for a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason-plaintiff's poor management and interpersonal skills-and that there is no record evidence showing a triable issue of fact on whether that reason is pretextual. With respect to the breach of contract claim, defendant argues that there was no enforceable agreement between plaintiff and defendant as of the October 19 meeting because the parties clearly intended for any agreement to be reduced to writing. Plaintiff does not dispute that the parties intended to reduce the agreement to writing, but claims that all material terms of the severance agreement were orally agreed to at the meeting. These issues have been fully briefed and argued and are ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The familiar standard for review of a summary judgment motion is too well-settled to warrant extended discussion. Under Rule 56, Fed. R. Civ. P., summary judgment is appropriate only where there is \"no genuine dispute as to any material fact\" such that the moving party \"is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Celotex v.

To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under this provision, a plaintiff must show by a preponderance of evidence that: \"(1) [plaintiff] engaged in protected activity; (2) the employer knew about the activity; and (3) the employer took adverse action against [plaintiff] as a result.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

The record here discloses some facts to suggest plaintiff believed defendant was violating the FCA.

By contrast, the record arguably contains no evidence demonstrating that these beliefs were objectively reasonable. Moreover, the record does not disclose the basis for the COR's belief that fraud was occurring, nor does the record reveal information concerning the COR's knowledge of BAS Contract requirements or concerning whether plaintiff had any knowledge of defendant's claim for payment for body armor under the BAS Contract. As such, there is inadequate evidence to assess whether the COR's-and in turn, the plaintiff's-beliefs about the existence of fraud are objectively reasonable. Given that the question whether plaintiff's belief about fraud was objectively reasonable is close, it is appropriate to assume without deciding that plaintiff's reports about defendant's body armor constituted protected activity.

The undisputed factual record contains no firm evidence of any time reporting fraud. In fact, the only basis for plaintiff's complaint was his observation of some contractors sitting outside during the work day. Plaintiff does not contend that he ever reviewed any time reports from those contractors or that plaintiff was privy to defendant's submission of time reports to the government. Finally, plaintiff admits that he reported the time reporting issues out of concern for defendant's profits and reputation, not fraud. Accordingly, the undisputed factual record demonstrates that plaintiff did not believe defendant was engaged in fraud and had no objectively reasonable basis for any such belief. Thus, no reasonable jury could find that plaintiff's complaints about time reporting constituted protected activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In any event, given the current record, it is appropriate to assume without deciding that plaintiff's complaints concerning defendant's body armor were protected activity. None of plaintiff's other reports, however, satisfy the requirements of protected activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The second prong of the prima facie FCA retaliation case is satisfied here. Defendant clearly knew about plaintiff's protected activity because plaintiff reported his concerns about the body armor directly to both his supervisors and the government COR. The government COR then discussed the body armor issue with Easley, asking Easley for documentation of the body armor's compliance with the contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reilly Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-14. Because a fact finder could conclude that these actions \"would put the employer on notice that [FCA] litigation [was] a reasonable possibility,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   plaintiff has satisfied his burden with respect to the second element of the prima facie retaliation case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Despite satisfying the first two prongs of the prima facie retaliation case, plaintiff fails to show a genuine dispute of fact demonstrating the final prong, namely that plaintiff was terminated as a result of plaintiff's protected activity. To begin with, defendant complained about the body armor in May 2015 but was not terminated until October 2015. In the Fourth Circuit, a substantial gap in time \"weighs against a finding that it is more likely than not that the alleged protected activities played a role in [plaintiff's] termination.\"\n   <em>\n    Feldman v. Law Enfor't Associates Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4309213\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/752/339/#p348\">\n    752 F.3d 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 348-49 (4th Cir. 2014). And, in retaliation cases, the courts in this circuit have found that a gap of three months, let alone the five-month gap at issue here, is too long to infer a causal nexus on the basis of timing alone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Furthermore, the undisputed factual record reveals that plaintiff was not disciplined or threatened because of his complaints about body armor. Indeed, defendant continued to employ plaintiff for several months after plaintiff reported the body armor issues, and the undisputed\n   record reflects that defendant took seriously plaintiff's recommendations with respect to body armor. In this regard, Easley immediately flew to Kabul to conduct his own investigation into the body armor issue, worked to resolve the issue with the government COR, and made plans to purchase body armor compliant with the more rigorous NIJ certification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203267961\">\n    2017 WL 3267961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *16 (finding plaintiff was not terminated as a result of alleged protected activity because defendant \"took seriously [plaintiff's] recommendations,\" \"reported [ ] errors to the government,\" and \"continued to employ [plaintiff] for several more months.\"). Moreover, plaintiff adduces no record evidence of Easley criticizing plaintiff for raising the body armor issues with the government COR or with his supervisors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, Easley ultimately commended plaintiff, noting that plaintiff's intent was \"positive and focused on employee safety.\" Doc. 46 Ex. 35 at 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In an attempt to overcome this undisputed record, plaintiff argues (i) that defendant did not treat Easley and Hunter in the same way when complaints were brought against those individuals; and (ii) that two of plaintiff's subordinates and the COR believed plaintiff was terminated because of the body armor incident. Neither of these arguments is a bar to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   To begin with, Easley and Hunter are not valid comparators to plaintiff. The complaints against those individuals were neither as frequent nor as severe as the complaints made against plaintiff. The complaints against plaintiff were numerous detailed and led to a formal investigation that validated those complaints.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Easley Dep. at 28:8-19; 115:11-123:12. By contrast, the complaints against Easley and Hunter were isolated and minor. Specifically, plaintiff and Reynolds each complained about Easley once, expressing concerns about Easley's impartiality before his trip to Kabul.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 46 Ex. 44, 49. Significantly, neither plaintiff nor Reynolds reiterated this complaint after Easley's trip, suggesting their concerns had been resolved. The contrast with plaintiff is even more striking with respect to Hunter. Specifically, plaintiff sent one email to Easley about Hunter's lack of engagement at work in August 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 46 Ex. 50.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   This hardly rises to the same level as the many complaints concerning plaintiff that led to the formal investigation and his discharge. Also worth noting is that among the complaints registered against plaintiff is the complaint that plaintiff ordered the destructive testing of defendant's body armor without authorization. As the testimony of Easley and Pfundheller reflects, this, by itself, could rise to the level of a terminable offense.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 105:13-105:8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pfundheller Dep. at 134:1-19. In sum, Easley and Hunter are not valid comparators; the material differences between the complaints about these individuals and the complaints about plaintiff suggest that different treatment of these individuals was warranted. Accordingly,\n   the treatment of Hunter and Easley fails to support an inference of retaliation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coleman v. Donahoe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048496\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/667/835/#p841\">\n    667 F.3d 835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 841 (7th Cir. 2012) ( \"There must be sufficient commonalities on the key variables between the plaintiff and the would-be comparator to allow the type of comparison that, taken together with the other prima facie evidence, would allow a jury to reach an inference of [retaliation].\" (internal quotations omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiff next points to the opinions of three individuals, Reilly, Reynolds and Christine Trostle,\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   who believe defendant terminated plaintiff because of plaintiff's body armor complaints. This evidence does not create a genuine dispute of fact as to the reasons for plaintiff's termination because the Fourth Circuit has long held that \"it is the perception of the decision maker which is relevant [to a retaliation claim],\" and the opinions of co-workers are \"close to irrelevant.\"\n   <em>\n    Hawkins v. PepsiCo, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11483078\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/203/274/#p280\">\n    203 F.3d 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 280 (4th Cir. 2000) (citing\n   <em>\n    DeJarnette v.

Reilly, Reynolds and Trostle were not involved in the decision to terminate plaintiff. Indeed, Reilly did not even work for defendant, and Trostle resigned from the BAS Contract in July 2015, well before plaintiff was terminated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trostle Decl. \u00b6 22. As such, these individuals' opinions about the reasons for plaintiff's termination are entirely irrelevant and thus do not create a genuine dispute concerning whether any protected activity engaged in by plaintiff was the cause of plaintiff's termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In sum, plaintiff has not demonstrated that defendant terminated plaintiff as a result of plaintiff's protected activity. Accordingly, plaintiff has not established a prima facie case, and defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on plaintiff's FCA retaliation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Even assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that plaintiff could establish a prima facie FCA retaliation case, plaintiff does not satisfy the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   burden-shifting framework. Specifically, defendant has provided legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for plaintiff's termination, and plaintiff has failed to identify record evidence demonstrating that those reasons are pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Defendant here offers ample record evidence of the legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for plaintiff's termination, including plaintiff's poor management and interpersonal skills, insubordination, and unprofessional conduct. As the undisputed factual record shows, Easley and Pfundheller received complaints throughout 2015 about plaintiff's difficulty managing people and plaintiff's negative interactions with other teams. In May 2015, plaintiff committed what Easley and Pfundheller testified would ordinarily be a terminable offense by directing the destruction body armor without the express approval of his PAE supervisors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Easley Dep. at 105:13-105:8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pfundheller Dep. at 134:1-19. Almost two months later, on July 29, 2015, Easley formally documented plaintiff's performance issues and identified five chief areas of concern, including plaintiff's negative interactions with other teams and poor treatment of subordinates. A month and a half later, Easley received yet another complaint from one of plaintiff's subordinates. Thereafter, the Human Resources Department conducted a formal investigation and ultimately recommended plaintiff's termination based on his management failures and lack of interpersonal skills. Thus, this record provides extensive support for defendant's legitimate and\n   non-retaliatory reasons for terminating plaintiff, namely plaintiff's poor job performance. And because courts have consistently recognized poor job performance as a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for termination under the FCA,\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   defendant has satisfied its burden of production under the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Importantly, plaintiff has not met his burden of establishing these reasons for plaintiff's termination are pretextual. Plaintiff offers three pieces of evidence in an attempt to demonstrate pretext: (i) the fact that defendant had only one email memorializing any formal complaint against plaintiff; (ii) an assertion that the investigation into plaintiff was biased; and (iii) the affidavits of three co-workers who believed defendant did not actually suffer from performance issues. Ultimately, plaintiff's evidence falls far short of that needed to overcome summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiff's argument that defendant relies on only one email to support defendant's proffered reasons for termination mischaracterizes the record. In fact, the record reveals that although Easley may have only\n   <em>\n    formally\n   </em>\n   documented plaintiff's performance issues once, Easley received several informal complaints about plaintiff, including the complaint that prompted the HR investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Easley Dep. at 28:2-19; 115:11-123:12. Moreover, D'Antignac conducted a formal investigation in which she interviewed several of plaintiff's subordinates, colleagues and plaintiff himself. The results of D'Antignac's interviews fully corroborated the areas for improvement identified in Easley's July counseling email.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Recognizing this fact, plaintiff argues that D'Antignac's investigation was biased. Yet, plaintiff fails to identify any record evidence that persuasively supports that allegation. Plaintiff points simply to the fact that Easley forwarded D'Antignac Easley's July counseling email, arguing that email improperly biased D'Antignac. But importantly, in that very same email, Easley reiterates that he appreciates D'Antignac's \"unbiased opinion on the issue.\" Doc. 46 Ex. 15 at 1. Plaintiff also suggests the fact that D'Antignac interviewed the individuals Easley flagged demonstrates D'Antignac's bias. But this allegation ignores the fact that D'Antignac also independently interviewed both plaintiff himself and Reynolds, one of the subordinates who filed complaints against Easley and consistently supported plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 46 Ex. 41 at 2-7. D'Antignac's interview list thus suggests thoroughness and not bias.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elkharwily\n   </em>\n   , 823 F.3d at 471 (finding plaintiff failed to demonstrate poor performance was pretext for retaliation where \"evaluations were confidential, based on feedback from\n   numerous staff interviews, and performed independently of each other.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Finally, plaintiff relies on the affidavits of two of his subordinates and the COR to argue that plaintiff did not, in reality, suffer from any performance issues. This evidence does not create a triable issue of fact on whether defendant's legitimate non-retaliatory reasons are pretext for retaliation; as the Fourth Circuit has made clear, it is the decision-maker's evaluation of plaintiff's job performance that matters, not the plaintiff's evaluation of his own job performance or the evaluation of the plaintiff's coworkers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hawkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11483078\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/203/274/#p280\">\n    203 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   280 (citing\n   <em>\n    DeJarnette\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"22398\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/133/293/#p299\">\n    133 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   298-99 ). In\n   <em>\n    Hawkins v.

Because the parties intended to reduce the agreement to writing for signature the day after the October 19 meeting, there is a strong presumption that no oral contract was formed at the meeting.
