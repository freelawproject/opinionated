INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pending before the Court is Plaintiff Centurion Medical Liability Protective Risk Retention Group. Inc.'s (\"Plaintiff\") Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. (Dkt. No. 43 (hereinafter, \"Motion\" or \"Mot.\").) Specifically, Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that it has no duty to defend Celina Gonzalez, a Certified Nurse Midwife (\"Gonzalez\"), Stephen N. Pine, M.D. (\"Dr. Pine\"), and S. Pine, a Medical Corporation (collectively, \"Defendants\") in an underlying lawsuit because Defendants gave late notice of the claim. After considering the papers filed in support of and in opposition to the Motion, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS in part\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES in part\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff issued a professional liability insurance policy to Defendants, effective May 30, 2016 through May 30, 2017 (hereinafter, the \"Policy\"). (Dkt. No. 50, Separate Statement of Uncontroverted Material Facts and Conclusions of Law in Support of Motion (hereinafter, \"SUF\") \u00b6 6; Dkt. No. 48-1 (Policy), Exh. A at 2.) The Policy states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   This underlying master policy is a claims-made policy with defense costs included within policy limits. The coverage provided by this policy is limited to those claims which arise from professional services rendered after the retroactive date stated on the declarations page and\n   <em>\n    which are first made against the insured and reported to the Company in writing during the policy period.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (Dkt. No. 48-1 (Policy), Exh. A at 12 (emphasis added).) The Policy defines the scope of coverage as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   In consideration of the payment of premium, upon compliance with all terms of this policy and subject to the specific terms, conditions and exclusions contained in this policy, and except as otherwise provided herein, the Company will pay on behalf of the Insured all sums, not to exceed the Policy Limits, which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of injury or death arising out of medical negligence of the Insured during the policy period, for a Claim\n   <em>\n    when timely\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    notice of such Claim is made to the Company within the policy period\n   </em>\n   , and for which a judgment against the Insured is entered following an actual trial in a court of competent jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Policy at 13.) A \"Claim\" is defined as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   A written notice received by an Insured, and forwarded to the Company, from a person or Entity, alleging that such person or Entity has been damaged by an Insured and demanding monetary damages or notifying the Insured of an intention to hold an Insured responsible for an occurrence; or the filing of a civil lawsuit seeking monetary damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Under the heading, \"Notice of Claim,\" the Policy imposes an additional reporting requirement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   You are obligated to provide written notice of the existence of a patient's claim against you to the Company promptly, and in any event\n   <em>\n    not more than 20 days after receiving such claim.\n   </em>\n   Notice of this claim is deemed to have been \"made\" to the Company, for purposes of policy coverage, on the date the Company first receives a written notice from you notifying the Company of the claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Policy also contains an exclusion barring coverage for late notice (hereinafter, the \"Late Notice Exclusion\"):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The Company shall not be liable to pay or defend any claim for medical negligence against the Insured for which the Company does not receive written notification from you\n   <em>\n    within 20 days after the Insured first receives a Claim\n   </em>\n   as defined in Section 1.01(a) of this Policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On September 28, 2016, J.H., a minor, through his guardian ad litem, filed a personal injury lawsuit against Defendants, alleging that J.H. suffered bodily injury due to Gonzalez's professional negligence in delivering J.H. (SUF \u00b6\u00b6 1-3; Dkt. No. 48-3, Exh. C (complaint in\n   <em>\n    Hernandez v. Good Samaritan Hospital et al.,\n   </em>\n   Los Angeles County Superior Court Case No. BC 635723 (hereinafter, the \"\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   Action\")).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The summons and complaint in the\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   Action were served on Gonzalez on or about November 13, 2016. (SUF \u00b6 11.) Defendants tendered their defense to Plaintiff sixty-six days later, on January 18, 2017, when Dr. Pine provided a copy of the\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   complaint to Plaintiff. (SUF \u00b6\u00b6 13, 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On February 27, 2017, Plaintiff commenced the instant action, seeking declaratory judgment that (1) it has no duty to defend Defendants in the\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   Action given that Defendants notified Plaintiff of the lawsuit more than 20 days after it was filed; (2) it has no duty to defend Defendants given the Policy exclusion barring coverage for high risk pregnancies; (3) the additional terms, conditions, exclusions, and endorsements in the Policy bar coverage; and (4) it has no duty to indemnify anyone for any judgment rendered in the\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   Action. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On July 30, 2017, Plaintiff filed this Motion, seeking summary judgment as to its first and third claims for declaratory relief. (Dkt. No. 43.) Concurrently, Plaintiff filed a Request for Judicial Notice. (Dkt. No. 49.) Defendants opposed the Motion on August 28, 2017 (\"Opp'n\") (Dkt. No. 57), and Plaintiff replied on September 1, 2017 (Dkt. No. 62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    III. JUDICIAL NOTICE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff asks the Court to take judicial notice of the following: (1) the complaint in the\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   Action; (2) the Complaint in the instant action; (3) the\n   Answer in the instant action; and (4) the proof of service on Gonzalez in the\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   Action. A court \"may take judicial notice of proceedings in other courts, both within and without the federal judicial system, if those proceedings have a direct relation to matters at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel.

Cal. 2015). The complaint and proof of service on Gonzalez in the\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   Action were filed in the Los Angeles County Superior Court. (Dkt. No. 48-3, Exh. C; Dkt. No. 48-7, Exh. G.) The Complaint and Answer in the instant action were filed in this Court. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff's Request for Judicial Notice. The Court advises Plaintiff \"for future reference that [it] need not seek judicial notice of documents filed in the same case,\" as \"[a]n accurate citation will suffice.\"\n   <em>\n    Gerritsen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363860\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/112/1011/#p1034\">\n    112 F.Supp.3d at 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when, after adequate discovery, the evidence demonstrates that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
