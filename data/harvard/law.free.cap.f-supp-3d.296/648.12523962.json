On Thursday, December 11, 2014, from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., the USCIS Naturalization Unit held its holiday party in the Unit's waiting room.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 3. The party, held annually, serves to promote collegiality among USCIS employees and to boost employee morale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Savage Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8. USCIS management selects the date of the party and solicits volunteers for a planning committee that then coordinates party logistics, including the provision of food and games.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.

Brown served on the planning committee, and Edna Baquie, a first-line supervisor and co-chair of the planning committee, asked Brown if he would volunteer to organize and run the games at the party, a regular feature of the Unit's holiday parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 5; Declaration of Edna Baquie, dated June 22, 2017 (attached as Ex. 2 to Def.

Brown agreed and suggested to the committee a game involving beaded necklaces, in which participants would be told not to use a particular word and would forfeit their necklaces if they did so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 7; Baquie Decl. \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Allegations in the Complaint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following is a summary of the allegations in the complaint:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the party, only members of the Naturalization Unit were present. Compl. \u00b6 4. Brown was part of a group of ISOs who \"are known for bringing alcohol to these parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. \"This party was similar to other parties. [Brown's] eyes were glassy, but his breath didn't smell like alcohol.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At approximately 2:30 p.m., Brown suggested that the people at the party play a game in which \"[p]articipants were required to wear Mardi Gras beads, and if someone said a certain word in conversation, one had to give his or her Mardi Gras beads to the other person in the conversation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. Smith played the game with one of her coworkers, ISO Dawn Panetta.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. During Smith's conversation with Panetta, Brown approached Smith and aggressively demanded that she give her beads to Panetta as part of the game.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. Because Brown was acting aggressively, Smith ignored him and walked away.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Five minutes later, Brown approached Smith and again demanded that she give her beads to Panetta.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. After Smith \"ran out of the Room to get away from\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Brown, Brown said \"[y]ou can run but you can't hide!\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Seven minutes later, Smith returned to the room and gave all but one of her beads to ISO Panetta.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. When Brown saw that Smith was still wearing a beaded necklace, he began to yell at her, demanding that she give Panetta all of her beads.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Smith ignored Brown's demands and placed her hands around her single beaded necklace as she spoke to Panetta.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Brown put his hands over Smith's hands and demanded that she \"let the beads go.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. Surprised by Brown's actions, Smith told Brown repeatedly to stop grabbing her hands.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. When Brown refused to remove his hands, Smith asked him: \"What are you doing?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Brown responded by demanding that she let go of the beads.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Smith told Brown to stop by saying \"[y]ou are taking this too far\" and \"I am a woman.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. But Brown refused to remove his hands from Smith's neck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After 7 minutes, Smith called for help.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. When another worker approached, Brown \"pulled down on\" Smith's hands, causing the beaded necklace around her neck to break and her arm to be scratched.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Immediately after the incident, Smith felt pain around her neck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. She visited a nurse, complaining of severe neck pain and that she was having trouble holding her head upright.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. Smith later went to a hospital to have her neck and arm examined.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. She was given a soft cervical collar to wear for 3-4 weeks and was prescribed Robaxin, a pain killer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Post-Incident Events\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Smith was out of work for 45 hours, during which she received benefits under the Federal Employees Compensation Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%208101\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , (\"FECA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 30; Declaration of Julia A.
