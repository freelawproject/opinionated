During the hearing, both Plaintiff and his attorney testified that Plaintiff had lost his health insurance after receiving a $50,000.00 worker's compensation settlement in August 2013 (associated with his April 2012 workplace accident) and had to live off of the settlement money because he was unable to work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 32-33, 45-47.
