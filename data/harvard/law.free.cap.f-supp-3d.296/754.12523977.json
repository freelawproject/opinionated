Smith (\"Smith\" or \"Plaintiff\") has filed this class action lawsuit\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   against Defendant Cohn, Goldberg &amp; Deutsch, LLC (\"Cohn\" or \"Defendant\") alleging Cohn failed to properly name the creditor to whom the debt was owed as required by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962g(a)(2) in its initial written communications to Maryland consumers, or within five days thereafter. (ECF No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 10; 28.) Defendant Cohn has filed a Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint (\"Cohn's Motion\"), asserting that Smith's claims fail as a matter of law, because Cohn's Initial Communication Letter provides the name of the owner of the note and does not contain any false or misleading statements, meeting the requirements of \u00a7 1962g(a)(2). (ECF No. 9.) Currently pending before this Court is Defendant's Motion to Dismiss.

On or about November 15, 2016, Defendant Cohn sent Plaintiff Smith an Initial Communication Letter (the \"Letter\") in connection to the collection of a debt. (Compl., ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 22.) The Letter asserts that on November 18, 2005, Smith purchased property at 9411 Lyonswood Drive, Owings Mills, Maryland 21117 financed through a mortgage with Mortgage Lenders Network USA, Inc. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1-1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 9-1 at 2.) The Letter states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 18, 2005, you executed a Deed of Trust and Note secured by the above referenced property, and borrowed money in connection with a loan made by Mortgage Lenders Network USA, Inc..[\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] The current owner of the note is U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, for Residential Asset Securities Corporation, Home Equity Mortgage Asset-Backed Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-EMX1, and the current servicer of the above-referenced loan is Wells Fargo Bank, N.A..[\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] The loan has been referred to this office for legal action based upon a default under the terms of the loan agreement....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Upon your written request within the thirty (30) day period, this office will provide the name and address of the original creditor if different from the current creditor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   IF YOU ARE A DEBTOR, OR AN ATTORNEY REPRESENTING A DEBTOR, THIS COMMUNICATION IS AN ATTEMPT TO COLLECT A DEBT, AND ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED HEREBY WILL BE USED FOR THAT PURPOSE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (ECF No. 1-1.) The Letter was the first communication that Smith received from Cohn, and other than an additional letter of the same date concerning the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, Smith did not receive any other communication from Cohn within five days of the Letter. (ECF No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Smith claims that the Letter violated 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g(a)(2) of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"), because it \"fail[ed] to clearly specify, in a manner in which the least sophisticated consumer could understand, the name of the creditor to whom the Debt was owed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28.) Smith's Complaint states that he was confused about which one of the entities listed in the Letter was the creditor owed the debt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26.) The Complaint further states that there were five entities listed in the Letter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29.) The Letter includes the following entities that are related to the debt in question: Mortgage Lenders Network USA, Inc.; U.S. Bank National Association; Residential Asset Securities Corporation, Home Equity Mortgage Asset-Backed Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-EMX1; Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.; and \"this office\" (Cohn). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Per the direction of the Letter, Smith wrote a letter to Cohn dated December 7, 2016, in order to verify the debt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36.) Subsequently, Smith filed this action alleging that the Letter violates the FDCPA, because the Letter did not contain the proper disclosures required by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g(a)(2). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Specifically, Smith argues that the Letter failed to specify the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed, and Cohn did not provide such disclosures within five days after.

To state a claim for relief under the FDCPA, a plaintiff must allege that \"(1) [he] has been the object of collection activity arising from consumer debt, (2) the defendant is a debt collector as defined by the FDCPA, and (3) the defendant has engaged in an act or omission prohibited by the FDCPA.\"\n   <em>\n    Webber v.

July 7, 2010) ). The first two elements of the claim are not in dispute. (ECF No. 11 at 7.) Rather, the relevant question here is whether Smith's claim plausibly alleges that Cohn \"fail[ed] to clearly specify, in a manner in which the least sophisticated consumer could understand, the name of the creditor to whom the Debt is owed,\" and thus, violated 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g(a)(2) of the FDCPA. (ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 28.) Section 1692g(a) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Within five days after the initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt, a debt collector shall, unless the following information\n   is contained in the initial communication or the consumer has paid the debt, send the consumer a written notice containing ... the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g(a) (2012).

(ECF No. 11 at 10-11.) The parties here are primarily in dispute over two issues regarding the clarity of the Letter: (1) whether the list of entities in the Letter could confuse the least sophisticated consumer, and (2) whether the context of the letter as a whole did not clearly communicate the identity of the creditor to the least sophisticated consumer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   First, Smith's Complaint contends that the five entities listed in the Letter would ultimately confuse the reader as to which entity is the creditor to whom the debt is owed. (ECF No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 28-32.) The Letter contains the following language as to the creditor to whom the debt is owed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [Y]ou executed a Deed of Trust and Note secured by the above referenced property, and borrowed money in connection with a loan made by Mortgage Lenders Network USA, Inc..[\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] The current owner of the note is U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, for Residential Asset Securities Corporation, Home Equity Mortgage Asset-Backed Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-EMX1, and the current servicer of the above-referenced loan is Wells Fargo Bank, N.A[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (ECF No. 1-1.) Fundamentally, the parties dispute whether the above text lists four entities or five. (ECF No. 9 at 6-9; ECF No. 11 at 8-13.) Cohn asserts that \"U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, for Residential Asset Securities Corporation, Home Equity Mortgage Asset-Backed Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-EMX1,\" is one entity, not two. (ECF No. 9-1 at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Both parties rely on\n   <em>\n    Janetos v. Fulton Friedman &amp; Gullace, LLP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324436\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/317/#p321\">\n    825 F.3d 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 321 (7th Cir. 2016) as instructive when interpreting the above language. The Seventh Circuit explains that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   If a letter fails to disclose the required information clearly, it violates the Act, without further proof of confusion ... When \u00a7 1692g(a) requires that a communication include certain information, compliance demands more than simply including that information in some unintelligible form. Otherwise, as we have said, \"the collection agency could write the letter in Hittite and have a secure defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Chuway v.

(ECF No. 9-1 at 5-10.) As explained above, not only must the information in the Letter be accurate, it must also be clearly communicated. The language of Cohn's Letter requires the reader to be able to extrapolate the identity of the creditor to whom the debt is owed from the listed entities, and further, understand the relationships between U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, for Residential Asset Securities Corporation, Home Equity Mortgage Asset-Backed Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-EXMI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) The least sophisticated consumer could plausibly be confused by the list of entities in the Letter, and the relationship between the listed entities, without a \"bizarre\" or \"unreasonable\" interpretation of the Letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Cohn asserts that the company \"clearly identified the owner of the note, which is the creditor to whom the debt is owed,\" therefore, the Letter would not confuse the least sophisticated consumer. (ECF No. 9-1 at 2.) The very fact that the parties dispute how many entities are included in the list of entities that purportedly communicates the identity of the creditor to whom the debit is owed portends that there are multiple interpretations, at least one of them inaccurate, of the content of the Letter. If the parties here dispute the number of actual entities within the Letter, what hope does the least sophisticated consumer have to accurately determine which entity is the creditor? The FDCPA requires that the identity of the creditor to whom the debt is owed be communicated effectively to the least sophisticated consumer, and here, there is at least a facially plausible claim that Cohn's Letter did not meet such a standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Second, vague language in the Letter potentially further confuses the identity of the creditor to whom the debt is owed, or at least does not clarify the identity of the creditor. The Letter states, \"[t]he loan has been referred to this office for legal action based upon a default under the terms of the loan agreement.\" (ECF No. 1-1.) While the reference to \"this office\" is not misleading given that the Letter clearly was sent from Cohn per the header of the Letter and signature, the reference to \"[t]he loan\" does not help to identify the creditor to whom the debt is owed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Further, the memo line of Cohn's Letter only includes vague references to file numbers, \"Loan # 1115040410\" and \"Our File # 449614,\" that do not link the account numbers to a particular entity that could be identified as the creditor to whom the debt is owed. (ECF No. 1-1.) (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Romano v. Schachter Portnoy, L.L.C.,\n   </em>\n   No. 17-CV-1014(ARR)(CLP),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202804930\">\n    2017 WL 2804930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (E.D.N.Y. June 28, 2017), finding that because the letter's subject line stated \"Re: CALVARY SPV I, LLC..Original Creditor: SYNCHRONY BANK formerly known as GE CAPITAL RETAIL Bank,\" the subject line clearly communicated that Cavalry SPV I, LLC was the creditor to whom the debt was owed; there was no other way to understand the disclosure than that the creditor was Cavalry SPV I, LLC, even though multiple entities were identified.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2.) Here, however, there are multiple possible interpretations of the information provided in the Letter's subject line, contrary to\n   <em>\n    Romano\n   </em>\n   . As a result, the content of the Letter supports a plausible claim that the identity of the creditor to whom the debt is owed was not effectively communicated, thus, Smith has set out a plausible claim for relief under the FDCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Cohn's Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 9) is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A separate Order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Smith brings this class action pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(3) on behalf of himself and those similarly situated persons with a Maryland address who received an initial debt collection letter from Defendant Cohn that does not specify the name of the creditor to whom the debt was owed.

(ECF No. 9-1 at 6.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    As a threshold matter, the parties dispute whether the interpretation of the least sophisticated consumer is a question of law or fact. The Fourth Circuit generally treats the test as an objective test that presents a question of law. \"Given the objective nature of this inquiry, a district court's application of the least sophisticated consumer test ordinarily presents a question of law.\"\n    <em>\n     Ramsay v.

However, the Fourth Circuit also recognizes that FDCPA claims \"may involve disputed factual issues that must be resolved before the court makes the legal determination whether a communication is false, deceptive, or misleading to the least sophisticated consumer.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=593%20Fed.%20Appx.%20204\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=593%20Fed.%20Appx.%20204\">\n     at 208, n.3\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . At this juncture, the question is merely whether Smith stated a plausible claim for relief under the FDCPA.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
