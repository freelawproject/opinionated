CRENSHAW, JR., CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Pending before the Court in this employment discrimination case is the Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 65) filed by Triumph Aerostructures, LLC (\"Triumph\"), to which Karen Morgan (\"Morgan\") has responded in opposition (Doc. No. 70), and Triumph has replied (Doc. No. 73). For the reasons that follow, the Motion will be granted, and Morgan's claims will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 24, 2005, Vought Aircraft Industries, Inc. hired Morgan as an Aircraft Assembler, and she kept that job when Triumph acquired Vought. (DSOF \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2). In December 2013, Morgan applied for, and received, a promotion to an Aircraft Inspector position, and was assigned to the production line for the C-130, a military aircraft. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As the name suggests, an Aircraft Inspector inspects aircraft parts that have been built by assemblers. If a deflect or flaw is observed in the part, the Inspector has authority to send the part back to assembly for correction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When Morgan began working as an Inspector on the C-130 line, Christopher Criss (\"Criss\"), a subassembly supervisor, screamed at her for rejecting parts, and later became angry with her for buying (or approving) parts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24, 25).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even though Criss screamed and yelled, Morgan does not recall him ever using any slurs or derogatory words against her. She believes, however, that Criss was trying to intimidate her to go against company policy and use defective parts. (PSOF \u00b6 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In January 2014, Morgan moved from subassembly to major assembly, where she was supervised by Don Cuozzo (\"Cuozzo\"). (DSOF \u00b6\u00b6 32, 34). Cuozzo believed Morgan was responsible for a missing part and required her to look for it. That turned out to be a misunderstanding because Criss had taken the part to a meeting with supervisors and the plant manager. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34, 36-38). Although Morgan was not present at the meeting, she claims Criss threw the part on the table and said he \"wanted something done about\" Morgan because the part was defective and she had approved it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-40). Later, Cuozzo took Morgan aside and told her that he had received a complaint about her from Criss, who \"wanted something done\" because Morgan had approved the defective part. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Criss's action prompted Morgan to contact Valerie Jordan-Taylor, a Human Resources Generalist for Triumph. At a meeting on January 16, 2014, Morgan told Jordan-Taylor \"everything that had happened\n   to that point,\" including that Criss was upset about Morgan approving a part, even though Morgan thought the part was good. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43). Morgan does not recall telling Jordan-Taylor that any slurs or offensive language had been used toward her by Criss, but wanted an apology from Criss, and an acknowledgment that he had acted unprofessionally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the meeting, Jordan-Taylor prepared a written summary that, in part, reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Karen stated to me that Chris Criss screamed at her; said that everyone time [sic] the department got a new inspector they \"had to go through this,\" that Karen was being too picky. Karen stated that she knew Chris Criss was mad when he approached her and she felt the environment around her was a little hostile. Karen stated that she is new to the program; she doesn't stamp off parts on her own yet; another inspector or her supervisor checks her work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Karen also felt that Chris Criss had complained about her to other employees. Someone told Karen that Criss had wrote an e-mail to Ron White complaining about her and Karen felt that if that was true, she wanted to know what the e-mail said because she doesn't appreciate Criss making slanderous comments about her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   I explained to Karen that I would talk with Chris Criss regarding his behavior. I also told Karen that if she had encounters of this type, she should inform the person that they needed to talk with her supervisor and then to just walk away from the situation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Jordan-Taylor also spoke to Criss, summarizing their conversations as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   I talked with Criss about the situation. He stated to me that they always have these problems with new inspectors. Criss felt like Karen should not have gotten the inspector job; that she wasn't qualified to do it. I explained to him that per the contract she was qualified to do the job and currently was in training. I asked Criss to be a little more conscious of his actions and words toward Karen and to give her the opportunity to learn the job. I also explained that if he had problems with her inspection of his parts he should take them up with Karen's supervisor until Karen has completed all her training.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48). She also summarized a conversation with Chris Ray (\"Ray), whom Morgan had identified as a witness:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   I talked with Chris Ray regarding Chris Criss' actions toward Karen Morgan. C. Ray commented that he felt Chris Criss handled the situation in the wrong way. Ray stated that Criss was mad because the earlier part had not been approved but the second part had. Ray stated everyone knows how Criss can talk and he could have approached Karen in a different way. Ray stated that Criss can sound like he was yelling when he is adamant about something. C. Ray felt like Karen was taking Criss words a little strongly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Jordan-Taylor claims that, after talking to the involved parties, her \"assessment was that Morgan was a new Inspector and Morgan did not understand everything about the position.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52). She claims to have told Criss to be more patient with Morgan, give her more direction, and show more understanding because Morgan was new to the job of Inspector. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Jordan-Taylor then followed-up with Morgan the following week and checked-in with her on a monthly basis thereafter to see if the problem was resolved. Morgan\n   reported no further problems with Criss. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Morgan's conversation with Jordan Taylor occurred around the time that Morgan moved from subassembly to major assembly. While working in the major assembly area on the C-130 line, Cuozzo mistakenly thought that Morgan had missed an inspection call. When discussing the supposed missed call with her, Cuozzo did not make any derogatory comments about women. He did, however, tell Morgan \"every morning\" thereafter not to miss calls, and laughed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55-56).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Also while working in Cuozzo's area, Randy Cox (\"Cox\"), the lead inspector on the C-130 told Morgan that he was \"burned out,\" and that he was tired of answering questions from new employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57). Cuozzo then told Morgan to direct her questions to him, instead of Cox. Although Morgan thought she was being singled out, she did not ask other inspectors whether they, too, had similarly been instructed to ask Cuozzo questions, instead of Cox. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In May 2014, Morgan was still on the C-130 line when Anthony Booker, a mechanic, told her to \"get off the jig\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   because she did not belong there. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61). Booker did not explain what he meant by her not belonging, but he stood in her way so that she could not walk down the stairs and off the jig.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Morgan reported the incident to Jordan-Taylor, who told Morgan that she would talk with Booker. Morgan admits that, after speaking with Jordan-Taylor, \"it was better,\" and admits that she has not had any further issues with Booker. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67-68).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   When Cuozzo was not at work, Randy Vaughter (\"Vaughter\") filled in as the supervisor. On June 5, 2014, he showed Morgan a picture of a panel with bolts missing that should not have been approved. Because Morgan was not the one who approved the panel, she replied, \"okay, I will keep an eye out on that so that it doesn't happen again.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71). Vaughter did not use any derogatory language or call Morgan names when he confronted her with the picture of the panel. Nevertheless, Morgan took exception to the comment because Vaughter was suggesting she had made a mistake, when, in fact, she had not. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 72-73).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   By June 2014, Morgan had transferred to the second shift, where she was supervised by Rick Angel (Angel\"). Morgan describe her working relationship with Angel as being \"great.\" (DSOF \u00b6 82). Whenever Morgan had a problem, she reported it to Angel who then took care of the matter. For example, on June 17, 2014, Morgan was asked to close out an order for a panel that was not part of her inspection area. When Morgan told Angel about the instruction, he told Morgan he would take care of it and for her to forward all of her emails to him so he could filter them. Morgan understood Angel's directive to be an effort to help her, and did not take issue with him asking her to forward the emails. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   While working the second shift, Morgan would sometimes find parts for her to tag\n   when she arrived at work. She did not have a problem with being asked to tag the parts, but she took exception when Cuozzo left parts in her chair and covered them with masking tape, believing this was hostile because \"it's not the way you do things.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89). He, and others, would also occasionally tape her table with masking tape, and Cuozzo would sometimes leave signs that read, \"do not touch.\" (PSOF \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Morgan also claims that Cuozzo treated her differently than male employees because he stood outside the restroom with his arms crossed when she took too long in the restroom, and would give her dirty looks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96). Morgan would also \"get talked to\" by Don Cuozzo for leaving her work area without permission, while male employees left for extended periods but were not questioned. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Morgan's primary issues, however, appear to be with Ray, a fellow Inspector. In her Statement of Facts, she quoted the following language from her deposition to demonstrate how Ray allegedly harassed her:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   He will stand at Randy Cox's desk, which I sit next to, and stare at my computer to see what I'm doing. And he used to do that on the C130. He would stand behind me. And I would turn around, and he would be looking at my computer screen to see what I was doing. And numerous people would tell me that he was watching me. And I said, why do you think that? And they said, Well, I've seen him behind some-the parts racking going like this and just trying to see where you are at. And he goes upstairs to the bathroom, and he looks down to see where you're at. And he-he watches me. He goes on my calls. I clock in on a job, and he-I guess-well, I could tell you the date was last Friday. I went on three calls. And he-the machines tell me, Chris Ray got it. So he goes on my calls. When I clock in on a call, he'll go over. He'll look at the job. By the time I get over there, they tell me-because his desk is farther down the line. And he's in position three, and I'm in position five way down there. So here I come. Oh, Chris Ray got it. He alters my tags when I'm present in the plant. He walks aggressively toward me. The mechanics-well, he'll tell my supervisor that I omitted soothing in MES and have my supervisor come to my desk and tell me. And when I complain about him micromanaging my tags and going on my calls, the supervisor said he is a mother hen. That's what he calls it. He's my-he's not my lead or my supervisor, so he shouldn't be scrutinizing my work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (PSOF \u00b6 9; Doc. No. 68-1, Pf. Depo. at 93-94). In short, Morgan believes that Ray is \"aggressive,\" and \"a problem...in every possible way.\" (DSOF \u00b6 44). He screamed obscenities at her across the hanger, threw things, slammed things down on her desk, sat at her desk, and moved things on her desk to agitate her. (PSOF \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Morgan also had a run-in with Ray in the parking lot at work. According to Derrell Bowden (\"Bowden\"), a Human Resources Generalist, Morgan called him from the parking lot, saying that she had been approached by Ray and wanted to be escorted into the building. (DSOF \u00b6 121). Bowden obliged and, according to him, Morgan stated that Ray said he wanted to apologize to her, but she did not want to have any contact with him and only wanted to deal with him on a professional level. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 122; Doc. No. 68-16, Bowden Depo. at 16-17). Bowden asserts that he then spoke with Ray who said he was trying to apologize. Bowden told Ray that Morgan\n   did not want an apology and wanted Ray to stay away from her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 123).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Morgan concedes that Ray was not just rude to her. She testified that he is \"constantly screaming on his phone,\" \"talks in the meeting in the morning about people not working or doing their jobs,\" and would use derogatory words when interacting with other people. (DSOF \u00b6\u00b6 73, 76). Morgan also claims that Ray sometimes said in reference to Angela Crissup (\"Crissup\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   another Inspector, \"that stupid bitch didn't do anything again last night.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78). Morgan \"believes\" Ray has referred to her as a \"stupid bitch,\" but he never did so to her face. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80). She also claims that she was also told by mechanics that Ray would walk around and tell them that Morgan did not do anything at night. Morgan further alleges she was once told by Mark Hale, a mechanic, that \"they\" were compiling a book of every mistake she had made, and that Ray was trying to find a way to get her terminated. (Doc. No. 68-1, Pf. Depo. at 106).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Other employees also expressed dislike for Ray. In December 2016, Cox, Noble, and two other employees met with Bowden to complain about Ray. Noble describe Ray as being \"rude,\" \"arrogant,\" \"loud,\" \"colorful,\" and full of himself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 125). Cox disliked working with Ray so much that he stepped down from his role as a supervisor so that he would not have to deal with him anymore. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 126). All four employees indicated that they did not like even being the same area with Ray because of his attitude and behavior. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 127).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   At some point in 2016, Ray was moved to the \"Airbus\" program, while Morgan remained working on the Gulfstream G650. These programs are 200 yards apart and in different parts of Triumph's plant. As a consequence. she and Mr. Ray no longer work in the vicinity of one another. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 129).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On the G650 line, Morgan is supervised by David Ellis (\"Ellis\"). She has characterized him as \"great\" and their relationship as \"fine\" because he treats her with respect and has never yelled at her or called her names. (DSOF \u00b6\u00b6 10-11, 113). Nevertheless, Morgan feels that Ellis retaliated against her because, after she claimed that Ray had put torque paint on a part that he did not witness torqued, Ellis printed off her clock-ins and inspection approvals for the day and reviewed them with her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 114-117).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Morgan still works at Triumph. During her employment, she was not demoted, nor did she miss a scheduled pay raise. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 101). She never received discipline in the form of a formal write-up. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102). Further, Morgan does not recall anyone at Triumph using words that were sexually demeaning towards her, nor does she recall\n   anyone telling her that they do not want women working for Triumph. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 105-106).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, according to Jordan-Taylor, almost half of the Inspectors that worked in Morgan's area on the C-130 were female. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 107).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Based on the foregoing, Morgan brings claims for sex discrimination and retaliation. She also contends that she was subjected to a hostile work environment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The standard of review for Motions for Summary Judgment has been aptly summarized by the Sixth Circuit as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Summary judgment should be rendered \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Unfortunately, these statement are unclear as to some of the operative dates and where Morgan was working when certain incidents occurred.

(PSOF \u00b6 7).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    It is unclear from the record when this occurred. According to the deposition testimony of Tammy Noble (\"Noble\"), another Inspector, the incident happened sometime around April 2016. Noble also testified that, around that same time, she overheard a telephone conversation between Ray and Cox in which Ray said that he was going to meet Morgan in the parking lot, and it \"isn't going to be good.\" (Doc. No. 68-17, Noble Depo. at 22). She also claims that Ray called Morgan a \"F-ing B\" during the phone call. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 24-26). While Morgan cites Noble's deposition for the proposition that Bowden was aware of the telephone conversation, Noble did not indicate when Bowden became aware of the call. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 24-25).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Crissup worked on the second shift. In her deposition, she testified that, during the 4\u00bd years she worked at Triumph she did not have an issue with Ray or feel that he was trying to intimidate her. She also testified that she never observed anyone being harassed or treated differently during her employment at Triumph.

No. 68-1, Pf. Depo. at 100), and her admission in response to Triumph's statement of facts that she \"does not recall anyone using words that are sexually demeaning towards her\" (DSOF \u00b6 105), Morgan claims in her own statement of facts that \"Ray has called Ms. Morgan 'bitch' and 'whore' directly to her,\" (PSOF 11). The sole support for this assertion, however, is not Morgan's own testimony, but Nobel's deposition testimony. Regardless, and despite Triumph's anti-discrimination policy, Nobel did not report these alleged statements to any supervisors, (Doc. No. 68-17, Noble Depo. at 17), nor did Morgan for that matter.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Morgan disputes this fact. However, the only basis for her dispute is Noble's statement in her deposition that she \"work[s] in a man's world,\" and that \"[w]omen are a minority.\" (Doc. No. 68-17, Noble Depo. at 14).

This argument neglects to consider Morgan's overriding contention that all of the males were treated better than she was. Regardless, to the extent Morgan cannot show that others were treated more favorably, this is more a function of the incorporeal nature of many of the employment actions about which she complains. It is one thing to be able to point to others who were not demoted, not transferred, not fired, or not docked pay. It is quite another to show that others were not subjected to seemingly disapproving facial expressions and body language.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Without citation to any authority, Morgan argues that \"Defendant's assertion of this defense in a motion for summary judgment is inappropriate\" because it \"is governed by a preponderance of the evidence standard.\" (Doc.
