(ECF No. 14.) The Court accepts as true the following facts from the Amended Complaint for the sole purpose of deciding Defendant's Renewed Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant hired Plaintiff to work as a school bus driver in 2001. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) In November, 2015, Defendant informed Plaintiff that, in accordance with a newly enacted state law, Plaintiff needed to undergo a background check to continue her employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The background check required that Plaintiff be fingerprinted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff is a devout Christian. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff informed Defendant that, according to her sincerely held religious beliefs, \"the Book of Revelation prohibits the 'mark of the devil,' which she believes includes fingerprinting, and that she will not get into Heaven if she submits to fingerprinting.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff asked Defendant for an accommodation, specifically, whether she could perform a different type of background check that did not require her to be fingerprinted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant informed Plaintiff that no accommodations were available, and terminated her for failing to comply with state law's fingerprinting requirement, effective December 31, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) However, Defendant allowed at least one employee with \"unreadable\" fingerprints to participate in an alternative background check for which fingerprinting was not required. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff asserts three claims: (1) religious discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (\"Title VII\") (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    at 3-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ); (2) retaliation, also in violation of Title VII (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5); and (3) a related claim under the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (\"PHRA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Additionally, Defendant avers that Plaintiff has not alleged that she failed to comply with an \"employment requirement,\" because the Pennsylvania's Child Protective Services Law (\"CPSL\"), not Defendant, imposed the requirement that Plaintiff undergo the background check that entailed fingerprinting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant further asserts that, even if Plaintiff did allege a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of religious discrimination, this Court should nonetheless grant its motion for judgment on the pleadings because Defendant could not accommodate Plaintiff without suffering an undue hardship. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.)

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 14 at 2.) Plaintiff informed Defendant of her sincerely held religious belief and was subsequently terminated for failing to comply with the fingerprinting requirement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff alleged facts that give rise to a plausible claim for religious discrimination.

Thus, more factual development is required before determining whether accommodating Plaintiff would have placed an undue burden on Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This Court also rejects Defendant's assertion that Plaintiff has failed to plead a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of religious discrimination because the fingerprinting requirement was imposed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and/or the FBI and, therefore, was not an \"employment requirement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 18 at 7-8.) Plaintiff satisfied her burden by alleging that Defendant informed her that she would need fingerprinting and subsequently terminated her employment after she requested an accommodation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 14 at 2.) Whether Defendant or some other entity made the decision to deny Plaintiff's request for accommodation cannot be determined\n   without additional factual information. Further, as a motion for judgment on the pleadings is analyzed under the same standard as a motion to dismiss, this Court \"must accept all of the allegations in the pleadings of the party against whom the motion is addressed as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Zimmerman,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264527\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/414/#p418\">\n    873 F.3d at 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, this Court is required to accept as true all plausible, well-pleaded allegations of the Complaint, regardless of Defendant's contrary version of the alleged facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Similarly, this Court is unpersuaded by Defendant's argument that if Plaintiff met her\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   burden to show religious discrimination, Defendant in turn satisfied its burden to prove undue hardship because Defendant could have been subject to criminal liability for violating the CPSL. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 18 at 8-13.) The cases that Defendant cites to support its argument that violating a statute constitutes an undue hardship are inapposite because they were decided later on in the litigation process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, this Court is required to accept all well-pleaded facts as true and view them in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p675\">\n    556 U.S. at 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p675\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Thompson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%2012903830\">\n    2012 WL 12903830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *1.

This Court must consider all of Plaintiff's well-pleaded facts as true. Plaintiff alleged that Defendant refused Plaintiff's request for an accommodation, while allowing an employee with \"unreadable\" fingerprints to undergo an alternative background check. Plaintiff has not alleged that anyone other than Defendant made the decision to deny her requested accommodation, nor that granting her request would have subjected Defendant to an undue hardship. While Defendant asserts in its Answer that it consulted various governmental entities in a good-faith attempt to accommodate Plaintiff and, through those inquiries, determined that granting Plaintiff's request for an accommodation would have subjected Defendant to an undue hardship, this Court must, at this stage, accept the facts in Plaintiff's Complaint as true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 18 at 10-13.) At this juncture, the Court must accept Plaintiff's version of the facts as true and draw all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff's favor.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Defendant concedes this for the sole purposes of the pending motion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
