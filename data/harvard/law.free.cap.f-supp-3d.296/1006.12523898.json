She also asserts claims for battery and loss of society and companionship against the officers under Wisconsin's wrongful death statute. The City of Neenah, which is statutorily required to indemnify officers for liability arising out of acts performed in the course of their employment, is also named as a defendant. The Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiff's \u00a7 1983 claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The case is before the Court on Defendants' motion for summary judgment.

For the reasons set forth, Defendants' motion will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises out of the tragic consequences of a horrendous crime committed by Brian Flatoff on December 5, 2015. At approximately 8:35 a.m. on that day, Brian Flatoff entered Eagle Nation Cycles, a motorcycle shop located at 206 Main Street in the City of Neenah, Wisconsin, with a loaded MAC-10 machine pistol and took Michael Funk, Ryan Moderson, Ethan Moderson, and Michael Petersen hostage. Pl.'s Proposed Findings of Fact (PPFOF) \u00b6 1, ECF No. 32. Flatoff instructed Ryan Moderson to call Vance Dalton, with whom Flatoff had a dispute, and tell him to come to the motorcycle shop immediately. After placing the call, Moderson kept the telephone line with Dalton open, and Dalton relayed information about the situation to local authorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At approximately 8:56 a.m., Winnebago County Dispatch notified the NPD about a weapons call at Eagle Nation and reported that a shot had been fired. Defs.' Proposed Findings of Fact (DPFOF) \u00b6 1, ECF No. 24. The NPD alerted officers to the hostage situation and directed them to proceed to the scene. The responding officers included Lieutenant Shawn O'Bre; Officer Jonathan Kuffel, the NPD SWAT team leader; Officer Craig Hoffer, the assistant SWAT team leader; Officer Robert Ross; and Sergeant Angela Eichmann. Officers from the nearby City of Menasha Police Department also responded. PPFOF \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   While en route to the scene, Lieutenant O'Bre learned there was a man inside Eagle Nation with a weapon and that he had several hostages. Beginning at 8:58 a.m., Officer Ross and other officers listening to the Main Channel dispatch learned that there were three possible hostages in the shop, that the hostage taker had a MAC-10 or MOC-10, and that the suspect was a white male with long hair and a beard, wearing a plaid jacket. DPFOF \u00b6\u00b6 8 12. The officers did not receive physical descriptions of any of the hostages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    \u00b6 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Upon arrival at Eagle Nation, Lieutenant O'Bre advised area units to set up a perimeter around the shop. Shortly thereafter, dispatch informed the officers that an individual who was believed to be the shooter left the shop in a truck. Sergeant Eichmann and Officer Ross stopped the vehicle and identified the driver as Ethan Moderson, who left the shop undetected by Flatoff. Moderson confirmed that there was still a man in the shop with a gun. After the officers released Moderson, Lieutenant O'Bre asked Sergeant Eichmann to manage the perimeter and O'Bre began forming a \"Hasty Team\" consisting of Kuffel, O'Bre, Ross, Hoffer, and Lieutenant Tyrone Thompson to enter the shop\n   if necessary.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    \u00b6 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Officer Kuffel eventually took command of the Hasty Team.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At approximately 9:21 a.m., the officers learned that Flatoff had threatened to start shooting if Dalton did not show up to Eagle Nation within five minutes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    \u00b6 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Approximately 18 minutes later, at 9:39 a.m., dispatch reported that Flatoff was threatening to kill everyone if Dalton did not arrive in the next minute or so.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    \u00b6 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on these facts, Officer Kuffel concluded it was necessary to forcibly enter the shop and prevent Flatoff from killing or seriously harming the hostages. At around 9:40 a.m. he began \"stacking\" the team into formation to enter Eagle Nation through the rear door from the alley on the south side of the building.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    \u00b6 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He stacked the officers in the following order: Lieutenant Thompson with a shield as number one, Lieutenant O'Bre as the driver as number two, Officer Hoffer as number three, Lieutenant Kuffel as number four, and Officer Ross as number five. Officer Heiting trailed the team with a ram in case he needed to force the door open.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A dashboard camera on a squad car parked at the west end of the alley facing in an easterly direction (Squad 1 video) captured the outdoor events that occurred next. ECF No. 25-2. The Hasty Team entered the shop at 9:42:07 a.m. PPFOF \u00b6 31. Motorcycles and other items were scattered around the rear shop area, limiting the team's ingress. Shortly after the team entered the shop, Lieutenant Thompson and Lieutenant O'Bre fell down a set of stairs just inside the doorway. Upon entry, the officers called out in a loud voice: \"Police,\" \"get down,\" \"get down on the ground right now,\" and \"let me see your hands.\" DPFOF \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the time the Hasty Team entered Eagle Nation, Funk was seated at a desk facing the rear entrance and Flatoff stood close to Funk. Funk dropped to the floor face down and Flatoff crawled behind Funk and began shooting at the Hasty Team. A bullet struck Officer Hoffer's helmet above his right eye around 9:42:14 a.m. PPFOF \u00b6 34. Six seconds later, a bullet struck a fire extinguisher, releasing powder into the air and obscuring the officers' view. The Hasty Team initially returned fire but then quickly withdrew from the shop at approximately 9:43:02 a.m.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    \u00b6 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Once outside, the Hasty Team shouted into the shop, which was met with more gunfire. DPFOF \u00b6 52. Officers Kuffel and Hoffer thought at the time that there were no hostages inside Eagle Nation and instead believed the officers had walked into an ambush.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    \u00b6 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In any event, Lieutenant O'Bre, Lieutenant Thompson, and Officer Kuffel retreated to Gord's Bar parking lot on the same side of the alley and to the west of Eagle Nation's rear entrance. Officers Hoffer and Ross joined Sergeant Eichmann and two Menasha Police Department officers and retreated to the east side of Vicky's Beauty Salon across the alley and to the east of the motorcycle shop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At approximately 9:45 a.m., Flatoff instructed Funk to close the shop's rear door, which the Hasty Team had left open, and warned Funk he would shoot him if he tried to escape. PPFOF \u00b6 61. Funk proceeded to the door, started to close it, but then dove out of the shop onto the ground outside.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    \u00b6 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As he did so, Flatoff fired in his direction. Once outside the shop, Funk scrambled behind a truck parked directly behind the shop in an apparent attempt to take cover from Flatoff in the event he followed him out the door. From his position behind the truck and facing the door to the shop he had just exited, Funk drew his silver-colored handgun from his waistband holster and held it in\n   both hands in a lowered position.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 65, 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the meantime, upon hearing the shots Flatoff had fired at Funk when he dove out the door, Officers Hoffer and Ross moved back toward the alley and joined City of Menasha Police Officer Raymond Berna, who was stationed at the southeast corner of Vicky's Beauty Salon, where they could see the rear door of the motorcycle shop.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    \u00b6 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By the time Officers Hoffer and Ross arrived at that position, Funk had already exited the shop and had drawn his pistol. DPFOF \u00b6 88. As Funk turned in a counter-clockwise direction and began running away from the truck and across the alley at 9:45:38 a.m., Officers Hoffer and Ross fired at him, striking him first in the left hip and leg, and then continuing to strike him as he fell to the ground. PPFOF \u00b6 78. Over a five-second period, Officer Hoffer fired eight shots, striking Funk twice, and Officer Ross fired eleven shots, hitting Funk with five.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    \u00b6 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   From the time Funk exited Eagle Nation until he was shot, neither Officer Hoffer, Officer Ross, nor any other police officer gave him a warning or any sort of instruction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    \u00b6 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Officer Hoffer told Wisconsin Department of Justice investigators shortly after the incident that he thought he ordered Funk to show his hands, but he later conceded he did not do so.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    \u00b6 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Officer Ross did not believe it was feasible to issue a warning to Funk between the time he first saw Funk with the gun in his hand and the time Funk began turning toward the officers. DPFOF \u00b6 74. The only statement directed by the police to Funk after he entered the alley was given fourteen seconds after the officers finished shooting and Funk had stopped moving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After Funk was down in the alley, Officer Hoffer and Sergeant Eichmann discussed whether an officer should retrieve Funk to provide medical attention. Officer Hoffer instructed the officers to leave Funk because \"he could care less right now if he sits there and dies.\" PPFOF \u00b6 97. Officer Hoffer contends he chose not to retrieve Funk because the officers did not have proper equipment and cover if Funk was lying on the ground merely waiting for an opportunity to shoot at them. DPFOF \u00b6 79.

Under the circumstances facing him, the court concluded that Officer Kibler's mistaken belief that Milstead was in fact the perpetrator, rather than the victim, and that deadly force was justified was not unreasonable. Officer Kibler already knew that a female had been stabbed, Milstead had been shot in the neck, Ramey was armed and had apparently shot his fellow officer and threatened to kill all of the responding officers. Under these circumstances, it was reasonable to believe that the person crashing through the door was Ramey intent on carrying out his threat. Though Officer Kibler's mistake was tragic, the court observed that \"courts cannot second guess the split-second judgments of a police officer to use deadly force in a context of rapidly evolving circumstances, when inaction could threaten the safety of the officers or others.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11122428\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/243/157/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p395\">\n    490 U.S. at 396-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p395\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flynn v.

Ind. 2005) (granting summary judgment in favor of defendant officer who fatally shot innocent civilian he reasonably mistook for suspect).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The same reasoning applies here. Only three to four minutes earlier, police had been met with a barrage of gunfire as they attempted to rescue the hostages that Flatoff had threatened to begin killing within minutes. Indeed, Officer Hoffer had been struck in his helmet by a bullet. Officers Hoffer and Ross retreated behind the east wall of Vicky's Beauty Solon and only returned to the alley when they heard more shooting. By the time they arrived at the corner and saw him, Funk was already outside with his gun in hand and began turning counter-clockwise in their direction as he moved across the alley. The last thing they expected was that one of the hostages whose life Flatoff had been threatening for the last hour would be armed. In the split-second of time they had to make a decision before Funk was either out of their view or completely turned toward them, Officers Hoffer and Ross fired. Their mistake was tragic, but it was not unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the claim by Officers Hoffer and Ross that they were justified in using deadly force against Funk is objectively unreasonable for several reasons. First, Plaintiff argues that the view\n   expressed by Officers Kuffel and Hoffer after the aborted attempt to enter the shop that it was not a hostage situation and was instead an ambush is unreasonable. Kuffel and Hoffer believed the situation was likely an ambush based upon several factors, including the number of obstacles in their path of entry, the people inside the shop seemed to be spread out with no one appearing distressed or responsive to police commands, most individuals were in positions of cover, and the amount of gunfire they encountered. Plaintiff notes that the ongoing report coming from the motorcycle shop was that Flatoff was the only hostage taker. She observes that the fact that Flatoff had a MAC-10 machine pistol capable of rapid, high volume fire explains the barrage of gunfire they were met with upon entry. Plaintiff also explains how Funk's actions during the aborted entry attempt were consistent with his hostage status. Pl.'s Mem. in Opp. at 15, ECF No. 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The fact that there may also exist innocent explanations for the observations of Officers Kuffel and Hoffer, however, does not make their suspicions unreasonable. It is not unreasonable to think that, if a lone gunman is holding a group of people as hostages, he would keep them close together. Nor is it unreasonable to think that people who had been held at gunpoint by a person who had made several threats to kill them over the last hour would appear anxious and distressed. We now know, of course, that the fusillade of gunfire that met them was caused by Flatoff's MAC-10, but in the heat of the moment and based on their experience, it seemed to Kuffel and Hoffer like more than one person was firing at them. Finally and more importantly, regardless of what Officer Hoffer may have thought about the hostages at the time he entered the shop, it was Funk's possession of a gun upon exiting the shop so soon after Hoffer and the other officers had been fired on that led Hoffer and Ross to conclude that Funk could not have been a hostage and was a threat to the safety of the officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff also criticizes Officers Hoffer and Ross for failing to comply with police standards. For example, Plaintiff cites the \"Priorities of Life\" standard under which the lives of innocent hostages are to be given priority above those of police officers in responding to hostage situations. Plaintiff notes that \"it is standard police practice in hostage situations to operate on the assumption that any individual involved in such a situation is innocent until reliable evidence shows that he is a suspect.\" Pl.'s Mem. in Opp. at 17. Plaintiff offers the reports of several experts to the effect that Officers Hoffer and Ross violated this and other standards in assuming that Funk was a threat and in using deadly force without first warning him to drop his gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The standards cited by Plaintiff provide little guidance in this particular situation, however. What is \"reliable evidence\" that a person is a suspect? Most of the standards cited do not speak to the specific situation where the potential suspect is armed. Under the circumstances in which they found themselves, Officers Hoffer and Ross obviously thought the fact that Funk had just come out of the shop where minutes earlier police had been met with a barrage of gunfire, and was turning in a counter-clockwise motion in their direction with a gun in his hand was \"reliable evidence\" that he posed an imminent and deadly threat. Are they required to wait for more evidence in the form of the suspect completing his turn and firing at them before they are justified in using deadly force? If so, no federal court has yet to say so, which raises the question of good faith immunity discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   For present purposes, it is enough to note that whether Officers Hoffer and Ross complied with police standards is not the issue. Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    Thompson v. City of Chicago\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit said that such standards are irrelevant: \"What's more, this court has consistently held that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   protects plaintiffs from constitutional violations, not violations of state laws or, in this case, departmental regulations and police practices....

Although Funk was already outside of the shop and had his gun in hand by that time, Plaintiff argues that a reasonable jury could rationally conclude that the officers were not entitled to use deadly force. \"Given the standard police practice of using deadly force only as a last resort, (PPFF 91), and the fact that [Funk] never pointed his pistol at Hoffer and Ross (or any other officer) and did not run toward them, (PPFF 63-77), the jury could conclude that a reasonable officer, viewing [Funk's] actions during that span of three to four seconds, (PPFF 73-78), would have concluded that he or she did not have enough information to support use of deadly force and should refrain from using it.\" Pl.'s Mem. in Opp. at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Having arrived at the tragically mistaken but reasonable conclusion that Funk was Flatoff or someone acting in concert with him, however, the officers needed to act quickly to prevent him from escaping or causing serious injury or death to others. In their view, he had already made clear that he was willing to use deadly force against police only minutes earlier when he fired on them repeatedly as they attempted to rescue the hostages that were being held in the shop. Despite this understanding, Officer Hoffer initially thought that he had first ordered Funk to show his hands before he fired. Officer Ross, on the other hand, thought any warning at the time was not feasible. In the view of Officers Hoffer and Ross, waiting longer would have put at risk their lives or the lives of others. Though they turned out to be wrong, in fact tragically wrong, their mistake was reasonable under the circumstances they confronted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the fact that neither Menasha Police Officer Berna nor Sergeant Eichmann fired their weapons supports her argument that the use of deadly force was not justified. Both testified by deposition, however, that they were not in a position to shoot. Officer Berna was holding a shield and would have been in Officer Hoffer's way had he stood up. Berna Dep. 50:25 51:5, ECF No. 34-7. And Sergeant Eichmann testified that she lost sight of Funk when Ross arrived at her location. Eichmann Dep. 66:14 16, ECF No. 34-6. But even if they had elected not to shoot out of caution, it does not follow that Officers\n   Hoffer and Ross were unreasonable in concluding immediate action was necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This was not a case where police were confronted with a suicidal drunk seated in a lawn chair in his garage with a shotgun lying across his lap who voiced no threat to anyone but himself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weinmann v. McClone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228333\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/444/#p447\">\n    787 F.3d 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 447 (7th Cir. 2015). In this case, police were confronting a dangerous hostage crisis in which they had just been met with a barrage of gunfire only moments before Funk emerged from the same location with, by the time Officers Hoffer and Ross saw him, his gun at the ready. In hindsight, we now know that Officers Hoffer and Ross were mistaken and that Funk was not the gunman who had shot at police. But as the courts have repeatedly emphasized, and as fairness demands, excessive force claims are not judged with the benefit of hindsight. Law enforcement officers are expected to act reasonably, not infallibly. Based on their mistaken but reasonable understanding of the circumstances they were facing, I conclude that the force used by Officers Hoffer and Ross was reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. For completeness, however, I will also address Defendants' argument that they are entitled to good faith immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The Court went on to say:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   The panel majority [of the court of appeals] misunderstood the \"clearly established\" analysis: It failed to identify a\n   case where an officer acting under similar circumstances as Officer White was held to have violated the Fourth Amendment. Instead, the majority relied on\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Garner\n   </em>\n   , and their Court of Appeals progeny, which as noted above lay out excessive-force principles at only a general level. Of course, general statements of the law are not inherently incapable of giving fair and clear warning to officers, but in the light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness must be apparent. For that reason, we have held that\n   <em>\n    Garner\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   do not by themselves create clearly established law outside an obvious case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   This is not a case where it is obvious that there was such a violation of clearly established law under\n   <em>\n    Garner\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   . Of note, the majority did not conclude that White's conduct such as his failure to shout a warning constituted a run-of-the-mill Fourth Amendment violation. Indeed, it recognized that this case presents a unique set of facts and circumstances in light of White's late arrival on the scene. This alone should have been an important indication to the majority that White's conduct did not violate a \"clearly established\" right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=196%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20463\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal citations omitted).

Plaintiff relies on a collection of cases to demonstrate that the officers violated Funk's clearly established Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force. Although the cases relied upon by Plaintiff establish the contours of excessive force generally, none of these cases are factually similar to this case or define Funk's Fourth Amendment right with the specificity required by the Supreme Court. Stated differently, no controlling case law exists involving sufficiently similar circumstances that would have put Officers Hoffer and Ross on notice that what they did violated a clearly established right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiff points to\n   <em>\n    Tennessee v. Garner\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that the use of deadly force is permissible only when an officer could have held an objectively reasonable belief that the suspect posed an imminent threat to the officer or others, and in such a situation, deadly force may be used to \"prevent escape only if, where feasible, some warning has been given.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195205\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/1/#p11\">\n    471 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 11-12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195205\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/1/#p11\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195205\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/1/#p11\">\n    85 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985). This case, however, is insufficient to put the constitutional question in this case \"beyond debate.\" Again, the Supreme Court has chastised courts for relying on\n   <em>\n    Garner\n   </em>\n   to demonstrate that a defendant violated clearly established law because it only recites the basic principles of excessive force on a general level.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pauly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12608520\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/548/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further,\n   <em>\n    Garner\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable on the facts because, in that case, an officer shot an\n   <em>\n    unarmed\n   </em>\n   suspect who ignored orders to stop fleeing after breaking into an unoccupied house,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195205\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/1/#p11\">\n    471 U.S. at 3-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195205\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/1/#p11\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , whereas here, Funk was armed with a pistol and was leaving a shop where a shootout with police had occurred minutes earlier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiff cites two additional cases where the victim of a police shooting was unarmed,\n   <em>\n    Wells v.

The court was concerned that the location of Baker's wounds indicated he was not facing the officer when he was shot, that Baker did not provoke Putnal or know that the officer approached the truck, and that the officer did not say anything to Baker before he turned to the officer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"871\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/75/190/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Weinmann v.

His wife called the police, and Deputy McClone responded to the call. Upon arrival, Deputy McClone peered into the garage through two garage windows but did not see Weinmann. He knocked on the door to the garage, but did not receive a response. Deputy McClone made no attempt to speak with Weinmann through the door and instead decided to make an unannounced entry into the garage by kicking the door in. The parties disputed what occurred next. According to Weinmann, whose version was presumed true at that stage of the proceedings, he sat in a lawn chair with the shotgun across his lap and rested his arms on the armrests or held just above them.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228333\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/444/#p447\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228333\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/444/#p447\">\n    at 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Upon entry, Deputy McClone opened fire on Weinmann, hitting him four times.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228333\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/444/#p447\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court concluded it was objectively unreasonable for Deputy McClone to believe he was in imminent danger and that \"[k]icking down a door and immediately shooting a suicidal person who is neither resisting arrest nor threatening anyone save himself is an excessive use of force.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228333\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/444/#p447\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228333\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/444/#p447\">\n    at 449, 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It held, in addition, that existing precedent clearly established that a suicidal person had a right to be free from the use of deadly force unless he threatened to harm others.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228333\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/444/#p447\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228333\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/444/#p447\">\n    at 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Again, these cases are factually distinguishable from the case at hand. Most importantly, the victims' conduct in Plaintiff's cases do not suggest that they posed a threat to the officers or the public at large. They made no sudden movements, made no threats to officers, and ignored no police commands. Importantly, in these cases, the officers did not identify themselves as law enforcement before they opened fire they did not warn the victims that officers would use deadly force or give them an opportunity to surrender, even though the victims posed no present threat of danger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   By contrast, Officers Hoffer and Ross in the instant case were confronted with an active hostage situation. Although they were told there were at least three hostages in Eagle Nation, they did not get any information about the hostages' identities or a description of their appearances. The gunman inside the shop had already threatened to kill the hostages if Dalton did not show up, which clearly was not going to occur. Police were told that the suspect was armed with a gun, and the responding officers and had already been fired upon by what they believed to be more than one person. When Funk appeared outside moments later after additional gunfire was heard coming from the shop, armed with a pistol and looking around in a manner suggesting that he was looking for a target, police reasonably concluded he was the person, or one of the persons, who had shot at them earlier and was likely to do so again. In short, the facts in this case are substantially different from those in Plaintiff's collection of cases. Plaintiff's cases are \"inherently incapable of giving fair and clear warning\" to Officers\n   Hoffer and Ross that they violated a clearly established right.\n   <em>\n    Pauly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12608520\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/548/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
