Defendant, PPG Kansai Automotive Finishes U.S., LLC, is a joint venture between PPG Industries and Kansai Paint of Japan. According to the Complaint, the Plaintiff develops chemical technologies \"to replace traditional tools that have negative environmental impact.\" Specifically, it develops \"detackifiers,\" which are agents used to remove the \"stickiness from among other things, paint and flocculant polymers to aid in automotive paint booth operations.\" [Dkt. #1]. The Plaintiff has alleged that the Defendants misappropriated its complicated Trade Secret for use in the Defendant's business-a charge the Defendants have denied. [Dkt. # 26].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties have essentially agreed on a Protective Order to govern future proceedings in this case. They cannot, however, agree on whether Ms. Anne M. Foulkes, one of PPG's in-house counsel, should have access to the Plaintiff's claimed Trade Secret. Ms. Foulkes, a twenty two-year-veteran with PPG, is, among other things, its corporate Secretary, who, its counsel conceded at oral argument, attends meetings of the Board of Directors in an \"advisory capacity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Foulkes says she has \"commercial legal responsibilities for the\n   <em>\n    majority\n   </em>\n   of PPG's business units,\"-and they are many-but not, she says, \"the business unit at issue in this litigation (PPG's Automotive OEM Coatings business).\" [Dkt. # 37-1-C, \u00b63-4]. (Emphasis supplied)(parenthesis in original). Nor, she says, does she have legal responsibility for PPG's Architectural Coatings Business unit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20Cow.%204346\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   She\n   does not explain even generally what \"commercial legal responsibilities\" means or of what it consists, or with whom she interacts with regularity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Despite the breadth of Ms. Foulke's approved, virtually unlimited participation in this case, and the eminent skill and experience of their retained counsel, Reed Smith-which has some 1,700 plus lawyers in offices around the world-the Defendants insist in their brief that unless she has access to the Plaintiff's Trade Secret information, they cannot litigate the present case \"efficiently and effectively.\" We take this otherwise unelaborated and unexplained assertion with a grain of salt since \"[l]awyers' talk is no substitute for data.\"\n   <em>\n    Phillips v.

Sysco Corp.\n   </em>\n   , it was shown that in-house counsel was present when pricing, purchasing, and marketing issues were discussed at Executive Team meetings, even though in-house counsel did not have decision making authority.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290555\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/83/1/#p3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That was enough.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whole Foods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%202059741\">\n    2007 WL 2059741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In this case, the\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   does not support the\n   <em>\n    conclusions\n   </em>\n   advanced in the Defendants' brief. The only\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   submitted by the Defendants consists of Ms. Foulke's carefully crafted, terse, 12-line Declaration. [Dkt. # 37, Ex. 1C]. In it, Ms. Foulkes, PPG's Associate General Counsel, states that she is a member of the Bar of Pennsylvania and Vice President, Associate General Counsel and Secretary of PPG. She does not explicitly say that she attends Board meetings, although in her role as Secretary it would be fair to assume that she does. We learned at oral argument in response to questioning that she attends Board meetings in an \"advisory capacity.\" The phrase was unexplained, but obviously Ms. Foulkes would appear to be more than a mere scrivener. In her Declaration, she does not claim to have any scientific training-an inference that we confirmed through questioning at the oral argument-and that would seem to affect her ability to be of real assistance to retained counsel, who will have the resources of PPG at their disposal, as well as the services of skilled experts of PPG's own choosing. While Ms. Foulkes says in her Declaration that she \"oversee[s] PPG's corporate governance and corporate finance functions,\" she does not explain what these functions entail. She does state\n   that she \"manage[s] intellectual property litigation,\" which is precisely what this case involves. [Dkt. # 37-1 at \u00b62].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   She has, as she phrases it in her Declaration, \"\n   <em>\n    commercial legal responsibilities\n   </em>\n   for the\n   <em>\n    majority\n   </em>\n   of PPG's business units, but not [she says] the business unit at issue in this litigation (PPG's Automotive OEM Coatings business).\"(Emphasis supplied)(Parenthesis in original). What relationship, if any, PPG's Automotive OEM Coatings business has with the numerous other PPG business units-the \"majority\" of which she admits she has \"legal responsibility\" for-she does not say. Nor does she explain what her duties actually entail except in the most general and laconic and uninformative of ways. She does not explain whether her legal responsibilities for the \"majority of PPG's business units\" brings her into contact with or involves in any way PPG's Automotive OEM Coatings business, or with those at PPG who are involved in competitive decision-making. She does concede that she is the Corporate Secretary from which one may correctly infer that she has contact with the Board of Directors-an inference confirmed during oral argument. But one is left with the disturbing sense that Ms. Foulkes' exceedingly short and carefully drafted Declaration was designed with a view toward stating what was thought to be the bare minimum that had to be disclosed. While the Declaration is not without some value, it does not go nearly far enough to resolve the issue in this case in favor of PPG. And of course, its representations are subject to being contradicted by other evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Although in-house counsel serve as legal advocates and advisors for their client, their continued employment often intimately involves them in the management and operation of the corporation of which they are a part.\"\n   <em>\n    Exxon Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"627144,5686548\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/636/1336/\">\n    636 F.2d at 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Cal. 2014).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Certainly, not having responsibility for PPG's Automotive OEM Coatings business does not mean Ms. Foulkes has no involvement or interaction of significance with it or PPG's Architectural Coatings business units (which she also mentions) their personnel. If she didn't,\n   presumably she would have said so. But, as courts have routinely held, interaction or involvement may heighten or magnify the risk of inadvertent disclosure. Similarly, there is a world of difference between the making of \"decisions\" relating to pricing, sales, marketing, design or development for PPG's Automotive OEM Coatings or Architectural Coatings business units [Dkt. #137-1 at 5] and involvement with the operation or personnel of those units, such as the giving of advice or recommendations. The risk of inadvertent disclosure is not reasonably foreclosed, then, by the absence of actual decision-making, which is almost never a function of in-house counsel like Ms. Foulkes. In short, that Ms. Foulkes says she has no \"legal responsibility\" for PPG's Automotive OEM Coatings business unit or PPG's Architectural Coatings business unit, is not decisive. [Dkt. # 37-1 at \u00b64].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The brevity of and lack of detail in Ms. Foulkes' Declaration, coupled with the absence of any other evidence from the Defendants, strongly suggest, if not necessitate, further inquiry. PPG's own website contains various PPG Press Releases, one of which states that Ms. Foulkes will \"continue in her role as corporate secretary...providing\n   <em>\n    direction and support to senior management and PPG's board of directors\n   </em>\n   on matters such as corporate governance and securities laws.\" What is significant is Ms. Foulkes' involvement and ongoing interaction with senior management of PPG and her continued attendance at Board meetings in an \"advisory capacity\" and as the Corporate Secretary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The website also noted that Ms. Foulkes will provide \"\n   <em>\n    legal support\n   </em>\n   for many of PPG's businesses in areas\n   <em>\n    including\n   </em>\n   commercial,\n   <em>\n    litigation\n   </em>\n   , transaction and\n   <em>\n    intellectual property\n   </em>\n   matters.\" (Emphasis supplied). The very things involved in this case. The Release also states that Ms. Foulkes has managed legal support for South America and acted as Secretary to the Global Ethics and Compliance Committee. http://investor.ppg.com/press-releases /2016/02-22-2016 (last visited on 11/6/17)(Emphasis supplied). In short, PPG has made clear that Ms. Foulkes has had and will continue to have significant involvement with and substantial exposure to the leaders of the Corporation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Norbrook Labs.

Although Whole Foods did not specifically identify mergers and acquisitions as falling within the scope of competitive decision-making, the list of competitive activities identified in Whole Foods was meant to be illustrative and not exhaustive.

Ms. Foulkes will not in any way be prevented from imparting her personal knowledge of the coatings industry or PPG and its business operations or other related matters that might assist outside counsel. The only restriction on her is that she cannot have access to the Plaintiff's Trade Secret or other materials properly designated as Highly Confidential. To say that any restriction on Ms. Foulkes will affect her ability to advise her client not only has not been proven but, in any event, is the beginning and not the end of analysis. To repeat, here, as always, a balance must be struck between the potential for inadvertent disclosure and the need that in-house counsel have virtually unfettered freedom to the material she wants.\n   <em>\n    Brown Bag Software v.

The Management Team, which is not mentioned in Ms. Foulkes Declaration, is significant. It is shown on PPG's web site under the word \"Governance.\" Under that is listed PPG's \"Board of Directors\" and immediately below that is the \"Management Team.\" The latter is comprised of the leaders of approximately 26 business units of PPG as well as senior corporate officers in human resources, tax administration, corporation and government affairs, treasurer, corporate development, information technology, environmental, health and safety, and science and technology.

But this case is not one of those where the decision is not open to serious question. The cases cited by PPG do not lead to a different conclusion. For example,\n   <em>\n    Motorola, Inc. v. Lemko Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%202179170\">\n    2010 WL 2179170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Ill. 2010) stressed that the materials were \"quite dated\" and that consequently \"their disclosure...to a very small number of Motorola personnel...would [not] pose the sorts of risk about which defendants are concerned.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. Here, of course, the information could not be more current or sensitive or significant. Ms. Foulkes' lengthy and extensive role with PPG and her involved and continued interaction with so many of PPG's senior decision-makers, preclude the necessary assuredness that there may not be an inadvertent disclosure of the Plaintiff's claimed Trade Secret if it is revealed to her in discovery. Significantly, SilverSun is not arguing that Ms. Foulkes cannot be involved in the litigation, or that she cannot provide litigation strategy or have input into matters affecting the case. Its position is only that disclosure of SilverSun's most sensitive information to Ms. Foulkes is not necessary for the case to be properly prepared and tried, and that disclosure to her would create an unnecessary risk of inadvertent disclosure on a matter of profound significance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \"The human mind is too complex for us fully to understand and explain our actions, even to ourselves.\"\n   <em>\n    Budoff v.

The Law may be slow and its vision obscured, but the cases teach that it is not so infirm that it will ignore a meaningful risk of inadvertent disclosure in a setting such as that presented by this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Frank Brunckhorst Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    LLC v.
