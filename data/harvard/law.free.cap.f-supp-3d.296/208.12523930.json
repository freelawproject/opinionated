The Court denied Plaintiff's [407] Motion in its [433] Order and [434] Memorandum Opinion of January 19, 2018, and Plaintiff filed the present [440] Motion for Reconsideration on January 30, 2018.

While the Court could address the long timeline in detail, in the Court's view the reasons for delays in this case are irrelevant to the present issue. The fact of the matter is that more than eleven years elapsed between Plaintiff's filing of his [1] Complaint on April 12, 2006, and his efforts to add an IIED claim in his [407] Motion to Amend on July 18, 2017. More than eleven years also elapsed from the filing of his [12] Second Amended Complaint on June 14, 2006. Plaintiff had years to seek leave to introduce an IIED claim, which is a very specific claim for which at least a substantial part of the relevant facts occurred before the filing of this case, and all occurred long ago. By the very nature of a distress claim, Plaintiff would have been intimately aware of the facts that caused his alleged distress at the time that the distress was caused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Only briefly shall the Court address Plaintiff's comment that a stay contributed to the delay in this case. Mot. for Recons. at 1; Reply Mem. at 2. The Court must make clear that the stay was in place for less than five of the aforementioned eleven years (October 11, 2011-May 4, 2016); Plaintiff did not move to preserve his right to seek leave to amend and add the IIED claim; and it was Defendants, not Plaintiff, who ultimately sought to lift that stay. Nor did Plaintiff quickly seek to add an IIED claim once the stay was lifted. Rather, he sought leave on July 18, 2017, to amend his SAC on the eve of trial, then planned for October 2, 2017.

As discussed above, only parts of Counts Seven and Eight of that SAC remain viable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Only lately has Plaintiff raised the argument that he should be able to recover for alleged defamation and tortious interference with business relationships under the non-disparagement clause of the Severance Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Order, ECF No. 442, at 2 (describing January 31, 2018, pretrial conference). In his [440] Motion for Reconsideration, Plaintiff made no more than a passing reference to these claims.

Like the discussion above of Plaintiff's argument that the tort of IIED \"merged\" with his remaining breach of contract claims, these fresh claims go beyond the scope of the Court's decision to deny him leave to add an IIED claim to the SAC.

Yet, despite his own summary treatment of the latest incarnation of his defamation claim in his [440] Motion for Reconsideration, his [447] Reply supplies no support for suddenly reading defamation into his remaining non-disparagement claim based on breach of contract.

Perhaps Plaintiff could seek in the Court of Appeals to refine the District of Columbia's merger doctrine, but again, the Court's June 15, 2017 decision that the tort of IIED had not merged with his remaining breach of contract claims was not at issue in Plaintiff's [407] Motion to Amend, nor did the Court reconsider that decision in its [433] Order and [434] Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   With the benefit soon of a final judgment, Plaintiff (or Defendants) may take the entire case up on appeal. The interest in avoiding piecemeal litigation is at last so close to being vindicated.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's [440] Motion for Reconsideration of the Court's Substantive Order of January 19, 2018. The following allegations of breach of contract asserted in Counts Seven and Eight of Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint remain viable:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (1) Defendants' alleged failure to make a good faith effort to remove Plaintiff as guarantor of a lease for Judicial Watch's headquarters;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   (2) Defendants' failure to pay health insurance for Plaintiff's children;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   (3) Defendants' filing a motion to strike Plaintiff's appearance in a Florida litigation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   (4) Defendants' failure to provide Plaintiff with access to documents regarding a client; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   (5) Defendants' alleged disparagement of Plaintiff and misrepresentations of the reasons for his departure from the organization.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   An appropriate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    The Court's consideration has focused on the following documents:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n    \u2022 Pl.'s Mot. for Reconsideration of the Ct.'s Substantive Order of Jan. 19, 2018, ECF No. 440 (\"Pl.'s Mot.\").\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n    \u2022 Defs.' Opp'n to Pl.'s Mot. for Reconsideration [ECF 440] of the Ct.'s Substantive Order or [sic] Jan. 19, 2018, ECF No. 444 (\"Opp'n Mem.\");\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n    \u2022 Pl.'s Reply to Defs.' Opp'n to Pl.'s Mot. for Reconsideration of the Ct.'s Substantive Order or [sic] Jan. 19, 2018, ECF No. 447 (\"Reply Mem.\").\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    In the alternative, Plaintiff also makes \"a motion for reconsideration under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e).\" Mot. for Recons. at 19;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n     at 2\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (claiming that arguments for relief under Rules 54(b) and 59(e) are \"interchangeable\"). However, he does not furnish support for any argument that the Court's [433] Order and/or [434] Memorandum Opinion constitute a \"judgment\" subject to the kind of \"motion to alter or amend a judgment\" provided for under that rule.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 59(e) ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 54(a) (defining \"judgment\" as,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , \"any order\n    <em>\n     from which an appeal lies\n    </em>\n    \" (emphasis added) ). The implication of Rule 59(e)'s inclusion in Rule 59, entitled \"New Trial; Altering or Amending a Judgment,\" is that the judgment is final. In any event, the Court proceeds to consider whether Plaintiff is entitled to his request for the same relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Some lingering discovery and associated disputes dragged beyond the official May 15, 2008, termination of discovery but concluded later in 2008.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    For the same reason that Plaintiff cannot recover for alleged tortious interference with business relationships, he also cannot recover damages for alleged loss of reputation, which Plaintiff again appears to seek.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mot. for Recons. at 7. It was to determine whether Plaintiff could support such a reputation claim that the Court previously permitted Plaintiff to try to identify any documentation of damages among discovery produced in this case.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    June 15, 2017 Mem. Op. and Order at 2-3, 8-15. His inability to do so precludes him from pursuing damages on either claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
