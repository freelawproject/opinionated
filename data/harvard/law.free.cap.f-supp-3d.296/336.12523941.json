INTRODUCTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Janssen Biotech, Inc. (\"Janssen\") alleges that defendants Celltrion Healthcare, Co., Ltd. and Celltrion, Inc. (together, \"Celltrion\"), and Hospira, Inc. (\"Hospira\") have infringed\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%207%2C598%2C083\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 7,598,083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the \" '083 Patent\"). Defendants have moved to dismiss for lack of standing. They claim that Janssen lacks standing because it is not the sole owner of the '083 Patent and the other co-owners have not joined Janssen as plaintiffs as required by Section 262 of the Patent Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20262\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ethicon, Inc. v.

Cir. 1998). In particular, defendants allege that the inventors, in a series of employee secrecy agreements (the \"Agreements\"), assigned the rights to the '083 Patent to more than 200 other companies, including Johnson and Johnson (\"J &amp; J\") and its subsidiaries and affiliates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The court, however, finds that the Agreements assigned the patent rights to Janssen's predecessor Centocor, Inc. (\"Centocor\") alone. Therefore, Janssen is the sole owner of the '083 Patent and is not required to join any other party to maintain this action. Accordingly, the motion to dismiss is being denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   II. THE COMPLAINT AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Complaint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The facts as alleged in the complaint are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Janssen produces Remicade, a biologic medicine whose active ingredient is a monoclonal antibody called infliximab.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 38. Growing the cells that produce biologic medicines like infliximab requires a composition called \"cell culture media.\" Janssen alleges that it holds the '083 Patent. The patent claims a \"soluble composition suitable for producing a final volume of cell culture media,\" and lists 61 ingredients in varying concentrations. Compl. Ex. A.

Plaintiff alleges that Celltrion infringes the '083 Patent by employing HyClone to manufacture the media under Celltrion's direction and control, and by inducing HyClone to infringe the patent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 551, 101, 111. It alleges that Hospira is liable for Celltrion's actions as a joint venturer and induces\n   Celltrion to infringe the patent by ordering Inflectra from it, among other things.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 6, 2015, plaintiff initiated Civil Action No. 15-10698 (the \"2015 Action\") alleging, among other things, technical infringement of the '083 Patent under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 14, 2016, after obtaining more information in discovery, plaintiffs filed a second action alleging actual infringement of the '083 Patent under the Patent Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20271\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and (b). The cases were consolidated and scheduled for trial beginning on February 13, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At a January 18, 2017 scheduling conference, the parties requested that the court address certain legal issues concerning the appropriate measure of damages and plaintiffs' entitlement to a permanent injunction if defendants were found to have infringed the '083 Patent. The court subsequently ordered the parties to file memoranda addressing these issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In their memorandum, defendants argued for the first time that Janssen failed to join all co-owners of the '083 Patent in either action and, therefore, lacked standing. In particular, defendants argued that four of the inventors of the '083 Patent had, in their Agreements with Centocor, assigned their rights to the '083 Patent not only to Janssen's predecessor, Centocor, but also to Janssen's parent, J &amp; J, and all of J &amp; J's subsidiaries and affiliates (together, the \"J &amp; J Family\" of companies). As explained earlier, a plaintiff's failure to join all co-owners in an action for patent infringement requires dismissal without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ethicon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11879751\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/135/1456/#p1467\">\n    135 F.3d at 1467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On February 8, 2017, the court heard oral argument on the issue of standing and found that the Agreements, which did not clearly assign patent rights to Janssen's predecessor Centocor, raise serious questions concerning its jurisdiction. As the parties agreed, those questions required the postponement of trial to permit the filing of a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and limited additional discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On February 22, 2017, plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss the 2015 and 2016 Actions for lack of standing due to plaintiffs' alleged failure to join all co-owners of the '083 Patent. The parties conducted limited discovery in connection with that motion. On March 6, 2016, Janssen and J &amp; J entered into an agreement that states that Janssen is the sole owner of the '083 Patent, and that neither J &amp; J nor any of its operating companies ever owned any interest in the '083 patent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   C.A. No. 15-10698, Docket No. 521-7. Janssen filed that agreement on March 8, 2017 with its opposition to the motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11879751\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/135/1456/#p1467\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On June 30, 2017, before briefing concerning the motion to dismiss was complete, the parties agreed to the dismissal of all of the claims for infringement of the '083 Patent in the 2015 Action and the complete 2016 Action, each without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   C.A. No. 15-10698, Docket No. 582 at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On May 31, 2017, Janssen filed this case. Defendants again moved to dismiss, arguing that the court lacks jurisdiction unless Janssen joins each of the more than 200 members of the J &amp; J Family that defendants assert are co-owners of the '083 Patent. On October 13, 2017, the court heard oral argument on the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   III.

ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As indicated earlier, the Agreements assign patent rights, which include the rights to the '083 Patent, to \"the COMPANY,\" which is defined, in pertinent part, as (1) Centocor \"and\" (2) J &amp; J, \"and\" (3) \"any\" of the J &amp; J Family Companies, \"including any\" company in the J &amp; J Family which may employ the inventor in the future. Defendants argue that this language assigns the rights to the '083 Patent not just to Centocor, but to J &amp; J and the entire J &amp; J Family, which includes more than 200 companies. Janssen contends that, in the context of the assignment provision, \"the COMPANY\" means the entity that employed the inventor when he or she \"conceived or made\" the invention-in this case Centocor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The court finds that \"the express terms of the contract\" are ambiguous, and Janssen's interpretation is most consistent with \"the intent of the parties\" as discerned from the \"surrounding circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Manahawkin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034750\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/217/99/#p118\">\n    217 N.J. at 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034750\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/217/99/#p118\">\n    85 A.3d 947\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In particular, the \"the interpretation placed on the [assignment] provision by the... conduct\" of the inventors, Janssen, and the rest of the J &amp; J Family manifest their intent to assign the '083 Patent to Centocor, and therefore Janssen, alone.\n   <em>\n    Conway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3250029\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/187/259/#p268\">\n    187 N.J. at 268-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3250029\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/187/259/#p268\">\n    901 A.2d 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Agreements are poorly drafted and do not clearly identify the intended assignee of the rights at issue. The assignee, \"the COMPANY,\" is defined to include not only Centocor, but also J &amp; J and \"any\" of the J &amp; J Family Companies. \"Any\" may have at least two meanings. The parties agree that \"any\" sometimes means \"all\" or \"every.\" For example, \"Any attempt to flout the law will be punished,\" or \"You are required to produce any documents relating to the issue.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bryan A.

However, \"in a sentence implying that a selection or discretionary act will follow, it may mean 'one or more (unspecified things or people); whichever; whatever,\" to be specified later.\n   <em>\n    Garner\n   </em>\n   at 52;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    First Bank &amp; Trust v.

In the definition of \"the COMPANY,\" \"any\" J &amp; J Family Company could reasonably be construed to mean \"one or more\" such companies, to be specified further in another provision. Moreover, the assignment provision, which refers to \"inventions conceived or made by me during my employment with the COMPANY,\" implies that \"the COMPANY\" means the inventor's employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Even if \"any\" means \"one or more,\" \"the COMPANY\" is still defined as \"Janssen\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   J &amp; J\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   any [J &amp; J Family Company].\" Agreement at 1 (emphasis added). Interpreted literally, therefore, the term \"the COMPANY\" includes at least two entities-Janssen and J &amp; J. As defendants argue, \"if the drafter wanted \"COMPANY\" to mean only the employer or subsequent employers,\" and not to include J &amp; J, he \"could have easily done so in just those words...\" Defs' Memo, at 10 (citing\n   <em>\n    Assisted Living Assocs. of Moorestown, L.L.P. v.

The last sentence of the definition of \"the COMPANY\" defines \"affiliates\n   of the COMPANY\" to mean \"any corporation, entity or organization at least 50% owned by the COMPANY, by Johnson &amp; Johnson or by any subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson.\" Agreement at 1. This definition of \"affiliates\" suggests that \"the COMPANY\" does not include J &amp; J and its subsidiaries, or always include them. If \"the COMPANY\" included, or always included, J &amp; J and its subsidiaries, the clause could have easily ended at \"the COMPANY,\" to read \"any corporation, entity or organization at least 50% owned by the COMPANY.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Interpreting the \"the COMPANY\" to include J &amp; J and its subsidiaries would render the additional references to those entities redundant and violate the \"cardinal principle that each term of a contract should be given meaning so that no term is superfluous.\"\n   <em>\n    Dubrosky v.

However, in this case, the definition of affiliates does not remove any ambiguity. Rather, by including the reference to J &amp; J and its subsidiaries, the drafters did not use obvious alternative language that would have made the definition of \"the COMPANY\" more clear and consistent with defendants' interpretation of the contract.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Advocate Healthcare Network v.

Therefore, the reference to J &amp; J and its subsidiaries in the definition of \"affiliates\" creates ambiguity rather than resolving it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In addition, as indicated earlier, in the assignment provision, the employee agrees to assign to \"THE COMPANY\" any invention made by the employee \"during [his] employment with the COMPANY.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Agreement at 1.

Janssen customarily treats patent rights as being owned only by the inventor's employer, rather than by J &amp; J or the entire J &amp; J Family. Janssen's patent databases show that all of its patents are assigned either to Janssen alone or to Janssen and one other entity that was involved in the invention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dow Decl.

In addition, J &amp; J's lead employment counsel, Anne Martinson, revised J &amp; J's standard employment agreement in 2008, before this litigation began, to provide clearly that inventions are assigned only to the inventor's employer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Martinson Dep. at 154-155.

For example, in\n   <em>\n    Gabriel v. Jackson Life Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , this court found that an insurance company's consistent practice of \"overstating the premium payments necessary to keep coverage in force\" was a breach of contract and a violation of Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 93A.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201410406\">\n    2015 WL 1410406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1, 11, 18 (D. Mass. Mar. 26, 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In this case, however, the evidence demonstrates that both parties shared a common understanding. More specifically, the evidence regarding the inventors' intent shows that they, like Centocor and Janssen, understood the Agreements to have assigned patent rights, including the rights to the '083 Patent, to Centocor alone. First, the '083 Patent states that the assignee is \"Centocor, Inc.\" and does not include J &amp; J or other members of the J &amp; J Family. Compl. Ex. A. Second, as indicated earlier, the Agreements required the inventors \"to disclose promptly\" to \"the COMPANY all INVENTIONS conceived or made by me... during my employment with the COMPANY.\" Agreement at 51. The inventors of the '083 patent complied with this disclosure obligation by submitting an invention disclosure to Centocor alone in May 2004. Dow Decl. Ex. B. The disclosure is on Centocor letterhead, is addressed to Kenneth Dow in his capacity as \"V.P. Patent Law, Centocor,\" states that it is \"Centocor confidential information,\" and identifies the inventors as Centocor employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201410406\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Third, the Agreement also required that the employees \"execute any applications, assignments or other instruments which the COMPANY shall consider necessary to apply for and obtain Letters Patent.\" Agreement at \u00b6 3. The inventors executed several such assignments to Centocor or Janssen alone, and never to J &amp; J or any other company\n   in the J &amp; J Family. This indicates that they understood their obligations to be only to Centocor or Janssen. Dow Decl. Exs. C-H.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Finally, there is no evidence that the other members of the J &amp; J Family, which under defendants' interpretation would be intended beneficiaries of the Agreements as assignees, have ever asserted any rights to the '083 Patent or any invention conceived by the inventors. J &amp; J and companies in its Family were on notice that the '083 Patent stated that Centocor was the only assignee. According to Janssen's patent database this was consistent with the practice concerning inventions by employees of Centocor or Janssen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dow Decl. Ex. I. As explained earlier, J &amp; J recently entered into an agreement with Janssen stating that it \"has never asserted any ownership rights in the '083 patent... \" and that none of the J &amp; J Family of Companies \"has or will assert any ownership rights to the '083 patent. \"C.A. No. 15-10698, Docket No. 521-7. Defendants have not presented any evidence rebutting these assertions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As defendants argue, in at least eleven other cases, J &amp; J and/or other companies in the J &amp; J Family have interpreted \"the COMPANY,\" as used in the confidentiality and non-compete provisions of similar or identical agreements, to include J &amp; J and/or certain of its subsidiaries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.Appx A to Def. Memo (Docket No. 18-1); Fed.Appx C to Def. Supp. Br. (Docket No. 52-1). As indicated earlier, the confidentiality provision protects information \"disclosed to [the employee] as a result of [his] employment with the COMPANY, not generally known to the trade or industry in which the COMPANY is engaged, about the products, processes, technologies, machines, customers, clients, employees, services and strategies of the COMPANY\" disclosure of which it asserts \"will cause immediate irreparable injury to the COMPANY.\" Agreement at 1 &amp; \u00b6 5. In these cases, J &amp; J and/or J &amp; J Family companies in addition to the employer alleged that their confidential information was protected under these provisions and that they were entitled to enforce them. Fed.Appx A to Def. Memo (Docket No. 18-1); Fed.Appx C to Def. Supplemental Br. (Docket No. 52-1). The positions taken in these cases provide some support for defendants' assertion that \"the COMPANY\" as used in the Agreements means more than just Centocor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Defendants argue that because Janssen's parent company has adopted this interpretation of \"the COMPANY\" in one section of the contract, Janssen cannot claim that it has a different meaning in the assignment provision. The \"principle[ ] of statutory construction is that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning\" is \"equally applicable\" to a contract, \"particularly when the contract under consideration is [ ] clearly the product of careful lawyering on both sides.\"\n   <em>\n    Celanese Ltd. v. Essex Cty. Improvement Auth\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5736355\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/404/514/\">\n    404 N.J.Super. 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5736355\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/404/514/\">\n    962 A.2d 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 601 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2009). However, in this case there is no evidence that the inventors had counsel or that the Agreements were the result of careful lawyering. Rather, the court finds that they were poorly drafted. In any event, \"the presumption of consistent usage 'readily yields' to context, and a statutory [or contractual] term-even one defined in the statute [or contract]-may take on distinct characters from association with distinct statutory [or contractual] objects calling for different implementation strategies.\"\n   <em>\n    Util.

As explained earlier, the language of assignment provision and the extrinsic evidence persuades the court that, at least for the purposes of patent assignments, \"the COMPANY\" means only Centocor and its successor Janssen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Assuming, without finding, that \"the COMPANY\" should be given a single consistent meaning throughout the Agreement, the positions taken by J &amp; J and/or companies in its Family in the other cases do not compel the conclusion that the term refers to all of the companies in the J &amp; J Family. Those suits were brought by J&amp; J or J &amp; J subsidiaries other than Janssen. The positions of companies in the J &amp; J Family other than Janssen in other cases is not necessarily inconsistent with Janssen's position in this case. As indicated earlier, the other cases were brought to enforce provisions protecting \"CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION,\" or secret information \"disclosed to [the employee] as a result of [his] employment with the COMPANY... about the products, processes, technologies, machines, customers, clients, employees, services and strategies of the COMPANY.\" Agreement at 1. This definition can be reasonably interpreted to cover information that also belongs to J &amp; J Family companies in addition to the employer. Such information could include information about the employer's products that also belongs to a company in the J &amp; J Family company which jointly developed the product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Indeed, this was alleged to be the case in\n   <em>\n    DePuy Spine, Inc. and Johnson and Johnson Regenerative Therapies v. Stryker Biotech LLC and Joseph Ross\n   </em>\n   , Suffolk Super. Ct. C.A. No. 07-1464 (Docket No. 15-3 at 9-10). In\n   <em>\n    DePuy Spine\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs were two companies in the J &amp; J Family-DePuy Spine, which was the individual's employer, and another company, JJRT. It was alleged that \"DePuy Spine's product development work is performed by [plaintiff non-employer] JJRT,\" which \"works in partnership with the J &amp; J operating companies, performing the research and development work necessary to bring products through FDA or other required regulatory approval.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595510\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/337/#p343\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    DePuy Spine\n   </em>\n   cited the \"broad[ ]\" definition of \"CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\" to support their assertion that the Agreements protected information about products that DePuy and JJRT were jointly developing and strategies concerning those products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, 10-16. Therefore, the position of the other companies that the Agreements protect their confidential information, as well as the employer's, is not necessarily inconsistent with Janssen's position that \"the COMPANY\" means only the employer. In any event, the conduct of other companies concerning other cases is not evidence of Janssen's customary practice or intent concerning the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Finally, while defendants identified eleven cases in which a company in addition to the individual's employer brought suit, Janssen has presented unrebutted testimony that the vast majority of the suits seeking to enforce similar or identical employment agreements have been brought only on behalf of the individual's employer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Martinson Dep. at 354-55.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In view of the forgoing, the court finds that the contracting parties' subsequent actions resolve the ambiguity in the assignment of patents provision and, for the purposes of that provision, \"the COMPANY\" means Centocor alone. While this conclusion is in tension with the literal definition of \"the COMPANY,\" which refers to Centocor \"and\" J &amp; J, a \"[d]isproportionate emphasis upon a word or clause or a single provision does not serve the object of interpretation.\"\n   <em>\n    Borough of W.

In light of the extrinsic evidence that the inventors, Centocor, and J &amp; J each understood the ambiguous Agreements to assign patent rights solely to Centocor, the court finds that Janssen is the only owner of the '083 Patent.

In this case there is no evidence that Janssen, rather than J &amp; J or other companies in its Family, was \"responsible in fact\" for the positions taken by other companies in other cases.

In view of these facts and the fact that Janssen was not a party in the other cases, Janssen will not derive an unfair advantage if not estopped.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    RFF Family P'ship, LP v.

Burack\n   </em>\n   , 677 F.3d at 16 (1st Cir. 2012) (internal citations omitted). The court finds that even if it had discretion, the equities do not favor finding Janssen is estopped from asserting it is the sole owner of the '083 Patent. This case concerns the enforcement of patent rights that are evidently worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Patent rights encourage innovation and, therefore, serve an important public interest. It would not be equitable to estop Janssen from pursuing its patent claims because of any inconsistent positions taken by other companies in the J &amp; J Family in employment cases brought against different defendants and concerning contract provisions that are not at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The final issue raised by the parties relates to the March 6, 2017 agreement between J &amp; J and Janssen. As previously discussed, that agreement states that neither J &amp; J nor any company in the J &amp; J Family has ever had an ownership interest in the '083 Patent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   C.A. No. 15-10698 Docket No. 521-7. Janssen argues that this \"disclaimer\" provides an independent basis to find that it has standing as the sole owner of the '083 Patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   This issue is moot in view of the court's decisions that the Agreements assigned the '083 Patent to Centocor alone, and that Janssen is not estopped from advocating this conclusion. In the interest of completeness, however, the court finds Janssen's argument unmeritorious. The Federal Circuit has never held that co-owners of a patent are not required to be joined as plaintiffs if they disclaim their interest in the patent. Janssen relies primarily\n   on\n   <em>\n    IpVenture, Inc. v. Prostar Computer, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2919389\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/503/1324/#p1325\">\n    503 F.3d 1324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed. Cir. 2007).\n   <em>\n    IpVenture\n   </em>\n   involved the question of whether a contract was an assignment of a patent or an agreement to assign it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2919389\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/503/1324/#p1325\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2919389\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/503/1324/#p1325\">\n    at 1325-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Federal Circuit held that the contract was an agreement to assign.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2919389\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/503/1324/#p1325\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2919389\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/503/1324/#p1325\">\n    at 1327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court further found that this interpretation was \"reinforced\" by a statement made by the purported assignee that it never had any legal or equitable rights to the patent at issue.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2919389\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/503/1324/#p1325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the court in\n   <em>\n    IpVenture\n   </em>\n   essentially considered the disclaimer as extrinsic evidence supporting its interpretation of the agreement at issue.\n   <em>\n    IpVenture\n   </em>\n   does not provide an alternative basis for finding that Janssen has standing to bring this cases because the Agreements assigned the '083 Patent to its predecessor Centocor alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   VI. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In view of the foregoing, the court finds that the Agreements assigned the inventors' patent rights to Centocor only. Janssen, therefore, is the sole owner of the '083 Patent and has standing to bring this case. The doctrine of judicial estoppel does not alter this conclusion. While the court finds that the March 6, 2017 agreement between J &amp; J and Janssen does not provide a basis for finding that Janssen has standing, that issue is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In view of the forgoing, it is hereby ORDERED that defendants' Motion to Dismiss (Docket No. 13) is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    A party is liable for direct infringement under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20271\">\n     35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a) when it \"[a] acts through an agent (applying traditional agency principles) or [b] contracts with another\" to do the infringing act.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Akamai v.
