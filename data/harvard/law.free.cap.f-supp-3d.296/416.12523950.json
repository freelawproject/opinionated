(hereinafter \"CJP\"), at Docket No. 173. For the reasons set forth below, the plaintiffs' request for the issuance of a preliminary injunction is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This action was filed on June 30, 2016 by CHPR and Camarero in response to\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   actions taken by certain jockeys associations, to wit, CJP, Inc. and Asociacion de Jinetes de Puerto Rico, Inc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs alleges that the cancellation of the horse races scheduled for June 30, July 1 and July 2, 2016 due to certain jockeys' boycott and refusal to ride the horses in the scheduled races constitute a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 7, and the Clayton Act, as the jockeys\n   are not employees of the CHPR, an association of the owners of racing horses. The CJP alleges that they are a union, hence, the jockeys, as employees, can legally call a boycott to plaintiffs and refuse to ride the horses, to force a payment increase for their horse mounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The core of this matter is whether the CJP, which is an independent jockeys' association, may also be considered a labor union, and as such, have a right to call strikes to force plaintiffs\n   <strong>\n    to increase their horse mount fees\n   </strong>\n   . It is important to note that CJP are currently not employees of CHPR and/or Camarero.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notwithstanding, there are two additional issues pending: whether the jockeys may call a strike to force plaintiffs to increase their horse mount fees, and other economic considerations, such as protection of their image in commercial advertising of the Camarero Race Track.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The facts of this case are familiar to the Court, indeed this is not the first time that the jockeys have called a boycott against the scheduled races in an effort to force the San Juan Racing Association, Inc. to grant a payment increase.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    San Juan Racing Association, Inc. v.

Both CHPR and Camarero have vehemently opposed to the demands of the jockeys members of the CJP. The Court held several long and extensive hearings, and allowed CJP sufficient opportunity to present their evidence, however, the Court was not persuaded by the legal arguments nor the evidence presented by the CJP to engage in a \"concerted refusal to deal,\" as the Court granted a preliminary restraining order at Docket No. 46.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our analysis follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Preliminary Injunction Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court will revisit the\n   <em>\n    Second Amended Nunc Pro Tunc Opinion and Order Re: Temporary Restraining Order\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 46, which addresses all the facets pending before the Court. The Court will include the analysis and discussion included therein, as the legal analysis remain the same after having reviewed all the evidence presented and admitted during all the evidentiary hearings held, to allow CJP an opportunity to show the Court why the injunctive relief requested by plaintiffs was not warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs have requested a temporary injunctive relief under Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(b)(1)(A)(B), (b)(2) followed by a preliminary injunctive relief under Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(b)(3), including damages relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The First Circuit follows the quadripartite test, which the Court must examine and strictly comply:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (1) likelihood of prevailing in the merits;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (2) significant risk of irreparable harm;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (3) the balance of hardships weigh on the movant's favor; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (4) whether the injunction will harm the public or third parties by granting the remedy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    New Comm.

The critical factor is that the remuneration of the jockeys is \"compelled\" by state regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Further, the actions of \"concerted refusal to deal\" are unrelated to actions by the management of the racetrack nor the horse owners, but they are in fact related to the current regulation issued under the governmental authority of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico relating to the distribution of the prize money of each race.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    San Juan Racing Association, Inc. v.

They have the ability to choose the race they want to run, and the particular horse they aspire to run, and they may run a different horse from a different owner creating a conflict with the horse owner of the previous or later race.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jockeys also pay for all the equipment they may need.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Hence, the alleged \"concerted activity of refusal to deal\" constitutes a mirror image of the controversy as expressed by the court in\n   <em>\n    San Juan Racing Association, Inc. v.

In the instant case, the Horse Racing administrator was requested by the jockeys to terminate the steward who fined the jockeys for a work stoppage of two races, and also refused to accept the request of the jockeys to increase their racing fees and percentage per mount and per race. The matter is not a \"labor dispute\" but a \"dispute against the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,\" and the Horse Racing Board of Puerto Rico. Notwithstanding, plaintiff CHPR initially advised that they would lobby the request before the Horse Racing Board to be resolved within ninety days.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The jockeys, however, refused to wait. Hence, the \"concerted refusal to deal\" by the jockeys continued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court considers the instant case to be an almost exact replica of\n   <em>\n    San Juan Racing Association, Inc. v. Asociacion de Jinetes de Puerto Rico, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"822964\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/590/31/\">\n    590 F.2d 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as to the facts and the law, as it fails to constitute a \"labor dispute\" against the CHPR or Camarero, but directed to the persons who are operating and regulating the agency and the Horse Racing Board of Puerto Rico, since the government agency constitutes the exclusive power to increase the compensation of the jockeys, as far as compensation is concerned per race for the winners and/or minimum compensation per race.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The record shows that, on June 16, 2016, the AJPR through its attorney Jorge A. Toro-McCown (hereinafter \"Mr. Toro-McCown,\" the attorney for the Asociacion de Jinetes de Puerto Rico\") sent a letter to the Office of the Racing Jury Panel, and the Horse Racing Administrator regarding a conflict with certain jockeys and the delay in racing day number 117 of June 10, 2016, and warning the Horse Racing Administrator that the jockeys could exercise their constitutional right to participate in a strike.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 153, page 29.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' Exhibits 7 and 8 of July 19, 2016. Mr. Toro-McCown demanded that the conflict with the jockeys be resolved within 72 hours and declined the proposition made by Mr. Barrios, President of CHPR, to negotiate this matter within 90 days. \"On June 20, 2016, the Horse Racing Administrator replied to the letter sent by the AJPR and declined its request to act as a mediator.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"822964\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/590/31/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On June 21, 2016, the president of plaintiff CHPR sent a letter to the AJPR's attorney, \"informing him that a boycott by the jockeys constituted a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"822964\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/590/31/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Exhibits 7, 8, 9 of July 19, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   According to Stipulated Fact \"V\", \"on June 24, 2016, the jockeys engaged in an illegal concerted activity, refused to register for the horses they would ride for the races scheduled for June 30 and July 1, 2016, in effect boycotting the racetrack operations and prompting the racetrack to suspend the racing operations for those two days.\" \"The Administration for the Industry and Horse Racing Sports, an agency of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, issued a certification that evidenced that, for the inscriptions held that day, the inscription tickets [to race as jockeys] were presented without any jockeys.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 153, page 30. Furthermore, the record shows that \"the races scheduled for Thursday, June 30, 2016, Friday, July 1, 2016, and Saturday, July 2, 2016 at Camarero Racetrack were cancelled due to the Defendants' refusal to ride the horses.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stipulated Fact \"U\", and Docket No. 153, pages 30-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Thus, the controversy presented in the instant case is an identical controversy as in the case of\n   <em>\n    San Juan Racing Association, Inc. v. Asociacion de Jinetes de Puerto Rico, Inc., et al.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"822964\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/590/31/\">\n    590 F.2d 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , wherein then Chief District Judge Jose V. Toledo decided that an injunction for a \"concerted refusal to deal\" was warranted under the federal antitrust laws. The First Circuit pellucidly affirmed the district court by also clearly determining that the matter failed to constitute a \"labor dispute\" at\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"822964\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/590/31/\">\n    590 F.2d at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (At that time the First Circuit determined that the record was not extensive, but now the record is more abundant).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As to irreparable harm, the Court understands that Camarero and CHPR are\n   risking the permanent loss of a debilitating and dire market, as the fans of the racetrack may move to other types of sport activities or another types of gaming. Further, other gaming competitors may occupy the clients of CHPR, also individual horse owners with the racetrack closed will be unable to use the investments that they have in the horses nor effectively train the horses as the jockeys will be engaged in a \"concerted refusal to deal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The balance of equities between the parties favor the granting of the remedies under Fed.R.Civ.P. 65, as Camarero, the race track administrator, stands to potentially permanently lose market, which involves betting, and other gaming, as well as the horse owners stand to lose the use, and investment in their horses, as well as the potential race prize profits. Further, and also critical, is that there are only thirty-six defendant jockeys, at the time of filing of the\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   , and some may leave to other racetracks in other jurisdictions. However, the strike affects all the employers of the racetrack including those who provide: (a) maintenance to the racetrack; (b) those who are at the windows of the gaming; (c) the persons working for the food concessionaires: (d) the horse owners sub-contractors who hire grooms and other employees to safeguard, protect, feed and work with the horses; (e) the owners of the gaming agencies wherein betting is placed as to the \"pool\" of seven races, as well as individual races. Lastly, and most critical, the defendants' concerted refusal to deal constitutes a significant loss of revenue generated for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico from this sport.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The public interest unequivocally also favors the granting of the injunctive relief, as the government stands to lose all the future revenues of the income generated by the use of the racetrack, as well as the revenues lost due to the cancellation of certain racing days. The fact is that the loss of revenues will be lost for good, as the racetrack nor the horse owners will be able to recuperate financially from the loss triggered by the forced closing of the racetrack operations due to the jockeys \"concerted refusal to deal\" on certain racing days. Moreover, an extended boycott may cost the Government of Puerto Rico millions of dollars to an Island that is currently in the verge of bankruptcy. Further, although jockeys are free to ride at other racetracks in the United States or other countries, the Camarero Racetrack can only operate in Puerto Rico, and the horse owners cannot run in other racetracks as Camarero is the only racetrack in Puerto Rico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Finally, and above all, this type of boycott by the jockeys against the racetrack operations has already been entertained by the First Circuit in an extremely similar case, as to a prior racetrack operating then in Puerto Rico, and an identical scenario wherein the jockeys attempted to boycott the horse owners and the administrator of the racetrack\n   <em>\n    San Juan Racing Association, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"822964\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/590/31/\">\n    590 F.2d 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in a \"concerted effort to refuse to deal\" unless the jockeys' fees were increased. The First Circuit ruled that the injunctive relief was warranted, as the \"concerted refusal to deal\" was not a \"labor dispute,\" for the jockeys are independent contractors and lack an employment relationship with either the racetrack administrator and the horse owners. Furthermore, the increase in the amount of racing fees sought by the jockeys were then \"compelled by the state\" and currently are determined by the government's Horse Racing Board.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Columbia River Packers Assoc. v.

As stated above, plaintiffs herein, Camarero and CHPR, agreed to establish a fund to pay for certain benefits to the jockeys, such as, the payment of the health insurance plan; accident insurance plan; life insurance policy, and the policy of the Puerto Rico State Insurance Fund, which must be paid individually by all independent contractors, in exchange for the use of the image of a jockey or jockeys as \"accessory figures\" under Section 3151(g) the Act, and as an exception under Section 3157(a) and (d) of the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In a nutshell, this matter was settled in a business decision fashion that was convenient for both the plaintiffs and the jockeys, and at the time frame wherein the jockeys were considered independent contractors under the law, as the image law in Puerto Rico was not yet enacted. The Court emphasizes that the core of this case is not the use of the image, but the jockeys' request for an increase on the horse mount, which is a matter of exclusive jurisdiction\n   to the Puerto Rico Horse Racing Board, as thoroughly discusses above.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the preliminary injunction and the memorandum in support of preliminary injunction requested by CHPR filed at Docket No. 153, is granted. Camarero's Memorandum in Support of Preliminary Injunction filed at Docket No. 154, is noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    Defendants are, hence, enjoined permanently from engaging in any concerted refusal to deal, which may in any way affect any race or racing day\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Therefore, this case now moves to the damages stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The parties are granted ninety days to make discovery as to damages only.\n   <strong>\n    A Discovery Status Conference is set for February 26, 2018 at 10:00 a.m.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The request for lawyers' fees is denied at this time without prejudice, as plaintiffs have not placed the Court in a position to make a finding of temerity nor have plaintiffs complied with the jurisprudence as required to a request of this nature.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The Court wishes to clarify that the only defendant active at the time of this writing is CJP, as Asociacion de Jinetes de Puerto Rico, Inc.
