The second prong (the \"enumerated offenses clause\") applies to any crime that \"substantially corresponds\" to, and does not \"sweep[ ] more broadly than,\" the \"generic definition\" of one of the listed\n   crimes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   To determine the elements of a generic offense, courts may look to the definition of the crime used by the states, learned treatises, and the Model Penal Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In determining whether a prior conviction falls under \u00a7 4B1.2(a), courts have employed the \"categorical\" and \"modified categorical\" approaches outlined in the ACCA context.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Typically, under the categorical approach, courts may \"look only to the statutory definitions-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the elements-of a defendant's prior offenses,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   and consider whether \"the least culpable conduct hypothetically necessary to sustain conviction under the statute\" falls under either clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, when the court is confronted with a statute that is \"divisible,\"-that is, when the statute \"comprises multiple, alternative versions of the crime,\" a modified categorical approach applies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under this approach, a court may look to a limited set of judicial records, such as the charging document and the plea agreement and colloquy, to determine the elements of the crime of conviction, and assess whether those elements satisfy either prong of \u00a7 4B1.2(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   These records are commonly referred to as\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendant's Aggravated Assault Conviction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant was convicted of aggravated assault in 1990 at the age of 18. At the time, aggravated assault was defined under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%202702\">\n    18 Pa. Cons.

A person is guilty of aggravated assault if he:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (1) attempts to cause serious bodily injury to another, or causes such injury intentionally, knowingly or recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (2) attempts to cause or intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes serious bodily injury to [a police officer or other member of a protected class] while in the performance of duty;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (3) attempts to cause or intentionally or knowingly causes bodily injury to [a police officer or other member of a protected class] in the performance of duty;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (4) attempts to cause or intentionally or knowingly causes bodily injury to another with a deadly weapon; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (5) attempts to cause or intentionally or knowingly causes bodily injury to [a designated school employee] while acting in the scope of his or her employment or because of his or her employment relationship to the school.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   This Court has previously ruled that \u00a7 2702(a) is a divisible statute under which each subsection is a separate and alternative version of the crime, and so in assessing whether the conviction constitutes a \"crime of violence,\" courts may limit their analysis to the specific subsection of the statute under which a defendant was convicted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, however, the\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   documents for Defendant's aggravated assault conviction have been lost, preventing either party from establishing the specific elements of his crime of conviction. Therefore, Defendant's prior conviction cannot be a \"crime of violence,\" unless \u00a7 2702(a) in its entirety, including each of its subsections, satisfies \u00a7 4B1.2(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A few aspects of the statute will be particularly relevant to the Court's analysis:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the subsections of \u00a7 2702(a) differ in the minimum level of\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   required. Subsections (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5) are all specific-intent offenses because they require that injury be caused \"intentionally or knowingly.\" In contrast, subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) require less culpable states of mind: Subsection (a)(1) requires recklessness \"with extreme indifference to the value of human life,\" often referred to as \"depraved heart\" recklessness; subsection (a)(2) requires only simple recklessness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , under Pennsylvania law, an aggravated assault under subsection (a)(1) of the Pennsylvania statute can be committed through omission without the affirmative threat or use of force. Specifically, in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Thomas\n   </em>\n   , the Superior Court of Pennsylvania held that a woman's conviction for aggravated assault under \u00a7 2701(a)(1) could be sustained based on her failure to feed and seek medical attention for her four-year old son, although there was no evidence that she used or threatened force against him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , although subsections (a)(1) and (a)(4) of \u00a7 2702(a) track the generic elements of \"aggravated assault\" as defined in the Model Penal Code, subsections (a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(5) of the statute criminalize conduct that exceeds the scope of the generic offense when the conduct involves injury to members of protected classes of people (law enforcement and school employees).\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In light of the third point, the parties agree that \u00a7 2702(a) as a whole exceeds the scope of the generic definition of \"aggravated assault,\" and therefore does not satisfy the \"enumerated clause\" of the \u00a7 4B1.2. The Government rests its argument solely on the force clause, and notably, does not argue that \u00a7 2702(a) can qualify as a \"crime of violence\" if only some of its subsections satisfy the force clause while the rest satisfy the enumerated offense clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Court will limit its analysis to whether \u00a7 2702(a) in its entirety satisfies the force clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendant argues that \u00a7 2702(a) falls outside the scope of the force clause in two ways. First, and primarily, Defendant argues that the term \"use of physical force against the person of another\" in the force clause requires specific intent, and therefore does not encompass subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) of \u00a7 2702(a), which criminalize reckless conduct. Additionally, and in the alternative, Defendant argues that the term \"use of physical force\" requires affirmative conduct, and therefore does not encompass subsection (a)(1), which criminalizes omissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court will first examine whether the language of the force clause extends to acts committed with the minimum\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   required under \u00a7 2702(a),\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   simple recklessness, and will reach alternative arguments if necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Mens Rea\n    </em>\n    Under the Force Clause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In asserting that the language of the force clause excludes reckless conduct, Defendant relies on long-standing Third Circuit precedent construing the term \"use of physical force against the person of another.\" In response, the Government relies on\n   <em>\n    United States v. Voisine\n   </em>\n   , which construed a similarly-worded definition of \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons explained below, the Court holds that\n   <em>\n    Voisine\n   </em>\n   has not abrogated established Third Circuit law, and therefore the force clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a) does not encompass the reckless conduct criminalized by Pennsylvania's aggravated assault statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Third Circuit Precedent\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Third Circuit has consistently held that \"the use of physical force against the person of another,\" requires intentional, rather than reckless, conduct. In 1992, the court in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Parson\n   </em>\n   addressed whether reckless endangerment under Pennsylvania law was a \"crime of violence\" under an earlier version of \u00a7 4B1.2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   In discussing the relationship between the text of \u00a7 4B1.2 and the earlier-enacted definition of \"crime of violence\" in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the court stated that \"[u]se of physical force is an intentional act, and therefore the first prong of both definitions requires specific intent to use force.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court contrasted the phrase \"use of physical force,\" which remains in the current version of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1), with the text of the residual clause, which was directed to offenses that \"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\" and has since been deleted from \u00a7 4B1.2 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   In contrast, under the second prong of the revised definition, criminals whose actions merely risk causing physical injury may have a lower\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   of \"pure\" recklessness: they may lack an intent, desire or willingness to use force or cause harm at all. For example, a parent who leaves a young child unattended near a pool may risk serious injury to the child, but the action does not involve an intent to use force or otherwise harm the child. Similarly, a drunk driver risks causing severe injury to others on the road or in the car, but in most cases he or she does not intend to use force to harm others.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The court's language makes clear that the \"use of physical force\" in the first prong of \u00a7 4B1.2 does not encompass conduct where the offender was merely reckless with respect to potential harm. Although the court ultimately held that reckless endangerment was a \"crime of violence\" under the residual clause, it noted, in a discussion directed to the Sentencing Commission, that a \"career offender\" enhancement based on purely reckless conduct was inconsistent with the original purpose of the provision: \"The term 'career offender' implies an ongoing intent to make a living through crime, and it is doubtful that one can make a career out of recklessness.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Third Circuit has since repeated this narrow construction of the \"use of physical force\" in interpreting both \u00a7 4B1.2(a) and other statutes that are identically, or nearly-identically worded. In\n   <em>\n    Tran v. Gonzales\n   </em>\n   , the Court analyzed the \"plain language\" of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a),\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   and held that the \" 'use' of force requires specific intent to employ force, and not mere recklessness as to causing harm.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   After surveying the dictionary definitions of the term \"use,\" the court concluded that \"[t]hese definitions show an obvious commonality: the 'use' of force means more than the mere occurrence of force; it requires the intentional employment of that force, generally to obtain some end.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Citing\n   <em>\n    Tran\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit held in\n   <em>\n    Popal v. Gonzales\n   </em>\n   that \"[i]t is now settled law in this Circuit that an offender has committed a 'crime of violence' under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) only if he acted with an intent to use force.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   On this basis, the court held that Pennsylvania's simple assault statute, which requires a minimum\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   of simple recklessness, rather than intent, is not a \"crime of violence\" under \u00a7 16(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subsequently, in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

United States.\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Voisine\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that the term \"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\" in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(9), which is defined in \u00a7 921(a)(33)(A) as a misdemeanor that \"has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, committed by [a domestic relation] of the victim,\" encompasses crimes with a\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   of recklessness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Supreme Court concluded that the ordinary usage of the word \"use\" in \u00a7 921(a)(33)(A) did not limit the provision to specific intent crimes: \"A person who assaults another recklessly 'use[s]' force, no less than one who carries out that same action knowingly or intentionally.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   To illustrate its reasoning, the Court pointed to examples of reckless conduct in the domestic violence context, such as a person who \"throws a plate in anger against the wall near where his wife is standing\" or \"slams the door shut with his girlfriend following close behind,\" that are ordinarily understood to involve the \"use\" of force.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court further concluded that construing \u00a7 922(g)(9) to exclude crimes committed with a reckless state of mind would \"substantially undermine the provision's design\" because Congress enacted \u00a7 922(g)(9) in order to prohibit \"domestic abusers convicted under run-of-the-mill misdemeanor assault and battery laws\" from possessing guns and \"fully two-thirds of such state laws extend to recklessness.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Government urges this Court to apply the construction of \u00a7 921(a)(33)(A) adopted in\n   <em>\n    Voisine\n   </em>\n   to the force clause of \u00a7 4B1.2. The Government acknowledges there is no Third Circuit precedent for doing so. To the contrary, the Third Circuit's language in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Chapman\n   </em>\n   , which was decided in 2017 after\n   <em>\n    Voisine\n   </em>\n   , strongly suggests that the\n   <em>\n    Parson\n   </em>\n   line of cases remains intact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nonetheless, the Government cites to opinions from the Fifth, Eighth, and Tenth Circuit Courts of Appeals, which have extended\n   <em>\n    Voisine\n   </em>\n   to \u00a7 4B1.2(a) and the ACCA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   These opinions\n   do not persuade the Court that it should depart from long-standing Third Circuit law. Instead, the Court has determined that the reasoning of the First Circuit in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bennett\n   </em>\n   , which relies on differences in the texts, contexts, and purposes of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(33)(A), is more consistent with Third Circuit precedent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   First, the text of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1) differs from the text of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(33)(A) in at least one respect that is relevant to the question of intent. Section 4B1.2(a)(1) requires the \"attempted, threatened, or actual use of physical force\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     against the person of another\n    </em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   In contrast, \u00a7 921(a)(33)(A) does not require the use of force\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   anyone or anything. This difference in text makes the \"ordinary usage\" reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Voisine\n   </em>\n   less intuitive in reading \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1). For example, a person who engages in indiscriminate dangerous conduct in a domestic violence setting, such as the throwing of plates or the slamming of a door in the proximity of a family member, can ordinarily be understood to be \"\n   <em>\n    us[ing]\n   </em>\n   physical force.\" But it is far more tenuous to argue that such a person is \"\n   <em>\n    us[ing]\n   </em>\n   physical force\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   the person of another\" when the offender did not specifically intend to direct the harmful conduct toward any person.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Second, as the Supreme Court has acknowledged, including in the\n   <em>\n    Voisine\n   </em>\n   opinion itself, the unique context and purpose of \u00a7 921(a)(33)(A) warrant a different construction from other similarly-worded statutes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   The language of \u00a7 921(a)(33)(A), as\n   incorporated in \u00a7 922(g)(9), was enacted to keep domestic abusers from owning guns by specifically capturing a category of state law offenses,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   \"garden-variety assault or battery misdemeanors,\" which in most states, encompass reckless infliction of bodily harm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   In contrast, \u00a7 4B1 of the Sentencing Guidelines serves to keep people who are deemed \"career\" offenders off the street, excluding them from the community by adding substantial enhancements to their Guidelines range for sentencing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no history that suggests \u00a7 4B1.2(a) was directed to recklessness offenses. Rather, the current version of \u00a7 4B1.2 omits the \"residual clause\" that was previously expressly directed toward reckless conduct,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   \"conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the Third Circuit recognized in\n   <em>\n    Parson\n   </em>\n   , the inclusion of recklessness crimes among the predicate offenses for establishing \"career offender\" status is incongruous with the term \"career offender,\" which \"implies an ongoing intent to make a living through crime.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In light of these differences between \u00a7 922(a)(33)(A) and \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1), the Court is convinced that it should not extend\n   <em>\n    Voisine\n   </em>\n   to \u00a7 4B1.2(a) in contravention of established Third Circuit case law. Moreover, to the extent\n   <em>\n    Voisine\n   </em>\n   created any ambiguity concerning the scope of \u00a7 4B1.2, the rule of lenity requires that the Court resolve the ambiguity in Defendant's favor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Court holds that the minimum\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   of simple reckless required under Pennsylvania's aggravated assault statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%202702\">\n    18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 2702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), does not satisfy the force clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   This holding is sufficient in this case for the Court to conclude that Defendant's prior conviction of aggravated assault does not qualify as a predicate \"crime of violence\" that subjects him to a career offender enhancement under \u00a7 4B1.1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court therefore declines to decide whether\n   the slightly heightened\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   of \"reckless[ness] ... under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to the value of human life\" required under \u00a7 2702(a)(1) would satisfy the force clause. The Court also declines to address Defendant's alternative argument that the omissions criminalized in \u00a7 2702(a)(1) exceed the scope of the force clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For all the reasons above, Defendant's conviction for aggravated assault under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%202702\">\n    18 Pa.

Accordingly, for Defendant's resentencing, the Court adopts the Probation Office's Guidelines range as calculated in the Amended Supplemental Sentencing Report, dated October 5, 2017, and rejects the Government's alternative calculation.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Section 4B1.1 provides enhanced offense levels when (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction; (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. The parties do not dispute that Defendant's current conviction is for a \"controlled substance offense,\" that he is 18 years of age, and that he has at least one predicate conviction for a \"controlled substance offense.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    The Amended Supplemental Sentencing Report corrects the calculation in the Supplemental Report for Resentencing, dated September 28, 2017, which the parties and the Probation Office agreed miscalculated the Guidelines range irrespective of the parties' dispute over the interpretation of \u00a7 4B1.2.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Under the Amended Supplemental Sentencing Report calculation, Defendant's base offense level is 20 pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4).
