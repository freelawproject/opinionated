CRENSHAW, JR., CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   What should be a routine skirmish over the enforceability of a Promissory Note between the maker, Patricia Porter Kryder (\"Kryder\"), and the holder, James Kemmler Rogers (\"Rogers\"), has escalated into a protracted battle, with campaigns fought in both state and federal court. The case was launched with a preemptive strike by Kryder in the form of a declaratory judgment action in the Chancery Court of Giles County, Tennessee. The front moved here, when the case was removed based upon diversity jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Now in its fourth year, and before its second federal judge, the case has survived Rogers. Almost two years after a judicially conducted settlement conference failed to provide a negotiated truce, Jennifer Rogers-Etcheverry (\"Etcheverry\"), as special administrator of Rogers' estate, filed a Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 136) seeking an end to the conflict. This is her second such attempt, and the third attempt at partial or complete summary judgment filed by the parties. Unfortunately, Etcheverry's Motion will not bring a total halt to the hostilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the Complaint filed in the Giles County Chancery Court, Kryder alleged that, in 2007, she and Rogers entered into a \"landlord/tenant\" agreement whereby Rogers would live in her Lynnville, Tennessee residence in exchange for providing general care-taking services and paying $1,500 per month rent, plus $150 per month for each of the four horses that Rogers pastured on the land. This was not a typical landlord/tenant agreement, however. Rogers, who was on a fixed income, was not required to pay the rent he owed each month. Instead, the parties would \"settle up\" at mutually agreeable intervals when Rogers had available funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Complaint also alleges that on January 9 or 10, 2010, Kryder and Rogers agreed that Rogers would become current and pay future rent by advancing Kryder a lump sum payment of $50,000. This agreement was to be set out in a Promissory Note for that amount, with the understanding that the principal would be reduced each month as Rogers' rent and pasture fees became due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Immediately thereafter, on January 11, 2010, a fire destroyed Kryder's utility building and carport, damaged her house, and destroyed surrounding landscaping and trees. Kryder demanded that Rogers reimburse her for \"certain damages\" caused by the fire, and Rogers agreed to do so when he had available funds, including using a frequent flyer credit card with payment made for Kryder's benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On January 15, 2010, Kryder executed a Promissory Note in the principal amount of $50,000. Rogers later agreed to advance Kryder an additional $50,000. Kryder executed a second Promissory Note on April 16, 2010 in the amount of $100,000, which consolidated the two Notes. As with the prior Note, the principal was to be reduced each month as Rogers' rent and pasture fees accrued. It was also to be reduced, Kryder alleged, by the amount of Rogers' responsibility for the fire loss, once that amount was finally determined. Kryder claims that, some time later, Rogers used his frequent flyer credit card for her benefit in the amount of $56,633.17, \"which represented his past-due rent and pasture fees through December 2009.\" (Doc. No. 1-1, Complaint \u00b6 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 18, 2012, Rogers was seriously injured in an automobile accident in Giles County and airlifted to Vanderbilt University Hospital in Nashville. Kryder informed Rogers' daughter Etcheverry, who was living in California, about the accident and the extent of her father's injuries. However, and unbeknownst to Kryder, Etcheverry immediately boarded a flight to Nashville, rented a van, drove to Kryder's farm, entered the residence without permission, and \"removed documents, including evidence of the various business transactions, 'settling up' of the rent, and note obligations between Kryder and Rogers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19). Etcheverry later \"admitted to law enforcement that she removed the documents and other property while Kryder was at Rogers' hospital bedside.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Kryder also alleged that, on June 3, 2012, Etcheverry removed Rogers' remaining personal property from Kryder's residence and, thereafter, Etcheverry and Rogers flew on a private jet to California. Then, on September 12, 2012, and at a time when Rogers was \"mentally incapacitated,\" Etcheverry, through her attorney, sent Kryder a letter alleging that Kryder had failed to pay interest on the two Notes, and demanding that the balance be paid with interest, even though the face of the $100,000 Note acknowledged that the $50,000 Note had been satisfied. This was followed by another letter dated February 20, 2013, that demanded Kryder pay the entire April 16, 2010 Note, together with interest by March 15, 2013. In response, Kryder informed counsel that Rogers actually owed her at least $40,000 for past due rent, pasture fees and damages resulting from the fire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Based upon the foregoing, Kryder asserted claims for breach of contract/procurement of breach; breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing; and\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   against Rogers and Etcheverry. She also sought an accounting and a declaration that Etcheverry and Rogers were obligated to apply all pre-paid interests, debts for rent and pasture fees, the damages resulting from the fire to the April 16, 2010 Promissory Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After the case was removed to this Court on May 16, 2013, Kryder filed an Amended and Restated Complaint (Doc. No. 80) that re-alleged the same facts and asserted the same causes of action. In response, Etcheverry and Rogers filed an Answer and Counterclaim that was twice amended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In the controlling Second Amended Answer and Counterclaim, Etcheverry and Rogers deny most of the pertinent allegations\n   made by Kryder. They concede that Kryder and Rogers entered into an agreement, whereby Rogers would stay at the Lynnville residence for an indefinite period of time, but claim that he was not obligated to pay rent, either for himself or his horses. Rather, Rogers was allowed to live on the property and pasture his horses there if he helped maintain the residence and performed general handyman duties, including mowing the lawn, hauling Kryder's horses, exercising and feeding the horses, and repairing and maintaining the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Etcheverry and Rogers also concede that Kryder executed two Promissory Notes in favor of Rogers-one for $50,000 and the second for of $100,000. They claim, however, that the money advanced via the Notes was not for past or future rents, or to reimburse Kryder for the damages that allegedly resulted from the fire. Rather, the first $50,000 was advanced to Kryder to pay attorney's fees in her unsuccessful attempt to contest her parents' will, and another $50,000 was advanced to pay additional attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Etcheverry concedes that, upon learning of her father's accident and hospitalization, (which she claims not to have heard from Kryder), she flew to Nashville on May 20, 2012, and went to the Lynnville residence. Etcheverry claims, however, that she let herself in with a key that her father had provided to her and that she removed some of her father's personal belongings, which is the same thing she told the police officers. On June 3, 2012, while under Kryder's supervision and with her permission, Etcheverry removed the remainder of her father's personal property from the residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Based upon the Promissory Notes and the advancement of other money, the Counterclaim alleges breach of contract and unjust enrichment. It also seeks equitable relief in the form of a lien to be placed on Kryder's property, either in the form of a Deed of Trust in favor of Rogers to secure the Notes, or a lien\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   on the property for at least the balance of the unpaid interest on the Notes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Second Amended Answer and Counterclaim was filed by Etcheverry as the \"attorney-in-fact for James Kemmler Rogers, an incapacitated person.\" After Rogers passed away on June 11, 2014, Etcheverry, on December 11, 2014, filed a Motion for Substitution (Doc. No. 81) requesting that she be substituted for Rogers as the Counter-Plaintiff in her capacity as the Special Administrator of Roger's estate. By marginal Order dated December 19, 2014, (Doc. No. 82), the Motion was granted by then-Judge William J. Haynes, who was presiding over the case at the time. Kryder filed a Motion to Reconsider (Doc. No. 83), arguing that the Giles County Chancery Court was the proper jurisdiction for the estate to present Rogers' claims, and that Kryder, as a creditor, had filed a Petition to probate Roger's estate in that court. Judge Haynes rejected Kryder's arguments and confirmed the substitution by Order (Doc. No. 85) entered March 9, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As noted at the outset, the matter is before the Court on Etcheverry's Motion for Summary Judgment and, for that reason, the allegations made by the parties in the unverified pleadings are, to a great extent, irrelevant. However, the Court sets them out in detail because, quite frankly, the parties' Local Rule 56.01 submissions, and in particular their respective Statement of Undisputed Facts (Doc. Nos. 138 &amp; 150), are unhelpful. Those filings fail to provide context, let alone flavor,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the\n   dispute between the parties. Furthermore, the parties rely on many of the allegations in advancing their arguments, as if the allegations were established facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   It is only with the foregoing background that one can makes sense of the limited number of material facts on which the parties actually agree. Those facts are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (1) Rogers lived on the Lynnville property from 2007 until he was injured in an automobile accident on May 18, 2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (2) Kryder drafted and executed two Promissory Notes in favor of Rogers. The first, signed January 15, 2010, was in the amount of $50,000. The second, signed April 10, 2010, was in the amount of $100,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (3) The $100,000 Promissory Note replaced the previous note\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (a) was to be secured by a Deed of Trust; (b) provided that Kryder would be responsible for attorney fee's, costs, and expenses if collection proceedings were necessary; and (c) required Kryder to pay four percent interest per year on the outstanding principal balance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (4) The Promissory Note contained no acceleration clause. Instead, all principal and unpaid interest was to be paid on or before December 31, 2020.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (5) After execution of the Promissory Note, Rogers advanced Kryder $56,633.17 using his frequent flyer credit card.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (6) From May 2010 through December 2011, Kryder made monthly interest payments to Rogers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (7) On January 11, 2010, a fire destroyed Kryder's utility building, carport, landscaping, and trees, and damaged her house.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (8) In April 2012, Etcheverry stayed at the Lynnville property and helped her father recover from hip surgery. No demands were made on the Promissory Note during time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (9) On September 11, 2012, and again on February 20, 2013, counsel for Etcheverry sent Kryder a letter requesting payment to make the Note current.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (10) Rogers died on June 11, 2014, and Etcheverry's Motion to Substitute was thereafter granted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (Doc.

The Court considers Kryder's claims first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Kryder's Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   All of Kryder's claims, to wit, her claims for breach of contract/procurement of breach (Count One); breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing (Count Two); quantum meruit (Count Three); accounting (Count Four); and declaratory judgment (Count Five) share a common ground. They are all based, to a greater or lesser extent, on her repeated contention that Rogers failed to fulfill his obligations under the Promissory Note by refusing to (1) apply pre-paid interest, (2) credit his monthly rent and pasture fees, and (3) pay his fair share of the losses incurred as a result of the fire. Kryder relies on two affidavits (Doc. Nos. 109 and 151) to support her contentions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Her claims fail for both procedural and substantive reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Procedurally, Kryder's claims fail because Etcheverry was never substituted as a party Defendant in this action in accordance with Rule 25 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. So far as relevant, that rule provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   If a party dies and the claim is not thereby extinguished, the court may order substitution of the proper parties. The motion for substitution may be made by any party or by the successors or representatives of the deceased party and, together with the notice of hearing, shall be served on the parties as provided in Rule 5 and upon persons not parties in the manner provided in Rule 4 for the service of a summons, and may be served in any judicial district. Unless the motion for substitution is made not later than 90 days after the death is suggested upon the record by service of a statement of the fact of the death as provided\n   here for the service of the motion, the action shall be dismissed as to the deceased party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(a)(1). Under this rule, \"[a]fter the suggestion of death is filed, a 90-day countdown begins\" and, within that period, \"some other party or the executor or administrator of the deceased must move for substitution of the estate for the deceased, or the deceased's case will be dismissed.\"\n   <em>\n    McKenna v.

Etcheverry specifically asked that she be substituted \"as Special Administrator of the Estate of James Kemmler Rogers as the Counter-Plaintiff in this case,\" (Doc. No. 81 at 3), which was subsequently granted by Order (Doc. No. 82) of Judge Haynes. While Judge Haynes' Order merely stated \"[t]he motion is GRANTED,\" any doubts as to its scope was removed when Judge Haynes entered a subsequent Order on Kryder's Motion to Reconsider in which he specifically noted that Etcheverry \"filed a motion for substitution of real party in interest as the Counter-Plaintiff in place of the original Counter-Plaintiff, James Rogers.\" (Doc. No. 85 at 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   There was never a suggestion in this case that Etcheverry would substitute as anything other than the Counter-Plaintiff, notwithstanding the fact that the Kern County, California Superior Court (where Rogers' estate was probated) gave her permission to \"to substitute in as a defendant and cross-complainant.\" (Doc. No. 81-1 at 1). Indeed, it would make little sense for her to voluntarily become the Defendant in this lawsuit, unless, of course, she wanted to exhibit a largesse heretofore not displayed by the parties to this lawsuit. It was incumbent upon Kryder to move for that substitution, which she did not do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Kryder relies on the \"Sixth Circuit\" decision in\n   <em>\n    Watts v. Novartis Pharm. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201456647\">\n    2015 WL 1456647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Ohio Mar. 30, 2015) for the proposition that \"[a]fter the changes to Fed. R. Civ. P. 25, courts take a flexible approach to the substitution of parties.\" (Doc. No. 149 at 9). This proposition is true enough, but\n   <em>\n    Watts\n   </em>\n   , a district court decision, dealt with the issues of whether the plaintiff was a proper heir to be substituted, and whether the motion for substitution was timely.\n   <em>\n    Watts\n   </em>\n   does not help Kryder, who did not move to substitute Etcheverry as a Defendant. Furthermore, while Kryder points out that Rule 25(a) is discretionary because it provides that \" the court may order substitution of the proper parties,\" this discretion presupposes a motion for substitution has been filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kaplan v.

After observing that \"no interest payment have been made since December 1, 2011,\" and that Kryder was \"now in clear default of the Promissory Note,\" the \"purpose of the letter\" was to give Kryder \"one opportunity to pay the amount owed bringing\n   <em>\n    current all sums owed\n   </em>\n   under the Promissory Note,\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   expect that legal action will be taken,\" with a \"collection attorney\" instructed to \"take whatever steps\n   <em>\n    are available under the Promissory Note\n   </em>\n   [.]\" (Doc.

First, the $100,000 Promissory Note was an agreement in writing signed by the parties sought to be bound. Second, Kryder did not perform under the contract because she indisputably made no interest payments after December 2011, even though the Promissory Note required \"from the date of draw through the date of repayment, interest at four percent (4.00%) per annum on the outstanding unpaid principal balance until such principal is paid in full.\" (Doc. No. 70-2 at 2). Further, the Note required that it be secured by a Deed of Trust filed in the Giles County Registrar's Office, which has not occurred. Third, Etcheverry, as the administrator of her father's estate has shown harm because she has not received the interest payments and the loan is not secured by the property as promised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Kryder does not argue that the Promissory Note was not a contract or that the Note did not require interest payments, or the filing of a deed of trust.

Accordingly, Etcheverry is entitled to an equitable lien on that property to secure the interest that has not been paid, as well as the attorney's fees, court costs and other expenses that Kryder also agreed to pay should the Note be \"placed in the hands of an attorney for collection or attempting to collect the indebtedness evidenced hereby.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   With the conclusion that Etcheverry is entitled to recover past due interest and an equitable lien to secure that interest, the Court need not address her additional request for declaratory and injunctive relief set forth in Count IV, or her \"Lis Pendens\" claim set forth in Count V. Count IV request an \"injunction precluding Kryder from disposing of the Property\" or \"an Order requiring [her] to execute and record a Deed of Trust against the property.\" (Doc. No. 70, Counterclaim \u00b6 47, 48). In Count V, Etcheverry \"seeks to fix a lien\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   on the property for at least the balance of unpaid interest on the Note, plus reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and other expenses incurred by [her] relating to this matter.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52). These requests are cumulative to the request for an equitable lien and will be denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   That leaves Count Two of the Counterclaim alleging unjust enrichment. More specifically, Etcheverry claims that,\n   following \"execution of the Note in April 2010, Kryder continued to receive funds advanced to her from Rogers well in excess of the principal amount of the Note and Rogers expected to be repaid said funds and Kryder knew that Rogers expected to be repaid such funds.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \"The elements of an unjust enrichment claim are: 1) '[a] benefit conferred upon the defendant by the plaintiff'; 2) 'appreciation by the defendant of such benefit'; and 3) 'acceptance of such benefit under such circumstances that it would be inequitable for him to retain the benefit without payment of the value thereof.' \"\n   <em>\n    Freeman Indus., LLC v.

No. 80 at 5).

Summary judgment will not be granted on Etcheverry's unjust enrichment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Based upon the foregoing, Etcheverry's Motion for Summary Judgment will be granted on all of Kryder's claims set forth in the Amended and Restated Complaint. The Motion will also be granted on Etcheverry's Counterclaim for breach of contract and her Counterclaim requesting an equitable lien. Etcheverry's Counterclaim for unjust enrichment will be denied. The remaining claims set forth in the Counterclaim will be denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   An appropriate Order will enter.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Hope springs eternal and, before this Court undertook the arduous task of wading through the record and formulating an opinion, the Magistrate Judge ordered the parties to participate in another judicially-conducted settlement conference. (Doc. No. 168). Any hope that the parties could amicably resolve their differences, however, was dashed on October 16, 2017, when the parties appeared before a second Magistrate Judge but were unable to reach an accord. (Doc. No. 176).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Even the Court's recitation of the allegations fails to do justice to the parties' apparent animosity towards each other and the lengths to which they will go to prevail on any issue, no matter how insignificant.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    Kryder's \"frivolous filings\" in the Giles County Chancery Court ultimately led to the imposition of almost $35,000 in sanctions by that court against her and her counsel. This was not the only time Kryder and her lawyer were sanctioned for conduct arising out of this litigation. On September 27, 2016, they were ordered by Judge Haynes to pay \"a total monetary sanction of $1,000\" (Doc. No. 116 at 1) for their failure to provide discovery and to comply with an Order of the Court regarding the same.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    Not to be outdone, Kryder moved to disqualify Etcheverry's counsel on the grounds that Kryder's former counsel entered into a \"law association\" with Etcheverry's counsel. That request was denied by the undersigned after a hearing. (Doc. No. 162).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    Most recently, the parties have become embroiled in a controversy over the caption of the case. When Etcheverry began identifying the Counter-Defendant as \"Patricia Porter Kryder a/k/a Patricia K. Ganier\" and the Magistrate Judge included that language in the style of the case, Kryder took umbrage and filed a \"Motion to Change Caption in Order\" because \"the use of an alias...is intended to harass\" and \"is needlessly hurtful\" to her. (Doc. No. 170 at 1).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    Because the parties agree that the April 16, 2010 Promissory Note replaced and supplanted the prior note, the Court will refer to that controlling document simply as the \"Promissory Note\" or \"Note\" from this point forward.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    Attached to the first Affidavit is a copy of a \"Revocable Trust,\" (Doc. No. 109-3), the significance of which is not clear. In both her second affidavit and Response Brief, Kryder simply states that the Revocable Trust provided that, upon her death, Rogers could reside at her Giles County farm for life \"without the payment of rent,\" and that, after the automobile accident, Etcheverry entered her home and removed documents, some of which related to Rogers \"serving as Co-Trustee over [her] Revocable Living Trust.\" (Doc. No. 109 at 2; Doc. No. 149 at 5 &amp; 6). To the extent that Kryder relies upon the Revocable Trust to establish an oral understanding that rent, fees, and damages were to be deducted from the Promissory Note, that reliance is unavailing because those matters are not discussed in that document.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    The Court recognizes that Count One of the Complaint alleges breach of contract and such actions are generally governed by a six-year statute of limitations as set forth in\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2028-3-109\">\n     Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 28-3-109\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . However, the Tennessee Supreme Court has made clear that, in determining the applicable statute of limitations, \"courts must ascertain the gravamen of each claim\" by considering \"both the legal basis of the claim and the injury for which damages are sought.\"\n    <em>\n     Benz-Elliott v. Barrett Enters., LP\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6877395\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/456/140/#p149\">\n     456 S.W.3d 140\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 149 (Tenn. 2015). Here, while Count One is couched as a breach of contract claim, a portion of the damages Kryder seeks in the form of an offset is Roger's alleged \"responsibility for the loses and damages related to the fire and other damages at Kryder's farm.\" (Doc. No. 80, Amended Complaint \u00b6 35). In this respect, Kryder is seeking damages arising from the loss of real property as a result of the fire, not damages for the alleged violation of a contract relating to the advancement of money. Regardless, and as explained below, Etcheverry has established that Kryder breached the contract based on the Promissory Note and is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on that issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    This figure is based upon the fact that, from May 2011 through December 2011, Kryder made monthly interest payment in the amount of $522.72, which, by Etcheverry's calculation, represented monthly interest at 4% per annum on $156,817.15. The fact that monthly interest payments were made in this amount tends to support the position that Kryder agreed to an additional loan not incorporated by the Note, but this evidence is hardly conclusive on the issue. That is a piece of evidence which the jury can weigh.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
