The court agrees with plaintiffs that the current evidentiary record is thin, and further discovery is necessary to understand the relationship between the housekeepers' various employers. Accordingly, applying, as it must, a lenient standard, the court holds that plaintiffs have made sufficiently substantial allegations of the existence of similarly-situated potential plaintiffs, and\n   that they have met the requirements for conditional certification of the class. The court therefore conditionally certifies a class consisting of all current and former housekeepers employed by Orta at hotels located in the Dallas / Fort Worth area, including those assigned to work for Omni.

The court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   First, numerous courts in the Fifth Circuit have held that inclusion of the caption of the court in a notice does not undermine judicial neutrality.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Nabarrette v.

Omni's request for a specific disclaimer by the court is unnecessary, because the language of the notice clearly conveys that the court has not made any determination regarding the merits of the lawsuit. The court thus concludes that the proposed notice is not defective on the basis that it does not maintain judicial neutrality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The court also disagrees with Omni's contention that the proposed notice is deficient because it fails to describe Omni's position. Although the proposed notice does not explicitly state that Omni denies wrongdoing, the language of the notice is not \"one-sided and argumentative.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gerlach v.

Here, Omni has provided no reason why 45 days is less burdensome than 90 days. Nor has Omni offered an explanation for why 45 days is sufficient notice for potential plaintiffs in this particular case. The court is left to infer that Omni prefers a shorter notice period simply because it hopes that fewer plaintiffs will opt in as a result. Accordingly, the court holds that 90 days is reasonable and does not impose an undue burden on defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiffs ask that the court approve distribution of notice and consent forms by mail, email, Facebook message, and a webpage solely dedicated to disseminating the notice.

They ask that the court order Orta and Omni to produce in electronic form the names, last known addresses, telephone numbers, and email addresses of potential plaintiffs. Ps. Mot. at 14.
