INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff John Lott worked for about four months as the Chief Compliance Officer of Defendant Not-For-Profit Hospital Corporation, an entity created under District of Columbia law that operates United Medical Center. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant fired him for identifying and reporting a host of problems at the hospital in violation of federal and state laws. Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is now before the court. For the reasons set forth below, the court dismisses Plaintiff's federal claims and declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his remaining state law claims. Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is therefore granted. The court, however,\n   will grant Plaintiff one more opportunity to amend his pleading and therefore does not dismiss this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

False Claims Act Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant argues Plaintiff's FCA claims should be dismissed because: (1) Defendant is not an entity that can be held liable under the FCA's qui tam provision due to its legal status as an \"instrumentality of the District government,\" D.C. Code. \u00a7 44-951.02(a) ; and (2) Plaintiff has not alleged the required elements of a FCA fraud claim. The court refrains from deciding, at this juncture, whether Defendant is subject to qui tam liability under the FCA, but concludes that dismissal is warranted because of Plaintiff's failure to allege a claim with the requisite specificity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Whether Defendant is a \"person\" subject to liability under the qui tam provision of the FCA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant's first argument for dismissal concerns whether Defendant is subject to suit under the FCA's qui tam provision. The FCA provides that a private party may bring a qui tam action-that is, an action on behalf of the United States and himself-against \"any\n   <em>\n    person\n   </em>\n   who ... knowingly presents, or causes to be presented\" to the United States government \"a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203729\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203729\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3730(b).

In\n   <em>\n    Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel.

The D.C.

This argument\n   <em>\n    presumes\n   </em>\n   the District of Columbia is a \"state\" and assigns significant weight to Defendant's authorizing statute, which defines Defendant as an \"instrumentality\" of the District of Columbia government that has a \"separate legal existence\n   <em>\n    within\n   </em>\n   the District government.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2044-951.02\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 44-951.02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added). In responding, Plaintiff does not address the applicability of the arm-of-the-state test or its three factors to support his position that Defendant is subject to suit under the FCA. Instead, Plaintiff contends that because Defendant is capable of being \"sued in its corporate name,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2044-951.06\">\n    D.C.

First, Plaintiff fails to explain why sovereign immunity is relevant to the \"person\"-hood inquiry at issue, i.e., whether Defendant is a \"person\" for purposes of qui tam liability under the FCA. To the extent Plaintiff is raising sovereign immunity because of\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   , he is misguided.\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   held that states are immune from qui tam FCA actions because the statutory term \"person\" did not include states, and expressly reserved deciding whether the Eleventh Amendment would provide an\n   <em>\n    independent\n   </em>\n   basis for shielding states and their agencies from FCA qui tam claims.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509149\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/765/#p787\">\n    529 U.S. at 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509149\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/765/#p787\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"We ... express no view on the question whether an action in federal court by a\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   relator against a State would run afoul of the Eleventh Amendment, but we note that there is 'a serious doubt' on that score.\" (citation omitted)). Thus, under\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   , a state entity's amenability to suit due to a general waiver of sovereign immunity does not answer whether such entity is a \"person\" for purposes of the FCA's qui tam provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant's argument also is flawed. If the District of Columbia is a \"state\" under the FCA's qui tam provision, the straightforward application of\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   and the arm-of-the-state test, as advocated for by Defendant, might be appropriate. But whether\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   applies is far from clear because the District of Columbia is not a state; the District is organized by statute as a \"body corporate for municipal purposes\" and possesses all the \"powers of a municipal corporation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201-102\">\n    D.C.

After the Executive Vice President of Human Resources refused Small's order to reinstate Edwards, Plaintiff does not allege that he undertook any oppositional action, such as filing a formal grievance, revisiting the matter with Small, reporting the action to an independent entity, or otherwise calling attention to the action.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeMasters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5768563\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/796/409/#p422\">\n    796 F.3d at 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
