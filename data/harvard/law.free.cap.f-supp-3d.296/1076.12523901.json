INTRODUCTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On March 17, 2016, with the assistance of counsel, petitioner Michael Ingram filed\n   his Amended Motion Pursuant To\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   To Vacate, Set Aside, Or Correct Sentence ( \u00a7 2255 Motion), seeking relief from his mandatory minimum sentence on his 2008 conviction for conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine. Ingram's mandatory minimum sentence was doubled from 10 years to 20 years, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20851\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , based on a prior felony drug conviction. Ingram's Amended \u00a7 2255 Motion seeks relief on two of his original claims: (1) a claim that the imposition of a \u00a7 851 enhancement in his case violated his Eighth Amendment rights; and (2) a claim that the imposition of a \u00a7 851 enhancement in his case violated his Fifth Amendment rights to Equal Protection and Due Process (his equal protection/selective prosecution claim).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both claims are based on the geographical disparity in the application of \u00a7 851 enhancements between this and other districts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On February 8, 2017, after reviewing the parties' briefs, I entered an Order for further briefing on specific issues. The parties filed their Supplemental Briefs on March 17, 2017, and Supplemental Replies on March 31, 2017. In addition, on March 17, 2017, Ingram filed a Motion To Expand The Record Pursuant To Rule 7 Of The Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases, to which the respondent consented, and on March 18, 2017, Ingram filed an Amended Motion To Expand The Record, involving one additional exhibit, to which the respondent also consented. Ingram's Motions To Expand The Record identify Rule 7 of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases as the authority on which they are based. That rule, while inapplicable to this \u00a7 2255 case, is identical to Rule 7 of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Cases. Because I find good cause supports Ingram's Motions To Expand The Record, and the respondent has consented, those motions are\n   <strong>\n    granted\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After reviewing the parties' first round of supplemental briefs, I entered an Order on May 26, 2017, requiring the parties to make a proffer of evidence on Ingram's \"equal protection/selective prosecution\" claim and requiring supplemental briefing of the question of whether there is a rational basis for the geographic disparity between the imposition of a \u00a7 851 enhancement on Ingram in this district and lack of such an enhancement for similarly-situated persons in other districts. The parties filed their Proffers Of Evidence on August 10 and 11, 2017, and their Second Supplemental Briefs on September 15, 2017. Ingram filed a Second Supplemental Reply on September 29, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   I conclude that Ingram's \u00a7 2255 Motion is now ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

Procedural Default\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Before considering any other questions in this case, I find it appropriate to address the respondent's contention, in its original briefing, that Ingram's claims are procedurally defaulted. The respondent is correct that, where a claim was not raised on direct appeal, it generally may not be raised in a \u00a7 2255 motion.\n   <em>\n    Walking Eagle v.

Indeed, the only body that had the pertinent information, the United States Sentencing Commission, did not publish the relevant statistics that could establish an adequate factual basis for such a claim until 2011.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248336\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/263/#p284\">\n    527 U.S. at 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248336\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/263/#p284\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that a cause external to the defense, such as the information being solely in the hands of the government, was required). It was not until I published my analysis of the disparity, specifically comparing the Northern District of Iowa to other districts, in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Iowa 2013), that an adequate basis for Ingram's claim became apparent. Thus, I find that Ingram has shown cause for his failure to raise on his direct appeal the geographic disparity in application of \u00a7 851 enhancements, because the factual basis for such a claim was not reasonably available to him or his counsel before Ingram's appeal.\n   <em>\n    Strickler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248336\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/263/#p284\">\n    527 U.S. at 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248336\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/263/#p284\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The prejudice prong requires a showing that there is a reasonable probability that, but for the cause in question, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kennedy v.

Removing improper selective application of the \u00a7 851 enhancement in Ingram's case would have resulted in a halving of his mandatory minimum sentence and a significant reduction of his sentence to one within his advisory Sentencing Guidelines range. I find that difference sufficient \"prejudice\" to overcome procedural default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Thus, procedural default does not bar relief on Ingram's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. The Eighth Amendment Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Ingram's first claim is that imposition of a \u00a7 851 enhancement in his case, on the basis of geographical location, violates the Eighth Amendment. Ingram relies on Justice Douglas's statement in his concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Furman v. Georgia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782791\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/238/#p256\">\n    408 U.S. 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 256,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782791\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/238/#p256\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782791\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/238/#p256\">\n    33 L.Ed.2d 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972), that a \"capriciously selected random handful upon whom the sentence of death is imposed is unconstitutional cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment requiring penal laws to be evenhanded, non-selective, and non-arbitrary.\" The respondent argues that a \u00a7 851 enhancement, even one doubling the mandatory minimum sentence from ten years to twenty years, is not closely comparable to a death penalty. Indeed, the respondent argues that the Eighth Amendment forbids only \"grossly disproportionate\" sentences, but the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has concluded that mandatory minimum penalties do not violate the Eighth Amendment. The respondent also argues that Ingram's \u00a7 851 enhanced\n   mandatory minimum sentence of twenty years is not grossly disproportionate to his advisory Sentencing Guidelines range of 168 to 210 months, nor does it exceed the sentence permitted by statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \" '[A] sentence within statutory limits is generally not subject to review under the Eighth Amendment.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Neither are criminal defendants subject to \u00a7 851 enhancements \"products of a set of cookie cutters.\" Yet, the claimant and the comparators must both be subject to a \u00a7 851 enhancement, or any comparison would be meaningless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Going further, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has repeatedly identified \"similarly situated\" persons as those engaged in \"similar misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Ready Mixed Concrete Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8925375\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/424/806/#p811\">\n    424 F.3d 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 811 (8th Cir. 2005). Other aspects of the \"similar misconduct\" requirement include that the comparator was subject to the \"same standards\" and engaged in \"the same conduct without any mitigating or distinguishing circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fatemi v.

As to differences in mitigating circumstances, in the case of criminal defendants, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has explained that a defendant who pleaded guilty and cooperated with the government is not similarly situated to a defendant who did not.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bowie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775251\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/618/802/#p819\">\n    618 F.3d 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 819 (8th Cir. 2010). These factors are consistent with the statement by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals that a similarly-situated person is \"one who engaged in the same type of conduct, which means that the comparator committed the same basic crime in substantially the same manner as the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11180091\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/231/800/\">\n    231 F.3d at 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In this case, in my view, this \"similar misconduct\" requirement is of considerable importance. In cases involving equal protection claims based on charging of substantive offenses, this factor might well require closer similarity than the same general kind of offense, such as drug trafficking, and instead require that the offenses be charged under the same statute, such as drug conspiracy crimes pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20846\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and likely similar or close base offense levels of the same controlled substance. Where, as here, the charging decision at issue does not involve a substantive offense, but a penalty enhancement, however, I believe that a \"relevant respect,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gilani\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172257\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/342/#p348\">\n    843 F.3d at 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , is the potential penalty. Thus, here, a similarly-situated person would be someone charged with a drug-trafficking crime that subjected the comparator to the same mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in the absence of a \u00a7 851 enhancement, that Ingram faced.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11180091\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/231/800/\">\n    231 F.3d at 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . I think another relevant component of the \"similar misconduct\" requirement is a similar criminal history, including, for example, whether a defendant was prosecuted in state or federal court, because recidivism, deterrence, and enforcement priorities are plainly relevant factors in the determination of charging decisions, as the Eleventh and Fourth\n   Circuit Courts of Appeals recognized.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Venable\n   </em>\n   , 666 F.3d at 901 ;\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11180091\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/231/800/\">\n    231 F.3d at 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, the penalty enhancement under \u00a7 851 is directed at recidivism, because it is triggered by prior drug felonies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   I also conclude that, in the context of a \u00a7 851 enhancement, this \"comparable seriousness\" factor extends to the underlying drug offense on which the enhancement is predicated. To me, this is the most important factor. I often see state court aggravated misdemeanors that are very old used as the predicate prior drug felonies for \u00a7 851 enhancements. Often, the offender received probation for that predicate offense and never served even a few days of county jail time. If one defendant has an old state court misdemeanor conviction where he never served a day in jail, but another defendant had a prior federal drug conspiracy conviction with a lengthy prison sentence, this difference would be exceptionally important in determining whether or not they were \"similarly situated.\" In other words, these are \"legitimate prosecutorial factors that might justify making different prosecutorial decisions with respect to [different defendants].\"\n   <em>\n    Venable\n   </em>\n   , 666 F.3d at 900-901. Thus, in the context of a \u00a7 851 enhancement, the nature and punishment of the predicate offense are crucial factors in the \"similarly situated\" analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   I believe that other \"relevant respects\" in this case are whether the comparators are alike in the disposition of their criminal cases,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , by plea or trial, and whether the comparators cooperated, because these are relevant \"mitigation\" factors in punishment, as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fatemi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340305\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/775/1022/#p1042\">\n    775 F.3d at 1042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting the relevance of \"mitigation\");\n   <em>\n    Bowie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775251\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/618/802/#p819\">\n    618 F.3d at 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that defendants who pleaded guilty and cooperated are not similarly situated to defendants who did not).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In short, while I do not find it necessary to attempt a comprehensive list of pertinent factors, nor do I find it necessary to determine that certain factors are irrelevant, it seems to me that the following factors are the\n   <em>\n    minimum\n   </em>\n   points of similarity that must be shown to establish that a comparator is similarly situated to Ingram for purposes of a \u00a7 851 enhancement: (1) The comparator must have been potentially subject to a \u00a7 851 enhancement; (2) the comparator's predicate offense must have been similar in nature, seriousness, recentness or remoteness in time, and punishment; (3) the comparator's federal drug-trafficking crime must have carried the same mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to \u00a7 841, in the absence of a \u00a7 851 enhancement; and (4) the comparator must have gone to trial on the federal charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The comparators that Ingram has identified as \"similarly situated\" in his Proffer Of Evidence satisfy the first and third of the minimum points of similarity identified above, but none satisfy the fourth, and it is, at best, uncertain whether they satisfy the second. As the starting point for the necessary comparisons, Ingram went to trial on and was convicted by a jury of a charge of conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of crack cocaine. His prior conviction for purposes of a \u00a7 851 enhancement, as identified in the Superseding Indictment and the Notice Of Intent To Seek Enhanced Penalties Pursuant To\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20851\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , was for manufacture/delivery of a controlled substance, on or about October 24, 2001, in Cook County Circuit Court, Illinois. Ingram's Presentence Investigation Report shows that he received 18 months of probation on this prior conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Dewight Brewer, Ingram's first purportedly similarly-situated comparator, was\n   convicted in 2011 in the Eastern District of Michigan of distribution of at least one kilogram of heroin and five kilograms of cocaine, on a guilty plea in exchange for the prosecution's recommendation of a sentence of 188 months and agreement not to file a \u00a7 851 enhancement. Ingram Proffer Of Evidence, Ex. 8, p.3, and Ex. 9, pp. 2-4. Thus, unlike Ingram, Brewer was convicted pursuant to a plea agreement, so he is distinguishable, not similarly situated. This is so, even though his prior convictions include one that might be considered more serious than Ingram's, because Brewer had a 2001 conviction for conspiracy to distribute crack and heroine, for which his prison term ended in 2008, a few years prior to his 2011 federal offense, Ingram Proffer Of Evidence, Ex. 9, pp. 2-3, where Ingram's prior conviction was several years earlier and incurred only probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Otis Booth, offered as another comparator, was convicted in 2014 in the Western District of Tennessee of trafficking between five and fifteen kilograms of cocaine, while he was on supervised release for another offense, but the prosecution agreed not to file the \u00a7 851 enhancement as part of his plea agreement. Ingram Proffer Of Evidence, Ex. 2, p. 2. Thus, Booth also pleaded guilty, where Ingram went to trial. Furthermore, Ingram's Proffer Of Evidence provides no indication of the nature, date, or punishment of Booth's predicate offense for \u00a7 851 purposes, so the extent of similarity on that point cannot be determined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Stevon Ray Alexander pleaded guilty in 2009 in the Western District of Louisiana to possession with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack cocaine, and the prosecution filed no \u00a7 851 enhancement. Ingram Proffer Of Evidence, Ex. 1, p.2. Thus, also unlike Ingram, Alexander's federal charge was resolved by a plea, rather than a trial. Alexander's plea agreement gives no indication of the nature, recentness, or punishment of his predicate offense.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20851\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   His brief on appeal indicates two prior convictions for \"drug possession\" in 2001, and a third conviction for \"drug possession\" in March 2008, just prior to his conviction on his federal offense, but does not indicate the punishment of any of his prior convictions.

There is no doubt that the USAO for the Northern District of Iowa could produce a rational basis for imposing the \u00a7 851 enhancement on Ingram, because he has a prior drug conviction, and imposing such an enhancement serves the legitimate governmental purpose of punishing recidivism, which is clearly a policy of the USAO in this district, as the statistics discussed in\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   quite clearly show.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Thus, Ingram also has not proffered any evidentiary basis on which he can demonstrate lack of a rational basis in support of his equal protection/selective prosecution claim, and that claim is denied as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D.
