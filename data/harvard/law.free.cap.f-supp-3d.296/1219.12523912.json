Form 990 has a supplement, Schedule B, which lists the names and addresses of an organization's contributors. Although many of the documents required by the Registry are open to public inspection, the contents of Form 990 Schedule B have always been considered confidential, accessible only to in-house-staff and handled separately from non-confidential documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CCP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180376\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/1307/#p1311\">\n    784 F.3d at 1311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On January 9, 2014, Plaintiff filed its Annual Registration Renewal Fee Report with Defendant, including a copy of its Form 990 and a redacted version of its Schedule B omitting the names and addresses of its contributors. Plaintiff subsequently received a letter from Defendant dated February 6, 2014 (\"Letter\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 37-2.

Plaintiff subsequently filed a motion for preliminary injunction claims on grounds that said requirements unconstitutionally infringed upon its freedom of association, and that requiring the submission of an unredacted Schedule B was preempted by federal law in any event. That motion was denied. With respect to the freedom of association claim, the Court reasoned that Plaintiff had not articulated any objective, specific harm that would befall its members as a result of compliance with the Schedule B Requirement, and thus had failed to make a prima facie showing of infringement concerning its associational rights.\n   <em>\n    Center for Competitive Politics v.

The panel recognized that immediate access to Schedule B filings \"increases her investigative efficiency\" by allowing her to \"flag suspicious activity\" by reviewing significant donor information. The court thus concluded that requiring the disclosure of Schedule Bs \"bears a 'substantial relation' \" to a \" 'sufficiently important' government interest\", therefore satisfying examination under exacting scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180376\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/1307/#p1311\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following the Ninth Circuit's denial of its interlocutory appeal, Plaintiff filed a petition for writ of certiorari, which was denied by the United States Supreme Court on November 9, 2015. Plaintiff then filed its FAC on August 12, 2016. ECF No. 37. The FAC continues to allege that the Attorney General's unredacted Schedule B requirement violates Plaintiff's First Amendment rights to free association and speech and is preempted by federal law. Plaintiff further argues that its Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure is also being violated. Plaintiff allegedly has chosen to cease fundraising in California rather than comply with the requirement that it file a complete copy of its Schedule B with the Registry.

Moreover, unlike the present case, the\n   <em>\n    AFPF\n   </em>\n   decision indicates that \"[d]uring the course of trial, the Court heard ample evidence establishing that AFPF, its employees, supporters and donors face public threats, harassment, intimidation, and retaliation once their support for and affiliation with the organization becomes publicly known.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12134088\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/182/1049/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court went on to cite specific instances in that regard. Accordingly, the\n   <em>\n    AFPF\n   </em>\n   court found that AFPF supporters were \"subjected to abuses that warrant relief on an as-applied challenge.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12134088\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/182/1049/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Significantly, no such abuses have been identified in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In the face of the actual burden on associational rights identified in\n   <em>\n    AFPF\n   </em>\n   , the Court went on to examine the strength of the Attorney General's legitimate interest in the disclosure. It found that the record before it lacked \"even a single, concrete instance in which pre-investigation collection of a Schedule B did anything to advance the Attorney General's investigative, regulatory or enforcement efforts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12134088\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/182/1049/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12134088\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/182/1049/\">\n    at 1055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consequently, \"in light of the requirement's burdens on AFPF's First Amendment rights,\" it found that the Attorney General's interests did not justify those burdens.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12134088\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/182/1049/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Here, the absence of any articulated burden, even in the wake of the Ninth Circuit's\n   <em>\n    CCP\n   </em>\n   decision and Plaintiff's subsequent opportunity to file its FAC, makes the balancing engaged in by\n   <em>\n    AFPF\n   </em>\n   unnecessary. In the present case, we have, in the face of no identified First Amendment burden, the Attorney General's argument that disclosing the names of significant donors \"is necessary to determine whether a charity is actually engaged in a charitable purpose, or is instead violating California law by engaging in self-dealing, improper loans, or other unfair business practices.\"\n   <em>\n    CCP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180376\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/1307/#p1311\">\n    784 F.3d at 1311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under the circumstances of the present matter that representation is sufficient to survive exacting scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Additionally, plaintiff's argument in\n   <em>\n    AFPF\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that the Attorney General's office has been unable to keep confidential Schedule Bs private makes no difference to this analysis. Preliminarily, as a Central District decision,\n   <em>\n    AFPF's\n   </em>\n   findings are not binding on this Court in the first place. Secondly, given the amendment of California Code of Regulations \u00a7 310, effective July 8, 2016 (at a point after the\n   <em>\n    AFPF\n   </em>\n   decision was rendered on April 21, 2016), the Attorney General now is legally required by law as well as by practice to maintain the confidentiality of donor information contained in submitted schedules. The fact that confidentiality is now guaranteed by formal regulation weighs in favor of the reasonableness of the Attorney General's disclosure requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Having determined that Plaintiff has not stated a cognizable First Amendment freedom\n   of association claim, the Court now addresses the second prong of Plaintiff's First Amendment challenge; namely, its argument that the Attorney General's Schedule B requirement impinges upon free speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiff's First Amendment Free Speech Claim Also Fails\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In addition to alleging the associational claims rejected above, Count I of the FAC also contends that the requirement to file a Schedule B \"as a predicate to Plaintiff's ability to lawfully speak about a topic or subject matter-namely charitable solicitation\" violates its First Amendment right to free speech. FAC, \u00b6 80. The FAC further claims, without supporting facts or elaboration, that the Schedule B requirement operates as a content-based restriction on charitable solicitation, \"which is itself a form of First Amendment speech.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 58-62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   To begin with, the FAC fails to identify any speech that is impacted by the reporting requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Citizens United v.

At most, as already enumerated above, the FAC simply suggests that because Plaintiff has itself elected to not comply with Schedule B's requirement and purports to have accordingly stopped fundraising in California on that basis, its speech has been impaired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court agrees with Defendant that Plaintiff's argument in this respect fails as a matter of law. Although solicitation of charitable contributions is protected speech (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Riley v.

At issue in\n    <em>\n     Reed\n    </em>\n    was a sign code that subjected various signs to different restrictions depending on their content.
