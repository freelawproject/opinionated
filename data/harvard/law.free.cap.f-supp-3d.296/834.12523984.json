(Administrative Record 322, DN 53-2 [hereinafter AR] ). He died in 1991, and his wife died in 1992. (AR 303).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In 2004, Plaintiffs-all of whom are Louis' children-filed claims for benefits under Parts B of the EEOICPA,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   asserting that Louis' employment at the PDGP caused him to develop thrombocytopenia, liver disease, and kidney disease. (AR 659-72). Instead of issuing a recommendation regarding Plaintiffs' Part B claims, the district office informed Plaintiffs that, though the alleged conditions were not compensable under Part B, the medical evidence submitted to prove those conditions raised the possibility that Louis had CBD. (AR 307-14, 317-19). As such, the district office directed Plaintiffs to submit additional evidence showing that Louis developed CBD as a result of working at the PGDP. (AR 317-19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs never submitted additional evidence supporting a diagnosis of CBD, and, eventually, the district office recommended and the FAB concluded that Plaintiffs' Part B claims should be denied. (AR 155-70, 172-84). Both branches found that the alleged conditions-thrombocytopenia, liver disease, and kidney disease-were not compensable under Part B. (AR 165-66, 176-79). Further, even though Plaintiffs did not claim entitlement to Part B benefits on the ground that Louis developed CBD, both branches determined that Plaintiffs' medical evidence failed to establish a CBD diagnosis. (AR 165-66, 176-79). In reaching this conclusion, the district office and FAB relied on a report that the District Medical Consultant prepared after reviewing Plaintiffs' medical evidence. (AR 165-66, 176-79). The report found that the evidence did not establish a diagnosis of pre-1993 CBD. (AR 189-90).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On November 19, 2010, Plaintiffs' authorized representative, Gary S. Vander Boegh (\"Vander Boegh\"), submitted a new claim on behalf of Lanier, asserting that Lanier was entitled to Part B survivor benefits on the ground that Louis developed CBD as a result of his employment at the PGDP. (AR 136-37). Vander Boegh included the following documents in support of this claim: (1) a copy of a final decision issued by FAB on an unrelated claimant's CBD claim, (2) copies of Louis' medical records, and (3) an August 25, 2005, internal agency memorandum addressing\n   the condition of CBD as contributing to other chronic pulmonary diseases. (AR 103-35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Less than two weeks later, the district office sent Vander Boegh a letter (the \"2010 letter\") explaining that it would not issue a recommendation regarding to Lanier's CBD claim. (AR 51-54). In the 2010 letter, the district office advised Vander Boegh that the FAB had already concluded that Louis' medical records failed to establish a diagnosis of pre-1993 CBD. (AR 51-54). It then explained that it would not address Lanier's claim unless and until he presented new evidence to substantiate a CBD diagnosis. (AR 54). In submitting a letter rather than a recommended decision, the district office acted according to the following internal policy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The [claims examiner] has discretion to conclude that a new claim has been adjudicated in a prior determination under the EEOICPA.... [N]o Recommended Decision is needed if a Final Decision has previously addressed a newly claimed condition. In such instances, the claimant is notified that the condition has previously been decided and that no further action will be taken without a request from the claimant to reopen the prior final decision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Federal (EEOICPA) Procedure Manual, Chapter 2-1600.3a(1) (October 2009).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Thereafter, Vander Boegh, on behalf of Plaintiffs, asked the district director to reopen all of Plaintiffs' claims. (AR 19-31). The district director denied the request, noting that Plaintiffs had not submitted new evidence relevant to whether Louis had CBD. (AR 1-12). On August 25, 2014, Plaintiffs filed the Complaint in the present action seeking judicial review of the agency's decisions regarding their Part B and Part E claims. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-27, DN 1). On October 27, 2014, DOL moved to dismiss the Complaint under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (6), asserting that the statute of limitations-along with the EEOICPA and Sixth Circuit precedent-rendered judicial review improper with respect to each of the agency's final decisions. (Def.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 7-15, DN 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   This Court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order (DN 31) addressing DOL's motion to dismiss. In that opinion, the Court noted Plaintiffs' Complaint failed to specify which agency decisions warranted judicial review. (Mem. Order &amp; Op. 4-5). Nonetheless, the Court gave Plaintiffs the benefit of the doubt and assumed that Plaintiffs sought judicial review of all agency decisions, including: (1) FAB's 2006 and 2007 decisions denying Plaintiffs' request for Part E benefits, (2) FAB's 2007 decision concluding that Louis did not develop CBD (the \"2007 decision\"), (3) the district office's 2010 letter declining to review Lanier's claim that Louis had CBD, and (4) the district director's 2014 decision rejecting Plaintiffs' request to reopen their claims. (Mem. Order &amp; Op. 4-10). The Court then granted DOL's motion as to all of Plaintiffs' claims\n   <em>\n    except\n   </em>\n   for their claim concerning the district office's 2010 letter. (Mem. Order &amp; Op. 5-10). In reaching its decision the Court reasoned that if the 2010 letter constituted a final agency decision, it was issued within the statute of limitations and may be jurisdictionally proper and entitled to judicial review. (Mem. Order &amp; Op. 8-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The parties then filed briefs addressing the question whether the district office's 2010 letter declining to issue a recommended decision with respect to Lanier's CBD claim was arbitrary and capricious. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opening Br. 1-27, DN 59; Def.'s Resp. Br. 12-20, DN 60).

DOL argues that this Court should not address the propriety of 2010 letter because the FAB's 2007 decision constitutes the final agency decision on the issue whether the submitted medical evidence supported a finding that Louis developed CBD. (Def's Resp. Br. 12-14). DOL also asserts that, even if the letter is reviewable, the decision contained within it was neither arbitrary nor capricious. (Def.'s Resp. Br. 14-18).

Broken down, Plaintiffs argue that, because the FAB's 2007 decision\n   <em>\n    should not\n   </em>\n   have addressed whether Louis developed CBD, the district office\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   have issued a recommended decision as to Lanier's CBD claim rather than the 2010 letter. (Pls.' Reply 2-8). Assessing the propriety of the 2010 letter would necessitate review of the FAB's 2007 decision; but, as this Court has already held, the statute of limitations bars review of that decision. (Memo. Order &amp; Op. 5). Therefore, Plaintiffs' position \"defies logic because [Plaintiffs] complain [only] of actions taken by\" the FAB in 2007-all of which occurred outside the limitations period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Slater\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"224286\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/120/623/#p631\">\n    120 F.3d at 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In sum, the FAB's 2007 decision-not the district office's 2010 letter-represents the final agency decision regarding the issue whether the submitted medical evidence established that Louis developed CBD as a result of his employment at PDGP. Therefore, the 2010 letter is not subject to judicial review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chicago &amp; S.

Though not explicit, Plaintiffs appear to take issue with the fact that the district office declined to produce a recommended decision regarding Lanier's \"new\" CBD claim. (Pls.' Reply 2-8). They seemingly assert that federal regulations require the district office to issue a recommended decision anytime a claimant files a new claim, regardless whether the agency has already reviewed that claim in prior proceedings. (Pls.' Reply 2-8). In essence, then, Plaintiffs contend that Chapter 2-1600.3(a)(1) of DOL's procedure manual-which allows district offices to forego review of claims that have been \"adjudicated in a prior determination\"-contradicts federal regulations and that, as such, decisions made pursuant to that procedure are arbitrary and capricious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Federal (EEOICPA) Procedure Manual, Chapter 2-1600.3a(1) (October 2009). DOL contends that the policy manual embodies its interpretation\n   of its own regulations and, as such, is entitled to deference on judicial review. (Def.'s Resp. Br. 17-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Given the parties' arguments, the Court must address two questions in reviewing the appropriateness of the 2010 letter. The threshold question is the extent to which DOL's procedure manual is entitled to deference. The secondary question is, in light of any deference afforded to DOL's procedure manual, whether the 2010 letter constitutes arbitrary and capricious agency action. The Court will address each of these issues in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Deference\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The provision in the procedure manual at issue is Chapter 2-1600.3(a)(1), which states that the claims examiner \"has the discretion to conclude to conclude that a new claim has been adjudicated in a prior determination under the EEOICPA,\" and that, no \"Recommended Decision is needed if a Final Decision has previously addressed a newly claimed condition.\" Federal (EEOICPA) Procedure Manual, Chapter 2-1600.3a(1) (October 2009).
