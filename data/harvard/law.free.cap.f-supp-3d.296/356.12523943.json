ZOBEL, SENIOR UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Maria Manuela Andrade-Hermort appeals from a final decision by the Acting Commissioner of Social Security (\"the Commissioner\") upholding the ruling of the Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") that denied her application for Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits (\"SSDI\"). Docket # 10. Plaintiff contends that the ALJ's finding that she could perform her past work was not supported by substantial evidence, and relatedly, that the ALJ erred by failing to consider the effects of her impairments when determining her residual functional capacity. The Commissioner filed a cross-motion seeking an order to affirm the decision. Docket # 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff filed an application for SSDI on February 11, 2014, alleging disability due to \"inflamatory [sic] [rheumatoid arthritis ], DDD back, possible Lyme Disease, brain\n   aneurysm s/p surgery with shunt in situ, HBP, risk of bleeding, right CTS-trigger finger-arthritis, impaired balance with falls, and L knee disorder\" beginning April 2, 2012. R. at 143.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Her claims were first denied on April 15, 2014, and again upon reconsideration later in July 2014. Plaintiff filed a request for a hearing before an ALJ, and a hearing was held on August 19, 2015. At the hearing, a vocational expert (\"VE\") testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Applicable Statutes and Regulations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   To receive SSDI benefits, a claimant must be unable \"to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which ... has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20423\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A). The impairment or impairments must be \"of such severity that [she] is not only unable to do [her] previous work but cannot, considering [her] age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20423\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1505\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The ALJ analyzes whether a claimant is disabled by using an established \"five-step sequential evaluation process.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1520\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(i)-(v). Under this framework, the ALJ first determines whether the claimant is currently engaging in substantial gainful work activity. If not, then at step two, the ALJ decides whether the claimant has a \"severe\" medical impairment or impairments, which means the impairment \"significantly limits [the claimant's] physical or mental ability to do basic work activities,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1520\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 404.1520(c). If the claimant has a severe impairment or impairments, the ALJ considers, third, whether the impairment or impairments meets or equals an entry in the Listing of Impairments, 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1, and meets the duration requirement. If so, then the claimant is considered disabled. If not, the ALJ must determine the claimant's residual functioning capacity (\"RFC\"), which is \"the most [a claimant] can still do despite [her] limitations,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1545\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). The ALJ then moves to step four and determines whether the claimant's RFC allows her to perform her past relevant work. If the claimant has the RFC to perform her past relevant work, she is not disabled. If the claimant does not, the ALJ decides, at step five, whether the claimant can do other work in light of her RFC, age, education, and work experience. If the claimant can, she is not considered disabled; otherwise, she is. \"Once the applicant has met his or her burden at Step 4 to show that he or she is unable to do past work due to the significant limitation, the Commissioner then has the burden, at Step 5, of coming forward with evidence of specific jobs in the national economy that the applicant can still perform.\"\n   <em>\n    Seavey v.

The ALJ's Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In a September 24, 2015, written decision, the ALJ found that plaintiff was not disabled under the Social Security Act. He first concluded that plaintiff did meet the insured status requirements of the Social Security Act through December 30, 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20423\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Then, he structured his decision around the five-step sequential evaluation process. At the first step, the\n   ALJ found that plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since the alleged onset date of her disability, and at step two, that she has several severe impairments: fibromyalgia and associated lower back pain, and arthritis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1520\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Nonetheless, he determined at step three that she does not have an impairment or combination of impairments that meets or medically equals the severity of one of those listed in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1 because \"the medical evidence does not show a gross anatomical deformity [or] findings based on appropriate medically acceptable imaging of joint space narrowing, bony destruction, or ankylosis (Listing 1.02).\" R. at 20. Before moving to step four, he wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [T]he claimant has the residual functional capacity to perform light work as defined in 20 CFR 404.1567(b) except that she can lift 20 pounds occasionally, and 10 pounds frequently; stand or walk at least 6 hours in an 8-hour workday; sit (with normal breaks), about 6 hours in an 8-hour workday; frequently climb or balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, or crawl, but never climb a ladder; and, she must avoid concentrated exposure to hazards.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1520\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He found plaintiff's allegations only \"partially credible\" because the \"treatment notes in the record do not support the conditions to which she testified.\" R. at 22.

The consultants relied solely on a review of plaintiff's medical record in order to complete plaintiff's physical RFC assessment. There is nothing in the medical evidence record, however, that supports their RFC assessments-and thereby the ALJ's RFC determination-that plaintiff can occasionally lift twenty pounds, frequently lift ten pounds, stand and/or sit about 6 hours in an 8-hour workday, and frequently climb, kneel, stoop, crawl, and crouch.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. at 59, 70.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the ALJ erred in attributing \"great weight\" to these assessments in determining plaintiff's RFC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strother v.

He found, however, that after reviewing the evidence, \"these conditions [were] controlled, minimally treated, not treated at all, or that they lack objective medical evidence of a diagnosis, treatment, or functional limitations in support thereof.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10521913\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/34/13/#p18\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Thus, the ALJ ultimately concluded that these additional alleged conditions \"have little to no impact on the claimant's ability to do work like activities, and, at worst, [are] non-severe in nature.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10521913\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/34/13/#p18\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    In the Work History Report, plaintiff identified the following prior job titles: \"Case Manager\"; \"Residential instructor\"; and \"Teacher's aid [sic]\". R. at 155. During the hearing, the VE identified plaintiff's relevant prior work to correspond with the following titles and Dictionary of Occupational Titles (\"DOT\") code: Social services aide (DOT 195.367-010) and teacher's aide (DOT 249.367-074). Accordingly, \"Social Service Aide\" is synonymous with \"Case Manager\".\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    The Commissioner attempts to side-step this argument by claiming that \"the ALJ did not conclude that Plaintiff could perform that type of past relevant work [i.e., being a case manager who had to climb steps],\" but rather found that plaintiff \"would still be able to perform work as a social service aide ... with her impairments and the assessed RFC.\" Docket # 14, at 15. This argument is both perplexing and incorrect. The ALJ never addressed the issue of climbing steps, nor asked the VE what are the job requirements for a case manager. Instead, in the hypothetical he presented to the VE, he assumed that the \"individual has the ability to\n    <em>\n     frequently\n    </em>\n    climb,\" R. at 47 (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Further, the record is missing page three of plaintiff's work history report, dated March 3, 2014, which appears to have included the job description of her role as a Teacher's Aide.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 174-75 (\"Page 2 of 8\" followed by \"Page 4 of 8\"). Although plaintiff failed to put in issue how her limitations prevented her from satisfying the requirements of being a teacher's aide, it is unclear how the ALJ could have concluded that plaintiff had the RFC to perform her past job as a teacher's aide without an understanding of what the job entails.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1520\">\n     20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (f) (requiring ALJ to compare his RFC assessment with the physical and mental demands of plaintiff's past relevant work).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Although in plaintiff's Function Report, she states that she is able to perform household tasks, drive, shop for groceries, read, watch t.v. and knit, R. at 165-68, she also reports that it was \"difficult\" to kneel and bend, and that she could not drive a car for long distances. R. at 37. Thus, it is unclear how these activities of daily living specifically support an RFC assessment that concludes plaintiff is able to frequently climb, kneel, stoop, crawl, and crouch.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
