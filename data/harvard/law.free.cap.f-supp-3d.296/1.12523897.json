Mr. Luczynski is an Attorney Advisor who is responsible for acting as a liaison between various divisions and offices of DOJ in responding to FOIA and Privacy Act requests. Luczynski Decl. \u00b6 1. Ms. Leeper is a legal assistant who serves as the FOIA and Privacy Act Coordinator for USAO CDIL, and who coordinates with EOUSA in response to all FOIA and Privacy Act requests for USAO CDIL. Leeper Decl. \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   EOUSA's declarant averred that each U.S. Attorney's Office maintains the case files for criminal matters prosecuted by that office, so, upon receiving plaintiff's request, EOUSA forwarded the request to EOUSA's FOIA contact in the Central District of Illinois. Luczynski Decl. \u00b6 13. He stated that the FOIA contact \"began a systematic search for records on 'Marcelo Sandoval' to determine the location of any and all files relating to plaintiff in order to comply with his request,\" which included a search for records from the case file in Case\n   <em>\n    #\n   </em>\n   99-cr-40019-JBM.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3479440,3479962,10532205,10532302\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/897/540/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The declarant referred to Ms. Leeper's declaration for further details about the searches conducted.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3479440,3479962,10532205,10532302\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/897/540/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Ms. Leeper provided details about USAO CDIL's computerized docketing/case management system known as LIONS, and she also stated that files could be located in any USAO CDIL office as well as the Federal Records Center in Chicago. Leeper Decl. \u00b6 8. From January 4, 2016, to June 13, 2016, \"emails were sent to employees of the CDIL ... advising\n   them to complete a search for responsive records.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. Ms. Leeper herself \"performed a physical search for opened and closed files, search for Federal Records Center files, the LIONS system, Windows, Outlook, PACER (court's website), and archived electronic computer files, for responsive documents relating to Sandoval, specifically case number 99-CR-40019.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The declarant stated that she located \"boxes of files relative to Sandoval, case number 99-CR-40019, as well as electronically stored files,\" but that after reviewing the documents, she did not find any responsive documents. Leeper Decl. \u00b6 12. She discussed this conclusion with the Assistant U.S. Attorney who handled plaintiff's case and \"he advised [her] that there were no documents responsive to Sandoval's request.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At that point, on June 13, 2016, Ms. Leeper advised EOUSA that no responsive documents were found.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Court has concerns about the declarations provided by EOUSA and USAO CDIL. First, the lack of clarity within the declarations made the task of assessing the adequacy of the search unnecessarily complicated. It appears that plaintiff sent three FOIA requests to EOUSA-one on August 31, 2015, one on September 11, 2015,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and one on October 20, 2015-but only the request sent in September was assigned a Request Number.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Luczynski Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-7. EOUSA informed plaintiff on October 9, 2015, that this FOIA request had been assigned FOIA No. 2015-04040. Luczynski Decl. \u00b6 7. Plaintiff did not submit his third request until ten days later.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. Yet, in describing her search for records, USAO CDIL's declarant cited the language from plaintiff's third request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Leeper Decl. \u00b6 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. C.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court recognizes that the three requests call largely for the same information, but the declarations should make it clear if all three were consolidated under a single request number, or if requests one and two were considered to have been superseded by the slightly broader third request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Turning to the searches themselves, the Luczynski declaration does adequately explain why the request was assigned to USAO CDIL, and the Leeper declaration sufficiently describes the various computer systems that were searched. But, the Leeper declaration, which Mr. Luczynski points the Court to for the \"most accurate description of the search,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Luczynski Decl. \u00b6 13, falls short in a few other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Leeper states that she \"performed a physical search for opened and closed files, search for Federal Records Center files, the LIONS system, Windows, Outlook, PACER (court's website), and archived electronic computer files,\" Leeper Decl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 11, but she fails to explain why these were the locations searched.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oglesby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3486337,10542054\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/920/57/\">\n    920 F.2d at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, the declaration asserts that \"emails were sent to employees of the CDIL ... advising them to complete a search for responsive documents,\" Leeper Decl. \u00b6 10, but it does not identify who those employees were and what their responsibilities are, nor does it aver that no other custodians were likely to possess responsive documents, or describe the types of records searched or the search methodology used by the employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oglesby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3486337,10542054\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/920/57/\">\n    920 F.2d at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the declarant states that she searched electronic databases \"for responsive documents relating to Sandoval, specifically case number 99-CR-40019,\" but she does not list the search terms used, and while she states that she personally reviewed the paper and electronic files that were uncovered, she does not describe what she did to search the electronic files.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Leeper Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 11-12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oglesby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3486337,10542054\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/920/57/\">\n    920 F.2d at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Although agency affidavits are afforded a presumption of good faith, that presumption can be rebutted when \"a review of the record raises substantial doubt\" that certain materials were overlooked.\n   <em>\n    Valencia-Lucena\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11662837,3669414\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/321/\">\n    180 F.3d at 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    Founding Church of Scientology\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3785360,11114\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/610/824/\">\n    610 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   837 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Truitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3479440,3479962,10532205,10532302\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/897/540/\">\n    897 F.2d at 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If, however, the record leaves substantial doubt as to the sufficiency of the search, summary judgment for the agency is not proper.\").

The FBI searches were adequate.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   To describe its searches for records in this case, the FBI proffered the declaration of David Hardy, the Section Chief of the FBI Record/Information Dissemination Section, Records Management Division.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hardy Decl. \u00b6 1. The declarant explained at length the FBI's recordkeeping systems,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-24, and the means by which FBI's staff conducted searches for records responsive to plaintiff's two FOIA requests.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-29. Specifically, the declarant stated that the FBI staff conducted multiple index searches of the Central Records System using variations of plaintiff's name, and ultimately his aliases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-28. A search conducted after plaintiff filed this lawsuit resulted in the location of eleven pages of responsive records.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 28.

Upon review of the FBI's supporting declaration, including the detailed coding system that the FBI used to guarantee, to the best of its ability, that the only information withheld is exempt or \"so intertwined with protected material that segregation is not possible without revealing the underlying protected material,\"\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-33, 35, the Court concludes that the FBI has met its segregability obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court will dismiss plaintiff's Privacy Act claims against all defendants, and it will dismiss plaintiff's FOIA claim against BOP. With respect to defendants' motion for summary judgment on plaintiff's FOIA claims, the Court will deny the motion in part as to defendants DOJ, EOUSA, and USAO CDIL because the declarations provided to the Court do not describe an adequate search for documents in response to plaintiff's FOIA requests. The Court will remand the case to the agencies to provide a more detailed and clear justification for the adequacy of the searches, and to release any reasonably segregable non-exempt material to plaintiff consistent with FOIA. However, the Court concludes that the FBI conducted adequate searches for documents, properly withheld information pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 6, 7(C), 7(D), and 7(F), and has met its segregability requirement. Therefore, defendants' motion for summary judgment will be granted in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   A separate order will issue.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    The language of plaintiff's FOIA request to BOP is not cited in defendants' statement of facts, motion, or the declaration of Dominick Desanto, despite Mr. Desanto's statement that \"a true and accurate copy of Mr. Sandoval's FOIA request\" was attached to his declaration.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Decl. of Dominick Desanto [Dkt.\n    <em>\n     #\n    </em>\n    17-4] (\"Desanto Decl.\") \u00b6 3. However, this information is irrelevant since the Court will grant defendants' motion to dismiss the FOIA claim against BOP in light of plaintiff's failure to respond to defendants' motion to dismiss that claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    It is unclear which FOIPA request USAO CDIL had received at this point in time, and on what date USAO CDIL actually received it.

This sentence structure implies that the same request that USAO CDIL initially sent to EOUSA made its way back to USAO CDIL after EOUSA processed it. However, in describing USAO CDIL's search for responsive records, its declarant cited to language contained in plaintiff's third FOIPA request, which was sent in October 2015.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Leeper Decl. \u00b6 5.
