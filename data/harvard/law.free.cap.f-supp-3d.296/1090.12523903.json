INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On September 14, 2017, the undersigned United States District Judge heard oral argument on Defendant Osseo Area School District, ISD No. 279's (\"Osseo\" or the \"School District\") Motion for Summary Judgment [Docket No. 17], and Plaintiffs Jane Doe, John Doe, and Minor Doe, by and through his Legal Guardians, Jane Doe and John Doe's (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") Motion for Summary Judgment [Docket No. 33]. For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs' Motion is denied and Defendant's Motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Graffiti Discovered on November 9, 2016\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Around 12:45 p.m. on November 9, 2016, a student discovered racist graffiti written\n   in whiteout on an inside stall door and toilet paper dispenser in a boys' bathroom at Maple Grove Senior High (the \"School\"). Vernig Decl. [Docket No. 19] \u00b6 3; Kenney Decl. Ex. 1 [Docket No. 25] (\"Hr'g Tr.\") at 46:2-8. The graffiti included \"#Gobacktoafrica,\" \"#whitesonly,\" \"#whiteamerica,\" and other racist, hostile phrases. Vernig. Decl. \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Assistant Principal Naida Grussing-Neitzel (\"Grussing-Neitzel\") learned about the graffiti from a student management specialist. Hr'g Tr. 127:11-13. Grussing-Neitzel directed that the bathroom with the graffiti be locked, and that the rest of the school's bathrooms and locker rooms be checked for possible graffiti.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   129:13-130:3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The presence of the graffiti spread quickly among the students through social media causing significant tension.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   130:14-20; 217:10-17. The School staff was fully occupied responding to distraught and concerned students.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   130: 7-12. The School was also fielding an \"avalanche of calls\" about the graffiti, including over 19 media inquiries within a few hours after the graffiti was discovered.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   130:7-20; 217:25-218-3; 258:3-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The School's Investigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Because of the large number of black students enrolled at the School, Grussing-Neitzel determined that the graffiti posed a student safety issue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   130:21-131:4. She quickly initiated an investigation to discover the responsible student.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   131:5-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After reviewing the security camera footage, Grussing-Neitzel and her administrative team surmised the graffiti had to have been written between 11:18 a.m. and 12:05 p.m.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   132:2-133:12. The security footage was also used to identify students who were in the bathroom for an extended period of time between 11:18 a.m. and 12:05 p.m.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   131:22-132:1. The film review led the investigation to focus on two suspects, Plaintiff Minor Doe was one of those suspects.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   136:6-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Grussing-Neitzel and another assistant principal interviewed Minor Doe the following afternoon.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   144:11-23. Minor Doe explained his presence in the bathroom on the security film by saying he left class and went to the bathroom to address a bloody nose.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   144:25-145:2. Minor Doe denied going into the stall where the graffiti was written, claiming that he stayed in front of the large mirror by the sinks the entire time he was in the bathroom.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   145:18-147:3. Minor Doe then allowed Grussing-Neitzel to search his backpack.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   147:4-17. Grussing-Neitzel discovered that Minor Doe was carrying a whiteout pen and a purple binder with \"K.L.U.R.P.\" written on it in whiteout.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   147:4-17. Minor Doe explained that \"K.L.U.R.P.\" was a \"PlayStation group\" and that some of his female classmates in his fourth period English class wrote it on his binder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   148:18-149:11. Grussing-Neitzel suspended Minor Doe for five days based on the information from the security footage and the items discovered in his backpack.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   152:4-12. During Minor Doe's suspension, the School's investigation continued.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   153:21-154:3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Assistant Principal Josie Johnson (\"Johnson\") interviewed all of the girls in Minor Doe's English class to corroborate Minor Doe's story about \"K.L.U.R.P.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   155:24-156:4. The girls all denied writing anything on Minor Doe's binder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   156:7-10. Two or three girls reported seeing Minor Doe write with whiteout on folders during class.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   156:11-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Grussing-Neitzel, Johnson, and other School officials interviewed every student observed entering the bathroom between\n   11:18 a.m. and 12:13 p.m.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   156:24-157:12. No student reported seeing another student in the bathroom with a bloody nose.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   231:2-9. Security footage also showed Minor Doe casually walking to bathroom without holding his nose, which was contrary to Minor Doe's statement that he had to leave class in a hurry because he had a bloody nose.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   233:4-16. The School concluded that Minor Doe's story \"fell apart.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   233:1-3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On Friday, November 18, the School determined that Minor Doe wrote the racist graffiti in the bathroom and initiated expulsion proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   159:9-160:11; 182:19-23; 260:19-262:8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Minor Doe\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In April 2016, approximately seven months before the graffiti incident, the School provided Minor Doe with an educational plan pursuant to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Doe Aff. Ex. 1 [Docket No. 37] (\"Section 504 Plan\"). Minor Doe has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (\"ADHD\"), Major Depressive Disorder, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   His Section 504 Plan states that he lacks confidence in his academic abilities and struggles with self-advocacy and organization.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Section 504 Plan accommodates Minor Doe by: 1) scheduling his classes in a manner to ensure continuity of teachers, 2) having a counselor check-in to provide academic support, 3) providing additional time to complete assignments, and 4) breaking down longer assignments into smaller parts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Minor Doe has not received services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The November 21, 2016 Meeting\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Because Minor Doe was a Section 504 student, the School District was required to follow certain procedures prior to expulsion. On November 21, 2016, the School convened a meeting of Minor Doe's Section 504 Team to conduct a \"Section 504 Manifestation Determination.\" Emmons Decl. [Docket No. 20] Ex. 1. The purpose of the meeting was to determine whether \"Minor Doe's conduct was caused by Minor Doe's Section 504 disabilities.\" Emmons Decl. \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Kate Emmons (\"Emmons\"), the School District's Director of Student Services, directed the meeting, which was attended by Minor Doe's guardians and their attorney, the School's Principal and Assistant Principal, Minor Doe's math teacher, a School counselor, and the School District's legal counsel. Emmons Decl. \u00b6 5. The School principal reviewed the disciplinary incident, explaining that Minor Doe committed vandalism and violated racial harassment policies by using whiteout to write racial slurs in a boys' bathroom.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. The group then reviewed and discussed Minor Doe's: 1) Section 504 Plan; 2) diagnostic report from a therapist working with him; 3) his overall academic performance; 4) classroom observations from his math teacher; 5) current graduation requirements; and 6) background before being enrolled at the School.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After reviewing this information, the School personnel determined that Minor Doe's disabilities as identified on his Section\n   504 Plan did not cause him to write the racist graffiti in the bathroom.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. Minor Doe's guardians and their attorney disagreed with that determination and believed that Minor Doe's disability was the cause of the misconduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Shortly after the meeting, District-Level Principal Sara Vernig (\"Vernig\"), who was not present for the meeting itself, and the School District's attorney met with Minor Doe's guardians and their attorney. Vernig Decl. \u00b6 6. Vernig explained that because of the determination that Minor Doe's behavior was not a manifestation of his Section 504 disabilities, she needed to discuss the discipline-related options available to Minor Doe's guardians.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. Vernig offered several options to Minor Doe's guardians to avoid expulsion proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 9. Minor Doe's guardians did not agree to any of the proposed options, but continued to challenge the School's conclusion that Minor Doe engaged in the offensive conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. At the end of this meeting, Minor Doe's guardians requested the School District send them the expulsion hearing notice so they could evaluate whether to accept one of the School District's offers of alternative educational services at another secondary school.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The December 20, 2016 Expulsion Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The School District sent an expulsion hearing notice to Minor Doe's guardians on December 1, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. Prior to the hearing, Minor Doe's guardians did not agree to the School District's offers to avoid expulsion, insisting that Minor Doe be allowed to return to School.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Due to the severity of the incident and it causing school-wide disruption as well as concerns for Minor Doe's safety, the School District did not permit Minor Doe to return to School.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The expulsion hearing was held on December 20, 2016, before an independent hearing officer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13; Hr'g Tr. 1:8-12. The hearing officer heard testimony from 11 witnesses for the School District and received 30 exhibits, 29 of which were offered by the School District.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   3:7-4:19; 5:6-7:17. No witness testified on behalf of Minor Doe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The hearing officer concluded that \"there is no doubt that [Minor Doe] was responsible for writing the graffiti on the Maple Grove High School bathroom stall door and toilet paper dispenser.\" Kenney Decl. Ex. 3 [Docket No. 27] at 50. The hearing officer recommended that Minor Doe be expelled from the School for 12 months.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    F. The School District Passes a Resolution Expelling Minor Doe\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On December 27, 2016, the School District convened a special meeting of the School Board. Kenney Decl. Ex. 4 [Docket No. 28]. The School Board members present at the meeting unanimously agreed to expel Minor Doe for 12 months, effective December 7, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Minor Doe's guardians did not appeal the expulsion decision to the Minnesota Department of Education.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    G. The Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Amended Complaint [Docket No. 4] alleges that the School District violated Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act by expelling Minor Doe \"without first conducting a reevaluation of the kind specified in Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.\" \u00b6 74. Plaintiffs further allege that the School District violated Minor Doe's rights under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \"by \"applying an unlawfully high standard to determine whether Defendant was obligated to accommodate Minor Doe's disability.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs seek an order restoring Minor Doe's enrollment at the School.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Both parties have moved for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

According to Plaintiffs, the former standard is part of the IDEA, while the latter standard is part of Section 504 and the ADA. Plaintiffs contend that the School District's use of the higher \"caused by\" standard is not supportable and has no foundation in the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The School District argues that Section 504 does not set forth explicit procedural requirements for Section 504 students. Instead, Section 504 demands covered entities establish certain procedural guarantees, which may be satisfied by utilizing protections specified in the IDEA. The School District also argues that the causation standard it applied mirrors interpretive guidance issued by the Office of Civil Rights (\"OCR\"), the sub-agency of the U.S. Department of Education primarily responsible for protecting civil rights in education programs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The standard applied by the School District comports with the standard used in other school discipline cases.

Further, the OCR has long utilized a causation standard that aligns with this standard. OCR has advised that, under Section 504, prior to implementing an exclusion that constitutes a significant change in placement, the first step is to determine \"whether the misconduct is caused by the child's handicapped condition.\"\n   <em>\n    OCR Memorandum-Long-Term Suspension of Expulsion of Handicapped Students\n   </em>\n   , 307 IDELR 05 (OCR 1988). The OCR utilizes this \"caused by\" standard in its decisions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Prince William Cty. (VA) Pub. Schs.\n   </em>\n   , 68 IDELR 286 (OCR 2016) (\"When a significant change in placement is for disciplinary reasons, the first step in the reevaluation is to determine whether the student's disability caused the misconduct.\");\n   <em>\n    E.

Plaintiffs' attempt to sidestep OCR authority is unavailing. First, contrary to Plaintiffs' contention, the causation standard for determining whether student misconduct was a manifestation of the student's disability is not imported from employment or housing discrimination cases. Plaintiffs do not cite any Section 504 student discipline\n   case utilizing the causation standard they argue that the School District was required to apply. Second, the Supreme Court has held that an agency's interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to \"substantial deference.\"\n   <em>\n    Thomas Jefferson Univ. v.
