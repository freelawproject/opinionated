Orrick, United States District Judge\n   Currently before me are the parties' motions for summary judgment and motions to exclude expert testimony. Defendants move for summary judgment as to all of plaintiffs' claims, but as described below plaintiffs have significant evidence that Watson could have (if not would have) ultimately prevailed in the '529 litigation and a cognizable (if not disputed) theory of alternate injury in a but-for world. Defendants' motion is DENIED.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs more narrowly move for partial summary judgment that they have satisfied the \"contract, combination, or conspiracy\" element of their Section 1 and Section 2 claims (defendants do not oppose) and also to define the relevant antitrust market as the market for generic and brand 5% lidocaine patches. Rejecting defendants' arguments in support of an essentially unlimited market for pain relief products, I agree that plaintiffs have shown on undisputed material facts that the relevant market is the market for 5% lidocaine patches and GRANT their motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The general background and history of this litigation is well known and laid out in my prior orders.

Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment on All Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs' case rests on two theories of antitrust injury causation: (i) absent the large reverse payment, Watson would have launched at-risk; and (ii) absent the large reverse payment the parties would have reached an alternative \"no payment settlement\" giving Watson early entry into the market. Pls. Oppo. to MSJ [Dkt. No. 819] at 1. Defendants argue that summary judgment must be granted in their favor on plaintiffs' first theory because Watson's infringement of the '529 patent breaks the \"chain of causation\" as illegal activity and cannot support an antitrust claim. Plaintiffs counter that under Ninth Circuit case law, the chain cannot be broken by the '529 patent, but even it if could, plaintiffs have ample evidence from which a reasonable juror could determine that Watson would have prevailed in the patent litigation. As to plaintiffs' second theory, defendants argue that the \"hypothetical\" settlement proposed by plaintiffs is not legally cognizable and not supported by evidence in the record. Plaintiffs counter that numerous courts have recognized that hypothetical settlements are an acceptable basis for causation and that there is significant evidence in the record that a reasonable juror could rely on to find that, absent the reverse-payment settlement agreed-to in this case (hereafter Settlement), another\n   settlement would have been reached to allow Watson early-entry to the market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Necessity to Address Watson's Chances of Success in the '529 Patent Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that they need not show that Watson would have likely won the '529 patent litigation in order to prevail at trial in this case. They rely primarily on the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    F.T.C. v. Actavis, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698465\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/136/\">\n    570 U.S. 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698465\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/136/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698465\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/136/\">\n    186 L.Ed.2d 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). There, the Court explained that \"it is normally not necessary to litigate patent validity to answer the antitrust question (unless, perhaps, to determine whether the patent litigation is a sham....An unexplained large reverse payment itself would normally suggest that the patentee has serious doubts about the patent's survival.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698465\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/136/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 2236 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   3 Philip E. Areeda &amp; Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law \u00b6 2046d2 (Supp. 2016) (\"The size of the payment operates as a surrogate for direct patent-law-based questions about patent quality. Indeed, payment size may actually be a more reliable indicator to the extent it reflects the settling parties' market-based judgment about the patent's prospects in a fully litigated infringement suit.\"). According to plaintiffs, that is exactly the shape of this case; the reverse settlement payments are unexplained by legitimate factors (such as avoidance of litigation costs or the provision of other services) and are indisputably large. Plaintiffs also rely on their expert, Professor Einer Elhauge, who opined that if Endo thought it had more than a 15.1% chance of winning, Endo would not have rationally agreed to the Settlement because its expected profits from continuing to litigate would have exceeded its profits from the settlement. Elhauge Report, Declaration of Dena Sharp [Dkt. No. 819] Ex. 1 [Dkt. No. 819-2] \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8, 147-48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Recent decisions have limited the use of sole reliance on a large and unexplained reverse payment as a proxy for the weakness of the underlying patents to cases, like\n   <em>\n    Actavis\n   </em>\n   , that are brought by the FTC. In a detailed analysis, the district court in\n   <em>\n    In re Wellbutrin XL Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5901723\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/133/734/\">\n    133 F.Supp.3d 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Pa. 2015), as affirmed by the Third Circuit, concluded that the Supreme Court's admonition in\n   <em>\n    Actavis\n   </em>\n   that \"it is normally not necessary to litigate patent validity to answer the antitrust question\" was limited to the context of an action brought by the FTC under the FTC Act's \"more relaxed\" \"likely to\" causation standard.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5901723\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/133/734/\">\n    133 F.Supp.3d at 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court concluded that where private litigants are proceeding under the Clayton Act, that Act's more stringent \"proximate cause\" standard requires showing that it was the settlement that precluded competition and not the patents.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5901723\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/133/734/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If that could not be proved, the patent protection provided to the brand manufacturer (and that manufacturer's right to exclude) cuts off the chain of causation. \"In other words, if an agreement only replicates the effect of the underlying patent litigation, any exclusion resulting from that agreement must be caused by the underling patent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5901723\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/133/734/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 765 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Wellbutrin Xl Antitrust Litig.

In reaching that conclusion, the First Circuit accepted the proposition that \"the plaintiffs did not present such evidence that the brand-name's patents would have been declared invalid or that an at-risk launch would not have infringed the patents. And without such evidence, the 'patent served as an independent regulatory bar to [a generic's] launch.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122341\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/842/34/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122341\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/842/34/\">\n    at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Wellbutrin XL Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5901723\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/133/734/\">\n    133 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   767 );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5901723\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/133/734/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"The district court thus did not err by requiring some evidence of the patents' invalidity or noninfringement before allowing the plaintiffs to pursue an at-risk launch theory.\");\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Apotex, Inc. v.

The fact that the patent in question has been found to be invalid and non-infringed is relevant evidence on that required proof.

Plaintiffs point out that under the Hatch-Waxman Act and Paragraph IV litigation scheme, generic entrants are allowed into the market prior to patent expiration or invalidity. They need only secure an ANDA approval and have made the Paragraph IV certification that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anesta AG v.

There, Memorex brought antitrust claims against IBM who in turn asserted as a defense that Memorex's own wrongful acts (theft of IBM's trade secrets) barred Memorex's antitrust claims. The Ninth Circuit held \"that illegality is not to be recognized as a defense to an antitrust action when the illegal acts by the plaintiff are directed against the defendant. A wrongful act committed against one who violates the antitrust laws must not become a shield in the violator's hands\n   against operation of the antitrust laws.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"962128\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/555/1379/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"962128\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/555/1379/\">\n    at 1382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, I do not find\n   <em>\n    Memorex\n   </em>\n   as persuasive as plaintiffs contend. Here, it is not defendants' attempting to use plaintiffs' illegal conduct, or even Watson's conduct, as a shield against antitrust liability. Instead, the question is what amount of evidence (if any) must plaintiffs present to substantiate their assertion that defendants' reverse settlement was motivated by Endo and Teikoku's concerns that their patent rights were at serious risk in light of Watson's patent litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   More persuasive are plaintiffs' criticisms of the\n   <em>\n    Wellbutrin\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Nexium\n   </em>\n   decisions, and also their argument that they have, nevertheless, met the burdens imposed on plaintiffs in those cases.

That turducken is not only unappetizing as a matter of judicial efficiency, it is not required (or even suggested) by the\n   <em>\n    Actavis\n   </em>\n   opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, to put their at-risk launch theory of antitrust causation to the jury, plaintiffs\n   must show \"some evidence\" that Watson could have won at trial before Judge Sleet or on appeal at the Federal Circuit.

Watson's Chance of Success in the '529 Patent Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that significant evidence exists that a reasonable juror could rely on to find that Watson was likely to succeed in the '529 litigation including: (i) the large reverse payments themselves; (ii) Watson's positions in its Paragraph IV certification and during the '529 litigation; (iii) defendants' contemporaneous assessments that the '529 patent was weak; (iv) the testimony of the parties' respective experts that Watson would have won on appeal on invalidity defenses (as well as defendants' own experts concession that Watson would have won in the district court on infringement); and (v) the evidence of record in the '529 litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   No one disputes that the record in the '529 patent litigation was closed at the time of the parties' settlement. There had been a six day bench trial and the parties had submitted post-trial briefing. All that remained was for the Judge Sleet to issue his findings of fact and conclusions of law. As discussed below, for purposes of ruling on this motion, I conclude that plaintiffs have put forth significant evidence that Watson could have prevailed in the '529 litigation. While there is \"some evidence\" that Watson could have won on invalidity with respect to anticipation and non-infringement, I need not consider that evidence in-depth, because plaintiffs present stronger evidence on invalidity due to obviousness and unenforceability due to inequitable conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Contemporaneous Evidence from Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs note that in filing its ANDA application, Watson was required to and did certify that the '529 patent was invalid, unenforceable, and would not be infringed by Watson's planned generic. Watson spent over two years actively litigating the issues, contrary to defendants' current characterizations of Watson's chances of success.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The parties' contemporaneous statements, according to plaintiffs, also support a finding that Watson would have prevailed, including:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (i) Watson CEO's November 2011 earning call statements about its \"strong litigation stance\" and intent to start sales in 2012, Sharp Decl., Ex. 3 at 7. Defendants argue that these statements-made before the patent trial started-are irrelevant because they ignore the key question here, what would have happened at and after trial and on appeal;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (ii) A July 2012 Watson memorandum that \"the patents covering Lidoderm are not valid,\" that \"Watson's legal assessment\" was that the patents were weak, and that as such Watson had been preparing for launch upon FDA approval in July or August of 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., Ex. 4 at 1. The same memorandum described \"Watson's legal assessment of the patent held by Endo as being weak.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Defendants note that the provenance of this \"draft\" disclosure statement is in dispute, as the purported author, Joe DosSantos denied having knowledge of it;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (iii) A February 2012 email from Endo General Counsel Caroline Manogue characterizing the patent as \"very weak\" and deposition testimony from Teikoku's outside counsel characterizing Endo's \"negative impression\" of the strength of the patent. Sharp Decls., Exs. 5 (email) and 6 (Shimoda Depo. Tr.) at 267-269. Defendants again downplay the significance of these documents, as they too were drafted\n   before the patent trial, which they believe is the relevant point of focus; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (iv) Draft Endo accounting letters from July 2012 that, \"[w]hile the settlement with Watson was reached prior to the court's ruling, it was the view of [Endo's] management that there was a significant probability that the courts may find one or more of the patents to be invalid\" and that \"Watson and potentially other Companies may be able to launch a generic version of Lidoderm.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., Ex. 7 at 11. Endo also admitted that it \"believed a ruling in favor of Watson was very plausible, thus furthering our desire to settle.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Ex. 8 at 15. Defendants characterize these as having been written by individuals without knowledge of the '529 patent litigation and were prepared for review by others with actual knowledge \"to fill in the gaps.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   This evidence is relevant. Although its implications and importance are clearly disputed, it is significant enough-in combination with the expert opinions discussed below-to defeat defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Expert Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiffs rely most heavily-and defendants dispute most vigorously-on the testimony of plaintiffs' patent experts. After reviewing the trial record in the '529 litigation, those experts opine that Watson would have prevailed, if not in trial court then on appeal, on the issues of invalidity due to anticipation and obviousness, as well as unenforceability due to inequitable conduct before the PTO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Anticipation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that Watson would have won on anticipation, maybe at trial but definitely on appeal, based on Watson's argument and evidence at trial that the '529 claims were anticipated by the \"Takeda reference\" that disclosed a lidocaine hydrogel patch.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants challenge that assertion, arguing-as they did in the underlying '529 trial-that because the Takeda reference did not sufficiently disclose use of lidocaine in the patch, it did not \"enable\" a lidocaine patch. Defendants also argue that because Takeda did not disclose a particular concentration of lidocaine that could be used in the patch, the Takeda disclosure cannot support the \"adequate description\" requirement of an anticipation defense. Plaintiffs, in turn, dispute those contentions, arguing that the record below shows and arguments on appeal would have established that lidocaine was sufficiently disclosed. More particularly, as the Takeda reference discusses various embodiments, the teaching to use \"expected clinical effect\" was sufficient in conjunction with the fact that the Takeda concentration ranges overlap with the 5% lidocaine concentration claimed in the '529 patent, even if a 5% concentration was not expressly identified within Takeda for lidocaine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   For support, plaintiffs rely on Professor Martin Adelman who opines that based on\n   the record before the trial court, Watson would have won on anticipation in light of the Takeda reference. Adelman Report (Declaration of Dena Sharp [Dkt. No. 819-1], Ex. 12 [Dkt. No. 819-13] ) \u00b6\u00b6 22-37.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reviewing the evidence admitted at trial and the argument made by both Watson and Endo, Adelman opines that \"a reasonable factfinder would conclude that Takeda discloses both lidocaine and discloses the use of lidocaine in a soft patch formulation in [the various disclosed ranges of concentration].\" Adelman Report \u00b6 37.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendants counter with patent litigator Robert S. Frank, Jr., who disputes Adelman's conclusions and opines that Judge Sleet would have not found Takeda anticipating. Frank Report (Declaration of Daniel B. Asimow [Dkt. No. 786-1], Ex. [Dkt. No. 786-12], \u00b6\u00b6 48-49. Frank argues that in order for Watson to have won on anticipation, Judge Sleet would have had to credit Watson's expert (Walters) over Endo's expert (Lane), which he was unlikely do given Judge Sleet's statements in closing argument suggesting that he found Lane credible over Walters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-47;\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Report of David L.

However, Judge Sleet had not yet ruled and there was significant, if disputed, evidence in the record to support both sides. Reviewing the record and arguments as a whole, plaintiffs have produced \"some\" evidence that Watson would have won on anticipation, if not at the district court, then on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Obviousness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiffs rely again on Adelman, who opines that even if anticipation was\n   not shown, \"the Takeda reference presented a strong case for obviousness, especially when combined with the Teikoku Hydrogel Art and Topical Lidocaine Art.\" Adelman Report \u00b6 108;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-81.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs note that Endo's expert in the '529 trial admitted that the only distinction between the '529 claims and Teikoku's own prior-disclosed hydrogel art was lidocaine, and Watson showed through its expert that Takeda disclosed a lidocaine hydrogel patch that made the '529 claims obvious.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendants argue that plaintiffs have failed to adduce evidence that Watson was likely to succeed on both prongs of the obviousness test: to show person of ordinary skill in the art had (a) the motivation to make the invention and (b) a reasonable expectation of success in doing so. Defendants point out at that at trial Endo spent much time arguing through its expert that the art was unpredictable and even Watson's expert had not made a lidocaine hydrogel patch (although he had formulated other lidocaine patches). As to motivation, defendants acknowledge that there was \"conflicting testimony\" in the trial court, but again rely on Judge Sleet's comments during closing that he would credit Endo's expert over Watson's, and that Endo's expert (Lane) made an extensive argument that prior art \"taught away\" from putting lidocaine in a hydrogel patch because all prior lidocaine patches were water-free.

Closing Argument Tr. at 45, 108-09. Plaintiffs respond that Judge Sleet's inclinations cannot be deciphered solely from the comments identified by defendants and point out that Judge Sleet also referred to the importance of full disclosure to the PTO from a factual and policy perspective and noted he was free to draw reasonable inferences based on Watson's attempt to show specific intent to deceive. Closing Argument Tr. at 23 105-107.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Plaintiffs also argue that there was sufficient evidence and supporting argument in the record so show that Teikoku engaged in an inequitable \"failure to disclose\" because the declarations submitted to the PTO asserted only \"fictional distinctions\" over prior art and its experts (and Watson's at the '529 trial) asserted that the non-disclosure was material and Ono's failure to disclose the prior art was egregious. Defendants respond that because Watson did not assert affirmative misrepresentations (based on omissions) in the '529 trial itself, plaintiffs cannot rely on that theory to show Watson could have won on that ground in this case. However, the evidence underlying this theory is\n    <em>\n     in\n    </em>\n    the '529 record and even if not expressly argued at closing, could have formed a basis of either the trial court or Federal Circuit's decisions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Plaintiffs have presented strong evidence that Watson could have succeeded on unenforceability.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    <em>\n     Other Grounds\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Defendants argue that in light of an erroneous claim construction by Judge Sleet (as subsequently confirmed by the Federal Circuit in\n    <em>\n     Multilayer Stretch Cling Film Holdings, Inc. v.

Cir. 2016) ), Watson would have lost its appeal on infringement. Plaintiffs do not really dispute this position, although they rely on an expert for the essentially-agreed-to position that Watson would have won on non-infringement at the trial court level. Instead, plaintiffs argue in passing that Endo bears the burden to show infringement on summary judgment\n    <em>\n     here\n    </em>\n    -because they bore that burden in the '529 litigation-and they failed to do so. Pls. Oppo. to Defs. MSJ at 22. Defendants dispute this, contending that because it is plaintiffs' burden here to show antitrust injury premised on non-infringement or invalidity, they bear the burden to show non-infringement by Watson. Plaintiffs have\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    introduced \"some evidence\" that a reasonable juror could rely on to find that Watson would have ultimately won on non-infringement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Similarly, defendants also move for \"summary judgment\" on the \"derivation defense,\" arguing plaintiffs cannot establish a genuine issue of material fact that Watson could have proven in the '529 litigation that a third-party conceived of the '529 invention. Defs. MSJ at 12. Plaintiffs do not address this defense in their Opposition.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Accordingly, under Rule 56(g), the material facts that Watson could not have won on non-infringement and derivation are established for trial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    <strong>\n     iii. '529 Litigation Record\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Plaintiffs also rely on three categories of evidence introduced by Watson in the '529 litigation that a reasonable juror could rely on to determine that Watson would have won at trial and on appeal without regard to plaintiffs' experts' analyses. That evidence concerns: (i) anticipation by Takeda; (ii) obviousness in light of the Teikoku\n    Hydrogel prior art and teachings to use lidocaine in those patches; and (iii) inequitable conduct before the PTO. Pls. Oppo. to Defs. MSJ at 16-18.

Plaintiffs' Alternative Theory of Causation\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Plaintiffs have a second theory of causation; that absent the reverse-payment Settlement, the parties still would have agreed to an anticompetitive settlement, but one where no payment was made and only early generic entry was allowed. Defendants argue that this theory is not legally viable (and move to exclude the expert testimony submitted in support of it).

Starting from this proposition, and using the terms of the Settlement agreed to and the companies' own profit projections, Elhauge calculated that if Endo thought it had more than a 15.1% chance of winning, it would not have rationally agreed to the actual Settlement. Elhauge Report \u00b6\u00b6 6, 147. Then he considered the various possible strengths each party could have rationally had with respect to the litigation, to produce a range of feasible no-reverse-payment-settlement early entry dates that still would have provided each party with a payoff exceeding its litigation payoff. Plaintiffs explain that Leffler's analyses, while different, are also firmly rooted in economic theory and tied to the facts in this case. Leffler used economic literature analyzing settlements, but then also calculated Endo's profits from winning versus losing the patent litigation and weighted those expectations based on the objective expectations provided by Adelman.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Both of these case-based analyses-applying accepted principles in antitrust law and settlement analysis to evidence in this case-are different than what happened in\n    <em>\n     Wellbutrin\n    </em>\n    .

According to defendants, Watson's manufacturing difficulties required Watson to pause its production of generic Lidoderm in June 2012; after technical and operational fixes, it resumed production in September 2012. Plaintiffs' position is that absent the Settlement, Watson would not have paused to make those fixes and continued production. Defendants respond that even if that is correct, the level of production would have continued to be slow (much slower than it was in the actual world after the fix) and Watson would not have had 23 million patches until July 21, 2013.

The Cossart and Spigiel testimony raise a dispute of material fact precluding a finding under Rule 56(g).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    As to the amount of patches Watson wanted to have at launch, 23 million patches (launch quantities plus 4 weeks of inventory) or 35 million patches (launch quantities plus 12 weeks inventory), plaintiffs rely on testimony from Watson's plant General Manager Spigiel that \"sufficient quantities\" for launch, 23 million patches, were not achieved until March 2013 and that Watson documents show that 23 million patches was the forecasted launch quantity. Pls. Oppo. to Defs. MSJ re Causation at 4-6. Defendants respond that a \"typical\" launch would have required 12 weeks of supply, relying on the testimony of then-Assistant Director of Materials Lee Lamborn, who also testified that he could not recall a launch where Watson had less product on hand. The documents plaintiffs rely on, according to defendants, address a reduced launch supply and show that the launch target for Lidoderm was a moving target. Again, the differing interpretations of the documents at issue and related testimony raise a material dispute of fact for the jury precluding a finding under Rule 56(g).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Defendants' motion for partial summary judgment on this limited issue is GRANTED and plaintiffs' attempted-cross motion is DENIED.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    <strong>\n     III.

Defendants oppose and contend that the market should include a host of other pain medications that come in various forms including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and Celebrex, anticonvulsants like Lyrica, antidepressants like Cymbalta, muscle relaxers like Flexeril, opiods like tramadol, and topical anesthetic creams and gels like Qutenza.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Plaintiffs argue that there is no cross-elasticity of demand between Lidoderm and\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    other product (other than generic Lidoderm ), and that therefore as a matter of law the relevant market is limited to Lidoderm and its generics. They contend that defendants' experts did not consider the key and necessary legal issue of cross-elasticity of demand at all. Defendants counter that cross-elasticity of demand is relevant but not\n    <em>\n     required\n    </em>\n    to determine the relevant product market, and that other considerations-including evidence that other products are therapeutically similar and evidence about non-price competition in the pharmaceutical industry-are relevant to the determination of the product market to be decided by the jury.

Bell and Dr. Christopher J. Gilligan. Gilligan, a pain medicine specialist, provided a report identifying the clinical uses of Lidoderm and products that could be substituted for those clinical uses in place of Lidoderm. Gilligan Report [Dkt. No. 776-32]. Gilligan admits that Lidoderm was approved by the FDA to treat postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), but contends it is also \"frequently prescribed\" to treat other neuropathic, musculoskeletal and myofascial pain conditions, as well as pain associated with arthritis and other miscellaneous pain conditions.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 18. When using Lidoderm to treat musculoskeletal/myofascial pain, Gilligan opines that \"physicians will often consider Lidoderm to be interchangeable with the following prescription and over-the-counter ('OTC') medications: lidocaine gel/ointment/cream, topical and systemic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ('NSAIDs'), acetaminophen, certain opioids and muscle relaxants.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 20.\n    <footnotemark>\n     28\n    </footnotemark>\n    When treating pain associated with \"arthritis, especially osteoarthritis, physicians consider Lidoderm to be interchangeable with lidocaine gel/ointment/cream, topical NSAIDs, such as Voltaren Gel or Flector Patch, and systemic NSAIDs such as Aleve, Advil or Motrin, Celebrex, and Tylenol.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 21. When treating \"PHN and other neuropathic pain conditions, physicians may consider Lidoderm to be interchangeable with topical lidocaine gel/ointment/cream, capsaicin creams and patches, systemic nerve pain medications including anticonvulsants (such as Neurontin and Lyrica), antidepressants (such as Nortriptyline, Amitriptyline, and Cymbalta ), acetaminophen, and as well as opioids (particularly tramadol ).\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 22.\n    <footnotemark>\n     29\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Using the information from Gilligan, actual prescription data, and additional other sources showing Lidoderm could be interchanged with other treatments-including clinical guidelines and formulary placements-Bell agreed that Lidoderm was not only used to treat PHN but also used \"extensively\" to treat other forms of neuropathic pain, pain from arthritis, and musculoskeletal pain.

Those documents show that Endo made efforts to convince physicians to prescribe Lidoderm over other the other drugs, including Neurontin, Lyrica, capsaicin, topical aspirin formulations, lidocaine gel, and Qutenza.

As a result, Endo heavily marketed its products to physicians (including extensive use of free samples) and used rebates and other price concessions with MCOs and PBMs to encourage adoption and inclusion of Lidoderm. Defendants cite evidence that Endo consistently tracked its sales/prescriptions of Lidoderm in comparison with therapeutically similar products, primarily anticonvulsants (like Lyrica) and the Qutenza (capsaicin ) patch. But defendants do not show that the availability of those other products\n    <em>\n     forced\n    </em>\n    Endo to limit its Lidoderm price or otherwise constrained Endo's pricing. That Endo has evidence that physicians and MCOs were concerned about the \"high\" price of Lidoderm and prescribed more or made more available where prices were lower or significant rebates were provided does not mean that the\n    <em>\n     other\n    </em>\n    products on the market for treatment of PHN and other pain conditions constrained the price of Lidoderm.

Dr. Glenn Melnick opines that the unique method of administration (transdermal patch) distinguishes Lidoderm from other PHN treatments and that Endo's ability to maintain \"inflated\" prices demonstrates that there are no constraints\n    on the price of Lidoderm from other products. Kohn Decl., Ex. F, Melnick Report [Dkt. No. 776-6] at \u00b6\u00b6 88-91. Finally, plaintiffs also rely on Endo's own evidence and testimony that Endo did not forecast or expect that wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) price increases would result in Endo losing sales to other drugs.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Kohn Decl., Ex. I, Depo. Tr. Brian Lortie [Dkt. No. 776-9] at 254; Kohn Decl., Ex. N, Depo. Tr. Andrew Gesek [Dkt. No. 776-14] at 194.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    If evidence on price competition is required, defendants argue that they have it. Bell analyzed Lidoderm's\"own price elasticities\" to show that when rebates to MCOs/PBMs decreased, utilization decreased and vice-versa. Bell Report \u00b6\u00b6 71-74. Plaintiffs respond that evidence of one's \"own price elasticities\" is not sufficient to allow inclusion of\n    <em>\n     other\n    </em>\n    , uncompared-on-price products in the relevant antitrust product market. For example, that Endo increased its price concessions to MCO's from 2008 through 2013 (before generic entry) does not necessarily show that Endo was in price competition with other drugs. It could equally reflect that Endo decided to provide rebates in order to encourage MCOs to continue to provide access (or preferred access) to Lidoderm in their formularies and to increase profits by taking measures to increase the ultimate number of prescriptions by providing larger rebates to MCOs.\n    <footnotemark>\n     40\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Defendants then challenge plaintiffs' experts' evidence on lack of cross-elasticity as deficient and argue that it cannot support summary judgment. The primary deficiency identified by defendants is that plaintiffs' experts-particularly Singer-relied on wholesale acquisition cost (WAC or list price) as opposed to net price (after rebates or other incentives). Defs. Oppo. to Pls. MPSJ at 21-24. Defendants contend that net prices are what matters, given the significant level of rebates and other incentives provided to MCOs. Bell Report \u00b6\u00b6 88, 98. Plaintiffs respond that Singer testified that at least for Lidoderm, increases in the WAC closely correlated with changes in net price. As a result, his use of WAC does not undermine his analysis. Asimow Decl., Ex. 8 (Singer Depo. Tr.) at 675:20-676:10.\n    <footnotemark>\n     41\n    </footnotemark>\n    In contrast, defendants' expert Bell asserted only \"that growth in gross sales of Lidoderm outpaced the growth in net sales, indicating that gross prices grew faster than net price.\" Bell Report \u00b6 88. While Bell criticized Singer's (and plaintiffs' other experts') reliance on WAC, Bell did not indicate or offer an analysis on how large the purported gap between those two was or address in substance Singer's analysis that changes in the gross and net prices were largely correlated. Bell Report \u00b6 88.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    In sum, plaintiffs present evidence that price data and sales data show that during the relevant time there was no significant cross-elasticity of demand between Lidoderm and any product other than generic Lidoderm. Those analyses are generally supported by defendants own documents and analyses. Defendants show, at most, an issue regarding Lidoderm's\n    <em>\n     market share\n    </em>\n    for PHN and pain treatment with respect to only a few of the drugs defendants believe should be included in the relevant antitrust market (and at most a limited concern over the price of Lidoderm with respect to the 2010 entry of one drug, Qutenza), but those discrete references are insufficient to raise a material question of fact on whether the availability of those drugs\n    <em>\n     constrained\n    </em>\n    the price charged for Lidoderm.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    <strong>\n     4.

Motion to Exclude in Part Bell\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    If plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment as to the definition of the relevant antitrust product market is denied, plaintiffs move to exclude the testimony regarding that market by defendants' expert Dr. Gregory K. Bell. Dkt. No. 778. However, as noted above, plaintiffs' motion is granted, thereby making moot Bell's testimony regarding the market definition and his criticisms of plaintiffs' experts' testimony relevant to price-elasticity and market definition. Other portions of Bell's testimony may still be relevant to issues to be decided at trial. What, if any, remaining issues Bell may address at trial can be determined on a motion in limine prior to trial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    <strong>\n     2. Motion to Exclude in Part Carlton\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    Plaintiffs move to exclude in the testimony of Dr. Dennis Carlton, to the extent of his testimony regarding: (a) the possibility that after losing the patent trial against Watson, Endo might be able to obtain an injunction against Watson before any appellate ruling; and (b) whether and/or how\n    <em>\n     F.T.C. v. Actavis, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698465\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/136/\">\n     570 U.S. 136\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698465\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/136/\">\n     133 S.Ct. 2223\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698465\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/136/\">\n     186 L.Ed.2d 343\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2013) should be applied to the facts of this case. As to the first issue, plaintiffs argue that Carlton, as an economist, is not qualified to opine on whether had Watson won at trial (which both sides agree was the likely outcome), Endo/Teikoku could nevertheless have secured an injunction preventing Watson from entering the market. As to the second issue, plaintiffs argue that Carlton's opinion-that the inferences and burdens created by the Supreme Court in\n    <em>\n     F.T.C. v. Actavis, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698465\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/136/\">\n     570 U.S. 136\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698465\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/136/\">\n     133 S.Ct. 2223\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698465\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/136/\">\n     186 L.Ed.2d 343\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2013) should not apply in this case because in his view a cash payment (like the one in\n    <em>\n     Actavis\n    </em>\n    ) is competitively different than the $96 million worth of free branded Lidoderm that Endo gave to Watson-should be excluded because that is an impermissible legal conclusion and outside the realm of his expertise in economics.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    Defendants respond that the \"testimony\" plaintiffs seek to exclude are not Carlton's central opinions. Carlton's central opinions are that: (i) accounting for the projected royalties associated with the no-AG clause, the clause is more rationally viewed as a payment from Watson, rather than a payment to Watson; (2) the settlement inventory had procompetitive features ignored by plaintiffs' experts because it \"allowed Watson to compete in those situations where it would not have been able to otherwise\" due to lack of FDA approval; and, in any event, (3) the settlement did not delay generic entry or otherwise harm competition relative to expected outcomes from continued patent litigation. Carlton Report, Asimow Decl., Ex. 4 [Dkt. No. 807-4] \u00b6\u00b6 46, 77, 94. As to the first issue identified by plaintiffs, defendants argue that the testimony plaintiffs are concerned with arose in Carlton's deposition where he described his opinions as \"conserva\n    tive\" because they did not rely on Endo seeking and securing an injunction and because Carlton did nothing more than identify an injunction pending appeal as one possible factor but one he did not rely on in reaching his \"conservative\" opinion. As to the second issue, defendants characterize plaintiffs' concern as being one over deposition testimony they elicited but not part of Carlton's opinions. That said, defendants argue that because plaintiffs' experts testify that it is of no consequence as an economic matter that the free products and no-AG-competition provisions provided were \"not payments,\" Carlton should be able to dispute that by arguing that the non-cash \"payments\" here were \"competitively different\" from an exchange of cash. Carlton Oppo. at 6.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    The issue of an injunction is not central to Carlton's opinions and so plaintiffs' motion is DENIED, subject to renewal at trial if Carlton's testimony ventures into whether an injunction was possible or expected. On the purported significance between cash payments and other types of payments, the motion is GRANTED in part.\n    <em>\n     No expert\n    </em>\n    may opine that there is a legal significance to cash versus non-cash payments in reverse payment settlements. However, the expert economists can discuss any differences that various types of payments had or have on competition.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    <strong>\n     3. EPPs' Motion to Exclude Fritz\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    The EPPs renew their motion from class certification to exclude the opinion of John Fritz that health insurer members of the EPP class have not suffered any economic harm due to delayed-entry of a generic alternative for brand Lidoderm because any overcharges were passed on. Dkt. No. 769. The EPPs argue, again, that Fritz is not qualified to offer that opinion based on his general actuarial experience (a) because he lacks knowledge of how insurers set premiums or actual practices with respect to Lidoderm and (b) his opinion is based on the experience of one opt-out plaintiff (GEHA) and were not validated to any of the actual class members. The EPPs point out that I denied premium-related pass on discovery in April 2016, because there was, at that juncture, no evidence that any plaintiff insurer had been able to \"recoup\" amounts spent in the past on prescription drugs when setting employer contribution rates for the future. April 5, 2016 Minutes.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    However, in ruling on the motions for class certification, I denied the motion to exclude Fritz, concluding:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n    The weight to be given Fritz's opinion (based on his experience, or lack thereof, and based on the information he did or did not review) is more appropriately challenged at summary judgment or trial. Moreover, while the relevance of Fritz's opinion has not been fully briefed or finally determined (although I have expressed skepticism that the \"pass-on\" defense will be allowed in this case at least with respect to the federal claims), as explained above the opinion is not persuasive in my determination of the EPPs' certification motion.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    February 2017 Class Certification Order at 51-52.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    Defendants rely on the fact that I did not exclude Fritz at the class certification stage and contend no new challenges to his testimony have been adduced by plaintiffs. Defendants also argue, again, that pass-on is a defense to many of the EPPs' state law claims. Fritz Oppo. [Dkt. No. 804].\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    I DENY the motion to exclude. Fritz has actuarial experience and understanding of how, at least in some instances, insurers negotiate and set premiums. Any deficiencies or weaknesses in his testimony based on a lack of facts or experience\n    pertaining to how the EPPs in this case actually set premiums can be fully explored at trial. I will, however, accept a jury instruction to expressly limit any pass-on defense to the applicable state law claims. Plaintiffs are correct that defendants have not, at this juncture, shown that any type of pass-on defense is applicable to the direct purchaser federal claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    <strong>\n     4. Motion to Exclude in Part Moffitt\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    Plaintiffs move to exclude the testimony of Professor Michael Moffitt to the extent Moffitt proffers testimony to the effect that in the \"but-for world,\" defendants might behave economically irrationally in negotiating a patent settlement without a large reverse payment. Moffitt Mot. [Dkt. No. 771]. Plaintiffs contend that Moffitt's testimony about negotiator irrationality (\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , that sometimes negotiators act irrationally and against their economic interests) creates a danger of unfair prejudice and is contrary to antitrust law's presumption that firms act rationally. Plaintiffs point to Moffitt's opinion that economically rational settlements might not be reached where:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    parties might hold unrealistic views of the strengths of their case (Moffitt Report [Dkt. 771-8] at \u00b6\u00b6 66(a), (b)); \"might fear to signal agreement\" out of reputational concerns (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 66(c)); might adopt a stubborn, \"take-it-or-leave-it\" approach (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 66(d)); or might reject reasonable offers for a variety of other \"psychological reasons.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 10. Plaintiffs assert that testimony about these \"human factors\" are improper in a trial where participants must be assumed to be rational profit-maximizers.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    Defendants counter that since plaintiffs are contending (under their disputed second causation theory) that defendants would have negotiated a hypothetical settlement that bears little resemblance to the actual Settlement, they are entitled to rely on Moffitt. Defendants also challenge plaintiffs' characterization of Moffitt's testimony, arguing that he does not in fact testify that the parties would have acted in an economically irrational manner but that there are several evidentiary-based reasons why parties may never reach an agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    A few initial points bear emphasis. As plaintiffs clarified at the hearing, they only seek to exclude testimony from Moffitt that the parties might have acted in an economically irrational way, as that runs against the presumption in antitrust cases-including those underlying but-for analyses-that economic actors act in economically rational and profit maximizing ways. Hearing Tr. at 96:2-6. Moffitt's testimony concerns two broad areas: first, what factors would have gone into determining whether there was a \"zone of possible agreement\" (ZOPA) between Endo/Teikoku and Watson and if the negotiation history and other facts show a ZOPA existed does that \"necessarily demonstrate that real-world negotiators\" could have reached a settlement; and, second, if the settlement negotiations were restricted to entry date only (plaintiffs' alternative but-for scenario), would a settlement have occurred and (if so) could an alternate start date be reasonably determined. Moffitt Report \u00b6 2.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-155\">\n    I agree with plaintiffs that in the experts' competing testimony about the but-for world, only opinions that are economically rational may be provided.\n    <footnotemark>\n     42\n    </footnotemark>\n    Factors\n    that are economically rational (\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , consideration of the impact of a potential settlement on other or future litigation) are admissible. So is testimony that access to imperfect information or overconfidence based on that imperfect information (as opposed to irrationality) can impact settlements or willingness to enter settlements.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Moffitt Rep. \u00b6\u00b6 66a. I am not aware of cases showing that these well-known imperfections and hurdles in the settlement process suffered by economically rational actors are impermissible considerations in constructing but-for worlds; therefore, that testimony is permissible. But to the extent that Moffitt or any expert intends to opine that even though other economically rational settlements could have been reached, economically irrational factors (\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , a general but irrational reticence to settle) would have foundered any settlement, that testimony will not be admissible.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    I recognize that this ruling does not lead to a clean segregation of what is impermissible and excludable in Moffitt's report and testimony. Plaintiffs themselves, although moving to exclude in part, have not identified which specific portions of the Moffitt Report that they seek to exclude by line or paragraph number.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 771-10 (Proposed Order). In advance of the pretrial conference, the parties should attempt to agree on the topics to which experts will not be allowed to testify with respect to the theoretical but-for settlement proposed by plaintiffs consistent with this Order, and submit any disputed issues for my determination.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    <strong>\n     5. Motion to Exclude Murthy\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    Plaintiffs seek to exclude the opinion of Mr. Harsha Murthy, offered by defendants as an expert on pharmaceutical company decision-making relating to \"at-risk\" and authorized generic launches-that \"it is very unlikely that a company in Watson's position would have launched a generic version\" of Lidoderm at-risk because Murthy made \"no effort to examine the facts in this case specifically or in the generic drug industry generally to determine what a reasonable company would do here, rendering his opinion wholly speculative and thus unreliable.\" Murthy Mot. at 1 [Dkt.

EPPs' Motion to Exclude Navarro\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    The EPPs move to exclude the September 2, 2016 Report of Dr. Robert Navarro that discusses how payments flow for prescription drugs in managed care systems and responds to the opinions of plaintiffs' expert W. Paul DeBree on the same. As explained in the briefing on the motions for class certification, Narvarro opined that: (1) \"As a result of the individualized and complex nature\" of contractual relationships in the \"market for prescription drug benefits,\" individualized inquiry\" is necessary to evaluate the \"harm, if any\" to class members from the conduct at issue and to \"ascertain proposed class members\"; (2) claims data, even if available, fails to properly reflect rebate data and thus the price paid by class members; and (3) Pharmacy Benefit Managers (\"PBMs\") may pay or reimburse for Lidoderm or generic lidocaine through \"spread pricing\" or guaranteed rebates. Navarro Report [Dkt. No. 550-35] \u00b6\u00b6 9-15. The EPPs argue, first, that Navarro's opinions were elicited to defeat class certification (on ascertainability) and, therefore, are irrelevant at this juncture. Second, they argue his opinions are unreliable and based on pure speculation that because PBM might bear theoretical risk from their spread pricing and rebate strategies, there is no evidence that any PBM in the class period actually suffered injury (as opposed to the EPPs) with respect to Lidoderm. Third, as a result, his testimony is unduly prejudicial and likely to confuse the jury.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    Defendants respond that Navarro's opinions are based on his extensive experience in the industry and critical to injury and state law damages issues to show that some of the overcharges were either not passed onto the EPPs or absorbed in whole or in part by other parties. Defendants are correct that Navarro's testimony is not irrelevant. That said, plaintiffs are correct that the same defect in Narvarro's testimony that existed at class certification continues; while Narvarro identified a risk that PBMs could suffer all or some of the harm on a particular transaction for a particular drug because of their spread-pricing and rebate practices, he did not identify any instance of that happening with respect to Lidoderm (and plaintiffs' witnesses testified that there was no harm to PBMs in the relevant timeframe). Therefore, at trial, his testimony will be\n    limited to the fact that PBMs could have borne the risk of injury, but he cannot opine that PBMs suffered harm on their Lidoderm transactions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    Defendants are also correct that in the class certification Order I recognized that Navarro's opinions could be relevant to apportionment of damages. February 21, 2017 Class Certification Order [Dkt. No. 670] at 39 n.33. However, damages was not a focus of Navarro's expert report (as noted above, its primary if not sole purpose was to undermine ascertainability) and is mentioned only twice in passing. Narvarro also admitted at his deposition that he was not retained as a \"damages expert.\" Navarro Depo. Tr. [Dkt. No. 834-2] at 131:10-14. That does not mean his testimony is wholly irrelevant to damages. As this juncture, I will not preclude limited testimony by Navarro-given his background and experience-into the relationships between PBMs and plan sponsors, as well as pharmacies and manufacturers, and how rebates play into the payment flows for prescription drugs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-165\">\n    <strong>\n     7. Motion to Exclude Schaede\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    Plaintiffs seek to exclude the testimony proffered by the Teikoku entities of Professor Ulrike Schaede concerning Japanese business practices and how Teikoku's role and agreement with respect to the Settlement reflected typical Japanese business practices. Specifically, plaintiffs object to Schaede's opinions that: (i) Japanese business culture differs from Western business culture, in that Japanese business culture emphasizes long-term trade relationships built on trust and behavioral norms such as incremental commitment, obligation, loyalty, and intertemporal exchange of favors, and (ii) Teikoku's decisions-engaging Endo as a U.S. distributor, amending a supply agreement with Endo, giving Endo \"substantial control\" over patent infringement litigation, and entering the settlement agreement with Watson-are \"entirely consistent with Japanese business practices, and understandable in light of what a typical Japanese company would perceive and do in this situation. Schaede Report [Dkt. No. 772-2].\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    Plaintiffs argue that these opinions have no relevance to the antitrust issues and that admission of the testimony would be unduly prejudicial and risk jury confusion under Rule 403. Plaintiffs surmise that Teikoku wants to introduce this testimony to show its \"good motives\" and reluctance to join the agreement but that it did so out of obligation. Plaintiffs contend that good motives are irrelevant, as is Teikoku's purported reluctance.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    Teikoku responds that the purpose of Schaede's opinions is two-fold: to show that Teikoku did not have the \"intent\" to monopolize when it entered the agreement, relevant to the Section 2 Sherman Act claim; and to explain why Teikoku contributed to the Settlement (to preserve its good relationship with Endo), which in its view is a traditional and legitimate settlement consideration under\n    <em>\n     Actavis\n    </em>\n    and a \"justification\" defense that cannot be precluded through a motion in limine.

Teikoku Sur-Reply re Schaede at 2-3. Plaintiffs, by moving to exclude Schaede's testimony as not relevant under the law, are not raising a \"dispositive\" issue that should have been raised in a summary judgment motion.

Motion to Exclude Adelman &amp; Shah\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    Defendants move to exclude in part the opinions of plaintiffs' experts Professor Martin Adelman [Dkt. No. 819-13] and Dr. Kishore Shah [Dkt. No. 819-15], who offer expert testimony on what would have been the likely outcome of the '529 patent litigation, on the grounds that those experts' opinions are divorced from the record evidence in the '529 trial. Dkt. No. 780.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-182\">\n    <em>\n     Adelman\n    </em>\n    . Defendants move to exclude Adelman's opinions on validity and enforceability. Defendants argue that because he did not opine on how Judge Sleet or the Federal Circuit would have decided validity and enforceability, but instead analyzed validity and enforceability as a \"reasonable factfinder,\" his opinions are based on the wrong legal standard. Defendants posit that Adelman used the \"reasonable factfinder\" construct to avoid statements made by Judge Sleet on the credibility of witnesses that would, if considered, undermine Adelman's opinions. Adelman &amp; Shah Mot. at 4. Defendants also complain that Adelman makes an argument on enforceability (regarding misleading statements made by Teikoku in declarations and responses\n    to the PTO) that was not made at trial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-183\">\n    In his deposition, Adelman explains that \"reasonable factfinder\" was short hand for how the factfinder in the first instance (as anticipation is a question of fact) should have and then the Federal Circuit on appeal (under a clearly erroneous standard of review) would have decided the validity question. Adelman Depo. Tr. [Dkt. No. 817-2] at 70:12-16; 101:15-21. When discussing questions of law, like obviousness and inequitable conduct, Adelman referred to \"the court\" (including the Federal Circuit on review).\n    <footnotemark>\n     50\n    </footnotemark>\n    Adelman Report \u00b6 39.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-184\">\n    As to Judge Sleet's comments that Adelman supposedly ignored, I do not find them as certain or persuasive as defendants assert. While Judge Sleet asked a question about the significance and impact of a decision to credit Endo's witness (Lane) over Watson's (Walters) on some undisclosed bases and issues, it was phrased as a question and by no means indicates how Judge Sleet was going to credit the testimony, let alone how he would rule. As to the credibility that Judge Sleet found (much more affirmatively and specifically) concerning the '529 inventor (Ono), even though Judge Sleet found Ono credible, that does not answer the question of how he would have ruled on the intent to deceive issue with respect to Ono's representations made to the PTO. Indeed, as plaintiffs point out, Judge Sleet also expressly acknowledged that he could\n    <em>\n     infer\n    </em>\n    intent and recognized the important policy considerations at play that encourage full disclosure of prior art to the PTO. Closing Argument Tr. 105. While all experts agree that Judge Sleet was going to find infringement in light of his comments and claim construction order, defendants point to no testimony or other indication how he was going to decide validity or enforceability other than the two statements identified above, which do not bear the weight defendants put on them.\n    <footnotemark>\n     51\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-185\">\n    Finally, as to the \"new\" argument Adelman makes that was, according to defendants, not argued by Watson-that Teikoku knowingly submitted materially misleading declarations to the PTO-plaintiffs point out that Watson argued in closing that the declarations submitted to the PTO focused on the \"unique\" nature of the patches claimed in the patent application and how that was indisputably not true in light of Ono's own prior art, even if Watson did not use the term \"misleading.\" Closing Argument Tr. at 94-96;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Adelman Depo.

That is sufficient to support Adelman's testimony.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-186\">\n    The motion regarding Adelman is DENIED.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-187\">\n    <em>\n     Shah\n    </em>\n    . Defendants argue that Shah reached outside the closed record of the '529 patent litigation to form his opinions on whether the '529 patent was valid and enforceable. Shah testified that his opinions were based on the trial court record as well as his own \"technical assessment of the case.\" Shaw Depo. Tr. [Dkt. No. 817-7]. As Shah explained in his deposition, because he was applying his scientific background and knowledge to his review of the trial record, his opinions were informed by scientific literature.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 21. Shah also explained that he relied on specific references (outside of the '529 record), but only to explain the \"technology\" background (and not as prior art references to the '529 patent) and those references did not impact his decision as to the '529 patent's validity or enforceability.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 95-96 (as background); 103 (book cited in report for background but did not \"impact my opinion about the validity or invalidity\"). Shah's reliance on his general knowledge and on specific references outside of the '529 record to explain the context for the technology at issue was not impermissible, especially given his clear statement that these additional references did not impact his opinions as to the '529 patent's validity or enforceability.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-188\">\n    Defendants also argue that Shah's refusal in his deposition to say whether his opinions would change if he were limited to the \"trial testimony\" was an admission that he relied on materials outside the trial record for his opinions. Adelman &amp; Shah Mot. at 7. But this \"concession\" is not as strong as defendants would hope. On its face, \"trial testimony\" doesn't necessarily include all of the\n    <em>\n     evidence\n    </em>\n    before the '529 trial court (and available for the Federal Circuit's review on appeal). Shah also repeatedly clarified that he was asked to look at \"all the information\" and \"all of the references\" to give his opinions. Shah Depo. Tr. at 129, 130. But nowhere in his deposition were defendants able to identify a particular reference or piece of information that was verifiably outside the scope of the '529 record that Shah\n    <em>\n     relied upon\n    </em>\n    to form his opinion on validity and enforceability as to the '529 patent.\n    <footnotemark>\n     52\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-189\">\n    The motion to exclude is DENIED as to Shah.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-190\">\n    <strong>\n     2.

Elhauge Report [Dkt. No. 819-2] \u00b6\u00b6 6, 147.

Motion to Exclude Hardigan\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-200\">\n    Defendants move to exclude the opinions of Peter J. Hardigan, plaintiffs' designated expert to opine on the amount of litigation expenses (including trial and appellate expenses) that defendants saved by settling the two pending patent infringement cases relating to Lidoderm, the '529 litigation and the \"Rolf litigation\"\n    <em>\n     Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Watson Laboratories, Inc.\n    </em>\n    , No. 1:11-cv-00575 (D. Del.). Hardigan Mot. [Dkt. No. 785] at 1.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-201\">\n    Defendants attack the qualifications of Hardigan, as he is neither a lawyer nor an expert in patent law but instead works in patent and patent litigation investing.\n    <footnotemark>\n     53\n    </footnotemark>\n    Defendants complain that Hardigan did not examine the patents or the record involved in either the '529 or the Rolf patent litigations. Accordingly, they argue that his opinions-about projected appellate costs based on a belief that Endo/Teikoku would have lost at the trial court in the '529 case and that the Rolf case would have been less expensive to litigate given that it was related to the '529 litigation (which defendants contest)-are examples of why his analysis is unreliable and excludable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-202\">\n    As an initial matter, plaintiffs confirm that Hardigan will not be opining on whether Watson\n    <em>\n     would\n    </em>\n    have won at the trial court; his analyses are based on that assumption. With respect to the Rolf litigation, Hardigan did not simply rest on his understanding that the two lawsuits were closely related and could generate cost efficiencies. He started with the '529 litigation costs as a \"significant input\" for his analysis of the Rolf costs, but also looked to defendants' documents and deposition testimony regarding costs budgeted and (where data was provided) actually incurred at specific rates and stages of the two cases in order to help him reach his ultimate conclusions. For example, he noted that Watson budgeted (and at various stages incurred) less costs for the Rolf case than the '529 case. Hardigan Report \u00b6\u00b6 3.1, 5.1-5.4. He also \"back stopped\" his analyses by comparing them to the American Intellectual Property Associations publication on median ANDA litigations costs. Hardigan Report \u00b6 6.1. Defendants do not point to any of Hardigan's calculations as\n    misstating the evidence or argue that he came up with unreasonable estimates (\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Hardigan's estimate that the Rolf litigation would have cost Endo $7.9 million, less that the estimated costs for the '529 patent but still more than the median costs to try an ANDA case).\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 6.1. Hardigan did use the expenses occurred through trial in the '529 patent as a benchmark for his Rolf patent estimates, but did not rely exclusively on the \"relatedness\" between the two. Defendants may use that issue-and their belief that Hardigan relied too heavily on it-as a basis for cross-examination.\n    <footnotemark>\n     54\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-203\">\n    As to his ability to predict and experience in predicting costs made on those types of assumptions, defendants complain that Hardigan's only prior experience on cases that went to trial were two cases that did not involve pharmaceuticals. Plaintiffs counter that Hardigan has estimated litigation costs for hundreds of projects. More specifically, for the (at least) 50 patent litigation cases he managed, even where a contingency or flat fee arrangement was adopted, Hardigan estimated what the legal fees would be by each stage of the case on a \"full fee\" basis. Hardigan Depo. Tr. [801-2] at 156-57. Defendants do not explain why his limited direct experience with pharmaceutical patent litigations undermines his ability to estimate costs here. Given the record evidence he considered as well as relevant publications, he has sufficient expertise and knowledge to estimate legal fees for this type of litigation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-204\">\n    The motion to exclude is DENIED, except (as noted above and agreed-to by plaintiffs) Hardigan will not be allowed to testify on the likely outcome of the '529 litigation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-205\">\n    <strong>\n     4. Motion to Exclude Leffler\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-206\">\n    Defendants move to exclude the opinions of Dr. Keith B. Leffler in support of plaintiffs' alternate causation theory that in the hypothetical but-for world, but-for the reverse payment, the defendants nonetheless would have agreed to a settlement allowing Watson into the market on a date before its actual September 15, 2013 entry. Dkt. No. 782; Dkt. No. 782-2 (Leffler Report).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-207\">\n    Leffler started his analysis by evaluating the expected profits from litigation as opposed to an alternative settlement, an analysis approved by a large amount of economic literature. He calculated Endo's profits from winning or losing the patent litigation and \"weighted\" the alternatives by the objective expectations (from Adelman's opinion) that Endo would win or lose. Leffler Report \u00b6 80. He initially concluded that Watson would have accepted a no-payment settlement allowing it early entry in October 2012.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 82. When considering the testimony of plaintiffs' manufacturing witness (Miller) that Watson would not have had sufficient launch quantities by that date, Leffler revised his estimate to a later date.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 83.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-208\">\n    Defendants argue that Leffler's analyses must be excluded because there is no peer-review published article that teaches taking standard and accepted economic analyses of settlements and applying them in a way to predict early entry in this sort of case. Leffler Mot. at 5-6. However, as with the challenge to Elhauge, that prior experts or academics have not combined different but\n    <em>\n     accepted\n    </em>\n    economic theories and\n    modes of analysis for patent settlements and then applied them to this specific set of facts-which are unique in the relatedness between the actual Settlement and consideration that the identical parties are essentially identically situated-is not surprising and does not require exclusion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Leffler Depo. Tr. [Dkt. No. 782-4] at 184 (the \"details\" of this model are specific to the facts of this case, although the conceptual underpinnings are from economic literature).\n    <footnotemark>\n     55\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-209\">\n    Defendants also argue that Leffler's opinions are somehow based on an impermissible inference that an anticompetitive effect can be inferred from simply the large reverse payment, which in defendants' view is impermissible under\n    <em>\n     Wellbutrin\n    </em>\n    . Leffler Mot. at 6. As noted earlier, I have concluded that the large and unexplained nature of the reverse-settlement payment (if established) is particularly relevant evidence even if not sufficient on its own. Moreover, Leffler explained that he did not rest solely on the inference, but also considered the terms of the actual settlement and the parties' expectations of the outcome of the litigation. Leffler Depo. Tr. 128-29.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-210\">\n    Defendants criticize Leffler's reliance on Adelman's estimate of the low likelihood that Endo would win the patent litigation because he did not test that figure/assumption himself and only received that figure the day before his report was due. As explained above, Adelman's opinions have not been excluded and are subject to testing at trial. As to the timing, Leffler explained in his deposition that he created his model and used a placeholder for the Adelman figure and was able to test different inputs in his model, but inserted the final figure when he received it shortly before his report was due. Leffler Depo. Tr. 211-213. There is nothing improper about this approach.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-211\">\n    Finally, defendants argue Leffler's opinions must be excluded because they are not based on sufficient facts in the record. This is the same argument made above. Because this case is set in a but-for world, it is not surprising that no evidence shows that defendants were contemplating anything other than the actual Settlement. Leffler's failure to address (or adequately address) various factors that defendants believed would impact Watson's actual ability to launch (status of Endo's Citizen Petition, Watson's manufacturing capacity, Teikoku's willingness to enter into a settlement) can be addressed on cross-examination.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-212\">\n    Leffler may opine that the parties would have been economically motivated to enter into a no-payment settlement as of a particular date or within a range of dates. He cannot testify that the parties would have entered on a date certain, as that impinges on a determination left up to the jury. Defendants' motion is otherwise DENIED.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-213\">\n    <strong>\n     5. Motion to Exclude Miller\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-214\">\n    Defendants move to exclude the opinions of Dr. Kenneth Miller, who opines that in the but-for world, Watson would have manufactured the 23 million patches earlier than it actually did. Dkt. No. 793; Miller Report [Dkt. No. 793-2]. Miller's\n    opinions rest on two assumptions: (i) Watson could and would have manufactured sufficient launch quantities by December 17, 2012 had it continued production and not stopped in June 2012; and (ii) even if Watson stopped in June 2012 and restarted in November 2012 after correcting manufacturing issues (what actually happened), Watson would have had sufficient launch quantities by January 2013, as long as it employed profit-maximizing strategies, including delaying a plant closure and working through the holidays.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-215\">\n    Defendants first argue that Miller's failure to fully explain his experience in patch manufacturing in his deposition prevented defendants from fully testing the reliability of his opinions. Defendants point out that Miller testified that he was involved with the development of a hydrogel patch, but he would not provide specifics because of confidentiality concerns and only responded that \"he had never been involved in the development of a hydrogel that has become a commercial product.\" Miller Depo. Tr. [Dkt. No. 793-4] at 62. The exchange continued:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-216\">\n    Q.

Tr. at 63. Defendants also complain that Miller failed to answer specific questions as to the exact mix, mix process, and application to a patch for a patch he worked on at Mylan, although Miller did respond with general answers about those processes.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 36-37. Miller also refused to identify the date that Mylan started working on a lidocaine patch.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 45-46. Finally, defendants complain that while Miller opined based on his experience that pharmaceutical companies would cancel vacations, holidays, and plant shut downs, he refused to disclose with which companies he had experiences with on those topics.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 184-85.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-222\">\n    Plaintiffs respond that Miller testified extensively about his experiences with matrix patches, including the Mylan patches that Miller initially expressed confidentiality concerns about before going on to testify fully about the general process of manufacturing them. Miller Depo. Tr. at 36:6-37:13. According to plaintiffs, Miller's experience with matrix patches is transferrable to hydrogel patches, so that his few limited confidentiality assertions on his experience with hydrogel patches is not a problem. Miller Oppo. at 2. As to his experience with plant operations (in order to rush product production), plaintiffs argue that because Miller identified the two companies he had worked at full-time (Mylan and Noven), and also went onto disclose that Mylan had one plantwide shutdown during his time and that he knew of instances where Mylan cancelled vacations due to production demands, the bases for\n    his opinions have been disclosed. 184-86, 188-89, 192-93.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-223\">\n    Generally, reviewing his testimony as a whole, I find that Miller disclosed enough about his experience with matrix and hydrogel patches to allow defendants to test his level of experience.\n    <footnotemark>\n     56\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-224\">\n    Defendants also move to exclude Miller's opinions on what Watson \"would have done\" because Miller has no relevant expertise on those subjects, including his purported profit-maximizing strategies. While Miller admitted that he had not been responsive for \"pulling the switch and manufacturing a first commercial batch that I signed off on, I will grant you that. No, I haven't done that[ ]\", Miller Depo. Tr. at 60, he went onto explain, that \"there are a lot of processes that occurred before that that are at that level of responsibility.\" Miller Depo. Tr. at 60;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    at 61 (testifying to his \"extensive involvement in\" pre-commercial production and that he \"had many responsibilities throughout the organization and they did involve whether or not products were commercially manufactured and how that was done.\"). As to employee schedules, he testified that he did not set company calendars, but he did have employees work through holidays \"for him\" and had knowledge of companies' practice in the area.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 62.\n    <footnotemark>\n     57\n    </footnotemark>\n    Again, read in full, Miller's experiences are sufficient to allow him to opine on these subjects, but defendants will be free to challenge Miller's lack of experience on particular decision-making points during cross-examination.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-225\">\n    On the related point of Miller's interpretation of Watson's documents and his reliance on those documents in support of his but-for theories, I conclude that Miller's testimony synthesizing the various technical and non-technical documents is appropriate.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-226\">\n    With respect to Miller's alternate January 28, 2013 launch scenario, defendants argue that Miller admitted in his deposition (contrary to his Report) that his maximizing-theory (\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , working through holidays and cancelling plant shutdowns) would not have allowed Watson to manufacture enough quantity by January 28, 2013, so his opinion is without basis. But as Miller explained, his theory is based on Watson's own projections of two batches a week and having staff \"work every day\" (not just over the holidays) to meet those projections. Miller Depo. Tr. 197-98. The justification in his deposition is consistent with his theory of maximizing strategies from his Report.\n    <footnotemark>\n     58\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-227\">\n    Finally, defendants move to exclude Miller's opinions about claim construction and infringement, as he is a chemical engineer with no relevant experience. They contend that testimony by Miller as to claim construction and literal or doctrine of equivalents (DOE) infringement would be outside of the record of the\n    actual '529 litigation because: (1) Watson did not present a technical expert on claim construction; (2) Miller's opinion on literal infringement is based on an undisputed fact; and (3) Miller cannot make doctrine of equivalents arguments that were not made by Watson. Plaintiffs initially note Miller's qualifications and argue that his testimony is admissible (and appropriate) because he is simply responding to the arguments presented by defendants\n    <em>\n     in this case\n    </em>\n    by their expert (Majella Lane, who was Endo/Teikoku's expert in the '529 litigation). In doing so, Miller relies on evidence and arguments (as to claim construction) actually made by Watson in the '529 litigation (even if not presented through a \"technical expert\") and disputed in that case between Miller and Lane (as to literal infringement).\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Miller Reply Report [Dkt. No. 816-8] \u00b6\u00b6 15-20. This testimony is admissible.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-228\">\n    Miller's testimony regarding the doctrine of equivalents purports to answer questions of law (no infringement under the DOE due to vitiation, disclosure-dedication, or prosecution history estoppel). It falls outside of his area of expertise and he cannot opine on the ultimate legal conclusions that may have been reached in the '529 litigation. He can, however, dispute the factual issues (for example, he can contest Lane's analysis based on \"principles of pharmaceutical formulation\") and opine on what a person of ordinary skill in the art would have known or how she would have viewed the Teikoku file history (as relevant to legal questions arising under the DOE).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-229\">\n    Other than the objection to Miller's testimony on questions of law under the doctrine of equivalents, defendants' motion is DENIED.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-230\">\n    <strong>\n     6. Motion to Exclude Molina\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-231\">\n    Defendants move to exclude the opinions of Luis Molina that in absence of the Settlement, Watson would have launched at-risk and Endo would have launched its Authorized Generic (AG) immediately after Watson's launch. Defendants argue that Molina lacks the background and experience to opine on these subjects because while he provided input on these sorts of decisions, he was not the final decision-maker or included in the senior management's decision-making. Defendants also object to Molina's testimony about the \"intent\" of Watson and Endo regarding their launch plans, arguing that intent and state of mind are not appropriate areas for expert testimony. Finally, defendants object to Molina's \"interpretation\" of disputed facts, contending Molina is attempting to usurp the factfinder's role at trial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-232\">\n    On experience, defendants make much of the fact that Molina was never involved in deciding whether to launch a generic at-risk, was never the ultimate decision-maker on whether to launch an AG, never had specific responsibility concerning patent litigation, and had never presented his financial information directly to a Board or investors. Molina Mot. at 3-6. However, Molina bases his opinion on Watson's likelihood of launching at-risk on statements made by Watson employees and executives and also on evidence regarding the steps Watson took towards manufacturing their generic patch before and after the Settlement, evidence that in his view was consistent with the actions of a company preparing to launch at-risk. Molina Report [Dkt. No. 777-5] \u00b6 17.\n    <footnotemark>\n     59\n    </footnotemark>\n    While Molina admitted\n    that he had no first-hand experience with at-risk launch and while defendants contend that Molina ignores the possibility Watson's public statements were \"posturing,\" his background in analyzing the likelihood of potential generic competition and his own efforts in launching authorized generics gives him the experience to opine on the indicators that show a company was preparing to launch a product and whether they existed here.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Molina Rep. \u00b6 54. Defendants agree that Molina has direct experience with AG launches, but note that Molina never operated at the \"senior executive\" level and never made high-level presentations (to the Board or to investors) regarding AG launch, although information prepared by Molina was presented at these levels. Molina Mot. at 5-7. But given Molina's experience in the industry, he is qualified to opine on this subject based on his review of the evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-233\">\n    Molina's testimony concerning Watson and Endo's \"intent\" is about what he believed Watson and Endo were prepared to do prior to the Settlement based on his review of the record evidence. It is not the type of \"motivation\" or \"state of mind\" testimony that courts have excluded.\n    <footnotemark>\n     60\n    </footnotemark>\n    As made clear in his reply, Molina relied on his industry experience and the evidence he reviewed that Watson was preparing for an expeditious launch, but did not opine on what Watson executives subjectively decided, thought, believed, or intended. Molina Reply Rep. \u00b6 69. If Molina veers into purely speculative opinions on the subjective motivations or beliefs of employees or executives at Watson or Endo at trial, objections may be made and sustained. In light of his experience in the industry, Molina is allowed to opine that Watson and Endo had decided to launch generics, given the steps those companies had taken and the public and non-public comments that were made.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-234\">\n    Finally, plaintiffs will not be allowed to elicit testimony from Molina for the sole purpose of entering a factual narrative in the record. He will, of course, be allowed to identify the facts (documents, testimony) that support his otherwise permissible opinions. Defendants are free to challenge Molina on the stand regarding his interpretations of those documents and testimony.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-235\">\n    Defendants' motion to exclude Molina is DENIED.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-236\">\n    <strong>\n     7. Motion to Exclude Read\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-237\">\n    Defendants move to exclude the opinions of David T. Read, a lawyer at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) until 2015. Dkt. No. 779. Defendants argue that because Read participated in FDA ANDA discussions, including discussion about Watson's ANDA and because Read\n    signed off on the FDA's eventual approval of Watson's ANDA, Read's personal knowledge and participation blurs the line between expert and lay testimony and risks misleading the jury or elevating him in their estimations. Defendants also complain that Read refused to disclose in his deposition specifics of certain internal FDA discussions (at counsel's advice, based on concerns that to do so would violate confidentiality obligations) and, therefore, defendants were unable to adequately test Read's experiential qualifications and fully test his opinions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-238\">\n    Plaintiffs respond that Read is testifying only as to one, limited issue: whether the non-interference provision in the Settlement (where Endo agreed to not further amend or otherwise pursue its Citizen Petition with the FDA) sped up the denial of the Citizen Petition, and relatedly that the Citizen Petition was not acting as a barrier to Watson's ANDA.\n    <footnotemark>\n     61\n    </footnotemark>\n    Plaintiffs argue that in order to manufacture a conflict (and this motion), defense counsel attempted to ask Read questions about his work on ANDAs generally and Watson's ANDA specifically.

Depo Tr. [Dkt. No. 818-21] at 104.
