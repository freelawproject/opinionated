Accordingly, even if Section 4 requires state cooperation to the full extent permitted by federal law-and, as noted above, we are not persuaded by its terms that it does-Section 4 does not require Marion County's cooperation with removal orders, standing alone, or ICE detainers, standing alone. Stated otherwise, Section 4 does not require Marion County's cooperation with removal orders,\n   standing alone, or ICE detainers, standing alone, for three reasons: (1) the text of the statute does not require any cooperation; (2) the INA does not permit such cooperation as the Stipulated Judgment would prohibit; and (3) the Fourth Amendment does not permit such cooperation as the Stipulated Judgment would prohibit.

Given the contested legal nature of Marion County's qualified immunity defense, and the contested factual nature of Lopez-Aguilar's seizure and detention following his court hearing, litigating the merits of Lopez-Aguilar's case would likely involve an appeal of the qualified immunity issue, at least, as well as ultimate resolution by the trier of fact.
