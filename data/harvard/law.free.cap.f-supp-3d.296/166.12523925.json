INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case returns to this Court one year after the grant of summary judgment to Plaintiff Ferring Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Ferring\") due to Defendant U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (\"the FDA\") surprise change of position regarding the chemical classification of a molecule within Plaintiff's colon cleansing drug, Prepopik. For years, Ferring and the FDA have agreed that picosulfate is the active moiety\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   within the molecule sodium picosulfate,\n   one of the three active ingredients in Prepopik, and that this active moiety does not exist in any drugs previously approved by the FDA. Based on this understanding, Ferring challenged the FDA's interpretation of a rule that it believed was the only obstacle to obtaining five years of exclusivity for the drug. After the grant of summary judgment to Ferring removing this obstacle, and remand to the FDA for a determination of whether Ferring was entitled to five years of exclusivity for Prepopik, the FDA returned to Ferring with a new conclusion: that the active moiety in sodium picosulfate is actually bis-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-pyridyl-2-methane (\"BPHM\"), an active moiety found in several drugs that have already been approved. As such, the FDA concluded that Ferring was not entitled to five-year exclusivity for Prepopik.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ferring now challenges this determination as a violation of the Court's grant of summary judgment and remand to the agency, and requests that this Court order the \"FDA to recognize NCE exclusivity of Prepopik, in keeping with the positions the agency has taken repeatedly throughout the regulatory process and ensuing litigation.\" Mem. P. &amp; A. Supp. Pl.'s Mot. Enforce J. (\"Pl.'s Mem.\") at 17, ECF No. 64-1. For the reasons set forth below, the Court denies Ferring's motion to enforce the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Prepopik, a fixed-combination drug product used to cleanse the colon prior to colonoscopies, contains three active ingredients: sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid. A.R. 4, ECF No. 20-3. \"Fixed-combinations are drug products that generally include two or more drug substances (active ingredients) in a fixed ratio, synthetically combined into a single dosage form.\" A.R. 200, ECF No. 20-4. While magnesium oxide and anhydrous citric acid had already been approved in previous New Drug Applications (\"NDA\") when Ferring submitted its NDA for Prepopik, sodium picosulfate had not been. Therefore, when it submitted its NDA for Prepopik, Ferring also sought five years of exclusivity for the drug as a New Chemical Entity\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"NCE\"), which if approved would have prevented other drug manufacturers from submitting Abbreviated New Drug Applications (\"ANDA\") and \u00a7 505(b)(2) NDAs\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   of generic versions for Prepopik for five years after the approval of Prepopik's NDA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j)(5)(F)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The FDA approved Ferring's NDA for Prepopik in 2012. A.R. 201. However, the agency refused to grant Ferring five years of exclusivity for Prepopik because two of the active ingredients in the drug (magnesium oxide and anhydrous citric acid) existed in drugs previously approved by the FDA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Instead, it granted Ferring three years of exclusivity on the ground that its application \"contain[ed] reports of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) essential to the approval of the application and conducted or sponsored\n   by the applicant.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j)(5)(F)(iii) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex.

In contrast, the three-year exclusivity provision only precludes the FDA from\n   <em>\n    approving\n   </em>\n   new ANDAs and \u00a7 505(b)(2) applications before the end of the three-year period, rather than altogether prohibiting the submission of those applications.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j)(5)(F)(ii),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 355(j)(5)(F)(iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ferring submitted a Citizen Petition requesting that the FDA change its exclusivity determination for Prepopik. A.R. 64. A year later, the FDA issued a response to this Citizen Petition and Citizen Petitions filed by two other pharmaceutical companies whose respective fixed-combination drug products had also been denied five-year exclusivity. A.R. 199. The FDA's response stated that it believed that its then-current interpretation of the relevant statute and regulations-that fixed-combination drugs that contain at least one previously approved active moiety cannot be granted exclusivity, even if the drug also contains at least one new active moiety-was \"permissible.\" A.R. 212. However, it acknowledged that its existing interpretation \"may result in drug development strategies that are suboptimal from a public health perspective\" because, when sponsors submit two NDAs-one for a drug with a single active-ingredient containing the new active moiety and another for a fixed-combination product-\"undue importance\" may be placed on \"the order in which these two NDAs are approved.\" A.R. 213-14. Therefore, the FDA agreed to consider altering its interpretation of the law, issuing a draft guidance and seeking public comment on a new interpretation of existing law and regulation that would \"recognize 5-year NCE exclusivity for a drug substance that does not contain a previously approved active moiety, even where such a drug substance is approved in a fixed-combination with another drug substance that contains at least one previously approved active moiety.\" A.R. 214.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Despite the fact that Prepopik met this new standard, the FDA refused to grant it five years of exclusivity because \"[e]xclusivity runs from the date of approval of the product\" and the agency's old interpretation had been in effect on the date Prepopik's NDA had been approved. A.R. 215. After filing a Petition for Reconsideration and Petition for Stay, which the FDA denied, Ferring filed this action in federal court, alleging that the FDA's denial of its application was contrary to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20301\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 399b, and the agency's own regulations, and that its refusal to apply the new interpretation was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 58-71, ECF No. 2. As a remedy, Ferring sought \"a declaratory judgment declaring that the FDA's determination of the exclusivity period for Prepopik violates the [APA]\" and \"injunctive relief ordering the FDA to grant the full five years of exclusivity for Prepopik.\" Compl. \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On first review, the Court denied Ferring all of the relief it requested.\n   <em>\n    See gen\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    erally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ferring Pharm.

Performing a\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   analysis, at Step One the Court found that it was ambiguous whether the term \"drug\" in the relevant sentence of the statute referred to drug substances or drug products.\n   <em>\n    Ferring I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343357\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/169/199/\">\n    169 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   211-12 (citing\n   <em>\n    Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.

At\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   Step Two, it found that the agency's original construction of the statute was reasonable, even though that construction assigned different meanings to the term \"drug\" within the same sentence of statutory text.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 212-17. It similarly found that the original interpretation was not arbitrary and capricious.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 217-19. This holding was in part predicated on the fact that Ferring had not produced any examples of the original interpretation creating circumstances in which a drug substance's eligibility for five-year exclusivity turned on the order in which NDAs were approved.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 218 (\"If there were, in fact, situations in which a drug was eligible for five-year exclusivity under FDA's prevailing interpretation but failed to receive it because of the order in which it was approved, those circumstances might render FDA's policy arbitrary and capricious.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Following the Court's grant of summary judgment to the FDA, Ferring moved for reconsideration on the grounds that it could identify several examples of a single-entity drug substance being denied five-year exclusivity due to the order in which the NDAs for drugs that include that substance were approved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. P. &amp; A. Supp. Pl.'s Mot. Recons. (\"Pl.'s Mot. Recons. Mem.\") at 1-3, ECF No. 39-1. The Court granted the motion for reconsideration, entered summary judgment for Ferring, and \"remand[ed] th[e] action to FDA for further proceedings not inconsistent with [its] opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    Ferring Pharm., Inc. v. Burwell\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Ferring II\n   </em>\n   \"), No. 15-802,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204734333\">\n    2016 WL 4734333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (D.D.C. Sept. 9, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   It is the result of this remand that Ferring now challenges. Throughout the NDA process, the NCE exclusivity Citizen Petition process, and this litigation, the FDA has consistently agreed with Ferring that the active moiety in sodium picosulfate is picosulfate. For example, when Ferring submitted its NDA for Prepopik, the FDA classified the NDA as a \"Type 1-New Molecular Entity\" submission.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FDA, Drugs@FDA: FDA Approved Drug Products, Prepopik (NDA 202535), https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm. The term \"new molecular entity\" is not defined by statute or regulation, but the FDA defines the term as \"an active ingredient that contains no active moiety that has been previously approved by [the FDA] in an [NDA] or has been previously marketed as a drug in the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FDA, Drugs@FDA Glossary, https://www.fda.gov/drugs/informationondrugs/ucm079436.htm. Implied in that classification is the determination that sodium picosulfate contains an active moiety that had not previously been approved because magnesium oxide and anhydrous citric acid contain active moieties that had already been approved. Throughout the course of this litigation, the FDA never altered its determination that sodium picosulfate contains a not previously approved active moiety-until now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Eight months after the Court remanded this matter back to the FDA for further proceedings consistent with its arbitrary and capriciousness finding, the FDA changed its mind regarding the identity of the active moiety in sodium picosulfate. It now believes, upon \"further review,\" that the active moiety in sodium picosulfate is not picosulfate, but rather BPHM, an active moiety that is also found in other previously approved drug products. Ex. B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   at 2, Pl.'s Mot., ECF No. 64-3. As such, it concluded that Prepopik was not entitled to five-year NCE exclusivity. Ex. D at 8-9, Pl.'s Mot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The agency's change in position is based in its new chemical analysis of picosulfate. Following its review of Ferring's application for five-year NCE exclusivity, it explained that \"[a]t the time the Prepopik application was submitted, the Agency determined that sodium picosulfate was [an NME]. It was believed that picosulfate was the active moiety of the drug substance sodium picosulfate, and that this active moiety had not been previously approved by FDA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The agency has given no indication of why this determination was made. It admits that \"[i]t is not clear from the administrative record how the Agency determined that sodium picosulfate was considered to be an NME, as no documentation of a structural analysis of this active ingredient has been found.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The agency continues that at the time of its approval of Prepopik's NDA and its initial denial of the application of five-year NCE exclusivity, \"there was no need to closely examine the structure of picosulfate to more thoroughly assess the assumption that it did not contain a previously approved active moiety,\" because, using the agency's interpretation of the NCE exclusivity regulations in place at the time, it had already determined that Prepopik did not qualify for five years of exclusivity anyway. App. A at 4, Ex. 1, Defs.' Opp'n.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Now the FDA explains that, following the Court's remand, it has taken a closer look at the chemical properties of sodium picosulfate and \"determined that sodium picosulfate is the di-sodium salt of a di-sulfate derivative of [BPHM],\" because \"[a]fter excluding the salt and ester portions of sodium picosulfate, as FDA's regulations require, what remains is BPHM.\" Ex. D at 7, Pl.'s Mot. \"Amongst chemists, there is a long standing understanding that esters are substances resulting from the splitting-out of water from the combining of an alcohol, and an acid, where the acid may be organic (e.g. acetic acid) or inorganic (e.g. sulfuric acid).\" App. A at 4, Ex. 1, Defs.' Opp'n. After performing a \"virtual hydrolysis to cleave all ester bonds,\" and \"[e]xamin[ing] the alcohol and acid components\" to \"determine which are 'responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance,' \" the FDA determined that the active moiety in sodium picosulfate is BPHM.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12. It therefore concluded that \"[d]espite [its] prior statements that sodium picosulfate was an NME and an NCE, it is now evident that those statements were incorrect because this drug substance contained a previously approved active moiety when it was approved in Prepopik.\" Ex. D at 8, Pl.'s Mot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Ferring does not accept this conclusion, claiming that it resulted from a mid-adjudication change in the interpretation of the term \"ester\" to include \"covalently bound sulfur-based appendages.\" Ex. C at 2, Pl.'s Mot., ECF No. 64-4. It argues that if the agency wanted to change its interpretation of the term \"ester,\" it should have followed the appropriate administrative procedures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Ferring, the FDA's \"sudden reversal is not just an unreasonable\n   break with past practice,\" but also \"an end-run around this Court's\" grant of summary judgment and remand order. Pl.'s Mem. at 2. Therefore, it has filed a motion to enforce the Court's prior judgment, requesting that the Court \"order FDA to award NCE exclusivity to Prepopik instead of ordering another remand.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.

The order at issue in this case was the result of a motion for reconsideration, which was filed \"for the limited purpose of addressing one aspect of this Court's March 15, 2016 Memorandum Opinion\" granting summary judgment to the FDA.

However, the opinion in question, and the analysis leading to it, concerned only whether the FDA's original interpretation of the five-year NCE exclusivity provisions was arbitrary and capricious. The Court performed no separate analysis, and made no finding, of whether Prepopik was entitled\n   to NCE exclusivity. All the Court found was that the agency's prior interpretation of the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions could not be justified, and therefore, that the FDA could not apply that interpretation to Prepopik when adjudicating Ferring's application for five-year exclusivity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   However, Ferring still believes that FDA's change in position \"violates both the letter and spirit of this Court's Order\" because the FDA, as well as the Court, had never questioned whether sodium picosulfate contained an active moiety that the FDA had not previously approved. Pl.'s Mem. at 6. And because Ferring, it would seem, relied on the FDA's assumption regarding the non-approval status of sodium picosulfate's active moiety, it believes that the FDA should not be allowed to issue its surprise denial of exclusivity at this late hour.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Ferring therefore argues that the FDA's change in position regarding sodium picosulfate's prior approval status violates the law of the case; that the agency is judicially estopped from changing its position in this manner; that the agency's eleventh hour chemical analysis of sodium picosulfate impermissibly retroactively applies a new interpretation of the term \"ester\" and violates due process; and that the agency's actions are arbitrary and capricious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-15. For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that the FDA's actions on remand do not violate the law of the case and that the FDA is not judicially estopped from asserting its change in position concerning sodium picosulfate's prior approval status. The Court also finds that Ferring's arguments regarding retroactivity, due process, and arbitrary and capriciousness are not suitable for consideration within the context of a motion to enforce judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Law of the Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Ferring's first argument is that the FDA's change in position regarding the active moiety in sodium picosulfate violates the law of the case doctrine because the FDA's actions on remand \"undermine the clear thrust of this Court's order instructing FDA to take further proceedings\n   <em>\n    consistent with the Court's memorandum opinion.\n   </em>\n   \" Pl.'s Mem. at 8 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis in original).

Indeed, in neither of its two prior memorandum opinions did the Court even repeat the parties' belief that the active moiety in sodium picosulfate was the not-previously-approved picosulfate. The closest the Court ever came to such a pronouncement was during its description of Ferring's actions during the NDA and NCE exclusivity application processes, when it explained that \"[b]ecause sodium picosulfate constituted a new drug substance, Ferring sought five-year exclusivity for PREPOPIK when it submitted its NDA.\"\n   <em>\n    Ferring II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204734333\">\n    2016 WL 4734333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. Apart from that, the Court only referenced the fact that sodium picosulfate \"had never previously been approved in a NDA,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *1, a fact which the parties still do not dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court never found or stated that picosulfate is the active moiety in sodium picosulfate because the identity of that moiety was irrelevant to the Court's analysis of the agency's interpretation of the NCE exclusivity provisions. Ferring argues that the parties' assumption regarding the active moiety cannot now be revisited because otherwise, \"[t]he issue before the Court in this case-the propriety of FDA's original interpretation of the NCE exclusivity statute as applied to fixed-dose combination products-would have been wholly academic if sodium picosulfate were not, in fact, a novel active ingredient.\" Pl.'s Mem. at 6. Therefore, Ferring argues, it can be inferred that the Court found that the active moiety in sodium picosulfate had not already been approved. But that is not so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   If the FDA had indeed already informed Ferring that BPHM was the active moiety in sodium picosulfate, and had denied Ferring's application for five-year NCE exclusivity based on both its active moiety determination and its application of its prior interpretation of the NCE exclusivity provisions to Prepopik, and Ferring believed that it had legitimate challenges to both grounds of denial, and indeed then challenged both, Ferring's challenge of the FDA's use of its prior interpretation of the exclusivity provisions would have been far from academic.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   After all, the same arguments\n   regarding retroactivity, due process, and arbitrary and capriciousness that Ferring now promotes to challenge the FDA's decision to recognize sodium picosulfate as an ester would have also been available to Ferring then. As such, it cannot be inferred, from the Court's finding on a completely separate issue, that the Court had already found that sodium picosulfate contained an active moiety that had not already been approved. The Court simply never made such a finding, either explicitly or implicitly. Indeed, given the obvious scientific complexity that went into determining the active moiety's identity on remand,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , App. A at 11-12, Ex. 1, Defs.'

Likewise, in\n   <em>\n    Turtle Mountain\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Claims refused to revisit an explicit decision by the Indian Claims Commission that it had already affirmed, explaining that its prior determination during the first appeal was the law of the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Turtle Mountain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10813705,10811731,1411535\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/612/517/\">\n    612 F.2d at 519-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   both of these cases, issues that had not been disputed, but that had in fact already been decided, were deemed to be the law of the case.

While the FDA has indeed asserted \"clearly inconsistent\" positions with respect to its view of whether picosulfate is the active moiety in sodium picosulfate, it is not the case that the FDA \"succeeded in persuading the court to accept [its] earlier position.\" Pl.'s Reply at 9. Indeed, the FDA never made any effort to persuade the Court of the identity of the active moiety in sodium picosulfate. Instead, the FDA took its earlier statements that the active moiety of sodium picosulfate was picosulfate during the NDA process, assumed those statements were correct, and also assumed, at that time, that\n   those statements would be applicable to the NCE process. The Court never mentioned, nor questioned, this assumption, not because it had been persuaded, but because the question concerning sodium picosulfate's active moiety did not need to be decided to resolve the issues before it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, the FDA did not \"succeed[ ] in persuading [this] court to accept [its] earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position\" by this Court on remand would create the perception that this Court had been previously misled.\n   <em>\n    Maine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/#p750\">\n    532 U.S. at 750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/#p750\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   There is no doubt that Ferring is inconvenienced by the FDA's new position that the active moiety in sodium picosulfate can be found in other, previously approved active ingredients. Indeed, had Ferring known that the FDA would argue that the active moiety in sodium picosulfate was BPHM rather than picosulfate, it may have decided not to pursue this litigation in the first place. At the very least, this revelation is a setback. However, this change in position certainly did not give the FDA an unfair advantage throughout the course of this litigation.
