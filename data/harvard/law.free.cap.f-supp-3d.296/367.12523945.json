The articles were submitted to arXiv (pronounced \"archive\"), an online repository of manuscript preprints owned and operated by Cornell University (\"Cornell\"). Aldabe, who appears\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , alleges that Cornell and the individual defendants who operate arXiv (collectively \"defendants\") breached a contract between the parties and violated the Copyright, Civil Rights, Sherman Antitrust and False Claims Acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before the Court are 1) defendants' motion to control service and 2) defendants' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 1991 the Los Alamos National Laboratory (\"LANL\") created an online repository of digital scientific \"preprints\". Physicists, mathematicians, economists and other academics publish their research as digital \"preprints\" before such research appears in a formal, peer-reviewed journal. These digital preprints take the place of draft articles researchers used to post on physical billboards in research labs. Originally maintained under the domain name xxx.lanl.gov, LANL secured arXiv.org as a domain name in 1998 and transferred arXiv to Cornell University Library in 2001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Articles published on arXiv are not subject to the rigorous peer review process of formal journals. Instead, the research is subject to minimal oversight that includes reclassifying an article for a more appropriate category or removing an article that violates arXiv policies. With over one million scientific articles available to the public without cost, arXiv is the largest such repository in the world. It also plays a prominent role in the world of peer-reviewed journals, as some journals will not publish articles that lack an arXiv-assigned identification number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Fermin Aldabe joined xxx.lanl.gov in 1994 as a post-doctoral fellow in theoretical physics and submitted a dozen articles to the website between 1995 and 1998. Aldabe alleges that, after the 2001 transfer from LANL to Cornell, arXiv's continued publication of those articles was improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In a separate incident, Aldabe alleges that arXiv mistreated him with respect to an October, 2015, paper submission. According to Aldabe, arXiv misclassified the paper as a general physics (\"physics.gen-ph\") paper, although Aldabe intended the paper to be categorized as a high energy theoretical physics (\"hep-th\") paper. Aldabe explains that an author\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   would prefer to flush his work down the toilet instead of selecting physics.gen-ph, [because those articles are] doomed to be ignored by most if not all members\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   of the international community of physicists. This is because articles bearing the \"hep-th\" designation are featured closer to the top of arXiv's daily newsletter and because researchers searching arXiv's database may limit their search to the \"hep-th\" category.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Two weeks after the initial submission, during which time plaintiff and arXiv exchanged emails, arXiv rejected Aldabe's paper. One month later, arXiv explained to Aldabe that the paper was \"in need of significant review and revision before it\n   would be considered publishable.\" Aldabe alleges that arXiv's real reason for rejection was that his name \"sounds Muslim\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   One year after the described incident, in November, 2016, the European Physical Journal C, a peer-reviewed journal, accepted Aldabe's paper for publication. Upon submitting his article to arXiv again, Aldabe discovered that the paper was once again reclassified from \"hep-th\" to \"physics.gen-ph\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff filed his original complaint in November, 2016, and an amended complaint in March, 2017. The defendants' motion to dismiss responds to that amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court will address each count of the amended complaint\n   <em>\n    seriatim\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

That procedure provides several potential reasons for removal of an article, including inappropriate format, inappropriate topic, duplicated content, submission of copyrighted material and excessive submission rate.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    When arXiv rejected Aldabe's paper, it did so with the explanation that the paper was \"in need of significant review and revision.\" Plaintiff thus was given a reason for the rejection and Aldabe admits that arXiv was entitled to reject or remove articles for being in an \"inappropriate format\". The arXiv website defines \"inappropriate format\" to include \"papers in need of significant review and revision.\" According to plaintiff's own allegations, then, no material breach of a contract occurred.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Plaintiff also includes alleged breaches of terms that do not exist in the on-line agreement. He alleges that arXiv promised to \"state with good reason\" why an article lacks scientific quality. He further claims that arXiv breached its agreement by not providing an arXiv ID in a \"typical time\". As to the former allegation, arXiv clearly states that website administrators \"cannot provide detailed feedback regarding submissions deemed inappropriate.\" As to the latter, plaintiff points to no provision governing the timeliness of arXiv's approval process.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Finally, plaintiff alleges that defendants breached the contract by rejecting his work in October, 2015, and reclassifying his paper to \"physics.gen-ph\" in November, 2016. Prior to submitting those papers, however, Aldabe agreed to arXiv's policy statement providing that \"I understand that arXiv.org reserves the right to reclassify or reject any submission.\" Accordingly, arXiv did not materially breach any contract by rejecting or reclassifying plaintiff's work.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Plaintiff fails to allege that any material feature of the alleged contract was breached.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff's claim of breach of contract for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted will be allowed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      Claims against Individual Defendants and the Simons Foundation\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    In addition to suing Cornell University, plaintiff brings his claims against a handful of individual defendants and the Simons Foundation. The only individual defendant who is mentioned in the body of the amended complaint is Paul Ginsparg and he allegedly played a role in Cornell's copyright infringement. However, plaintiff's copyright claim fails, as described above. Plaintiff also alleges that the Simons Foundation \"aided and abetted\" Cornell University's discrimination against him, but that claim fails as well because the underlying discrimination charge will be dismissed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    The substance and structure of a plaintiff's complaint \"must give the defendants notice of the nature of the claim against them.\"\n    <em>\n     Ruivo\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201012\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/766/87/#p91\">\n     766 F.3d 87\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 91 (1st Cir. 2014) (citing\n    <em>\n     Cort\u00e9s-Rivera\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Department of Corrections &amp; Rehabilitation\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052052\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/626/21/#p28\">\n     626 F.3d 21\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 28-29 (1st Cir. 2010) ).

In support of that assertion, defendants point to emails plaintiff exchanged with defendants' counsel and directly with individual defendants. In one such message to defense counsel, plaintiff explains:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n    Give me some credit and consider that I may make it stick and that all those defendants will have their names plastered on the internet unnecessarily.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    In another, sent directly to a defendant, plaintiff states\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n    Isn't cool that if you google your name the claim comes up for everybody to see!!\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Plaintiff responds that this motion has no basis in law, and that blocking service would deny his right to petition the government and violate his right to due process.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Because the Court will allow the motion to dismiss with respect to the class of individual defendants who are not specifically mentioned in the body of the amended complaint, defendants' motion will be denied as moot.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      VI.-Dismissal with prejudice\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Plaintiff has already been permitted to amend his complaint once to bring it into compliance with the Federal Rules of\n    Civil Procedure and to include factual allegations pertaining to defendants' alleged misdeeds. Nevertheless, the amended complaint still fails to state any claim upon which relief can be granted. Because the Court will allow the defendants' motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.
