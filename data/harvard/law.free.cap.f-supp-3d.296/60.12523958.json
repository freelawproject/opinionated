First, the divorce proceedings are judicial in nature. Second, the District of Columbia has a significant interest in divorce proceedings taking place in the District and the division of marital assets. Finally, the divorce proceedings provide an adequate opportunity for the parties to present the factual determinations common to this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   While the Court is not here asked to \"grant a divorce, determine alimony or support obligations, or resolve parental conflicts over the custody of their children,\" it is required to make a determination about the ownership of particular accounts and whether the alleged access was authorized or unauthorized.\n   <em>\n    Bennett v.
