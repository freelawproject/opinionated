Rather, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the \"Court of Appeals\") has identified a \"sliding scale\" under which, for example, a greater showing of potential irreparable harm results in a lesser burden on plaintiffs to show a likelihood of success on the merits.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3328607\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/452/1289/#p1292\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1293 (citing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Corus Group PLC v.

The court further concludes that they have failed to show that the equitable relief they seek would be in the public interest. Therefore, even were the court to presume, without deciding, that plaintiffs would be able to demonstrate that they will incur irreparable harm absent the relief they seek, and that the balance of hardships is in their favor, they still would not qualify for this relief. In this case, there are no facts in dispute as to the merits of their claims, and the court is able to assess their likelihood of success by considering pure questions of law stemming from the interpretation of the applicable statutes. While arguing that their showing of likelihood of success on the merits should be viewed on a sliding scale based on a strong showing of irreparable harm, they have failed to show that the statutory interpretations on which they have based their claims are plausible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    C. Plaintiffs' Claims in this Litigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiffs assert three claims in their complaint. The claims have in common a contention that the President acted without congressional authority in issuing the Proclamation. The first claim identifies a flaw in the proceedings leading up to the issuance of the Proclamation, and the other two pertain to an aspect of the President's determination itself. Plaintiffs maintain that the court must declare the Proclamation unlawful, and prohibit the implementation of the Proclamation, in response to each of these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   First, plaintiffs claim, in Count 1 of their complaint, that the President and the U.S. Trade Representative violated sections 201 and 203 of the Trade Act by adopting a safeguard measure upon a report of the ITC that did not comply with subsection (e) of section 202 of the Trade Act.

The ITC's report to the President contained three different, and alternative, recommended actions. The issue the Count 1 claim presents is whether the ITC's failure to reach agreement on, and report to the President, a recommended remedy that was on behalf of the Commission confined the discretion of the President to order the safeguard measure.

Section 201(a) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   If the United States International Trade Commission ... determines under section 2252(b) of this title that an article\n   <em>\n    is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury\n   </em>\n   , or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing an article like or directly competitive with the imported article, the President, in accordance with this part,\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   take all appropriate and feasible action within his power which the President\n   <em>\n    determines\n   </em>\n   will facilitate efforts by the domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition and provide greater economic and social benefits than costs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added). Similarly, section 203(a)(1)(A) provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   After receiving a report under section 2252(f) of this title [i.e., the report of the Commission]\n   <em>\n    containing an affirmative finding regarding serious injury\n   </em>\n   , or the threat thereof, to a domestic industry, the President\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   take all appropriate and feasible action within his power which the President\n   <em>\n    determines\n   </em>\n   will facilitate efforts by the domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition and provide greater economic and social benefits than costs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202253\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A) (emphasis added). A condition precedent to the President's taking \"all appropriate and feasible action within his power\" is an affirmative injury or threat determination of the ITC under section 202 of the Trade Act. Thus, in both sections 201(a) and 203(a)(1)(A), the exercise of the President's discretion is expressly conditioned on an affirmative injury or threat finding by the ITC. But in neither section 201(a) nor section 203(a)(1)(A) did Congress expressly condition the President's authority to act on the President's being provided a \"remedy finding of the Commission\" within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201330\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2). While both sections expressly condition presidential action on an affirmative injury or threat finding, any conclusion that the President could not act in the absence of a \"remedy finding of the Commission,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201330\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2), can be reached only by implication. This contrast, by itself, casts some doubt on the plaintiffs' statutory interpretation. Plaintiffs interpret sections 201(a) and 203(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act in a way that permits their interpretation, despite the specific reference to an affirmative finding of injury or threat. They submit that the statute, in various places, limits the President's discretion in the way they posit.

The practical effect of plaintiffs' interpretation is that the lack of an ITC remedy recommendation would negate the ITC's affirmative injury or threat determination. In other words, the President, even though presented with a situation in which a domestic industry is incurring serious injury, would be powerless to respond. For the sole reason that the ITC could not agree on\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   remedy, that industry would\n   receive\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   remedy. In this way, plaintiffs' interpretation would interfere with, rather than further, the statutory purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Of course, the President, once presented with an ITC finding that a domestic industry is incurring serious injury or threat, retains the discretion either to take the action that is \"appropriate and feasible,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202253\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2253(a)(1)(A), or to take no action.

The President has discretion, therefore, to decide that there is no appropriate and feasible action that will facilitate the domestic industry's efforts to adjust positively to import competition and provide greater economic and social benefits than costs. The Commission's failure to obtain three votes for a single remedy recommendation is not the equivalent of a presidential determination that no such remedy exists.

Plaintiffs argue that without resort to the override provision of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202253\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), Congress would be impaired in exercising its constitutionally-vested authority to regulate foreign commerce.

But to attach to it the significance plaintiffs advocate, the court must conclude that Congress intended to preclude the President from acting to remedy the injury or threat when the ITC report lacked a qualifying remedy recommendation of the Commission, despite the anomalous result the court has identified, in which serious injury is found to exist but the President, paradoxically, is powerless to act. As the court discussed previously, the textual indications in the statute are to the contrary. Moreover, the legislative history confirms that Congress did not intend to foreclose presidential action in the absence of a qualifying ITC recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As enacted in 1974, the escape clause provisions of the Trade Act also contained a congressional override provision. Congress enacted the current section 330(d)(2) of the Tariff Act of 1930,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201330\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2), in the Tax Reform Act of 1976, Pub.

Prior to the 1976 amendment, Congress could override an escape clause determination of the President only when the President declined to adopt a remedy finding supported by a majority of voting commissioners. If the Commission was equally divided into two groups, each supported by one-half the number of commissioners voting, and the President chose the remedy finding of one of those two groups, chose a different remedy, or chose to deny relief, there could be no congressional override.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Senate Report for the Tax Reform Act explained the reason for amending section 330(d). Because it is instructive as to the reason for the amendment, the court\n   quotes it at length. After summarizing the congressional override provision in the Trade Act of 1974, the Senate Report stated that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Under the Trade Act of 1974, if the Congress prefers the remedy recommended by the Commission rather than the relief proposed by the President, or if the President declines to grant relief, a majority of those present and voting of both Houses may pass a resolution within 90 Congressional working days requiring the President to implement the remedy recommended by the Commission.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   This was the manner in which the Trade Act was intended to work. However, in two of the six escape clause cases under the Trade Act in which the Commission found by a majority vote that injury existed, the Commission was unable to reach majority agreement with respect to a remedy. In such cases, even though a majority of the Commission agree that an industry is being injured, because the Commission cannot agree as to what kind of relief is appropriate, the Congressional override mechanism of the Trade Act fails to function. When the Commissioners are unable to reach, through compromise, a common position with respect to remedy, the Congress is deprived of its opportunity to override the decision of the President and to reinstate the recommendation of the Commission. In such a situation, the President is free to deny import relief-for reasons which may be rooted in foreign policy without adequate regard to sound economics-without fear of being overridden by the Congress. The result is that an industry which may be found by the Commission to be entitled to import relief has been deprived of that relief, without good reason.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   S.

The final Tax Reform Act of 1976\n   included a modified version of the measures in paragraphs (3) and (4), as the Conference Report explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    Conference agreement.\n   </em>\n   -Under the conference agreement, if a majority of the Commissioners voting on an escape clause or market disruption case cannot agree on a remedy finding, then the remedy finding agreed upon by a plurality of not less than 3 Commissioners shall be treated as the remedy finding of the Commission for the purposes of the Congressional override in sections 202 and 203 of the Trade Act of 1974. If the Commission is tied on the remedy vote, and each voting group includes not less than 3 Commissioners, then (1) if the President takes the action recommended by one of those groups, the remedy finding agreed upon by the other group shall, for purposes of the Congressional override, be treated as the remedy finding of the Commission, or (2) if the President takes action which differs from the action agreed upon by both such groups, the remedy finding agreed upon by either such group may be considered by the Congress as the remedy finding of the Commission for purposes of the Congressional override. It is the intention of the conferees that this apply only for purposes of implementing the Congressional override in sections 202 and 203 of the Trade Act of 1974. It is not intended that this provision affect in any way the rules of procedure of the International Trade Commission.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Further, the conferees strongly urge the Commissioners to reach majority agreement on all determinations, findings, and recommendations in all cases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    Conference Report\n   </em>\n   at 530-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Senate and Conference Reports show that Congress was aware that in some cases under then-current law the Commission might agree that a domestic industry is undergoing serious injury or threat but might not reach majority agreement on a remedy finding and that the congressional override provision of section 203(c) of the Trade Act would not function in that instance. The solution agreed upon at conference allowed the congressional override mechanism to function in some instances in which the Commission did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   reach majority agreement on a remedy finding. For example, under the prior law the override was not available in the case of an evenly-divided Commission, with one half of voting commissioners supporting one remedy finding and the other half supporting another. That was because the\n   <em>\n    President\n   </em>\n   , not Congress, could choose which of the two would be regarded as the remedy finding of the Commission. Under the 1976 amendment, in the event that three commissioners support a remedy finding not imposed by the President (whether the President grants relief or not), that remedy finding is available for adoption by the Congress. Where two groups of three commissioners support different remedy findings, and the President chooses to adopt the remedy finding of one group, Congress may impose the remedy the President did not choose, and it may impose either one should the President choose to impose a different remedy or none at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Still, the solution adopted in the 1976 amendment did not ensure that a remedy finding of the Commission would be available in\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   escape clause proceeding: the override provision required that at least one remedy finding be supported by a group of three commissioners. The Senate and Conference reports did not state or suggest that the President could not act to remedy the serious injury or threat in those cases in which the congressional override provision was not available. Notably, the Congress, in amending section\n   330(d) of the Tariff Act, did not intend that its changes would confine the discretion of the President under the escape clause provisions of the Trade Act of 1974. The Senate Report made this point explicitly:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   This section amends section 330(d) of the Tariff Act of 1930, relating to the voting procedures of the Commissioners in import relief cases. The committee states that nothing contained in this section, or in any other provision of the amendment, is intended to alter the eligibility criteria for import relief under the Trade Act of 1974.... In addition, the committee states that\n   <em>\n    nothing contained in this section, or in any other provision of the amendment, is intended to change the legal authority of the President under present law to select the type and level of import relief to be provided to an industry, be it the form of relief recommended by the Commission, a modification of the Commission's recommendation, or a denial of relief altogether.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    Senate Report\n   </em>\n   at 57 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In their brief and in their reply brief, plaintiffs point to other language in the Senate Report, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    International Trade Commission (Title XXIV)\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   The voting procedures of The International Trade Commission in import relief cases are changed to insure that the Congress will have an opportunity to override import relief decisions of the President under sections 201 and 406 of the Trade Act of 1974.

The more specific, and far more detailed, discussion in the body of the Senate Report, which clarifies that the changes in the Senate bill were intended to \"increase the probability that if there is a majority vote for injury, there would be a majority finding on a remedy,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 58, is more instructive as to what the Senate bill was trying to achieve. Also instructive to the interpretation of the Senate Report is the nature of the changes the Senate bill actually would have made. None of the changes would do what plaintiffs argue Congress intended: to prohibit presidential action, or to continue to prohibit presidential action, in the absence of remedy finding of the Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Plaintiffs also cite a statement by Senator Ribicoff, the sponsor of the 1976 amendment, that the change was intended to \"correct the serious problems that have developed in connection with 'escape clause' actions under the Trade Act of 1974' and 'make sure that the escape clause works in the future the way Congress originally intended it to.' \" Pls.' Br. 29 (quoting 122 Cong. Rec. 24,725 (1976) (statement of Sen. Ribicoff) ) (emphasis omitted). This language sheds no light on whether Congress ever intended to deny the President authority to impose a safeguard action in the absence of a remedy finding of the Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   According to plaintiffs, legislative history of the Customs Courts Act of 1980 confirms their interpretation of the escape clause statute. They argue that \"the drafters wrote that the Trade Act 'specif{ies} that the President may not act\n   <em>\n    until he has received advice from the International Trade Commission (ITC)\n   </em>\n   or the U.S. Trade Representative.' \" Pls.'

The quoted language is from\n   the report of the House Judiciary Committee on the legislation that established the Court of International Trade and is on the topic of the jurisdiction the new court should have. An examination of the quoted sentence in the context in which it appears in the House report reveals that plaintiffs have misinterpreted the word \"advice\" in the quoted sentence. It was not a specific reference to a remedy finding of the Commission in an escape clause action. Nor was the intended meaning of the word \"advice\" one confined to \"recommendations.\" In the report, the House Judiciary Committee was referring generally to statutes authorizing the President to take actions to protect the United States and American manufacturers against injury due to the importation of foreign goods and not in particular to sections 201-203 of the Trade Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The context of the discussion was an explanation of the reasons for deleting certain jurisdictional provisions in the original version of the House bill, H.R. 6394.
