They claim that Border Transfer improperly treated them as independent contractors when they were, in fact, employees, and that, as a result, Border Transfer unlawfully deducted certain business expenses from their pay under the Massachusetts Wage Act. Plaintiffs now seek certification of a class of similarly situated current and former drivers under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. For the reasons discussed below, Plaintiffs have met the Rule 23 requirements. Thus, after hearing, the Court\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ALLOWS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   the motion for class certification (Docket No. 73).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Allegations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Border Transfer is a broker registered with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (\"FMCSA\"). Docket No. 9-2 at 1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013102\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2). As a broker, Border Transfer arranges home delivery services for large retail stores such as Sears.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Border Transfer itself does not deliver goods. Instead, Border Transfer contracts with FMCSA-authorized motor carriers to perform the home deliveries. Border Transfer's contracts with each motor carrier, which Border Transfer calls Contract Carrier Agreements (\"CCAs\"), are all substantially the same. Docket No. 74-3 at 11 (\"Matos Dep.\" at 33:17-18). Each of the CCAs states that the motor carrier is considered to be an independent contractor of Border Transfer.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 74-4 at 5 (\"DaSilva CCA\" \u00b6 8 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Border Transfer only enters into CCAs with business entities. Docket Nos. 74-7 at 7, 74-8 at 2 (Border Transfer's \"Carrier File Requirements,\" which require motor carriers signing CCAs to provide Border Transfer with a \"copy of LLC or incorporation\"). Drivers who wish to deliver for Border Transfer but who do not already have a corporate entity must create one; in at least one instance, Border Transfer helped a driver form a corporate entity and complete the steps to comply with federal regulations covering motor carriers. Docket No. 74-9 at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In some cases, Border Transfer contracts with motor carrier companies that consist solely of a single driver who personally performs the delivery services. That was the case with named plaintiff Marcos DaSilva, who entered into a CCA with Border Transfer through Alpha Logistics Trucking, LLC (\"Alpha Logistics\"). Docket No. 74-4 at 9. DaSilva applied for a job as a delivery driver with Border Transfer. Docket No. 74-11 \u00b6 4. A Border Transfer manager told him that he needed to form a company to sign a contract with Border Transfer, and the manager helped him fill out the necessary forms to create Alpha Logistics. Docket No. 74-11 \u00b6 4. Alpha Logistics only ever operated one truck, and DaSilva was the sole driver for that truck. Docket No. 74-9 at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In other cases, Border Transfer contracts with motor carrier companies that employ multiple drivers. That was the case with Matteus Ferreira, the other named plaintiff. Matteus Ferreira was the joint owner of Father &amp; Son Transporting LLC with his father, Marcos Ferreira. Docket No. 74-10 at 9. Father &amp; Son Transporting LLC was formed before the father, Marcos Ferreira, signed a CCA with Border Transfer. Docket No. 9-2 at 12; Docket No. 74-10 at 7. Father &amp; Son Transporting LLC began by operating one truck for Border Transfer but eventually operated three trucks for Border Transfer. Docket No. 74-10 at 12-13. Those three trucks were operated by Matteus Ferreira, Marcos Ferreira, and several other persons hired by Father &amp; Son Transporting LLC. Docket No. 74-10 at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The motor carriers under contract with Border Transfer perform their deliveries from Sears' Westwood, Massachusetts facility. The CCAs require that all drivers who have an assigned route on a particular day attend a morning \"stand-up\" meeting at the facility. Docket No. 9-2 at 13; Docket No. 74-3 at 13. At the meeting, drivers might receive instructions on new installation processes, be informed of recurrent customer complaints, or receive training on how to communicate with customers. Docket No. 74-3 at 13, 29. The CCAs require drivers to wear a uniform each day, and drivers are not allowed to leave the facility if they do not comply with that mandate. Docket No. 9-2 at 17-18; Docket No. 74-3 at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Delivery procedures are spelled out in the CCAs as well. Docket No. 9-2 at 14. Among the requirements is that the drivers \"must run all delivery routes exactly as specified in the manifest.\" Docket No. 9-2 at 14. Those manifests are provided to drivers by Border Transfer and contain the order of deliveries and time windows for each delivery. Docket No. 74-3 at 22; Docket No. 74-14. Drivers must log deliveries as they happen by recording them on a smartphone app. Docket No. 74-3 at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The plaintiffs filed the proposed class action complaint in this case on June 23, 2016. Docket No. 1. The original complaint named Border Transfer as the sole defendant and contained two counts: violation of the Massachusetts Wage Act and unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Border Transfer moved to dismiss, arguing that the Wage Act claim was preempted by the Federal Administration Authorization Act of 1994,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014501\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Docket No. 8. On January 5, 2017, the Court denied the motion as to the Wage Act claim but dismissed the unjust enrichment claim. Docket No. 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The operative complaint is the amended complaint, which was filed on May 1, 2017. Docket No. 65. The amended complaint names the President of Border Transfer, Patrick McCluskey, as an additional defendant and contains a single count for violation of the Wage Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In substance, the plaintiffs allege that their misclassification resulted in unlawful deductions from their pay, including damage claims and uniforms, as well as unlawful requirements that they pay for workers' compensation coverage and cargo insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Now pending before the Court is the plaintiffs' motion for class certification, filed on June 19, 2017. Docket No. 73. The proposed class is defined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   All individuals who 1) entered into a Contract Carrier Agreement (or similar agreement) directly or through a business entity; 2) personally provided delivery services for Border Transfer on a full-time basis in Massachusetts; and 3) who were classified as independent contractors, at any time since June 23, 2013.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Docket No. 73 at 1. This class definition excludes so-called secondary drivers, who provided delivery services for Border Transfer under contracts between Border Transfer and other persons, and so-called absentee contractors, who held contracts with Border Transfer but did not drive a truck themselves.

Docket No. 74-6 at 2. The defendants do not appear to contest that the plaintiffs meet the numerosity requirement. However, it bears mentioning that not all fifty-nine of Border Transfer's contractors during the time period fall within the plaintiffs' class definition. The plaintiffs' class definition is narrow: drivers who, in the relevant time period, \"personally provided delivery services for Border Transfer on a full-time basis in Massachusetts.\" The record does not make it clear how many of the fifty-nine contractors utilized by Border Transfer during that time period personally delivered for Border Transfer on a full-time basis-but it is certainly not all fifty-nine. The defendants have put evidence in the record that at least three contractors, Humberto Chantre, Jose Pinto, and Naila Brito, did not personally drive full-time for Border Transfer and would be excluded from the class definition. Docket Nos. 81-3 at 2; 81-6 at 2, 4; 81-7 at 1. Rogerio Matos, a Border Transfer assistant manager, remembered two additional contractors who did not drive their own trucks. Docket No. 74-3 at 4-5, 9. Thus, at least five of the fifty-nine contractors would be excluded from the proposed class definition.

The plaintiffs rely on\n   <em>\n    Dow v.

Thus, the Massachusetts Wage Act would apply to all of the members of the putative class, and there is no choice-of-law obstacle to certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Prong A: Control\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   As described above in the subsection on the statutory framework, the plaintiffs need only prevail on either Prong A or Prong C of the Massachusetts Wage Act. Prong A itself contains a conjunctive test under which the plaintiffs need only prevail on one branch. Under Prong A, an individual is an independent contractor only if \"the individual is free from control and direction in connection with the performance of the service, both under his contract for the performance of service and in fact.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, \u00a7 148B(a)(1). Due to the conjunctive nature of this test, a company asserting that a worker is an independent contractor must show that the individual was free from its control\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   as a matter of contract and as a matter of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The plaintiffs argue that because only a single common issue is necessary to meet the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a), they satisfy the requirement by showing that either contractual control or actual control can be adjudicated on a class-wide basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   i. Control as a Matter of Contract\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The plaintiffs argue that whether an individual is free from control under the terms of his or her contract can be resolved through common evidence such as the uniform provisions of the CCAs. The plaintiffs are correct. The defendants do not appear to contest the plaintiffs' characterization that the CCAs contain standard terms for all of Border Transfer's drivers. Docket No. 74-3 at 11. Examining the standard terms to determine the extent of Border Transfer's contractual control is an exercise that appears to lead to common answers. As such, the Third Circuit decided that the extent of a company's right to control its workers could be resolved by examination of the franchise agreement, policies manual, and training manual that\n   were common to the class.\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Jani-King of Phila. Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125466\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/314/#p321\">\n    837 F.3d 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 321-22 (3d Cir. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The defendants' argument in response seems to be that, for various reasons, the contract does not contain as much right of control as the plaintiffs claim. Docket No. 80 at 19. But that is a merits question. The only question at this point is whether the extent of Border Transfer's contractual right of control over its delivery drivers is determinable on the basis of common evidence. The answer is yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   ii. Control as a Matter of Fact\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The defendants argue that determining the extent of Border Transfer's actual control over its delivery drivers requires an individualized factual inquiry. The plaintiffs respond that evidence of common practices can establish common answers as to control as a matter of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As common evidence of actual control, the plaintiffs argue that Border Transfer had a policy that required all of its drivers to attend morning meetings to receive delivery instructions, that all of the drivers were subject to a customer rating system that could influence route assignment, that all drivers were required to wear uniforms, and that Border Transfer issued manifests to each driver containing a mandated order of delivery and delivery timeframes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The defendants' response wades too often into the merits. The defendants expend significant effort arguing that, as a practical matter, Border Transfer's control over its drivers was less than the plaintiffs make it seem: that drivers' amount of communication with Border Transfer throughout a delivery day was not so significant; that the morning meeting requirement was not strictly enforced; that the customer rating system had little impact on drivers' routes; that drivers did not have to make deliveries in the order listed in the manifest; and that contractors could work when they wanted and that there were no limitations on the amount of time they could take off. But the question at this stage is whether the level of actual control can be determined by common evidence on how Border Transfer dealt with its drivers, or whether different putative class members were treated differently. The defendants have put forward some \"happy camper\" affidavits presenting that some drivers have some flexibility, but this does not defeat commonality or predominance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   iii. Incorporation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The defendants argue that even if Massachusetts law applies to all of the members of the putative class, and even if there is common evidence regarding control under Prong A, commonality does not exist because individual adjudication is necessary to determine whether the Massachusetts Wage Act even applies to each proposed class member. Border Transfer did not contract with drivers directly but instead contracted with drivers through the corporate entities owned by the drivers. The Massachusetts Wage Act does not \"expressly exclude individuals who provide services through a corporation.\"\n   <em>\n    Chambers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20N.E.3d%201\">\n    65 N.E.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   14 (citing Advisory 2008/1, Attorney General's Fair Labor and Business Division on Mass.

The defendants argue that these fact-specific inquiries must be conducted on an individual basis to determine whether the Massachusetts Wage Act applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The defendants point to the named plaintiff DaSilva, who testified at his deposition that he formed \"Alpha Logistics Trucking, LLC\" at the request of Border Transfer in October 2014 and that the company remained in business for six months. Docket No. 81-16 at 6. However, the defendants claim that Alpha Logistics Trucking's business records show otherwise: that Alpha Logistics Trucking operated well past that date transporting products brokered by companies other than Border Transfer. Defendants argue that the other named plaintiff, Ferreira, presents different potential issues regarding application of the Wage Act. Ferreira's corporate entity (Father &amp; Son Trucking) existed two to three months prior to the CCA with Border Transfer, and it employed multiple drivers to complete Border Transfer's jobs in a third truck Father &amp; Son Trucking owned. There is also evidence in the record of at least four other contractors who formed corporations before contracting with Border Transfer and for reasons other than Border Transfer's alleged requirement of incorporation. Docket No. 81-1 at 2 (Rosa declaration: \"Prior to [Border Transfer], Antonio Rosa Transportation LLC provided delivery services to Spirit Delivery.\"); Docket No. 81-2 at 1 (Martins declaration: \"I own Martins Trucking LLC, a company I formed for tax reasons.\"); Docket No. 81-6 at 2 (Pinto declaration: \"I formed my company in 2009\" and began contracting with Border Transfer in 2011); Docket No. 81-5 at 1 (Medina declaration: \"I formed Medina Trucking LLC because I wanted increased protection for my company.\"). For these drivers, defendants make a colorable argument that incorporation is not a sham to permit misclassification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   However, incorporation cannot be a shield to prevent liability under the Wage Act. The plaintiffs point to evidence in the record that Border Transfer required all drivers to form corporations as a prerequisite to signing a contract. Docket No. 74-3 at 10-11; Docket No. 74-11 at 2; Docket No. 74-13 at 2. Thus, regardless of whether a full-time driver formed a corporation prior to his engagement with Border Transfer, the class only involves full-time drivers for Border Transfer. Thus, the analysis for Wage Act purposes is whether the individual driver was an employee with Border Transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Other courts in this District have similarly found that individual questions of incorporation did not defeat commonality or predominance for a class of drivers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martins v. 3PD, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. CIV.A. 11-11313-DPW,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201320454\">\n    2013 WL 1320454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7, *9 (D.

The SJC wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   \"The better approach to the evaluation required by part (c) is to consider whether the service in question could be viewed as an independent trade or business because the worker is capable of performing the service to anyone wishing to avail themselves of the services\n   or, conversely, whether the nature of the business compels the worker to depend on a single employer for the continuation of the services.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=786%20N.E.2d%20365\">\n    786 N.E.2d at 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The SJC held that newspaper carriers were customarily engaged in an independently established trade because they were \"free to deliver newspapers (or other publications, such as advertising flyers) for anyone who wishes to contract with them\" and that \"several of the carriers\n   <em>\n    in fact\n   </em>\n   act as carriers for other publishers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=786%20N.E.2d%20365\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=786%20N.E.2d%20365\">\n    at 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). In other words, the SJC has treated an analogous test as an inquiry into whether a worker has the opportunity to engage in an independently established business, not whether they did in fact. This makes sense on a practical level, as the defendants point out: a contrary statutory meaning would implausibly require a business that wanted to engage with an independent contractor to ensure that the contractor was also in fact contracting with another business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Whether contractors with Border Transfer had the opportunity to engage in an independently established business is, as the plaintiffs argue, susceptible to common proof. The plaintiffs argue that Border Transfer assigned its drivers full-time work four to six days a week,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 74-3 at 11, leaving drivers with minimal time, if any, to perform deliveries for any other business as a practical matter. Moreover, the plaintiffs argue that drivers could not work concurrently for Border Transfer and another business because they were required to be in uniform for Border Transfer, Docket No. 74-3 at 14, and because \"co-loading\" of other merchandise alongside Sears merchandise was prohibited, Docket No. 74-1 (SLS-BTMI Contract at 8). The defendants respond that there were many examples of contractors who also delivered for companies other than Border Transfer and that co-loading was not actually prohibited. Whatever the resolution of this dispute on the merits, the key point at this stage is that this question appears susceptible to resolution by common evidence about Border Transfer's general customs and policies. The defendants have put forth no evidence that different putative class members-at the individual worker level-had different opportunities to engage in an independently established business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Establishing Violation of the Wage Act\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Although the class definition avoids the individualized\n   <em>\n    Chambers\n   </em>\n   inquiry into applicability of the Wage Act, Plaintiffs still must show that Border Transfer took deductions that were improper under the Wage Act. The plaintiffs argue that Border Transfer took the same types of deductions from each of its contractors and that those deductions are outlined in the CCAs and other Border Transfer documents. The defendants do not seem to contest this point. The propriety of deductions under the Wage Act can be resolved on common evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Summing up Commonality\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Commonality is met for a class of drivers who personally drove for Border Transfer on a full-time basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

They point out that Ferreira did not sign the CCA himself (his father did); his testimony about his company's operations is contradicted by others; his company existed before it signed the CCA with Border Transfer; and his business grew to operate three trucks for Border Transfer. They also point out that DaSilva's business only operated one truck, that his business was formed when he signed the CCA with Border Transfer, and that some of his testimony is contradicted by testimony of others (thus casting doubt on his credibility).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   None of these problems defeats typicality. DaSilva and Ferreira's experiences, although different in some ways from each other's, are reasonably coextensive with those of other motor carriers who contracted with Border Transfer.

Steps 1, 2, 3, and 4 in that chain appear to be provable by common evidence which predominates over any individualized issues identified by the defendants.
