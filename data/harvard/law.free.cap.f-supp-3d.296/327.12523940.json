Because the latter is the appropriate cause of action for the former violations, I treat them as one claim under Count II.

Claiming that Town defendants \"instructed or vicariously instructed departments of the town\" to remove his signs,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   plaintiff maintains that \"other similar signs of political nature posted by other individuals ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   were not so removed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.

It is \"well settled that the government need not permit all forms of speech on property that it owns and controls. The government, no less than a private owner of property, has power to preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated.\"\n   <em>\n    Del Gallo v.

Although he contends that, following the May 2015 Town Meeting, his signs were removed while \"other similar signs of political nature posted by other individuals ... were not so removed,\" Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 16-17, plaintiff's photographs of such other signs reveal remarkably little. Plaintiff has pleaded nothing about when the other signs were placed where or by whom. Even as to his own signs, the plaintiff does not specify where he posted them. In the absence of such information, it is impossible to conclude that defendants allowed some signs to remain in similar locations from which they removed plaintiff's signs, much less that they did so in a discriminatory manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    2. First Amendment Retaliation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Although it is not precisely pleaded, plaintiff's First Amendment claim could alternatively be read to allege retaliatory removal of his signs following his Town Meeting motion for a public hearing on nuclear safety issues. \"When a government actor retaliates against someone for exercising constitutionally protected First Amendment rights, that individual has a cognizable retaliation claim pursuant to \u00a7 1983.
