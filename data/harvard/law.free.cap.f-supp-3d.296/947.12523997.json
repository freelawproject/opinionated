Kennetha's mother, Rosemary Purnell (\"Purnell\"), filed a wrongful death suit against the homeowner. Purnell later amended her complaint (\"Underlying Complaint\") to include a wrongful death claim against McColly Realtors, Inc. and Ruth Lockhart (together, \"Defendants\"), asserting that the homeowner had contracted with Defendants for the purpose of leasing the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants requested that Allstate defend and indemnify them against the Underlying Complaint pursuant to an Allstate insurance policy held by McColly Realtors, Inc.

The Underlying Complaint alleges that Chale was the owner of premises located in Merrillville, Indiana (\"premises\" or \"property\"). Count I alleges that as of October 1, 2013, Kennetha leased the property from Chale, and that Chale owed a duty to follow applicable law in leasing the premises, and a duty to warn of latent or concealed dangers, to the residents of the premises. It alleges that Chale negligently and/or recklessly failed to register the premises as a rental as required by law, thereby causing the premises to be leased without proper inspection. According to the Underlying Complaint, an inspection would have revealed that the property was not fit for habitation, including insufficient barrier protection against infiltration of harmful gases from the garage to the living quarters of the premises. Count I alleges that Chale's violation of law, failure to warn and/or concealment of a latent and dangerous condition wrongfully caused the deaths of Kennetha, her husband and two minor children (together, \"Kennetha's family\") on October 12, 2013, when carbon monoxide infiltrated the living quarters of the premises from a generator operating in the garage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Count II asserts a similar wrongful death claim against McColly and Ruth Lockhart (\"Lockhart\"), who was allegedly working in her capacity as an agent and/or employee of McColly.

Because the Underlying Complaint does not allege a wrongful entry or invasion of property committed by or on behalf of Defendants as owners, landlords or lessors of the property, Coverage B does not apply here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court holds that the claim against Defendants in the Underlying Complaint is not covered by Coverage A or Coverage B of the Policy, and therefore, need not address whether coverage is excluded by the Realtor E &amp; O Exclusion. The Court further holds that under the Policy, Allstate has no duty to defend the claim against Defendants in the Underlying Complaint. Because Allstate has no duty to defend Defendants, it also has no duty to indemnify Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pekin,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%201597924\">\n    2007 WL 1597924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, Allstate's motion for summary judgment (DE # 26) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' cross motion for summary judgment (DE # 30) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n   The Clerk of the Court is\n   <strong>\n    DIRECTED\n   </strong>\n   to enter a\n   <strong>\n    DECLARATORY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n   in favor of Allstate declaring that under insurance policy number 648550390, Allstate has no duty to defend or indemnify McColly Realtors, Inc. and/or Ruth Lockhart against claims asserted by Rosemary Purnell in case number 45D01-1503-CT-50 in Lake Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    The Court granted default judgment against Purnell and the Clerk entered judgment on October 5, 2016.
