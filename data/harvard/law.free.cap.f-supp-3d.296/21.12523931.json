Defendant Jose Amaya-Ortiz (hereinafter \"Defendant\" or \"Mr. Amaya-Ortiz\") requests that the Court modify or reduce his sentence based on a 2015 amendment to the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Because Mr. Amaya-Ortiz is not challenging the legality of his sentence, the Court shall construe Defendant's Motion as a motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 14, 2013, Defendant entered into a Plea Agreement, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C), whereby he pled guilty to Count One of a Superseding Indictment charging him with Conspiracy to Distribute and Possess with Intent to Distribute Five Kilograms or More of Cocaine in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20846\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(A). The parties agreed on a sentence of 150 months of incarceration, to be followed by 60 months of supervised release. The parties agreed further that pursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines: (1) the Defendant's Base Offense Level was 36 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 ; (2) Defendant was subject to a two-level aggravating role adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(c) because he was a manager or supervisor of criminal activity; and (3) Defendant should receive a three-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 for accepting responsibility. Defendants' applicable Sentencing Guidelines offense level was 35, which corresponded with the applicable Guidelines range of 168 months to 210 months, because his criminal history category was I. Accordingly, Defendant's sentence of 150 months, which was accepted by the Court, was below the low end of the Guidelines range.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 2, 2015, Defendant filed an unopposed motion requesting a reduction of his sentence pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2), based on Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines which reduced Defendant's base level offense by two points.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. Supp. App. C, Amdt. 782 (Nov. 1, 2014). Amendment 782 lowered the bottom end of Defendant's applicable Guidelines range from 168 months to 135 months, and accordingly, Defendant requested that the Court employ its discretion to reduce his sentence from 150 months to 135 months of imprisonment. On November 3, 2016, the Court granted Defendant's request and reduced his sentence to 135 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 3, 2016, Defendant filed the instant Motion, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which he asserts that he is entitled to a further sentence reduction under Amendment 794 to the Sentencing Guidelines, whereby the United States Sentencing Commission amended the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, to make a sentencing adjustment available for a defendant \"who plays a part in committing the offense that makes him substantially less culpable than the average participant in the criminal activity.\" U.S.S.G. Supp. App. C, Amdt. 794 (Nov. 1, 2015). More specifically, Defendant asserts that he is entitled to a \"2, 3, or 4 level[ ]\" reduction in his sentence and he requests an \"adjustment[ ] to his term[ ] of imprisonment according to the tenets of Amendment 794 giving consideration to the expanded criteria, and addressing his involvement in the conspiracy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Since the Defendant is proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , his motion will be liberally construed to conform to the nature of the relief he seeks.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In this case, Defendant seeks reconsideration of his sentence in light of an intervening change to the Sentencing Guidelines, as opposed to challenging the legality of his sentence.

However, section 3582(c) of Title 18 of the United States Code provides three exceptions to this general rule. Specifically, the Court is authorized to modify a term of imprisonment once imposed only under one of these circumstances: (1) upon motion by the Director of the Bureau\n   of Prisons; (2) when expressly permitted by statute or Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35 ; or (3) where the applicable sentencing guideline range has been retroactively lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)-(2).

U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. In the instant case, Defendant did not receive a mitigating role reduction to his offense level when he was sentenced in 2014; instead, the Defendant and the Government agreed that his offense level should be increased two levels under Section 3B1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines because of his aggravating role as a manager or supervisor of criminal activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plea Agreement, ECF No. 234, at 4.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 (\"Aggravating Role\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Government argues that \"[e]ven assuming ... that the aggravating role enhancement that defendant received would not necessarily preclude him from also receiving a mitigating role reduction, defendant's role as a manager or supervisor of criminal activity weighs heavily against his eligibility for an adjustment intended for 'low-level offenders' such as 'drug couriers and mules.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Govt.'s Opp'n at 8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G.
