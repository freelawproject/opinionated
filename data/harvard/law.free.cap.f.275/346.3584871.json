Eggers v. Sun., etc., Corp. (C. C. A.) 263 Fed. 373. It would save no useful purpose io compare in del ail tlie so-called s\u00eda\u00edir.ile which plaintiff copyrighted and the doll that defendant sold; it is ni\u00ed\u00fcrieiit to say that the doll at the very least is a plain copy of a \u201csidlaiaiihril and materia!\u201d par\u00ed \u00edl\u00edcu eoh Co:iseqaendy it is an miringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">\u00a1T4, E] The proper method of mvostigating ami declaring' asserted infringement of a design patent has been much discussed at bar and. in the court below; it being stwqepieri that differing and divergent, if not incompatible, rules are io Ik: found in our previous decisions of Ashley v. Tatum, 186 Fed. 339, certiorari denied 225 U. S. 707, 32 Sup. Ct. 839, 56 L. Ed. 1266, and Borgfeldt v. Weiss (C. C. A.) 265 Fed. 268. We discover -m contradiction between these, decisions, though they do afford illustrations of different methods of approaching soiutioa of the same iililnuue problem, which is, like every question of iiiirirgciiiexit, always an inquiry o\u00ed fact,</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">Vvfhetiier the problem be of validity, scope, or infringement, Hie prime difference between patents for other inveu.tioas and Hose for designs is that in the first ekes the inquiry is, \u201cWh-h will it do?\u201d whereas in respect of design one always auks, \u201cHow does it look?\" Rowe v. Blodgett <em>&amp; </em>Clapp Co., 112 Fed. 61, 50 C. C. A. 120. How anything looks depends very largely on the eye of the observer; <em>yet </em>iliat observer, if a conn: in equity or a juryman at law, must decide by the effect upon his eve whether thci'e has or bar. not been that appropria<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>tion of essentials, or substantial appropriation, which constitutes infringement of any patent. For such a process it is inaccurate to speak of a rule in the sense that that word is properly used in relation, to legal rights. No more can be done than to indicate the processes by which experienced observers arrive at conclusions. The matter has lately been well put in the Ninth Circuit by saying:-</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-4\">\u2022\u201cThe differences in designs, which under the patent law will avoid infringement, are differences which will attract the attention of the ordinary observer, giving such attention as the purchaser usually gives in buying articles of the kind in question, and for the purposes for which they are intended.\u201d Zidell v. Dexter (C. C. A.) 262 Fed. 145, 147.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Almost the same words were used in Ashley v. Weeks-Numan Co., 220 Fed. 899, 136 C. C. A. 465. In Ashley v. Tatum, supra, the \u201cabsence of any applied ornamentation\u201d from the alleged infringement was held to create a difference between the articles of plaintiff and defendant \u201creadily apparent to any one\u2014expert or nonexpert\u2014[so that there was] no likelihood that, whether looked at together or apart, the one could not be mistaken for the other.\u201d In other words, to the eyes of the ordinary observers one did not look like the other. As was said by A. N. Hand, J., in a subsequent action on the same patent when reissued, the changes made by the defendant Tatum were thought to have \u201cproceeded so far that it [could not] fairly be said that Ashley\u2019s design was a substantial and easily discernible feature of the completed structure.\u201d Ashley v. Samuel C. Tatum Co. (D. C.) 240 Fed. 979, 982.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The discussion has only illustrated how differently admitted phenomena affect different minds when all are endeavoring to appfy the admittedly proper measure in respect of design patents, viz. optical effect. In respect of this particular defendant\u2019s doll it is sufficient to say that there is an even stronger external resemblance between plaintiff\u2019s \u201ckewpie\u201d and defendant\u2019s so-called \u201cbest baby\u201d than is exhibited by the drawings inserted in the opinion in Borgfeldt v. Weiss, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Decree affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
