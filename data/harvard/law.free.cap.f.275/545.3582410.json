Kissam assigned 10 certain bonds and mortgages of individuals and certain bonds of corporations owned by him to John C. Knox, and subsequently Knox assigned them to Jonas B. Kissam and his wife, Cornelia. In the instruments of assignment Knox, as party of the first part, assigned the bonds and mortgages \u201cto the party of the second part, their survivor, such survivor\u2019s executors, administrators and assigns,\u201d and to hold \u201cto the party of the second part, the survivor of them, and to the successors, personal representatives, and assigns of the said party of the second part forever,\u201d and it was further stated that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-4\">\u201cIt is tlie intention of this assignment that the survivor of the said Jonas B. Kissam and Cornelia B. Kissam shall become the absolute owner of said bond and mortgage and that neither the said Jonas B. Kissam nor the said Cornelia B. Kissam shall have power to affect the right of the survivor thereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The instrument of assignment of the corporate bonds contained the same provisions. All parties concede that the ownership was at least joint, and that it could have been severed and turned into a tenancy in common by either party, notwithstanding the reservation that neither party could affect the right of the survivor. June 2, 1917, Kissam died, leaving all his estate to his wife, Cornelia; she and John C. Knox being executors of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The Act of September 8, 1916, known as the Estate Tax Law, by section 201 as amended by Act March 3, 1917, \u00a7 300 (Comp. St. 1918, \u00a7 6336%b), provides: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">\u201cSee. 201. That a tax (hereinafter in this title referred to as the tax), equal to the following percentages of the value of the net estate, to be determined as provided in section 203, is hereby imposed upon the transfer of the net estate of every decedent dying after the passage of this act, whether a resident or nonresident of the United States:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">\u201cOne and one-half per centum of the amount of such net .estate not in excess of $50,000. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-9\">\u201cSec. 202.

The executors paid the additional tax under protest, and after unsuccessfully seeking to obtain a refund brought this action; the complaint containing four causes of action, of which the first involved the considerations above mentioned. They claimed that the assessment was void as to the half of the joint property which vested in Cornelia before the passage of the Act of September 8. 1916, as amended, and also that the act itself was unconstitutional, ns a direct tax upon property without apportionment among the several states as required by article 1, section 9, subdivision 4, of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">The executors moved for judgment on the first cause of action, which motion the District Court granted, and the collector has sued out this writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">ft] We point out in the first place that the practice pursued was wholly erroneous. What has become of the three causes of action as to which there was no answer or demurrer? Judgment should have been entered in favor of the executors on the merits on the first cause of action, and by default upon the second, third, and fourth causes of action. Actions at law cannot be brought up in the federal courts by writ of error piecemeal; the whole controversy must be settled in one final judgment. As the judgment will be reversed, the whole controversy can be disposed of upon a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\"><bracketnum>[2, 3 |</bracketnum> The joint property mentioned in section 202, subdivision (c), is included as a measure of the tax payable by the estate for the decedent\u2019s privilege of disposing of his property by will or intestacy. It is an excise tax, and not a direct tax upon property. New York Trust Co. v. Eisner (D. C.) 263 Fed. 620; Prentiss v. Eisner (D. C.) 200 Fed. 589; Id. (C. C. A.) 267 Fed. 16. The language of the subdivision plainly applies to property in, which the decedent was interested jointly with any other person, and all of which was originally his; i. e., any part of the property which originally belonged to such other person, and never at any time belonged to the decedent, is not to he included. The expression \u201coriginally\u201d refers, not to the time of death, but to the time the joint interest was created. So the words \u201cnever to have belonged to the decedent\u201d mean at any time before the creation of the joint estate. The act takes effect upon the death; it does not become retroactive, because it measures a transfer tax payable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>fey the estate in part by property which the decedent has given away in his life time. This seems to ns perfectly fair, and an answer to the ; constitutional objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
