Our inquiry, therefore, must be confined to those counts only, and to such portions of the very voluminous record as are pertinent thereto; the record, however, containing a full transcript of the proceedings on the trial, the laborious examination of which has satisfied us that, as respects the <em>facts </em>of the case, certainly there is no ground upon which we would be justified in interfering with the result reached in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">One of the assignments of error insisted upon by the plaintiff in error is that the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash the indictment on the ground that, the grand jury that returned it was not a legal body, for the reason that the court made no order directing the clerk and the jury commissioner to select jurors to be put in the grand and petit jury box. In support of the motion the clerk was called as a witness and gave this, among other, testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-10\">\u201cThere was no order made by the court directing myself and the commissioner to select jurors to be put into the grand and petit jury box. There was no order of that kind made. The jury commissioner and clerk put the names in the box without a special order of the court to do so. The court did not at any time order and direct myself and the commissioner to select names from the different counties in this district and place them in the jury box to constitute petit and grand juries. The court did not make any order directing a certain number of names to be selected and drawn and put in the jury box. X can\u2019t turn to any order made in relation thereto. No such order was made. I put in the box\u2014that is, the jury box\u2014names of persons which were thereafter to be used as petit and grand jurors, without the court having first made an order directing me so to do. Q. Just prior to selecting the names for this grand jury box, which composed this grand jury, did you and the commissioner meet and select names to be put in the box before the grand jury was selected? A. I can\u2019t give you the date now that we put them in. I don\u2019t know whether it was immediately preceding the drawing of the grand jury or some time preceding. Q. Weil, you did do so, though, previous to selecting the grand jury? A. Yes. Q. On more than one occasion after the commissioner was appointed by the court? A. Yes. Q. How many occasions? A. On two or three: I am not certain. Q. Have you any minute entry of those occasions? A. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">Section 276 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. \u00a7 1253) prescribes that hoth grand and petit jurors shall be publicly drawn from a box containing at the time of each drawing the names of not less than 300 persons possessing the qualifications prescribed in the preceding section, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>which names shall have been placed therein by the clerk of such court and a commissioner, to be appointed by the judge thereof, or by the judge senior in commission in districts having more than one judge, which commissioner shall be a citizen of good standing, residing in the district in which such court is held, and a well-known member of the principal political party in the district in which the court is held opposing that to which the clerk may belong, the clerk and said commissioner each to place one name in said box alternately, without reference to parly affiliations, until the whole number required shall be placed therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">By Act Feb. 3, 1917, c. 27, 39 Stat. 873 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919, \u00a7 1253) the above-mentioned section was so amended as to confer upon a \u201cduly qualified deputy clerk\u201d the same authority as was therein given the clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Section 277 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St. \u00a7 1254) is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">\u201cJurors shall be returned from, such parts o\u00a3 the district, from time to time, as the court shall direct, so as to be most favorable to an impartial trial, and\u2019so as not to incur an unnecessary expense, or unduly burden the citizens of any part of the district with such service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-7\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> That section is applicable to grand, as well as petit, jurors. Agnew v. United vStates, 165 U. S. 44, 17 Sup. Ct. 235, 41 L. Ed. 624; Spencer v. United States, 169 Fed. 562, 95 C. C. A. 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">The clerk also testified that when the grand jury that returned the indictment in question was drawn more than 300 names were in the box, and the record also shows that the judge of the court had directed the clerk and jury commissioner regarding the statutory requirements, although it does not appear that such order was entered upon the minutes of the court. The record of the case, however, is absolutely destitute of anything tending to show that the plaintiff in error was in any way prejudiced thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">In United States v. Reed, 27 Fed. Cas. 727, the court, composed of Circuit Justice Nelson and District Judge Hall, held that under the act of August 8, 1846 (9 Stat. p. 73, \u00a7 3). providing that no grand jury should be summoned in the federal courts except upon an order for a venire, to be made by a judge, a verbal order given to the clerk, though not entered of record or filed, was sufficient. And in the Case of Fries, 9 Fed. Cas. 826, 923, Circuit Justice Iredell ruled that the required venire, issued with the sanction of the court, had the same effect as though the express order of the court had been annexed thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">In United States v. Caplis et al. (D. C.) 257 Fed. 840, where a plea in abatement to an indictment for a conspiracy was based on the allegation that the jury commissioner who assisted in the drawing of the grand jury which returned the indictment was not a well-known member of the principal political party in the district opposed to that to which the clerk belonged, the District Court, in overruling the plea, referred to a similar ruling made by Circuit Judge Pardee and District Judge Swain in the case of United States v. Chaires et al., in the Circuit Court for the Northern District of Florida (40 Fed. 820), where the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>\u201cAn inspection of this statute shows that the work of preparing the names of the persons possessing the qualifications of jurors, and placing them in the box, is to be done by the clerk of the court and a jury commissioner to be appointed by the judge. The duty to be performed by these parties is clearly and specifically prescribed in the statute. It may be considered, and probably is, mandatory; but it is entirely distinct from the duty devolving, under the statute, upon the judge. The plea under consideration relates entirely to the performance of the duty of the judge. By the statute the judge is to appoint a commissioner, who shall be a citizen of good standing, who shall reside m the district in which the court is held, and who shall be a well-known member of the principal political party in the district opposing that to which the clerk belongs. The question is whether this part of the statute is mandatory or directory; whether, in appointing a jury commissioner, the judge, while endeavoring to comply with the law, must make no mistake of faer or of judgment, but must, at the peril of all subsequent proceedings, be sure to appoint a citizen, not only of standing, but of' good standing, and not only a known, but a well-known, member of the principal political party opposed to that to which the clerk belongs. The statement of the question, and the nature of the case, satisfies us that the statute in this particular is directory, and not mandatory. What is the standard for a citizen- in good standing? By what rule is it to be determined who is a well-known member of a political party? Considering that the judge has knowledge, judicial or otherwise,- as to the political party of the clerk, by what rule is the judge to determine which is the principal party opposed? Suppose that the clerk is an Independent or a Prohibitionist? In case of a challenge to the array of jurors, or a plea in abatement, who is to try the issue? All matters and questions come back to the judge. The judge, in the exercise of a sound discretion, under the responsibilities of his oflice, directed by the statute, passes upon the qualifications of the jury commissioner he appoints, and his action would seem to be final and conclusive, except, perhaps, in the court that can call the judge to account for misbehavior in office. Particularly must this be the case where neither injury .nor prejudice nor oppression is apparent nor is averred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">By Act Feb. 26, 1919, Congress made this addition to section 269 of tire Judicial Code :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">\u201cOn the hearing of any appeal, certiorari, writ of error, or motion for a new trial in any ease, civil or criminal, the court shall give judgment after an examination of the entire record before the court, without regard to technical errors, defects, or exceptions which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d 40 Stat. p. 1181, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919, \u00a7 1240.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Prior to that amendment the general rule was that for such irregularities as did not prejudice the defendant he had no cause for complaint. Agnew v. United States, 165 U. S. 36, 44, 17 Sup. Ct. 235, 41 L. Ed. 624, and cases there cited; 24 Cyc. of Law &amp; Proc. 217, where may he found cited many decisions of the courts, and where it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">\u201cThe statutory provisions with regard to making up the jury list are ordinarily held to be merely directory, and errors and irregularities in failing to comply strictly with their provisions, which are not prejudicial to the parties, do not invalidate the list, or furnish any ground for challenging the array; but a substantial.compliance with the law is necessary, and a disregard of the material provisions which make up the essential features of the system, and are designed to secure and preserve a fair and impartial trial, is not a mere irregularity, and is ground for challenging the array, even though it does not affirmatively appear that any injury has resulted therefrom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">See, also, Apgar v.

United States, 236 Fed. 305, 149 C. C. A. 437, where the plaintiff in error was convicted under two counts of an indictment which charged him with abstracting and converting to his own use \u201ccertain moneys, funds, and credits\u201d of a certain national banking association, and alleging that the depositor in each instance \u201cwas a depositor and creditor\u201d of the bank, and that the intent of the plaintiff in error was \u201cto injure and defraud said national banking association and said depositor and creditor,\u201d the majority of this court sustained the validity of the indictment, saying, 236 Fed. at page 310, 149 C. C.

Ed. 478), in considering that statute, the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-17\">\u201cBy the settled rules of criminal pleading, and by tbe previous decisions of this court, the words \u2018willfully misapplies,\u2019 having no settled technical meaning (such as the word \u2018embezzle\u2019 has in the statutes, or the words \u2018steal, take, and carry away\u2019 have at common law), do not, of themselves, fully and clearly set forth every element necessary to constitute the offense intended to be punished, but they must be supplemented by further averments, showing how the misapplication was made, and that it was an unlawful one. Without such averments there is no sufficient description oE the exact offense with which the defendant is charged, so as to enable him to defend himself against it, or to plead an acquittal or conviction in bar of a future prosecution for tbe same canse. United States v. Britton, 107 U. S. 655, 661, 669; United States v. Northway, 120 U. S. 327, 332, 334; Evans v. United States, 153 U. S. 584, 587, 588.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-18\">In that case the court held that the attempt there made to set forth how the misapplication was made, and that it was unlawful, was too indefinite and uncertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-19\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> Iti the present case, however, the indictment, in our opinion, does clearly and specifically show how the alleged misapplication of the $46,219.10 of the moneys, funds, and credits of the bank was made, and that it was so made by the defendant with the alleged unlawful intent to deceive the Comptroller of the Currency; for it expressly alleges that the defendant, as agent and vice president of the bank, had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>as such the management, direction, and control over its moneys, funds, and credits, and did on a specified day willfully and unlawfully, with intent to deceive the comptroller, draw a check upon the bank for $46,219.10 in the name of Fidelity Construction Company, by himself as its vice president, and, with the alleged intent, willfully and unlawfully caused $46,219.10 of the moneys, funds, and credits of the bank to he applied in the payment of that check, which money was thereupon willfully and unlawfully applied by the defendant on the books of the bank to the liquidation of certain specified promissory notes with the intent to deceive the comptroller, he, the defendant, having no authority from the Fidelity Construction Company to draw said check or to cause its payment, and not being at the time or at any time vice president of that company. See Evans v. United States, 153 U. S. 584, 593, 14 Sup. Ct. 934, 38 L. Ed. 830; United States v. Eno (C. C.) 56 Fed. 218, 220; Breese v. United States, 106 Fed. 680, 685, 45 C. C. A. 535; United States v. Morse (C. C.) 161 Fed. 429, and numerous cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Count 33 alleged, in substance; that on January 29, 1917, the defendant, at the time being vice president and agent of the bank, did knowingly, willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously, and with intent to deceive any agent appointed by the Comptroller of the Currency to examine the affairs of the said banking institution, abstract from the credits thereof certain specifically described promissory notes belonging to the bank and constituting part of its assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> While the word \u201cabstract\u201d is not a word of settled technical meaning like the word \u201cembezzle,\u201d as used in the statutes defining the crime of embezzlement, dr the words \u201csteal, take, and carry away,\u201d as used to define the crime of larceny at common law (U. S. v. Northway, 120 U. S. 327, 7 Sup. Ct. 580, 30 L. Ed. 664; Batchelor v. U. S., 156 U. S. 426, 15 Sup. Ct. 446, 39 L. Ed. 478), there can, in our opinion, be no misunderstanding of the true meaning of the allegation of the willful and felonious abstraction by an officer and agent of a hank of certain specifically described promissory notes constituting a part of its assets; the words \u201csteal, take, and carry away\u201d could not make its meaning plainer. We therefore have no difficulty in sustaining the validity of count 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The sufficiency of counts 16,- 17, 21, and 22, charging the willful and unlawful entry in the books of the bank of specifically described false entries by the defendant with intent to deceive the comptroller, does not, we think, admit of question.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">We have given very careful consideration to the very full and painstaking charge of the learned judge of the court below to the jury, and are of the opinion that it embraced the substance of all of the defendant\u2019s requested instructions that were appropriate and proper, and was without any error of which the plaintiff in error can justly complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
