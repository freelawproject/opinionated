M.\u2014(Special)\u2014The Tribune this morning in a copyrighted article of Louis Durant Edwards, a correspondent in Germany, says that Germany to make the final effort against Great Britain has plunged 300 or more submersibles into the North Sea. These, according to this writer, were mobilized from Kiel, Hamburg, Wilhelmshaven and Bremerhaven, where for months picked crews were trained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-9\">\u201cThey form the world\u2019s first diving battle fleet,\u201d he says, \u201ca navy equally prepared to fight above or beneath the waves.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-10\">\u201cThere are two types of these new boats now in commission, one of 2,400 tons and one of 5,000 tons displacement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-12\">\u201cThey dive beneath the water in a fraction' of the time that it takes the older types to submerge.

But in so far as the Edwards article involves authorship and literary quality and style, apart from the bare recital of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>facts or statement of news, it is protected by the copyright law. <em>That </em>the entire copyrighted article involves in its production authorship as generally understood, and manifests literary quality and style in striking degree, is impressively apparent, from its perusal. While the appropriated portions comprise in perhaps larger degree the salient facts than do the deductions, descriptions, and comments with which the other parts of the copyrighted article more largely deal, they are nevertheless not wholly or strictly confined to recital of mere facts. This appears evident from the perusal of some of the portions appropriated :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-4\">\u201cThey form the world\u2019s first diving battle fleet, a navy equally prepared to fight above <em>or </em>beneath the waves. * * * They dive beneath the water in a fraction of the time that it takes the older types to submerge. They mount powerful guns, are capable of great surface speed, and are protected by heavy armor of tough steel plate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">This is plainly more than a mere chronicle of facts or news. It reveals a peculiar power of portrayal, and a felicity of wording' and phrasing, well calculated to seize and hold the interest of the reader, which is quite beyond and apart from the mere setting forth of the facts. But if the whole of it were considered as stating news or facts, yet the arrangement and manner of statement plainly discloses a distinct literary flavor and individuality of expression peculiar to authorship, bringing the article clearly wiihm the purview and protection of the Copyright Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> We find no merit in the contention that the Herald publication constitutes no substantial part of the copyrighted article. It presents the essential facts of that article in the very garb wherein the author clothed them, together with some of his deductions and comments thereon in his precise words, and all with the same evident purpose of attractively and effectively serving them to the reading public. Whether the appropriated publication constitutes a substantial portion of that which It copyrighted cannot be determined alone by lines or inches which measure the respective articles. We regard the Herald publication as in truth a very substantial portion of the copyrighted article, and tiie transgression in its unauthorized appropriation Is not to be neutralized on the plea that \u201cit is such a Hide one.\u2019*</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">Nor is here influential the suggestion that the Herald article gives credit to the author, and sets forth as its authority that the article was copyrighted by tbe New York Tribune. Lar from there being any exculpatory virtue In this, it would lend rather to convey to the reading public the false Impression that authority to appropriate tire extracts from the copyrighted article had been duly secured by the offending publisher.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">We are of the opinion that the facts set forth, in the declaration warranted the judgment, and, no error appearing, it is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
