The two paragraphs road:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b821-6\">\u201cIf buyer fails in any one month to take his monthly proportion of the above stated requirements or quantity, buyer cannot thereafter, without the written consent of seller, take the balance of Hie proportion for that month, tout may toe required by seller to take such balance.

Such controversy as exists arises out of plaintiff\u2019s alleged failure to deliver defendant\u2019s asserted requirements for the next 5 months which were 7,161,899 gallons. During this period, defendant furnished 5,162,799 gallons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b821-9\">Although (here was a marked increase in defendant\u2019s requirements in the 15 month's\u2019 period, during which time the market price for this oil rose rapidly and exceeded the contract price, there is no claim of \u201cpadding\u201d presented by the record. In other words, it is conceded that the requisitions were the actual bona fide requirements of defendant. Plaintiff recovered judgment for the sum w itbhelcl by defendant because of the alleged failure to deliver the oil demanded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b821-10\">Max Pam, of Chicago, 111., for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b821-11\">Charles Y.

EVANS, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ABT\">(after stating the facts as above). The parties differ as to the proper construction to be given to their contract. Defendant contends that it was obligated to purchase all of its requirements from the plaintiff, and plaintiff was obligated to sell all of defendant\u2019s requirements up to a maximum of 15,000,000 gallons in fifteen mouths; that if it did not order 1,000,000 gallons in any one or more mouths, it could, if its requirements permitted, increase its demand for any other month. Plaintiff contends that it was not compelled to ship more than 1,000,000 gallons in any one month.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-14\">Was this a requirements or a quantity contract? Defendant urges that the fair construction of the entire contract impels us to hold that it was a requirements contact, and further, if any uncertainty exists, it is removed when we read the two paragraphs above quoted which were stricken from the contract before it was executed. When these omitted paragraphs were offered in evidence, Judge Page said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-15\">\u201cIt seems to me that the language o\u00ed this contract is perfectly plain and easily understood, and for this reason I am not permitting extraneous and outside matters to be introduced.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-16\">We agree that the contract is clear and unambiguous, and needs no evidence to remove asserted ambiguities. Further, we cannot agree with counsel that the two paragraphs stricken from the original con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>tract would tend to clarify it. The evidence was therefore properly excluded. Brawley v. United States, 96 U. S. 168, 173, 24 L. Ed. 622; 6 Ruling Case Law, p. 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The contract contains a maximum and a minimum provision. The minimum is stated as \u201cthe actual requirements\u201d of defendant. It is evident therefrom that the conti-act is not, as defendant urges, a \u201crequirements contract.\u201d Lor it must have been contemplated that there was a difference between the minimum and the maximum, and if the minimum was represented by defendant\u2019s requirements, it cannot be said that the parties were contracting to furnish defendant\u2019s actual requirements. Rather would it be logical to assume that the parties were contracting to purchase and sell a quantity of oil, the maximum amount being 15,000,000 gallons, and the minimum to be defendant\u2019s requirements, not, of course, exceeding 15,000,000 gallons. This conclusion might be entirely consistent with defendant\u2019s claim (if not with its theory) but for the two other quoted paragraphs of the contract, which we are not at liberty to ignore. When the parties provided for shipments to be made in \u201cfairly equal monthly quantities,\u201d the maximum and minimum provision must be read in the light thereof and in connection therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Is a court justified in saying that a contract which contained a clause for shipment in \u201cfairly equal monthly quantities\u201d permits of a construction that allows defendant to demand 254,633 gallons in one month and 1,632,236 gallons in another month? Or for four successive months the defendant may call for a total of 1,280,000 gallons, and for four other successive months 5,970,000 gallons? To justify this conclusion we would be compelled to totally ignore the \u201cfairly equal monthly shipments\u201d provision of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">But another reason may be found to support plaintiff\u2019s position. The provision making each shipment a separate and independent contract cannot be ignored. Read in the light of the further clause calling for shipments to follow shortly after plaintiff\u2019s receipt of a statement of defendant\u2019s monthly requirements, we conclude the separate shipment which is there referred to as a separate and independent contract is a monthly shipment. Further reason, therefore, exists for stressing the effect of a \u201cfairly equal monthly quantities\u201d provision, where the parties have specifically provided that each such monthly shipment is \u201ca separate and independent contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">The maximum amount which plaintiff was obligated to deliver was 15,000,000 gallons. The period of delivery was 15 months. Deliveries were to be made in \u201cfairly equal monthly quantities.\u201d The conclusion that the parties intended that the monthly maximum should be 1,000,000 gallons is unavoidable.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
