The act' of the General Assembly approved January 28, 1946 (Ga. L. 1946, pp. 90-93; Code, Ann. Supp., \u00a7 30-101), provides that a verdict or judgment for total divorce shall become of full force and effect at the expiration of thirty days \u201cunless some person at interest shall file in said court a written petition setting forth good and sufficient grounds for the modification or setting aside of such verdict or judgment.\u201d In the present case no written petition setting forth \u201cgood and sufficient grounds\u201d for the setting aside of the original divorce decree was filed in the manner directed by law. See <em>Allison </em>v. <em>Allison, </em>204 <em>Ga. </em>202 (48 S. E. 2d, 723); <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>204 <em>Ga. </em>363 (49 S.

The judgment of the court entered on May 11, 1951, \u201cupon oral motion of plaintiff\u2019s counsel,\u201d was a mere nullity; and all subsequent judgments by the court in this case are void. The original judgment and decree of divorce stands as a valid judgment, since no petition setting forth \"good and sufficient grounds\u201d was filed to set aside the judgment within the time provided by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"Ao2_\">\n<em>All the Justices concur.</em>\n</judges>\n<p id=\"b713-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>On August 9, 1951, W.
