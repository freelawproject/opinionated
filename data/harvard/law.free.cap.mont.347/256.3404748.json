We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\u00b62 Marx began active service with the Belgrade Rural Fire Department (Department), on a volunteer basis, in 1979. In 1995, he requested a temporary leave of absence from the Department in order to devote more time to family commitments and to his outside job, where he had been recently promoted. In addition, as of July of that year, Marx had not completed the training requirements necessary to continue serving as a volunteer firefighter with the Department. As a result, the Department had placed him on probation for the calendar quarter running July 1 through September 30, 1995, and had cautioned him that \u201cif you don\u2019t meet the minimum requirements for the next quarter, you will be removed from the rolls of the department.\u201d Marx indicated in his request for a temporary leave that he would complete the training requirements during his leave of absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\u00b63 The Department\u2019s acting chief submitted a letter to the Association\u2019s Board of Trustees (Board) recommending Marx be given until the end of October 1995 to complete a CPR refresher course and until January 1996 to meet the other minimum training requirements. The Board considered Marx\u2019s request at its October 3, 1995 meeting and rejected the Chiefs recommendation. The Board instead terminated Marx\u2019s service.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">\u00b64 Following his termination, Marx claims he made a number of verbal requests to the Board for a partial pension under \u00a7 19-18-602(5), MCA (1995).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That provision states, in pertinent part, that a member of a pure volunteer fire department who has completed 10 years\u2019 service as an active member of the department but who is prevented from completing 20 years\u2019 service by \u201cany . . . factor beyond his reasonable control may nevertheless qualify for a partial or reduced pension in an amount and to the extent determined by the board of trustees of the association.\u201d Section 19-18-602(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">\u00b65 According to Marx\u2019s affidavit filed in the District Court, the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>of his requests for a partial pension occurred within six months after his termination, and he was \u201cassured\u201d that the Board would act on the request and notify him of its decision. Marx states that he reiterated his request a number of times over the next few years and that the Board repeatedly assured him of its intent to act upon the request. However, because he was \u201ccontinually left in a state of limbo,\u201d Marx finally sent a written \u201cfollow-up request\u201d for the partial pension to the Board on December 21, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\u00b66 In March 2004, the Board denied Marx\u2019s request in a letter, explaining that \u201c[t]he trustees believe that your request does not meet the criteria for giving benefits.\u201d The Board enclosed with the letter a copy of \u00a7 19-18-602, MCA, which the Board stated was \u201cthe basis for [its] decision.\u201d Subsection (5) of \u00a7 19-18-602, MCA, was highlighted and the language \u201cother factor beyond the member\u2019s reasonable control may qualify for a partial or reduced pension\u201d was underlined. The Board included no other justification or explanation for denying Marx\u2019s pension request.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\u00b67 Marx filed the instant action against the Association on August 25, 2004, seeking damages and declaratory relief. He alleged that he qualified for a partial or reduced pension under \u00a7 19-18-602(5), MCA, and that the Board had abused its discretion and acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying him this pension. In August 2005, the Association filed a motion for summary judgment, relying in part on a statute of limitations defense. The Association argued that under \u00a7 27-2-211(1), MCA, Marx was required to have filed suit within two years of his termination, i.e., \u201cnot later than October 5, 1997, some eight years ago.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\u00b68 The District Court agreed with the Association and granted its motion on May 11, 2006. The court first observed that Marx had raised a genuine issue of material fact \u201cas to [the] reason for his termination.\u201d Accordingly, the court assumed for purposes of its analysis that Marx had been terminated from the Department \u201cfor reasons beyond his control\u201d and, thus, could qualify for a partial or reduced pension under \u00a7 19-18-602(5), MCA. The court identified the next issue as \u201chow long a claimant has to claim his or her pension.\u201d Observing that \u00a7 19-18-602, MCA, and the surrounding provisions do not provide an answer, the court turned to \u00a7 27-2-211(1)(c), MCA, which establishes a two-year statute of limitations for claims arising out of \u201ca liability created by statute other than ... a penalty or forfeiture; or a statutory debt created by the payment of public assistance\u201d (paragraph breaks omitted). The court decided that a volunteer firefighter\u2019s potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>right to a service pension is \u201ca liability created by statute that is not a penalty, forfeiture, or statutory debt created by the payment of public assistance.\u201d Accordingly, the court concluded that the two-year statute of limitations applied to Marx\u2019s claim. Lastly, the court noted that the statute of limitations does not start to run until the claim accrues. In this regard, \u00a7 27-2-102(1)(a), MCA, states that \u201ca claim or cause of action accrues when all elements of the claim or cause exist or have occurred, the right to maintain an action on the claim or cause is complete, and a court or other agency is authorized to accept jurisdiction of the action.\u201d In light of this definition, the court reasoned that once Marx was dismissed from the Department in October 1995, \u201chis potential entitlement to a partial pension vested under the provisions of \u00a7 19-18-602, MCA. That is, nothing more had to happen in order for him to be able to request the partial pension.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\">\u00b69 Based on the foregoing analysis, the District Court concluded the Association had established a valid statute of limitations defense under \u00a7 27-2-211(1)(c), MCA; that Marx had not met his burden as the party opposing summary judgment to show a genuine issue of material fact related to the application of \u00a7 27-2-211, MCA; and that under the undisputed relevant facts, the Association was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In reaching this conclusion, the court rejected Marx\u2019s arguments under a separate statute, \u00a7 27-2-301, MCA, on the grounds that this statute was inapplicable and that, even if the statute did apply, Marx\u2019s claim was still untimely. (The District Court\u2019s reasoning with respect to \u00a7 27-2-301, MCA, is discussed below.)</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">\u00b610 Marx now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\u00b611 Broadly speaking, the issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in granting the Association\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In challenging the District Court\u2019s decision, Marx asserts three theories. First, he contends that the accrual date of his cause of action is controlled by \u00a7 27-2-301, MCA, and that the District Court erred in its analysis under this statute. Second, he contends that the doctrines of estoppel and waiver precluded the Association from asserting a statute of limitations defense in the first place. Third, he contends that under the doctrine of equitable tolling, the statute of limitations applicable to this action could be \u201cequitably modified\u201d or simply \u201cprecluded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\u00b612 As to the second and third theories, Marx\u2019s arguments consist of nothing more than conclusory assertions. He neither lays out the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>elements of estoppel, waiver, and equitable tolling nor explains, based on a proper application of law to facts, why he is entitled to relief under these doctrines. With respect to the tolling theory in particular, we note that Marx\u2019s arguments in his appellate briefs are dedicated almost exclusively to the question of when his cause of action accrued, not whether the statute of limitations was tolled, and he cites no authority whatsoever for the proposition that, in the absence of an applicable statute, a mere informal request for action or relief tolls a statute of limitations indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u00b613 This approach is an utterly inadequate presentation of an issue to this Court. <em>See </em>M. R. App. P. 12(1)f. (requiring the argument section of the appellant\u2019s brief to contain \u201cthe contentions of the appellant with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor, with citations to the authorities, statutes, and pages of the record relied on\u201d); <em>see also e.g. State v. Mackrill, </em>2008 MT 297, \u00b6 49, 345 Mont. 469, \u00b6 49, 191 P.3d 451, \u00b6 49; <em>Jackson v. Jackson, </em>2008 MT 25, \u00b6 18, 341 Mont. 227, \u00b6 18, 177 P.3d 474, \u00b6 18. It is not this Court\u2019s job to conduct legal research on a party\u2019s behalf or to develop legal analysis that may lend support to the position he advances. <em>See In re Marriage of McMahon, </em>2002 MT 198, \u00b6 6, 311 Mont. 175, \u00b6 6, 53 P.3d 1266, \u00b6 6; <em>State v. Gomez, </em>2007 MT 111, \u00b6 33, 337 Mont. 219, \u00b6 33, 158 P.3d 442, \u00b6 33. Accordingly, we will not further address Marx\u2019s estoppel, waiver, and equitable-tolling theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b614 The sole issue on appeal, therefore, is whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the Association based on an incorrect determination of the accrual date of Marx\u2019s cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\u00b615 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment de novo, applying the criteria set forth in M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Willden v. Neumann, </em>2008 MT 236, \u00b6 13, 344 Mont. 407, \u00b6 13, 189 P.3d 610, \u00b6 13; <em>Corporate Air v. Edwards Jet Center, </em>2008 MT 283, \u00b6 24, 345 Mont. 336, \u00b6 24, 190 P.3d 1111, \u00b6 24. Rule 56(c) provides that the judgment sought \u201cshall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d The party moving for summary judgment has the initial burden of establishing both the absence of genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>matter of law. <em>Corporate Air, </em>\u00b6 25. The evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and all reasonable inferences are to be drawn therefrom in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Peterson v. Eichhorn, </em>2008 MT 250, \u00b6 12, 344 Mont. 540, \u00b6 12, 189 P.3d 615, \u00b6 12. If the moving party meets its initial burden, then the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to establish with substantial evidence, as opposed to mere denial, speculation, or conclusory statements, that a genuine issue of material fact does exist. <em>Peterson, </em>\u00b6 13; <em>Willden, </em>\u00b6 13. If no genuine issue of material fact exists, then the court determines whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Corporate Air, </em>\u00b6 25. This determination is a conclusion of law, which we review for correctness. <em>Corporate Air, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-3\">\u00b616 Whether the Association is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on its statute of limitations defense requires an interpretation and application of pertinent statutes. This Court reviews for correctness a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of a statute. <em>In re A.W., </em>1999 MT 42, \u00b6 6, 293 Mont. 358, \u00b6 6, 975 P.2d 1250, \u00b6 6; <em>Williams v. Zortman Mining, Inc., </em>275 Mont. 510, 512, 914 P.2d 971, 972-73 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u00b617 <em>Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment in favor of the Association based on an incorrect determination of the accrual date of Marx\u2019s cause of action?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\u00b618 Marx does not address the preliminary steps in the District Court\u2019s analysis. As noted, the court assumed, for the sake of argument, that Marx could qualify for a partial or reduced pension under \u00a7 19-18-602(5), MCA. The court then decided that the \u201cright to a service pension\u201d is \u201ca liability created by statute\u201d as contemplated by \u00a7 27-2-211(1)(c), MCA. Thus, the court concluded that the two-year statute of limitations in \u00a7 27-2-211(1)(c), MCA, applied to Marx\u2019s cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">\u00b619 Marx begins the Argument section of his brief with the statement, \u201cEven assuming that the two-year limitations period for statutory obligations under \u00a727-2-211[(1)](c), MCA, applies in this case ....\u201d It is not clear from Marx\u2019s use of the prefatory words \u201cEven assuming\u201d whether (1) he does not believe that \u00a7 27-2-211(1)(c), MCA, is the appropriate statute of limitations here or (2) he is making an offhand reference to his theory that the Association is precluded by estoppel and waiver from asserting a statute of limitations defense in the first place. Either way, he presents no argument that a different statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>limitations provision should apply, and his estoppel and waiver contentions are not properly before us for the reasons discussed above. Thus, we proceed on the premise that \u00a7 27-2-211(1)(c), MCA, is the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\u00b620 The crux of the issue raised by Marx is <em>when </em>the two-year limitations period began to run, i.e., when his cause of action against the Association accrued. In answering this question, the District Court relied on \u00a7 27-2-102(1)(a), MCA, which, as noted, states that a cause of action accrues \u201cwhen all elements of the claim or cause exist or have occurred, the right to maintain an action on the claim or cause is complete, and a court or other agency is authorized to accept jurisdiction of the action.\u201d Based on this statute, the court concluded that Marx\u2019s cause of action accrued in October 1995 when he was dismissed from the Department and that the statute of limitations, therefore, expired in October 1997. It is on this point that Marx contends the District Court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u00b621 Specifically, Marx articulates a \u201ctheory of delayed accrual.\u201d He first asserts that \u00a7 27-2-211(1)(c), MCA, is \u201csubject to the accrual rules\u201d set forth in Title 27, chapter 2, part 3, MCA. In particular, he relies on \u00a7 27-2-301, MCA, which states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">Where a right exists but a demand is necessary to entitle a person to maintain an action, the time within which the action must be commenced must be computed from the time when the demand is made, except where the right grows out of the receipt or detention of money or property by an agent, trustee, attorney, or other person acting in a fiduciary capacity, the time must be computed from the time when the person having the right to make the demand has actual knowledge of the facts upon which that right depends.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">In addition, Marx cites <em>Viers v. Webb, </em>76 Mont. 38, 245 P. 257 (1926), as standing for the rule that \u201cin fiduciary relationships, such as a bailment or trust, the statute of limitations does not begin to run until a demand or request has been made which is then denied or rejected.\u201d He also cites <em>State ex rel. Central Auxiliary Corporation v. Rorabeck, </em>111 Mont. 320, 108 P.2d 601 (1940), for the proposition that \u201cthe statute of limitations does not run until a trustee formally repudiates his obligation.\u201d Applying these rules and \u00a7 27-2-301, MCA, to the case at hand, Marx argues that \u201cthe Association\u2019s position did not become clear or irretrievable until its trustees and officers had finally issued a formal or official notification of their determination to deny his request, with the same being mailed on March 18, 2004.\u201d In Marx\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>view, therefore, his \u201cobligation to commence litigation did not accrue and/or was not triggered until that time - the intervening delays of the Association notwithstanding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\">\u00b622 We are not persuaded by Marx\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 27-2-301, MCA, and his rule of \u201cformal\u201d repudiation/denial. At the outset, Marx does not point to any statutory language (and we have found none) stating that the two-year limitations period prescribed by \u00a7 27-2-211(1)(c), MCA, is \u201csubject to\u201d the accrual rule in \u00a7 27-2-301, MCA. Rather, the statutory scheme states that, \u201c[u]nless otherwise provided by statute, the period of limitation begins when the claim or cause of action accrues,\u201d \u00a7 27-2-102(2), MCA, and \u201ca claim or cause of action accrues when all elements of the claim or cause exist or have occurred, the right to maintain an action on the claim or cause is complete, and a court or other agency is authorized to accept jurisdiction of the action,\u201d \u00a7 27-2-102(1)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">\u00b623 The accrual provisions set out in \u00a7\u00a7 27-2-301 to -304, MCA, apparently supersede \u00a7 27-2-102(1)(a), MCA, in the particular circumstances addressed in \u00a7\u00a7 27-2-301 to -304, MCA. For instance, \u00a7 27-2-301, MCA, applies to situations in which a demand is necessary to entitle a person to maintain an action; \u00a7 27-2-302, MCA, applies to mutual accounts; \u00a7 27-2-303, MCA, applies to actions for waste, trespass, or injury committed during mining work or exploration; and \u00a7 27-2-304, MCA, applies to actions involving personal property accruing after death and before issuance of letters of administration. However, nothing in \u00a7 27-2-211(1), MCA, indicates that an action upon a liability created by statute is \u201csubject to\u201d the specific accrual provisions in \u00a7\u00a7 27-2-301 to -304, MCA, as opposed to the general accrual provision in \u00a7 27-2-102(1)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">\u00b624 The only remaining question, therefore, is whether \u00a7 27-2-301, MCA, supersedes \u00a7 27-2-102(1)(a), MCA, on the facts of this case. The language of \u00a7 27-2-301, MCA, suggests it does not for at least two reasons. First, this provision applies \u201c[w]here a right exists but a demand is necessary to entitle a person to maintain an action.\u201d Section 27-2-301, MCA. Marx cites no authority for the proposition that \u201ca demand\u201d was necessary before he could maintain an action against the Association for a partial pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\u00b625 Second, and at the heart of Marx\u2019s arguments, \u00a7 27-2-301, MCA, prescribes a special accrual rule where \u201cthe right grows out of the receipt or detention of money or property by an agent, trustee, attorney, or other person acting in a fiduciary capacity.\u201d In that situation, \u201cthe time [within which the action must be commenced] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>must be computed from the time when the person having the right to make the demand has actual knowledge of the facts upon which that right depends.\u201d Section 27-2-301, MCA. Marx\u2019s position appears to be that the Board was acting in a fiduciary capacity vis-\u00e1-vis the partial pension for which he claims he qualified under \u00a7 19-18-602(5), MCA. The District Court accepted this premise for the sake of analysis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court then reasoned that Marx\u2019s repeated requests for a partial pension, which he began making within six months of his October 1995 termination, evidenced his \u201cactual knowledge of his right to apply for a partial pension\u201d and the two-year limitations period, therefore, began to run sometime in 1996. Furthermore, the court concluded that the Association\u2019s alleged delay in providing Marx with a definite answer to his verbal requests was irrelevant in light of our statement in <em>Pincus v. Pincus\u2019 Estate, </em>95 Mont. 375, 26 P.2d 986 (1933), that the statute of limitations commences to rim \u201cfrom the time that plaintiff knew the facts which would have justified him in making demand\u201d for the profits to which he claimed he was entitled. <em>Pincus, </em>95 Mont. at 386-87, 26 P.2d at 991 (citing \u00a7 9058, RCM (1921), which is now \u00a7 27-2-301, MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">\u00b626 Marx, however, argues that he could not have had \u201cactual knowledge of the facts upon which [his] right depends\u201d until the Board sent him the repudiation letter in March 2004. He likens the instant action against the Association to an action \u201cfor breach of a trust or fiduciary obligation,\u201d and he asserts that such an action does not accrue until the trustee/fiduciary \u201cformally repudiates\u201d its obligation and the beneficiary has knowledge of that repudiation. Notably, none of the authorities cited by Marx in support of this argument uses the term \u201cformally repudiates\u201d or \u201cformal repudiation,\u201d <em>see Rorabeck, </em>111 Mont. 320, 108 P.2d 601; <em>Viers, </em>76 Mont. 38, 245 P. 257; <em>Blackford v. City of Libby, </em>103 Mont. 272, 62 P.2d 216 (1936); <em>Cobell v. Norton, </em>260 F. Supp. 2d 98 (D.D.C. 2003); <em>Oeth v. Mason, </em>56 Cal. Rptr. 69 (Cal. App. 2d Dist. 1967); <em>April Enterprises, Inc. v. KTTV, </em>195 Cal. Rptr. 421 (Cal. App. 2d Dist. 1983); <em>Restatement (Second) of Trusts </em>\u00a7 219 (1992), and Marx cites no authority holding that a repudiation of a fiduciary obligation must be accomplished by written letter (as opposed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>conduct amounting to a repudiation). But the ultimate flaw in Marx\u2019s argument is that he essentially would have us insert a requirement of \u201cformal repudiation\u201d or \u201cformal denial of a claim\u201d into \u00a7 27-2-301, MCA. This we may not do. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA (\u201cIn the construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\u00b627 Again, the statutory language under consideration states that \u201cthe time [within which the action must be commenced] must be computed from <em>the time when the person having the right to make the demand has actual knowledge of the facts upon which that right depends.\u201d </em>Section 27-2-301, MCA (emphasis added). Marx\u2019s right depends on the facts that he was a member of a pure volunteer fire department who completed 10 years\u2019 service as an active member of the department but was prevented from completing 20 years\u2019 service by a \u201cfactor beyond [his] reasonable control.\u201d Section 19-18-602(5), MCA. Marx had actual knowledge of these facts in October 1995. Even assuming the Board was acting in a fiduciary capacity and it detained money or property to which Marx was entitled, Marx has failed to show error in the District Court\u2019s determination that, under \u00a7 27-2-301, MCA, his action accrued in October 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\u00b628 Before concluding, we note Marx\u2019s reliance on <em>Martin v. Construction Laborer\u2019s Pension Trust, </em>947 F.2d 1381 (9th Cir. 1991), <em>Wetzel v. Lou Ehlers Cadillac Group, </em>222 F.3d 643 (9th Cir. 2000), and <em>Kosty v. Lewis, </em>319 F.2d 744 (D.C. Cir. 1963), for the proposition that a suit to enforce rights under a pension plan accrues when there has been \u201ca clear and continuing repudiation\u201d of rights made known to the beneficiary, and not while the trustees are \u201cgiving continuing consideration\u201d to the applicant\u2019s eligibility. We find these cases inapposite for the simple reason that \u201cfederal law determines the time at which the cause of action accrues,\u201d <em>Martin, </em>947 F.2d at 1384, whereas here we are concerned with the rules of accrual provided under Montana law in \u00a7\u00a7 27-2-102(1)(a) and -301, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\u00b629 We also note Marx\u2019s argument that under the District Court\u2019s interpretation and application of the foregoing statutes, \u201cparticipants, beneficiaries and claimants effectively could be required to file suit before their administrative remedies have been exhausted.\u201d Marx likens this to a \u201cshoot first and ask questions later\u201d approach, and he speculates that had he filed suit prior to the March 2004 written denial, the Association would have complained that his suit was \u201cpremature.\u201d Marx also claims it was not \u201chis fault\u201d the Association <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>\u201cconsistently put [him] off\u201d and it was not \u201cfair\u201d for the Association to ignore his requests. Whether or not these statements are true, however, they ultimately miss the mark. Marx identifies no statutory provision requiring him to exhaust \u201cadministrative remedies\u201d before pursuing an action for a partial pension. Moreover, his assertions in this regard seem to relate more to his estoppel and waiver theories than the application of \u00a7\u00a7 27-2-102(1)(a) and -301, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\u00b630  With respect to the Association\u2019s statute of limitations defense, we conclude that the Association met its initial burden, as the moving party, of establishing both the absence of genuine issues of material fact and its entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. Furthermore, Marx did not meet his burden as the nonmoving party of establishing, with substantial evidence, the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. Based on the application of \u00a7\u00a7 27-2-102(l)(a), -211(1)(c), and -301, MCA, to the undisputed relevant facts, the Association was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on its statute of limitations defense. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\u00b631 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b286-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICE COTTER, WARNER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b277-9\"> All statutory references are to the 1995 version of the Montana Code Annotated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b284-5\"> The issue of whether Marx in fact qualified for a partial pension, which the Board (allegedly) arbitrarily and capriciously denied, was not resolved in the District Court since the court dismissed his complaint at the summary judgment stage based on the statute of limitations. Likewise, here, for the sake of argument, we accept, but do not resolve, the premise that that the Board was acting in a fiduciary capacity vis-avis a partial pension to which Marx was entitled.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
