With the consent of the Yellowstone Comity Attorney and the District Court, Samples reserved the right to appeal the District Court\u2019s previous denial of a petition to change his level 3 sexual offender designation and to dismiss the information on constitutional grounds. Judgment was entered and Samples now appeals from the denial of his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">\u00b62 Samples raises numerous issues, which we restate as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">\u00b63 Issue 1: Is the provision of the Sexual and Violent Offender Registration Act (2001 Act) requiring an offender to report a change of residence void for vagueness?</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">\u00b64 Issue 2: Does the provision of the 2001 Act requiring an offender to report a change of residence demonstrate Samples did not commit a crime?</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">\u00b65 Issue 3: Did the 1999 version of the Sexual and Violent Offender Registration Act (1999 Act) as applied to Samples deprive him of his constitutional right to due process of law because the Department of Corrections (DOC) set his sexual offender risk level without notifying him or giving him an opportunity to contest the designation?</p>\n<p id=\"b313-13\">\u00b66 Samples avers other constitutional violations. However, because we conclude that Issues 1 through 3 are dispositive, we do not address the remaining issues Samples raises.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">\u00b67 In 1989, Samples pled guilty to one count of sexual assault. He was sentenced to serve ten years at Montana State Prison, with all but the first thirty days suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b68 That same year, 1989, the Montana Legislature enacted the Sexual Offender Registration Act (amended and re-titled in 1995 as the Sexual or Violent Offender Registration Act) requiring convicted sex offenders to register in the county where they live. The Act also requires offenders to be assigned a risk level, level 1,2, or 3, indicating how likely they are to re-offend. Level 3 offenders are considered at a high risk of re-offending and have the strictest registration requirements. Section 46-23-509(2)(c), MCA (2001). The Act requires all registered offenders to inform authorities of any changes in their address.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u00b69 In 1998, the District Comb revoked Samples\u2019s suspended sentence and committed him to the DOC for five years. He discharged his sentence in 2000. Upon his discharge, as Samples had not been assigned a risk level by the District Court, DOC designated him a level 3 sexual offender pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-509(5), MCA (1999). He did not receive any notice that DOC intended to designate him a level 3 offender and did not have an opportunity to see or contest the data DOC relied on to designate him a level 3 offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\u00b610 Samples updated his registration each time he changed his address until June of 2002. He had been residing at the Montana Rescue Mission, a shelter in Billings. He left the shelter in June of 2002 and became homeless. He did not inform the appropriate authorities he was no longer staying at the shelter.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">\u00b611 In August 2002, the State charged Samples with failure to register as a sexual offender, in violation of \u00a7 46-23-507, MCA (2001). Samples initially pled not guilty and counsel was appointed to represent him. However, Samples filed a <em>pro se </em>petition in the District Court arguing the 2001 Act was unconstitutional on a variety of grounds. The District Court denied this petition. Samples subsequently pled guilty to the charge, reserving the right to appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of his <em>pro se </em>petition. On appeal, this Court concluded that the District Court should have addressed each of the constitutional issues raised in Samples\u2019s petition and thus remanded the matter for reconsideration. <em>State v. Samples, </em>2005 MT 210, \u00b6 15, 328 Mont. 242, \u00b6 15, 119 P.3d 1191, \u00b6 15 <em>(Samples I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">\u00b612 On remand, Samples, with the assistance of counsel, filed an amended petition challenging the constitutionality of the Act as it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>applied to him. The District Court again dismissed his petition. Samples now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u00b613 Samples\u2019s petition is essentially a motion to dismiss. A district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss is a question of law, which we review de novo to determine whether it is correct. <em>Samples I, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\u00b614 Questions of constitutional law are subject to plenary review by this Court. <em>State v. Webb, </em>2005 MT 5, \u00b6 9, 325 Mont. 317, \u00b6 9, 106 P.3d 521, \u00b6 9. All statutes are presumed to be constitutional, and we will construe a statute so as to avoid an unconstitutional interpretation whenever possible. <em>Hernandez v. Bd. of Cty. Commrs., </em>2008 MT 251, \u00b6 15, 345 Mont. 1, \u00b6 15, 189 P.3d 638, \u00b6 15. A statute may be held unconstitutionally vague in violation of due process if it is void on its face or if it is unconstitutional \u201cas-applied\u201d to the situation at hand. <em>State v. Knudson, </em>2007 MT 324, \u00b6 16, 340 Mont. 167, \u00b6 16, 174 P.3d 469, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">\u00b615 <em>Issue 1: Is the provision of the 2001 Act requiring an offender to report a change of residence void for vagueness ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">\u00b616 As noted above, a statute may be challenged as violative of the right to due process for its vagueness on two different bases: (1) the statute is so vague that it is void on its face; or (2) the statute is vague as applied in a particular situation. The void-for-vagueness doctrine requires a criminal statute to define the offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. <em>State v. Turbiville, </em>2003 MT 340, \u00b6 18, 318 Mont. 451, \u00b6 18, 81 P.3d 475, \u00b6 18 (citing <em>State v. Britton, </em>2001 MT 141, \u00b6\u00b6 5-6, 306 Mont. 24, \u00b6\u00b6 5-6, 30 P.3d 337, \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">\u00b617 A statute that fails to meet this standard is void for vagueness. The statute need not provide \u201cperfect clarity and precise guidance\u201d but it must give a person fair notice that his conduct is forbidden. <em>State v. Leeson, </em>2003 MT 354, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 15, 319 Mont. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 15, 82 P.3d 16, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 15 (citations omitted). To prove a statute is vague on its face, a party must show it is impermissibly vague in all of its applications. <em>State v. Dixon, </em>2000 MT 82, \u00b6 18, 299 Mont. 165, \u00b6 18, 998 P.2d 544, \u00b6 18. If a statute is \u201creasonably clear\u201d in its application to the conduct of the person challenging the statute, it is not void for vagueness. <em>Dixon, </em>\u00b6 20 (citations omitted). Although the Sexual Offender Registration Act may not constitute a criminal statute, we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>previously extended the void-for-vagueness rules for criminal statutes specifically to \u00a7 46-23-505, MCA (2005). <em>Knudson, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u00b618 Section 46-23-505, MCA (2001), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">If an offender required to register under the part changes residence, the offender shall within 10 days of the change give written notification of the new address to the agency with whom the offender last registered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Samples argues this statute is both void on its face and as applied to him because it did not give him fair notice that he needed to update his registration when he left the Montana Rescue Mission and became homeless.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\u00b619  The statute uses clear language which gives fair notice to offenders that they are required to update their registration when they change their residence. Section 46-23-505, MCA (2001), is not vague on its face because it states with \u201csufficient definiteness\u201d what offenders must do to maintain their registration. <em>State v. Stanko, </em>1998 MT 321, \u00b6 21, 292 Mont. 192, \u00b6 21, 974 P.2d 1132, \u00b6 21. We conclude that \u00a7 46-23-505, MCA (2001), is not void for vagueness on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">\u00b620 The statute is also not void for vagueness as applied to Samples. It is \u201creasonably clear\u201d the statute applied to him when he left the shelter and became homeless. <em>Dixon, </em>\u00b6 20. Section 46-23-505, MCA (2001), requires an offender to report to law enforcement agencies within 10 days when he \u201cchanges residence.\u201d In this case, Samples ceased residing at the Montana Rescue Mission on June 14, 2002, when he left the shelter. He himself states that he left the rescue mission and became homeless. He changed his residence when he admittedly left the shelter. The statute gave Samples \u201cfair notice\u201d that he was required to inform authorities when he left the shelter and went to five elsewhere. <em>Leeson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11, 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">\u00b621 In <em>Knudson, </em>we held that the word \u201caddress\u201d rendered the statute vague as applied to the defendant because it could be interpreted as either requiring him to name a residential address or a mailing address, and he could not then reasonably know that he was in violation of the law when he advised law enforcement that he left his previous residence and that his new address was a post office box. Knudson, \u00b6\u00b6 25, 29, 30. In this case, Samples failed to notify the appropriate authorities that he had changed his residence. Had Samples notified the authorities he had changed his residence by leaving the shelter and said he was homeless living on the streets of Billings, perhaps <em>Knudson </em>would apply. However, since Samples failed to inform the authorities he \u201cchange[d] residence,\u201d and the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>of the statute is clear on its face, \u00a7 46-23-505, MCA, is not void-for-vagueness as applied to Samples.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">\u00b622 <em>Issue 2: Does the provision of the 2001 Act requiring an offender to report a change of residence demonstrate Samples did not commit a crime?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00b623  Samples argues he committed no crime because he was homeless and thus had no new residence to report. However, as stated above, he changed his residence when he left the shelter and was required to report that change by \u00a7 46-23-505, MCA (2001). He did not report to the authorities that he was no longer at the shelter and he did not report that he was then living on the streets of Billings. Thus, he violated \u00a7 46-23-507, MCA (2001), as he did not keep his registration current.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">\u00b624 <em>Issue 3: Did the 1999 Act as applied to Samples deprive him of his constitutional right to due process of law because the DOC set his sexual offender risk level without notifying him or giving him an opportunity to contest the </em>designation?</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\u00b625 Section 46-23-509(5), MCA (1999), provided, if a judge does not set a sexual offender\u2019s risk level, \u201cthe [DOC] shall designate the offender as level 1, 2, or 3 when the offender is released from confinement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ABI\">\u00b626 All offenders, regardless of risk level, are required to maintain their registration with law enforcement officials. Level 1 and 2 offenders are required to update their registration yearly, and level 3 offenders must update their registration every 90 days. Section 46-23-504(4), MCA (1999). Offenders are also required to update their registration with the appropriate authorities any time they change residence. Section 46-23-505, MCA (1999). All offenders are required to maintain their registration for life, although, after ten years, if certain conditions are met, offenders may petition to be released from the registration requirements. Section 46-23-506(3), MCA (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">\u00b627 Samples argues that \u00a7 46-23-509(5), MCA (1999), violated his right to procedural due process because DOC designated him a level 3 offender upon his release from prison without notice, a hearing, or an opportunity to contest the designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">\u00b628 Both the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 17, of the Montana Constitution guarantee that no one shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. Due process includes both a procedural and a substantive component. In this case, we focus on the procedural component.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">\u00b629 Procedural due process is required if a party makes a showing that a property or liberty interest exists. <em>State v. Egdorf, </em>2003 MT 264, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>\u00b6 19, 317 Mont. 436, \u00b6 19, 77 P.3d 517, \u00b6 19. If there is a property or liberty interest at stake, procedural due process requires that a person \u201cmust be given an opportunity to explain, argue and rebut any information that may lead to a deprivation of life, liberty, or property.\u201d <em>Webb, </em>\u00b6 19 (citing <em>State v. McLeod, </em>2002 MT 348, \u00b6 18, 313 Mont. 358, \u00b6 18, 61 P.3d 126, \u00b6 18).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">\u00b630 We have not directly addressed whether Montana\u2019s sexual offender registration laws implicate a life, liberty, or property interest. However, several other states with similar laws have addressed the issue. For example, the Iowa Supreme Court concluded \u201c[a] liberty interest is at stake whenever a sex offender risk assessment is conducted.\u201d <em>Brummer v. Iowa Dept. of Corrects., </em>661 N.W.2d 167, 175 (Iowa 2003). The <em>Brummer </em>Court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">[T]he risk of an erroneous assessment and the associated opprobrium arising from such an assessment implicate a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clauses. We are mindful that a record of conviction for a sex offense is a public record readily accessible, under statutory guidelines, to the general populace .... However, sex offender risk assessment and the resulting public notification go far beyond the mere redisclosure of an offender\u2019s conviction. Instead, a Corrections agent takes the additional step of assessing an offender based on a limited documentary record .... Then, after completing the assessment and notifying an offender of the results, and pending limited appellate procedures, the individual\u2019s status as a convicted sex offender <em>together with </em>an additional classification of his risk to reoffend, can be transmitted, in varying extent and degree, to different members of the public. This entire process clearly implicates a liberty interest in that it threatens the impairment and foreclosure of the associational or employment opportunities of persons who may not truly pose the risk to the public that an errant risk assessment would indicate ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-6\"><em>Brummer, </em>661 N.W.2d at 174-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">\u00b631 The Oregon Supreme Court relied on similar reasoning in concluding that the determination that a person is a predatory sex offender implicates a liberty interest, reasoning, when an agency gathers and synthesizes evidence in making such a determination, the interest of the person to be labeled goes beyond mere reputation. It is an interest in avoiding ostracism, loss of employment opportunities, also such a designation likely involves verbal or even physical harassment. <em>Noble v. Bd. of Parole &amp; Post-Prison Supervision, </em>964 P.2d 990, 995-96 (Or. 1998); see <em>also Hawai\u2019i v. Guidry, </em>96 P.3d 242, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>250 (Haw. 2004) (holding that lifetime registration requirements for sexual offenders implicate a liberty interest and require due process protections).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">\u00b632 The cases from other jurisdictions cited by the parties in which there is no liberty interest implicated in sexual offender registration requirements are inapposite. <em>See Russell v. Gregoire, </em>124 F.3d 1079, 1094 (9th Cir. 1997) (concluding that Washington\u2019s registration law did not deny sexual offenders due process because there is no privacy interest in the information disseminated and, thus, no liberty interest); <em>Conn. Dept. of Pub. Safety v. Doe, </em>538 U.S. 1, 7, 123 S. Ct. 1160, 1164 (2003) (noting no procedural protections were necessary because in Connecticut the registration requirements turn on an offender\u2019s conviction alone and no other facts are relevant or affect the registration).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\u00b633  In the context of a criminal sentence in Montana, it is not the duration or severity of a sentence that might render it constitutionally invalid; it is the imposition of a sentence based on a foundation which may be extensively and materially false, and which the prisoner had no opportunity to correct that can deny the defendant due process of law. <em>McLeod, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>State v. Herman, </em>2008 MT 187, \u00b6 21, 343 Mont. 494, \u00b6 21, 188 P.3d 978, \u00b6 21; <em>State v. Rosling, </em>2008 MT 62, \u00b6 70, 342 Mont. 1, \u00b6 70, 180 P.3d 1102, \u00b6 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">\u00b634  We agree with those jurisdictions that have concluded there is a liberty interest at stake when a person is designated as a particular risk level under the Act. Unlike the law at issue in <em>Connecticut Department of Public Safety, </em>the designation of a risk level does not turn on an offender\u2019s conviction alone. <em>Conn. Dept. of Pub. Safety, </em>538 U.S. at 7, 123 S. Ct. at 1164. In Montana, facts other than conviction are used to make the designation, and the designation leads to varying requirements for an offender. This Court determined in <em>State v. Mount, </em>2003 MT 275, \u00b6 89, 317 Mont. 481, \u00b6 89, 78 P.3d 829, \u00b6 89, that the Act is non-punitive and functions as a regulatory measure to assist law enforcement and protect the public. Still, the Act places a burden on offenders to update their registration or face criminal sanctions. The extent of that burden depends on their offense risk level. For example, a level 3 offender must complete a registration verification form every 90 days, while a level 1 or level 2 offender must verify annually. Section 46-23-504(4), MCA (1999). Acting pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-509(5), MCA (1999), DOC set Samples\u2019s risk level based on information unknown to him, and he had no chance to argue for a lesser risk level designation. The risk of an erroneous assessment and the associated opprobrium arising from such an assessment implicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>a liberty interest protected by Article II, Section 17, of the Montana Constitution. <em>See Brummer, </em>661 N.W.2d at 174. We conclude that Samples was denied his right to due process of law when DOC designated him a level 3 sex offender, because he did not have the opportunity to know what information was used to designate his risk level, he had no right to contest that information, and he had no ability to argue for a different designation. Therefore, we must remand so Samples has the \u201copportunity to explain, argue and rebut any information\u201d used in the designation of his sexual offender risk level. <em>Webb, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">\u00b635 Nevertheless, our determination that Samples\u2019s designation as a level 3 offender violated his right to procedural due process does not affect his conviction for failing to file notice of his change of address. Section 46-23-505, MCA (2001), which Samples violated requires all offenders \u201cgive written notification of the new address to the agency with whom the offender last registered.\u201d This requirement does not vary based on offender level; all offenders must comply. Thus, even were Samples\u2019s designation to change on remand, he remains convicted of failure to register as a sex offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\u00b636 Samples\u2019s 2003 conviction for failure to register as a sex offender is affirmed. Samples\u2019s 2001 level 3 sex offender designation is vacated, and this matter is remanded to the District Court for a hearing to appropriately determine Samples\u2019s sex offender level.</p>\n<judges id=\"b320-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, COTTER, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
