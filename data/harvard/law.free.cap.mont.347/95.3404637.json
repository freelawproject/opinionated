We reverse and remand with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"Axi\">\u00b62 We restate the issue as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">\u00b63 Did the District Court impose improper probation conditions on Stiles?</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">\u00b64 In late December 2004, Stiles began negotiating by phone and email with a Wyoming car dealership regarding the pin-chase of a Chevrolet Monte Carlo Intimidator. The car dealership ultimately shipped the vehicle to Stiles in Billings, and Stiles told them that his credit union in California had issued a check to the dealership. In late January 2005, the car salesman contacted Stiles because the dealership had not received payment for the vehicle. Stiles assured the salesman that the credit union had issued the check and also informed the salesman that Stiles would be unable to get another check issued until the first one was located. Stiles, however, was not a member of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>the credit union, nor did he have access to any accounts at the credit union.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">\u00b65 On September 6, 2006, a jury convicted Stiles of felony theft. The District Court sentenced Stiles to fifteen years at Montana State Prison, with five years suspended, and the court ordered Stiles to pay restitution to the car dealership. The District Court designated Stiles a persistent felony offender. The District Court also revoked a previously suspended sentence and sentenced Stiles to five years at Montana State Prison to run consecutive with his other sentence for felony theft. Additionally, the court imposed several probation conditions, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-5\">10. The Defendant will not possess or use illegal drugs or any drugs unless prescribed by a licensed physician. The Defendant will not be in control of or under the influence of illegal drugs, nor will he have in his possession any drug paraphernalia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">12. The Defendant shall not possess or consume intoxicants/alcohol, nor will he enter any place intoxicants are the chief item of sale. He will submit to Breathalyzer testing or bodily fluid testing for drugs or alcohol as requested by his Probation &amp; Parole Officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">20. The Defendant shall not possess or use any electronic device or scanner capable of listening to law enforcement communications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-8\">21. The Defendant will not enter any casinos or play any games of chance. <em>The Court makes the exception for employment purposes.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-9\">26. The Defendant will submit to random or routine drug and/or alcohol testing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">\u00b66 Stiles objected to several of the probation conditions, including condition 12. The District Court struck two of the conditions, but imposed condition 12. Stiles did not object to conditions 10, 20, 21, and 26. At Stiles\u2019 request, the District Court included a work exception to condition 21. Stiles now appeals the District Court\u2019s imposition of conditions 10, 12, 20, 21, and 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b117-12\">\u00b67 We review probation conditions under a dual standard of review: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>we first review de novo the legality of the probation conditions; we then review the conditions\u2019 reasonableness for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Brotherton, </em>2008 MT 119, \u00b6 10, 342 Mont. 511, \u00b6 10, 182 P.3d 88, \u00b6 10; <em>State v. Ashby, </em>2008 MT 83, \u00b6 9, 342 Mont. 187, \u00b6 9, 179 P.3d 1164, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\u00b68 Did the District Court impose improper probation conditions on Stiles?</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">\u00b69 Stiles argues that no evidence linked his felony theft charge to the use of alcohol, illegal drugs, gambling, or scanning devices, and thus, we should strike those probation conditions from his sentence. The State maintains that Stiles failed to object to several of the probation conditions and that the District Court acted within its discretion when it imposed the conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">\u00b610  In addition to the statutorily enumerated conditions, a sentencing court may impose \u201creasonable restrictions or conditions considered necessary for rehabilitation or for the protection of the victim or society\u201d on a deferred or suspended sentence. Section 46-18-201(4)(o), MCA; <em>accord-, </em>\u00a7 46-18-202(1)(f), MCA. For these \u201creasonable restrictions or conditions\u201d to constitute proper probation conditions, a nexus must exist between the probation conditions and the offense or the offender. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 15. A court may impose offender-related conditions only when \u201cthe history or pattern of conduct to be restricted is recent, and significant or chronic.\u201d <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">\u00b611  Stiles did not object to probation conditions 10, 20, 21, and 26 at the district court level. We generally refuse to address issues raised for the first time on appeal, including probation conditions. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 22. The <em>Lenihan </em>decision, however, permits appellate review of a criminal sentence that is allegedly illegal or that exceeds statutory mandates, even if the defendant failed to object at the district court level. <em>State v. Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. 338, 343, 602 P.2d 997, 1000 (1979). A sentence that falls within the statutory parameters constitutes a legal sentence. <em>State v. Mingus, </em>2004 MT 24, \u00b6 10, 319 Mont. 349, \u00b6 10, 84 P.3d 658, \u00b6 10. A sentencing court\u2019s failure to abide by certain statutory requirements may result in an objectionable sentence; however, an objectionable sentence is not necessarily an illegal sentence. <em>State v. Nelson, </em>274 Mont. 11, 20, 906 P.2d 663, 668 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"A_U\">\u00b612 We have referred to probation conditions that lack a nexus to the offense or the offender as illegal. <em>See e.g. State v. Lessard, </em>2008 MT 192, \u00b6\u00b6 27, 36, 344 Mont. 26, \u00b6\u00b6 27, 36, 185 P.3d 1013, \u00b6\u00b6 27, 36; <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number><em>v. Marshall, </em>2007 MT 218, \u00b6 20, 339 Mont. 50, \u00b6 20, 70 P.3d 923, \u00b6 20. Nonetheless, we have treated our review of conditions such as the ones that Stiles challenges as objectionable rather than illegal. For example, in <em>State v. Ommundson, </em>the defendant appealed from two conditions of his DUI sentence, though he objected to only one condition at the district court level. 1999 MT 16, \u00b6 2, 293 Mont. 133, \u00b6 2, 974 P.2d 620, \u00b6 2, <em>overruled on other grounds; State v. Herman, </em>2008 MT 187, 343 Mont. 494, 188 P.3d 494; <em>modified; Ashby, </em>\u00b6 15. We specifically refused to review the unchallenged condition in light of Ommundson\u2019s failure to object at the district court level. <em>Ommundson, </em>\u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">\u00b613 In <em>Ashby, </em>we announced a new standard of review for sentencing conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">We will first review a sentencing condition for legality. Then, because sentencing statutes authorize sentencing judges to impose conditions on deferred or suspended sentences that constitute \u201creasonable restrictions or conditions considered necessary for rehabilitation or for the protection of the victim or society,\u201d the \u201creasonableness\u201d of such conditions will be reviewed for an abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-6\"><em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 9. As our \u201cfinal cautions\u201d in <em>Ashby </em>highlight, this new standard effectively places the nexus analysis under the second inquiry-whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22, 23. Though we acknowledged the availability of <em>Lenihan </em>review for unchallenged \u201cillegal, rather than objectionable\u201d conditions, we cautioned defendants that the right to challenge an improper condition disappears unless they object \u201cat or before <em>sentencing...\u201d Ashby, </em>\u00b6 22. We further stated that, <em>\u201cupon proper objection </em>by the defendant,\u201d we would \u201cnot hesitate to strike\u201d alcohol, gambling, and other similar conditions that bore no nexus to the offense or the offender. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 23 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">\u00b614 In <em>Ashby, </em>we examined whether a nexus existed between the challenged conditions and Ashby, or Ashby\u2019s offense. Implicit in our nexus analysis was our determination that the conditions passed the threshold question of legality. The probation conditions that Stiles challenges are similar to those objected to in the trial court and reviewed on appeal in <em>Ashby, </em>in that the conditions were imposed under the \u201creasonable restrictions or conditions\u201d relating to rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society as set forth in \u00a7 46-18-201(4)(o), MCA, and \u00a7 46-18-202(1)(f), MCA. In this case, Stiles failed to object to conditions 10, 20, 21, and 26 in the trial court. Consequently, pursuant to <em>State v. Kotwicki, </em>2007 MT 17, 335 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>344, 151 P.3d 892, and <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 22, we refuse to consider his arguments regarding whether the offense-or offender-nexus existed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">\u00b615 Condition 12 prohibits Stiles from possessing or consuming intoxicants and from frequenting businesses where intoxicants constitute the chief sale item. Condition 12 also subjects Stiles to drug and alcohol testing. Stiles argues that no connection exists between this condition and his felony theft charge. The State does not contend that a nexus exists between this condition and Stiles\u2019 offense; rather, the State argues that Stiles has a history of substance abuse and that a clear relationship exists between substance abuse and recidivism. The State further asserts that preventing Stiles from drinking and frequenting bars will enable him to more easily satisfy his restitution obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\u00b616 The PSI report indicates that Stiles began drinking around the age of fifteen and that his drinking contributed to him \u201cdropping out\u201d of school during the tenth grade. The report also indicates that Stiles was intoxicated when he committed a felony offense in 1983. Additionally, Stiles was diagnosed with substance abuse in 1986. Though we do not minimize Stiles\u2019 experiences with alcohol, a court may impose offender-related conditions only when \u201cthe history or pattern of conduct to be restricted is recent, and significant or chronic.\u201d <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 15. Stiles was forty-eight years old at sentencing. The PSI report indicates that Stiles\u2019 problems with alcohol, although significant, are not recent. Thus, we conclude that condition 12 has an insufficient nexus to Stiles and is improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\u00b617  We conclude that the probation conditions included in Stiles\u2019 sentence fall within the sentencing court\u2019s discretion under \u00a7 46-18-201(4)(o), MCA, and \u00a7 46-18-202(1)(f), MCA. Thus, Stiles\u2019 failure to object to conditions 10, 20, 21, and 26 bars our review of those probation conditions. We further conclude that no nexus exists between Condition 12 and Stiles\u2019 offense of felony theft or Stiles himself. Thus, we reverse the District Court\u2019s imposition of Condition 12, and we remand to the District Court with instructions to strike the condition from Stiles\u2019 sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">\u00b618 Reversed and remanded with instructions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b120-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, MORRIS, RICE and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b120-10\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"AqU\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>\u00b619 I concur in the Court\u2019s decision to reverse the District Court\u2019s imposition of Condition 12. I dissent, however, from the Court\u2019s treatment of the other four conditions challenged by Stiles and, more generally, from the Court\u2019s new approach with respect to reviewing the legality of sentencing conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">\u00b620 Stiles challenges five conditions imposed by the District Court on his suspended sentence: no drugs or drug paraphernalia (Condition 10); no alcohol or intoxicants, plus mandatory testing for drugs and alcohol (Condition 12); no electronic scanning devices (Condition 20); no casinos or games of chance (Condition 21); and random or routine testing for drugs and alcohol (Condition 26). When this Court reviews a condition on a deferred or suspended sentence, \u201cthe threshold question is whether the imposition of [the condition] constituted an illegal sentencing condition.\u201d <em>State v. Nelson, </em>2008 MT 359, \u00b6 27, 346 Mont. 366, \u00b6 27, 195 P.3d 826, \u00b6 27 (citing <em>State v. Ashby, </em>2008 MT 83, \u00b6 9, 342 Mont. 187, \u00b6 9, 179 P.3d 1164, \u00b6 9). If the condition is legal, we then determine whether the district court abused its discretion in imposing the condition. <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 20 (citing <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">\u00b621 The Court acknowledges that this is our established approach. Opinion, \u00b6 7 (\u201c[W]e first review de novo the legality of the probation conditions; we then review the conditions\u2019 reasonableness for abuse of discretion.\u201d). The Court further acknowledges that we review a probation condition that is allegedly illegal <em>even if </em>the defendant failed to object to the condition in the district corut. Opinion, \u00b6 11 (citing <em>State v. Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. 338, 343, 602 P.2d 997, 1000 (1979)). For this reason, Stiles is entitled to have Conditions 10, 12, 20, 21, and 26 reviewed for legality.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">\u00b622 The Court, however, fails to provide a cogent analysis of whether these conditions are legal. The Court merely offers the conclusory and nebulous observation that the conditions Stiles challenges \u201care similar to\u201d those we reviewed in <em>Ashby. </em>Opinion, \u00b6 14. In this connection, the Court notes that the probation conditions at issue in <em>Ashby </em>\u201cimplicitly]\u201d passed the threshold question of legality, apparently because they were imposed pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201(4)(o) and - 202(1)(f), MCA. Opinion, \u00b6 14. These statutes authorize a sentencing court to impose on a deferred or suspended sentence any reasonable restrictions or conditions related to the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim or society. Thus, what the Court effectively holds today is that any probation condition that is \u201csimilar to\u201d those we reviewed in <em>Ashby </em>and that was imposed pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-201(4)(o), MCA, or \u00a7 46-18-202(1)(f), MCA, is per se legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>\u00b623 I disagree with this approach for two reasons. First, the Court errs in holding that a condition is per se legal simply because it is \u201csimilar to\u201d those we reviewed in <em>Ashby </em>and was imposed pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-201(4)(o), MCA, or \u00a7 46-18-202(1)(f), MCA. Second, in adopting this new approach to legality review, the Court explicitly relegates our traditional legality test-the nexus test-to the second, abuse of discretion prong of our standard of review. Opinion, \u00b6 13. In other words, the Court holds that the nexus requirement is a limit on the sentencing court\u2019s <em>discretion, </em>not its <em>authority. </em>For the reasons which follow, this new approach contradicts years of precedent and is inconsistent with the language of the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">\u00b624 It is beyond dispute that a sentencing judge \u201chas no power to impose a sentence in the absence of specific statutory authority.\u201d <em>State v. Hatfield, </em>256 Mont. 340, 346, 846 P.2d 1025, 1029 (1993); <em>accord State v. Hicks, </em>2006 MT 71, \u00b6 41, 331 Mont. 471, \u00b6 41, 133 P.3d 206, \u00b6 41. Accordingly, when a challenge to a sentencing condition is raised, the \u201cthreshold question,\u201d as noted above, is whether the condition is statutorily authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\u00b625 There are no provisions in the sentencing statutes explicitly authorizing conditions of the sort at issue here-namely, no drugs, no alcohol, no gambling and casinos, no electronic scanning devices, and mandatory alcohol and drug testing. Rather, the presumed authority to impose these conditions is found in \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201(4)(o) and -202(1)(f), MCA. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 14. The former authorizes a sentencing judge to impose \u201cany . . . reasonable restrictions or conditions considered necessary for rehabilitation or for the protection of the victim or society.\u201d Section 46-18-201(4)(o), MCA. Similarly, the latter authorizes a sentencing judge to impose \u201cany... limitation reasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society.\u201d Section 46-18-202(1)(f), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\u00b626 The authority to impose \u201creasonable\u201d restrictions that are \u201cnecessary for\u201d or \u201creasonably related to\u201d the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim or society is certainly broad. Before today, however, that authority has not been without limit. Indeed, we stated exactly that in <em>State v. Ommundson, </em>1999 MT 16, 293 Mont. 133, 974 P.2d 620: \u201cAlthough this grant of sentencing authority is broad, it is not without limit.\u201d <em>Ommundson, </em>\u00b6 11. Consequently, in order to determine whether a condition imposed pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-201(4)(o), MCA, or \u00a7 46-18-202(1)(f), MCA, is statutorily authorized, we must first determine what the \u201climit\u201d on the authority granted by these statutes is.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>\u00b627 The answer to this question is not immediately obvious, since the authority granted by \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201(4)(o) and -202(1)(f), MCA, is totally amorphous. What makes a condition \u201creasonable\u201d and \u201cnecessary for\u201d or \u201creasonably related to\u201d the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim or society? Clearly, the answer to this question varies from case to case. Thus, unlike conditions whose legality can be assessed facially by asking, \u201cIs there statutory authority for this condition?\u201d (see <em>e.g. State v. Stephenson, </em>2008 MT 64, \u00b6\u00b6 14-33, 342 Mont. 60, \u00b6\u00b6 14-33, 179 P.3d 502, \u00b6\u00b6 14-33), determining the legality of conditions imposed under \u00a7 46-18-201(4)(o), MCA, or \u00a7 46-18-202(1)(f), MCA, by contrast, necessarily requires some sort of test that applies legal standards to factual underpinnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">\u00b628 We articulated that test in Ommundson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">We hold that, in order to be \u201creasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and protection of the victim and society,\u201d a sentencing limitation or condition must have... some correlation or connection to the underlying offense for which the defendant is being sentenced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-6\"><em>Ommundson, </em>\u00b6 11 (citation omitted). Thus, we held in <em>Ommundson </em>that the \u201climit\u201d on a sentencing court\u2019s \u201cbroad\u201d authority to impose a \u201creasonable\u201d restriction in the name of offender rehabilitation and the protection of the victim or society is this: a \u201ccorrelation or connection\u201d (also referred to as a \u201cnexus\u201d) must exist between the condition and the underlying offense for which the defendant is being sentenced. Accordingly, a condition that does not have a nexus to the underlying offense is not reasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and protection of the victim or society and, thus, is not statutorily authorized. <em>See McDermott v. McDonald, </em>2001 MT 89, \u00b6 18, 305 Mont. 166, \u00b6 18, 24 P.3d 200, \u00b6 18 (\u201cThe \u2018correlation or connection\u2019 standard, therefore, was based on a specific statutory limitation on the district court\u2019s sentencing authority.\u201d). And if the condition is not statutorily authorized, it is not legal. <em>See State v. Brotherton, </em>2008 MT 119, \u00b6 10, 342 Mont. 511, \u00b6 10, 182 P.3d 88, \u00b6 10 (\u201cA sentencing condition is illegal if the sentencing court lacked statutory authority to impose it . . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">\u00b629 Following <em>Ommundson, </em>we repeatedly reaffirmed that to be \u201clegal,\u201d a condition of sentence must have a \u201cnexus\u201d to the underlying offense. In <em>State v. Armstrong, </em>2006 MT 334, 335 Mont. 131, 151 P.3d 46, for instance, we explained that \u201ca limitation or condition in a sentence must have a correlation or connection to the underlying offense. Stated differently, to be legal, a condition of sentence must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>have a nexus to the conviction.\u201d <em>Armstrong, </em>\u00b6 11 (citation omitted); <em>accord State v. Marshall, </em>2007 MT 218, \u00b6 20, 339 Mont. 50, \u00b6 20, 170 P.3d 923, \u00b6 20. Likewise, in <em>State v. Herd, </em>2004 MT 85, 320 Mont. 490, 87 P.3d 1017, we acknowledged that \u201ca condition of sentence must have a nexus with the conviction in order for it to be a legal condition of sentence.\u201d <em>Herd, </em>\u00b6 17; <em>accord State v. Greeson, </em>2007 MT 23, \u00b6 12, 336 Mont. 1, \u00b6 12, 152 P.3d 695, \u00b6 12. Similarly, in <em>State v.

And, in <em>State v.

But in <em>State v. Horton, </em>2001 MT 100, 305 Mont. 242, 25 P.3d 886, and <em>State v. Setters, </em>2001 MT 101, 305 Mont. 253, 25 P.3d 893, we held that the sentencing court had \u201cexceeded its statutory authority\u201d in making the payment of child support (Horton) and restitution (Setters) a condition of sentence, since there was no \u201ccorrelation or connection\u201d between the underlying offenses and these conditions. <em>Horton, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 28-29; <em>Setters, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 27-28; <em>accord State v.

First, we recited the <em>Ommundson </em>rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">\u201cAlthough this grant of sentencing authority [to impose limitations \u2018reasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society\u2019] is broad, it is not without limit. We hold that, in order to be \u2018reasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and protection of the victim and society,\u2019 ... a sentencing limitation or condition must have . . . some correlation or connection to the underlying offense for which the defendant is being sentenced.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-6\"><em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 14 (ellipses in <em>Ashby) </em>(quoting <em>Ommundson, </em>\u00b6 11). We then held that a sentencing judge may impose a particular condition of probation so long as the condition has a nexus either to the offense for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>which the offender is being sentenced or to the offender himself or herself. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 15. Essentially, we decided that our original interpretation in <em>Ommundson </em>of a sentencing court\u2019s authority under \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201(4)(o) and -202(1)(f), MCA, had been too narrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">\u00b631 Accordingly, after <em>Ashby, </em>the authority of a sentencing court to impose a \u201creasonable\u201d restriction in the name of offender rehabilitation and the protection of the victim or society is still \u201cnot without limit,\u201d but the authority is not as limited as it was under <em>Ommundson. </em>Now, the sentencing court has authority to impose a restriction that has a nexus either to the underlying offense for which the defendant is being sentenced or to the offender himself or herself. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 15. The existence of this nexus determines whether the sentencing court exceeded its statutory authority and, thus, whether the condition at issue is illegal. Indeed, we applied the nexus test precisely for this purpose in several post-Ashby cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\u00b632 In <em>State v. Winkel, </em>2008 MT 89, 342 Mont. 267, 182 P.3d 54, Winkel claimed that the condition prohibiting him from possessing or ingesting intoxicants was \u201cillegal\u201d because alcohol played no role in his offense. <em>Winkel, </em>\u00b6 13. We concluded otherwise, reasoning that because the condition \u201chas a nexus to both the underlying crime and the offender,\u201d the condition \u201cis within the parameters set by \u00a7 46-18-202(1)(f), MCA.\u201d <em>Winkel, </em>\u00b6 16. We reached the same conclusion with respect to the no-casinos condition, stating that it \u201cis also within the parameters set by \u00a7 46-18-202(1)(f), MCA, and <em>Ommundson.\u201d Winkel, </em>\u00b6 20. Our use of the word \u201cparameters\u201d in relation to our analysis under the nexus test indicates unmistakably that we were using that test to determine whether the condition was legal, not whether the district court had abused its discretion in imposing it. <em>See State v. Hameline, </em>2008 MT 241, \u00b6 8, 344 Mont. 461, \u00b6 8, 188 P.3d 1052, \u00b6 8 (\u2018We review a sentencing condition for legality, determining whether the condition is within statutory parameters.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\u00b633 In <em>State v.

Teets, </em>2008 MT 130, 343 Mont. 73, 183 P.3d 45, the defendants contended that the alcohol restrictions on their sentences constituted \u201cillegal\u201d conditions because alcohol had no relation to their respective underlying offenses. <em>Deshazo, </em>\u00b6 9; <em>Teets, </em>\u00b6 10. We rejected these contentions based on our application of the nexus test. <em>See Deshazo, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10-12; <em>Teets, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-12.

Brotherton, </em>2008 MT 119, 342 Mont. 511, 182 P.3d 88, we observed that \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201(4)(n) and -202(1)(f), MCA (2005), were the statutory authority for the no-intoxicants condition at issue. <em>Brotherton, </em>\u00b6 14. We then explained that in order to be authorized by these statutes, the condition must have a nexus either to the offense for which the offender is being sentenced or to the offender himself or herself. <em>See Brotherton, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-17. We then proceeded to analyze the condition, concluding that it \u201chas a sufficient nexus to Brotherton\u2019s unique background and characteristics,\u201d that it thus \u201cis a reasonable restriction necessary for Brotherton\u2019s rehabilitation,\u201d and that it accordingly \u201cis legal under \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201(4) and -202(1)(f), MCA.\u201d <em>Brotherton, </em>\u00b6 24. Thereafter, we further observed that, \u201cin light of the factual circumstances of this case,... the District Court did not abuse its discretion in imposing this condition.\u201d <em>Brotherton, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\u00b635 It makes logical sense to use the nexus test for determining whether a challenged condition is legal under \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201(4)(o) and -202(1)(f), MCA-i.e., whether it is a \u201creasonable\u201d restriction \u201cnecessary for\u201d or \u201creasonably related to\u201d the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim or society-and then to apply the abuse of discretion standard for determining whether the condition is excessive in terms of harshness or duration. Indeed, that is exactly the approach we adopted in <em>State v. Herd, </em>2004 MT 85, 320 Mont. 490, 87 P.3d 1017.</p>\n<p id=\"AWI\">\u00b636 In <em>Herd, </em>the district court gave the defendant two 20-year suspended sentences, to run consecutively. One of the conditions on the sentences barred Herd from driving a motor vehicle during the entire 40-year term. <em>See Herd, </em>\u00b6 9. Herd challenged this condition on appeal. At the outset, we noted that \u201ca condition of sentence must have a nexus with the conviction in order for it to be a legal condition of sentence.\u201d <em>Herd, </em>\u00b6 17 (citing, among others, <em>Ommundson, </em>\u00b6 11). Herd conceded that the driving restriction was legal, since there was a nexus between this condition and her underlying offense of negligent homicide (which had resulted from her lack of care while driving). <em>Herd, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17, 24. Instead, Herd argued that the length of the driving suspension, while not explicitly forbidden by statute, was excessive. <em>Herd, </em>\u00b6 24. She asked this Court \u201cto determine whether a condition of sentence can bear a relationship to the underlying offense, yet exceed reasonableness in its harshness or duration.\u201d <em>Herd, </em>\u00b6 17. We answered this question in the affirmative. We concluded that imposition of a 40-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>year driving prohibition would ultimately impair the prospects of Herd\u2019s rehabilitation by drastically inhibiting her ability to make a living, to serve the needs of her family, and to pay court-ordered restitution. We accordingly held that the district court had abused its discretion in imposing this \u201clengthy\u201d restriction on Herd\u2019s ability to drive. <em>Herd, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">\u00b637 Thus, to summarize, we have long applied the nexus test to determine whether a condition of sentence is legal-i.e., whether it is \u201cnecessary for\u201d or \u201creasonably related to\u201d the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim or society, \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201(4)(o) and -202(1)(f), MCA-and we have applied the abuse of discretion standard to determine whether the condition is excessive in terms of its harshness or duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u00b638 Notwithstanding these decisions and our unambiguous statement in <em>Ommundson </em>that a sentencing court\u2019s broad authority under \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201(4)(o) and -202(1)(f), MCA, is \u201climited\u201d by the nexus requirement, the Court today announces an entirely new approach. Specifically, the Court holds that the nexus test determines whether the sentencing court abused its discretion in imposing the challenged condition, not whether the condition is statutorily authorized in the first place. Opinion, \u00b6 13. Yet, in abandoning our traditional test for determining legality, the Court provides nothing constructive in its stead, i.e., no practical method for determining whether a condition falls within the parameters of \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201(4)(o) and -202(1)(f), MCA. The Court simply states that any probation condition which is \u201csimilar to\u201d those we reviewed in <em>Ashby </em>and which was imposed under these statutes is legal. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 17. In so doing, the Court implicitly rejects the notion that a no-alcohol, a no-gambling, or a drug-testing condition might be legal in some cases and illegal in others. Moreover, the Court effectively rewrites \u00b6 11 of <em>Ommundson </em>to say: \u201cThe grant of sentencing authority to impose limitations \u2018reasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society\u2019 is broad, <em>and it is without limit.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u00b639 The Court attempts to recast <em>Ommundson </em>as resting on something other than legality grounds. Opinion, \u00b6 12. The Court points out that we refused to review a condition to which Ommundson did not object in the district court. <em>See </em>Ommundson, \u00b6 2. Yet, after stating that we would not review this particular condition, we then stated the issue before us as follows: \u201cThe sole issue before this Court, then, is whether the District Court had <em>authority </em>to impose the condition that Ommundson participate in a sex offender treatment program.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number><em>Ommundson, </em>\u00b6 2 (emphasis added). It is abundantly clear from this statement that our analysis in <em>Ommundson </em>concerned a sentencing court\u2019s \u201cauthority\u201d under the statutes. Indeed, we have previously explained our holding in <em>Ommundson </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-4\">In <em>Ommundson, </em>this Court held that the statutory requirement that a sentence be \u201creasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and protection of the victim and society,\u201d requires that any sentencing limitation or condition have some \u201ccorrelation or connection to the underlying offense for which the defendant is being sentenced.\u201d <em>Ommundson, </em>\u00b6 11. <em>The \u201ccorrelation or connection\u201d standard, therefore, was based on a specific statutory limitation on the district court\u2019s sentencing authority.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-5\"><em>McDermott v. McDonald, </em>2001 MT 89, \u00b6 18, 305 Mont. 166, \u00b6 18, 24 P.3d 200, \u00b6 18 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">\u00b640 The Court cites \u00b6\u00b6 9, 22, and 23 of <em>Ashby </em>in support of its new approach. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 13. Admittedly, there is language in these paragraphs which could be interpreted as placing the nexus test under the second, abuse of discretion prong of our standard of review. However, that is not how I understood <em>Ashby </em>at the time I signed it-as my opinions, for a unanimous Court, in <em>Brotherton, Greensweight, </em>and <em>Lessard </em>reflect. Moreover, there is nothing in <em>Ashby </em>to suggest that we were consciously, deliberately, and explicitly abandoning nine years of applying the nexus analysis as a legality test-which the Court confirms today by its use of the word \u201cimplicit\u201d to describe our reasoning in <em>Ashby. See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 14. It is troubling to think that we would abandon our well-settled approach with no supporting analysis or explanation whatsoever, particularly since we had just reaffirmed that approach twice during the previous year. <em>See State v. Greeson, </em>2007 MT 23, \u00b6 12, 336 Mont. 1, \u00b6 12, 152 P.3d 695, \u00b6 12 (\u201c[A] probation condition must have a sufficient nexus with the conviction to constitute a legal condition of sentence.\u201d); <em>State v. Marshall, </em>2007 MT 218, \u00b6 20, 339 Mont. 50, \u00b6 20, 170 P.3d 923, \u00b6 20 (\u201c[T]o be legal, a condition of sentence must have a nexus to the conviction.\u201d). Rather, the primary purpose of our <em>Ashby </em>decision was to expand the nexus test to include the <em>offender, </em>not just the <em>offense. </em>Given that <em>Ashby </em>did not involve a challenge to a probation condition to which the appellant had not objected in the district court, it is clear that the Court today overreads <em>Ashby\u2019s </em>actual holding and transforms dicta into law.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">\u00b641 The Court\u2019s confusion appears to derive from the Legislature\u2019s use of the terms \u201creasonable\u201d in \u00a7 46-18-201(4)(o), MCA (\u201cany other reasonable restrictions or conditions considered necessary for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>rehabilitation or for the protection of the victim or society\u201d), and \u201creasonably related\u201d in \u00a7 46-18-202(1)(f), MCA (\u201cany other limitation reasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society\u201d)- These statutes contain a \u201creasonableness\u201d requirement built in to the authority granted to the sentencing court. In other words, \u201creasonableness\u201d itself is the explicit statutory limit on the sentencing court\u2019s authority. Our nexus test has long been the measure of that reasonableness, which the Court acknowledges in \u00b6 10 of the Opinion. Accordingly, when we apply the nexus test, we are essentially determining whether the condition falls within the parameters of \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201(4)(o) and -202(1)(f), MCA, not whether the sentencing court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">\u00b642 It is for this reason that the following statement <em>in Ashby </em>(which the Court quotes in \u00b6 13 of the Opinion) is somewhat inaccurate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">[B]ecause sentencing statutes authorize sentencing judges to impose conditions on deferred or suspended sentences that constitute \u201creasonable restrictions or conditions considered necessary for rehabilitation or for the protection of the victim or society,\u201d the \u201creasonableness\u201d of such conditions will be reviewed for an abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-6\"><em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 9 (footnote omitted). It is self-evident that if the sentencing statutes \u201cauthorize\u201d only those conditions which are \u201creasonable\u201d and \u201cnecessary for rehabilitation or for the protection of the victim or society,\u201d then any conditions which are not \u201creasonable\u201d and \u201cnecessary for rehabilitation or for the protection of the victim or society\u2019 are not authorized by these statutes. This is a matter of legality \u2014 not discretion \u2014 since a sentencing court has discretion to impose only those conditions that are statutorily authorized in the first place. Thus, it makes no sense to say, as the Court does today, that the question of whether the challenged condition meets the statutory requirements of being \u201creasonable\u201d and \u201cnecessary for rehabilitation or for the protection of the victim or society\u2019 is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. If it does not meet these explicit statutory requirements, then it is illegal and need not be reviewed for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">\u00b643 In sum, we review a sentencing condition for legality by determining whether it is statutorily authorized and within statutory parameters. <em>Brotherton, </em>\u00b6 <em>10; Hameline, </em>\u00b6 8. The parameters of \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201(4)(o) and -202(1)(f), MCA, are set forth in these statutes: The condition must be \u201creasonable\u201d and \u201cnecessary for\u201d or \u201creasonably related to\u201d the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim or society. These are the actual words used in the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>language defining the authority of the sentencing court. We interpreted and gave concrete meaning to these parameters in <em>Ommundson </em>by requiring a nexus between the condition and the underlying offense. We reinterpreted these parameters in <em>Ashby </em>and concluded that they include a nexus between the condition and the offender as well. Sentencing courts, therefore, have had a clear and unambiguous statement from this Court as to what conditions fall within the statutory parameters of \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201(4)(o) and -202(1)(f), MCA: a condition having a nexus to either the underlying offense or the offender is within statutory parameters, and a condition not having a nexus to either the underlying offense or the offender is outside statutory parameters. After today\u2019s decision, however, there is no sensible test at all to tell us whether a condition imposed pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-201(4)(o), MCA, or \u00a7 46-18-202(1)(f), MCA, falls outside statutory parameters and, thus, is illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">\u00b644 Admittedly, whether our nexus test is applied under the first, legality prong or the second, abuse of discretion prong of our standard of review ultimately makes little difference in run-of-the-mill cases where the defendant has objected to the condition in the district court. But in a case such as the one at hand, where the defendant did <em>not </em>object to the condition, relegation of the nexus test to the second prong of our standard of review makes all the difference. The ultimate result of today\u2019s decision is that Stiles receives no real review whatsoever-neither for legality nor for abuse of discretion-of Conditions 10, 20, 21, and 26. He is not entitled to review for abuse of discretion because he did not object to these conditions in the District Court (a point of the Court\u2019s Opinion with which I agree). But he <em>is </em>entitled to review for legality. Opinion, \u00b6 11. Yet, he is not receiving proper legality review since we no longer have a workable test for determining whether a condition imposed under \u00a7 46-18-201(4)(o), MCA, or \u00a7 46-18-202(1)(f), MCA, falls within statutory parameters.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ9\">\u00b645 Notably, in making his argument to this Court, Stiles relies on our statement in <em>State v. Greeson, </em>2007 MT 23, 336 Mont. 1, 152 P.3d 695, that \u201ca probation condition must have a sufficient nexus with the conviction to constitute a legal condition of sentence,\u201d <em>Greeson, </em>\u00b6 12, and our statement in <em>State v. Armstrong, </em>2006 MT 334, 335 Mont. 131, 151 P.3d 46, that \u201cto be legal, a condition of sentence must have a nexus to the conviction,\u201d <em>Armstrong, </em>\u00b6 11. Indeed, he quotes this language in his brief as support for his claim that Conditions 10, 12, 20, 21, and 26 are \u201cillegal\u201d because they \u201chad no nexus to the facts of this case.\u201d The Court, however, announces that we did not mean what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>we actually said in <em>Greeson, Armstrong, </em>and the myriad cases stating the same rule. Rather, according to the Court, what we meant in all those cases-though we did not actually say it-was that the nexus requirement is a limit on <em>discretion, </em>not <em>legality. </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. On this basis, the Court dismisses Stiles\u2019s nexus arguments with respect to all but Condition 12.1 cannot agree with this bait and switch.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\u00b646 Lastly, while I disagree with the Court\u2019s decision to relegate our nexus test to the abuse of discretion prong of our standard of review, it concerns me more that the Court leaves a gaping void in the legality prong where the nexus test once stood. If the nexus test no longer determines whether the challenged condition is statutorily authorized, then this Court must supply a workable replacement or articulate a new interpretation of the statutory parameters as we did in <em>Ommundson. </em>It is wholly inadequate to assert merely that the probation conditions Stiles challenges \u201care similar to those . . . reviewed on appeal in <em>Ashby, </em>in that the conditions were imposed under the \u2018reasonable restrictions or conditions\u2019 relating to rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society as set forth in \u00a7 46-18-201(4)(o), MCA, and \u00a7 46-18-202(1)(f), MCA.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"A0Z\">\u00b647 It is also troubling that the Court creates confusion in our caselaw by ignoring the numerous cases which applied the nexus analysis as a legality test. While the Court attempts to recast the holdings of some of these cases as resting on abuse of discretion grounds <em>(see </em>Opinion, \u00b6 12), the Court\u2019s assertions in this regard are not supported by the actual language of the cases. Rather, what the Court does here is implicitly overrule all of the cases discussed in \u00b6\u00b6 28-29 and 32-36 above.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u00b648 In conclusion, at the time we decided <em>Ashby, </em>we were facing review of \u201cnumerous cases\u201d seeking clarification or broadening of the <em>Ommundson </em>rule. <em>See Ashby, </em>\u00b6 15. Indeed, throughout mid to late 2007, the State routinely asked this Court in probation-condition appeals either to overrule or to broaden the <em>Ommundson </em>rule. We accordingly undertook \u201cdetailed review and analysis\u201d of the parties\u2019 arguments and the factual scenarios in each of those cases. <em>See Ashby, </em>\u00b6 15. At the conclusion of this detailed review and analysis, we attempted-once and for all-to clarify exactly how this Court would review probation conditions. We then proceeded to apply that approach in several unanimous, <em>post-Ashby </em>decisions. Today, in one fell unanalyzed swoop, the Court undoes what we accomplished in <em>Ashby </em>and injects confusion back into our caselaw. As a result, we can expect to see yet more cases \u201cseeking clarification\u201d of the <em>Ommundson-Ashby </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>rule. What\u2019s more, we can expect to see the same arguments by the State that we rejected in Ashby-all based on the premise that sentencing courts have \u201cunlimited\u201d authority to impose whatever conditions the prosecution and the Department of Corrections ask for and the court happens to agree with. Quite simply, we have taken the sideboards off the district courts\u2019 sentencing authority that we imposed in <em>Ommundson </em>and refined in <em>Ashby.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">\u00b649 Yet, \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201(4)(o) and -202(1)(f), MCA, do not give sentencing courts the authority to impose \u201cany condition they want.\u201d Rather, the statutes give the courts authority to impose \u201creasonable\u201d conditions that are \u201cnecessary for\u201d and \u201creasonably related to\u201d the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim or society. This statutory language is itself the \u201climit\u201d on the authority of sentencing courts to impose conditions under these statutes. <em>Ommundson, </em>\u00b6 11. The nexus test, as expanded in <em>Ashby, </em>was a sensible and workable interpretation of this limit. The rule of NercZ-namely, reviewing a condition that is otherwise legal to determine if the condition is excessive in terms of harshness or duration-is a sensible and workable approach under the second prong of our standard of review. I disagree with the Court\u2019s conversion of the nexus test into a measure of discretion, leaving nothing in its stead for determining whether the challenged condition is legal in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\u00b650 I concur in the Court\u2019s decision to reverse the imposition of Condition 12.1 dissent as to the remainder of the Court\u2019s Opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
