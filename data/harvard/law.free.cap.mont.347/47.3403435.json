We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">\u00b62 The procedural history of this appeal is somewhat convoluted, involving multiple charges of partner or family member assault (\u201cPFMA\u201d) in three separate criminal cases, all filed in the Sixth Judicial District Court. At the outset, it is useful to note that a first or second conviction of PFMA is considered a misdemeanor, while a third or subsequent conviction is considered a felony. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-5-206(3)(a), MCA (2005); \u00a7 45-2-101(23), (42), MCA. Furthermore, Martz was convicted of PFMA in 2002; and for the purpose of determining the number of Martz\u2019s prior PFMA convictions, the 2002 conviction was his <em>first.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">\u00b63 On January 24, 2006, the State filed an information in Cause No. DC 06-09 charging Martz with the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-10\">Count I: partner or family member assault, <em>second </em>offense, a <em>misdemeanor, </em>allegedly committed on or about December 23-24, 2005.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-11\">Count II: partner or family member assault, <em>third </em>offense, a <em>felony, </em>allegedly committed on or about December 25-26, 2005.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUo\">Count III: assault with a weapon, a felony, allegedly committed on or about December 25-26, 2005.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-12\">\u00b64 On May 4, 2006, the State filed an information in Cause No. DC 06-48 (the instant action) charging Martz with the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-13\">Count I: partner or family member assault, <em>fourth </em>offense, a <em>felony, </em>allegedly committed on or about April 10, 2006.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-14\">Martz entered a plea of not guilty to this charge on May 15. On June 1, the District Court entered an order setting trial for December 19, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-15\">\u00b65 On August 31, 2006, the State moved to dismiss, without prejudice, the charges pending in DC 06-09. The State provided two grounds: (1) \u201c[a] material witness is not currently available\u201d and (2) \u201c[interests of justice.\u201d The District Court granted the motion that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>\u00b66 On September 20, 2006, the State re-filed the charges previously dismissed in DC 06-09. The case was given a new cause number: DC 06-103. The District Court set trial for December 20, 2006. Thus, Martz was scheduled to be tried on the charge of PFMA, <em>fourth </em>offense, the day before he was to be tried on the charges of PFMA, <em>second </em>offense and <em>third </em>offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">\u00b67 On December 18, 2006, Martz filed a motion in DC 06-48 to dismiss the charge of PFMA, fourth offense, for lack of a speedy trial. Martz explained, first, that while the State had charged this offense as a felony, \u201cin substance, it is actually a misdemeanor.\u201d Martz reasoned that because he had only one prior PFMA conviction (in 2002), his trial on the instant charge on December 19 could only be his <em>second </em>PFMA conviction. As noted, a second conviction of PFMA is a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"Axn\">\u00b68 Based on the theory that the PFMA charge in DC 06-48 was a misdemeanor, Martz argued that the speedy trial statute applied. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">After the entry of a plea upon a misdemeanor charge, the court, unless good cause to the contrary is shown, shall order the prosecution to be dismissed, with prejudice, if a defendant whose trial has not been postponed upon the defendant\u2019s motion is not brought to trial within 6 months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Section 46-13-401(2), MCA. Martz observed that he had entered his plea of not guilty on May 15, 2006, and that he had never asked for any postponements or trial delays. Thus, Martz argued, he should have been brought to trial by November 15, 2006, and the failure to do so required dismissal of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">\u00b69 The State responded to Martz\u2019s motion, asserting that the PFMA offense in DC 06-48 was properly charged as a felony. The State noted that the charges of PFMA, second offense and third offense, had been re-filed in DC 06-103. The State did not deny that Martz was scheduled to be tried on his \u201cfourth\u201d offense <em>before </em>being tried on his \u201csecond\u201d and \u201cthird\u201d offenses; however, the State claimed that charging him in DC 06-48 with a fourth offense was correct given the chronology of when the offenses occurred. (The second and third offenses were based on events in December 2005, while the fourth offense was based on events in April 2006.) The State posited that Martz could be charged in separate actions based on the number of \u201coffenses\u201d he allegedly had committed, as opposed to the number of \u201cconvictions\u201d actually reflected in his criminal record. The State also argued that if Martz were found guilty in DC 06-48 of a \u201cfourth\u201d offense but was not found guilty the next day in DC 06-103 of either the \u201csecond\u201d or \u201cthird\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>offense, then his \u201cfourth\u201d offense could simply be reduced to a misdemeanor at the time of sentencing. In this connection, the State requested \u201cthat the sentencing in [DC 06-48], should a jury convict, be held off until after the outcome of the trial in DC 06-103.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">\u00b610 The District Court heard additional arguments on Martz\u2019s motion during a hearing the morning of trial. Defense counsel reiterated Martz\u2019s contention that \u201c[t]here is no circumstance that the State can identify, today, where Mr. Martz will be convicted of anything other than a misdemeanor.\u201d Counsel asserted that \u201c[the instant charge], if he\u2019s convicted, will be his second conviction,\u201d which constitutes a misdemeanor. Counsel argued that the way the State \u201clabels\u201d an offense in a charging document should not control with respect to the speedy trial statute; in other words, form should not prevail over substance. Thus, since there was \u201c[no] conceivable outcome, today, other than a misdemeanor,\u201d counsel asserted that DC 06-48 fell within the purview of the speedy trial statute and had to be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\u00b611 The court, however, focused on the fact that the State had charged the offense as a felony, and the court opined that it was not critical for the misdemeanor and felony offenses to be tried in chronological order. The court indicated that if the State failed to obtain guilty verdicts on either of the PFMA charges in DC 06-103, then any guilty verdict the State obtained in DC 06-48 would be treated as a misdemeanor for sentencing purposes. The District Court therefore denied Martz\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">\u00b612 A jury found Martz guilty in DC 06-48 of PFMA, \u201cfourth\u201d offense, on December 19, 2006. The following day, a trial was held in DC 06-103. At the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, the District Court granted a motion to dismiss Count II (PFMA, \u201cthird\u201d offense) and Count III (assault with a weapon) for insufficient evidence. A jury thereafter found Martz guilty under Count I (PFMA, \u201csecond\u201d offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">\u00b613 Shortly after the presentence investigation report was filed in DC 06-48, but prior to sentencing, Martz filed a sentencing memorandum challenging the probation/parole officer\u2019s recommendation of a five-year commitment to the Montana State Prison. Martz argued that the guilty verdict in DC 06-48 was his second \u201cconviction\u201d of PFMA; that this conviction, therefore, had to be treated as a misdemeanor; and that his sentence, accordingly, could not be more than one year imprisonment in the county jail. In response, the State asserted that irrespective of the sequence in which the cases were tried, Martz presently stood guilty of PFMA, second offense, committed in December 2005, and PFMA, third offense, committed in April 2006. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>The State requested \u201cconcurrent sentencing\u201d on the two offenses. The District Court agreed with the State\u2019s argument and denied Martz\u2019s motion to treat the guilty verdict in DC 06-48 as a \u201csecond conviction\u201d for sentencing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">\u00b614 The District Court sentenced Martz in both DC 06-48 and DC 06-103 on March 19, 2007. The court first imposed sentence in DC 06-103: thirty days in the Park County Detention Center, to run concurrently with any sentence in DC 06-48. The court then imposed sentence in DC 06-48: two years at the Montana Department of Corrections, with one year suspended. Martz now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">\u00b615 We restate the issues raised by Martz, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-7\">1. Did the District Court lack jurisdiction over the charge in DC 06-48?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-8\">2. Did the District Court err in denying Martz\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial under \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-9\">3. Did the District Court impose an illegal sentence in DC 06-48?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">\u00b616 Martz\u2019s challenge to the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction is an issue of law, which this Court determines de novo. <em>See Stanley v. Lemire, </em>2006 MT 304, \u00b6 52, 334 Mont. 489, \u00b6 52, 148 P.3d 643, \u00b6 52; <em>City of Missoula v.

This Court reviews for correctness a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of a statute. <em>State v. Bullman, </em>2007 MT 288, \u00b6 7, 339 Mont. 461, \u00b6 7, 171 P.3d 681, \u00b6 7. However, any factual findings underlying the application of \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, to the case at hand are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>See State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, \u00b6 119, 338 Mont. 442, \u00b6 119, 167 P.3d 815, \u00b6 119. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the fact-finder misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of the record leaves this Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>See Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 119; <em>State v. Weaver, </em>2008 MT 86, \u00b6 9, 342 Mont. 196, \u00b6 9, 179 P.3d 534, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-13\">\u00b618 Lastly, we review criminal sentences that include at least one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>year of actual incarceration for legality. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 174. We confine our review to determining whether the sentencing court had statutory authority to impose the sentence, whether the sentence falls within the parameters set by the applicable sentencing statutes, and whether the court adhered to the affirmative mandates of the applicable sentencing statutes. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 174; <em>State v. Stephenson, </em>2008 MT 64, \u00b6 15, 342 Mont. 60, \u00b6 15, 179 P.3d 502, \u00b6 15. This determination is a question of law and, as such, our review is de novo. <em>Stephenson, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">\u00b619 <em>Issue 1. Did the District Court lack jurisdiction over the charge in DC 06-48?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">\u00b620 Martz contends that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over the single PFMA offense charged in this case. The State notes that this issue is being raised \u201cfor the first time on appeal.\u201d As a general rule, this Court will not address an issue raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Mackrill, </em>2008 MT 297, \u00b6 47, 345 Mont. 469, \u00b6 47, 191 P.3d 451, \u00b6 47; <em>State v. LaPier, </em>1998 MT 174, \u00b6 9, 289 Mont. 392, \u00b6 9, 961 P.2d 1274, \u00b6 9, <em>overruled in part on other grounds, Slavin v. State, </em>2005 MT 306, \u00b6 12, 329 Mont. 424, \u00b6 12, 127 P.3d 350, \u00b6 12. Jurisdictional issues, however, are an exception to this general rule; indeed, it is well-established that the question of a court\u2019s jurisdiction may be raised at any time, even by the court sua sponte. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-13-101(3), MCA; <em>State v. West, </em>2008 MT 338, \u00b6 19, 346 Mont. 244, \u00b6 19, 194 P.3d 683, \u00b6 19; <em>Stanley, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30-32; <em>State v. Finley, </em>2003 MT 239, \u00b6 13, 317 Mont. 268, \u00b6 13, 77 P.3d 193, \u00b6 13; <em>LaPier, </em>\u00b6 9. Accordingly, we will consider Martz\u2019s jurisdiction argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">\u00b621 Jurisdiction is the power and authority of a court to hear and decide the case or matter before it. <em>Stanley, </em>\u00b6 30; <em>Finley, </em>\u00b6 13. This <em>power </em>and authority is conferred on courts only by the Constitution or statutes adopted pursuant to the Constitution. <em>Pinnow v. Montana State Fund, </em>2007 MT 332, \u00b6 20, 340 Mont. 217, \u00b6 20, 172 P.3d 1273, \u00b6 20. With respect to criminal matters, a court\u2019s jurisdiction depends on whether the offense is classified as a felony or a misdemeanor, which in turn depends on the maximum sentence that may be imposed for committing the crime. <em>See State v. Campbell, </em>191 Mont. 75, 78-79, 622 P.2d 200, 202 (1981); \u00a7 45-1-201(1), MCA; \u00a7 45-2-101(23), (42), (49), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">\u00b622 In pertinent part, the Montana Constitution confers on district courts \u201coriginal jurisdiction in all criminal cases amounting to felony\u201d and \u201csuch additional jurisdiction as may be delegated by the laws of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>the United States or the state of Montana.\u201d Mont. Const. art. VII, \u00a7 4(1). Furthermore, \u201c[o]ther courts may have jurisdiction of criminal cases not amounting to felony and such jurisdiction concurrent with that of the district court as may be provided by law.\u201d Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a7 4(3). Finally, justice courts have \u201csuch original jurisdiction as may be provided by law,\u201d but they do not have \u201ctrial jurisdiction in any criminal case designated a felony except as examining courts.\u201d Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a7 5(2). Thus, while felonies may be tried only in district courts, misdemeanors may be tried in district courts, \u201c[o]ther courts\u201d (e.g., justice courts), or both district courts and other courts, as determined by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">\u00b623 Section 3-5-302, MCA, sets out the original jurisdiction of district courts. Among other cases, district courts have original jurisdiction in \u201call criminal cases amounting to felony\u201d and in \u201call cases of misdemeanor not otherwise provided for.\u201d Section 3-5-302(1)(a), (d), MCA. The Legislature has \u201cprovided for\u201d jurisdiction over a number of misdemeanor cases. Of relevance to this discussion, justice courts have \u201cconcurrent jurisdiction with district courts of all misdemeanors punishable by a fine exceeding $500 or imprisonment exceeding 6 months, or both.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 3-10-303(1)(c), MCA. Misdemeanor PFMA falls under the latter category. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-5-206(3)(a)(i), (ii), MCA (providing that upon a first or second conviction of PFMA, the offender may be fined up to $1,000 and imprisoned in the county jail for a maximum term of one year).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">\u00b624  Accordingly, based on these provisions, it appears that district courts have original jurisdiction over felony PFMA charges and that justice courts and district courts have concurrent jurisdiction over misdemeanor PFMA charges. Nevertheless, Martz presents an argument that the District Court lacked jurisdiction in this case. He begins with the premise that the single count of PFMA charged by the State was, in substance, a misdemeanor because he had only one prior PFMA conviction on the day the information was filed and on the day the offense was tried. Based on this premise, he contends that the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction in this case depends on the jurisdictional provisions governing misdemeanors. Next, Martz acknowledges our statement in <em>State v. Brockway, </em>2005 MT 179, 328 Mont. 5, 116 P.3d 788, that \u201cdistrict courts have concurrent jurisdiction with justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>courts over misdemeanor charges of Partner or Family Member Assault.\u201d <em>Brockway, </em>\u00b6 11 (citing \u00a7 3-10-303(1)(c), MCA). However, he argues that this statement, while correct as applied to the factual circumstances at issue in <em>Brockway, </em>is overbroad and inapplicable to the case at hand. Moreover, according to Martz, \u00a7 3-10-303, MCA, is not particularly \u201cgermane\u201d to issues of district court jurisdiction since that provision outlines the criminal jurisdiction of <em>justice courts. </em>Instead, Martz turns to subsections (1)(d) and (2) of \u00a7 3-5-302, MCA. As noted, the former states that district courts have original jurisdiction in \u201call cases of misdemeanor not otherwise provided for.\u201d Section 3-5-302(1)(d), MCA. In Martz\u2019s view, the \u201cotherwise provided for\u201d misdemeanors are those listed in subsection (2). That provision, in turn, states that district courts have \u201cconcurrent original jurisdiction\u201d with justice courts in the following misdemeanor cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-4\">(a) misdemeanors arising at the same time as and out of the same transaction as a felony or misdemeanor offense charged in district court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\">(b) misdemeanors resulting from the reduction of a felony or misdemeanor offense charged in the district court; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">(c) misdemeanors resulting from a finding of a lesser included offense in a felony or misdemeanor case tried in district court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Section 3-5-302(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">\u00b625 Based on the foregoing, Martz points out that <em>Brockway </em>involved a multi-count information charging two counts of misdemeanor PFMA and two counts of felony PFMA. <em>See Brockway, </em>\u00b6 3. Thus, according to Martz, although <em>Brockway </em>was correctly decided, it should have been grounded in \u00a7 3-5-302(2)(a), MCA, not \u00a7 3-10-303(1)(c), MCA. In the case at hand, by contrast, Martz contends that the District Court did not have jurisdiction over the misdemeanor PFMA charge because it was charged in a single-count information, which is not a recognized basis of jurisdiction in \u00a7 3-5-302(2), MCA. In essence, Martz maintains that district courts have only pendent jurisdiction over misdemeanors as provided for in \u00a7 3-5-302(2), MCA, and that they do not have jurisdiction over a \u201csingle, stand-alone misdemeanor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">\u00b626 In response, the State rejects Martz\u2019s assertion that the charge in DC 06-48 was a misdemeanor. But assuming, for the sake of argument, that it was a misdemeanor, the State argues that the District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to our reasoning in \u00b6 11 of <em>Brockway. </em>The State does not address the fact that <em>Brockway </em>involved a multi-count information, while the information filed in DC 06-48 contained a single misdemeanor count (under Martz\u2019s theory). Nevertheless, we agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>with the State that the District Court had jurisdiction over the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"A2a\">\u00b627 Assuming, for the moment, that the charge in DC 06-48 was, in substance, a misdemeanor, we cannot accept Martz\u2019s interpretation of the pertinent statutes. Section 3-5-302(1)(d), MCA, grants the district courts original jurisdiction in \u201call cases of misdemeanor not otherwise provided for.\u201d This language implicitly instructs us to determine whether jurisdiction over the misdemeanor at issue is \u201cprovided for\u201d elsewhere in the Code. If it is not otherwise provided for, then the district courts have jurisdiction over the misdemeanor. Section 3-10-303(1)(c), MCA, in turn, states that the justice courts have \u201cconcurrent jurisdiction with district courts of all misdemeanors punishable by a fine exceeding $500 or imprisonment exceeding 6 months, or both.\u201d Thus, although high misdemeanors are \u201cprovided for\u201d by \u00a7 3-10-303(1)(c), MCA, which grants jurisdiction over those offenses to the justice courts, this provision simultaneously states that the jurisdiction is \u201cconcurrent\u201d with the district courts. It follows, then, that district courts have original jurisdiction over a misdemeanor charge of PFMA, even one brought in a single-count information. Notably, we reached this conclusion in <em>State v. Koehn, </em>1998 MT 234, 291 Mont. 87, 966 P.2d 143, albeit with no analysis. <em>See Koehn, </em>\u00b6 13 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">\u00b628 Moreover, his statutory interpretation aside, we cannot accept Martz\u2019s premise that the PFMA charge in DC 06-48 should have been designated a \u201cmisdemeanor\u201d for jurisdictional purposes. \u201c \u2018[T]he jurisdiction of a court depends on the state of facts existing at the time it is invoked.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Tomaskie, </em>2007 MT 103, \u00b6 22, 337 Mont. 130, \u00b6 22, 157 P.3d 691, \u00b6 22 (brackets in <em>Tomaskie) </em>(quoting 22 C.J.S. <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 222 (2006)). \u201cFor the determination of the court\u2019s jurisdiction at the commencement of the action .. ., the offense shall be designated a felony or misdemeanor <em>based upon the maximum potential sentence which could be imposed by statute.\u201d </em>Section 45-1-201(1), MCA (emphasis added). Here, when the instant action was commenced on May 4, 2006, Martz had one prior PFMA conviction and there were two PFMA charges pending in DC 06-09. The information in DC 06-09 had been filed on January 24, 2006, and it does not appear that Martz had filed any motions challenging that information for lack of probable cause or other defects. Thus, in light of the facts existing at the time the information was filed in DC 06-48, including the possibility of two convictions in DC 06-09, \u201cthe maximum potential sentence which could be imposed\u201d was the punishment set out in \u00a7 45-5-206(3)(a)(iv), MCA, for \u201ca third or subsequent conviction\u201d-namely, a fine of not less than $500 and not more than $50,000, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>imprisonment for a term not less than thirty days and not more than five years. This potential sentence falls in the \u201cfelony\u201d category. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-2-101(23), MCA. Accordingly, for jurisdictional purposes, the PFMA offense charged in this case was properly designated a felony. (In this regard, the State correctly points out that Martz never filed a motion to dismiss for lack of probable cause to support a felony charge in the instant action.) Lastly, because district courts have original jurisdiction in all criminal cases amounting to felony, Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a7 4(1); \u00a7 3-5-302(1)(a), MCA, we hold that the District Court had jurisdiction over the charge in DC 06-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">\u00b629 <em>Issue 2. Did the District Court err in denying Martz\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial under \u00a746-13-401(2), MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">\u00b630 Section 46-13-401(2), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">After the entry of a plea upon a misdemeanor charge, the court, unless good cause to the contrary is shown, shall order the prosecution to be dismissed, with prejudice, if a defendant whose trial has not been postponed upon the defendant\u2019s motion is not brought to trial within 6 months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">In <em>State v. Bertolino, </em>2003 MT 266, 317 Mont. 453, 77 P.3d 543, we observed that this statute \u201cmandates dismissed of a misdemeanor charge if it is not brought to trial within six months, where the defendant has not asked for a postponement and where the State has not shown good cause for the delay. The statute itself serves as the sole standard of whether \u2018good cause\u2019 for the delay has been shown.\u201d <em>Bertolino, </em>\u00b6 13 (citations and some internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"Aiu\">\u00b631 Here, Martz again proceeds on the premise that the single count of PFMA charged in DC 06-48 was, in substance, a misdemeanor because he had only one prior PFMA conviction on the day he was brought to trial on the charge. Martz then points out that he entered a plea of not guilty on May 15, 2006; that he did not seek any postponements of his trial; and that his December 19, 2006 trial date was more than seven months after he entered his plea. Furthermore, citing <em>Bertolino, </em>Martz observes that the State did not argue \u201cgood cause\u201d for the delay in the District Court, but rather took the position that since Martz had been properly charged with felony PFMA, the speedy trial statute did not apply. Martz contends, therefore, that the District Court erred in denying his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">\u00b632 The State initially responds that because Martz was charged with felony PFMA, \u201cthe entry of a plea upon a misdemeanor charge\u201d as contemplated by \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, never occurred in this case. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>State goes on to argue that Martz\u2019s speedy trial motion was essentially an untimely motion to dismiss the felony charge for lack of probable cause. The State does not, however, provide any argument on the merits of Martz\u2019s speedy trial claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">\u00b633 We concluded under Issue 1 that the PFMA charge in DC 06-48 was properly designated a felony for jurisdictional purposes on May 4, 2006, when the information was filed. That analysis, however, does not control for resolution of the speedy trial issue. Rather, we hold that the determination of the speedy trial statute\u2019s applicability to a given offense must be made based on the facts which exist at the time the motion is made and considered by the court, as demonstrated below.</p>\n<p id=\"A2q\">\u00b634 We begin with two critical clarifications. First, under the PFMA statute, \u201c[a]n offender <em>convicted </em>of a second offense under this section shall be fined not less than $300 or more than $1,000 and be imprisoned in the county jail not less than 72 hours or more than 1 year.\u201d Section 45-5-206(3)(a)(ii), MCA (emphasis added). Second, \u201cin order for there to be a <em>conviction, </em>a sentence must be imposed.\u201d <em>State v. Tomaskie, </em>2007 MT 103, \u00b6 12, 337 Mont. 130, \u00b6 12, 157 P.3d 691, \u00b6 12 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">\u00b635 Defense counsel argued during the pretrial hearing in the District Court that \u201c[t]here is no circumstance that the State can identify, today, where Mr. Martz will be convicted of anything other than a misdemeanor.\u201d That statement, however, was not exactly correct, given the foregoing rules. Although he was found guilty by a jury on December 19, 2006, of the single count of PFMA in the instant action (DC 06-48), he was not \u201cconvicted\u201d of that charge until March 19,2007, when sentence was imposed. <em>Tomaskie, </em>\u00b6 12; <em>see also </em>\u00a7 46-1-202(7), (11), (25), MCA. In the meantime, the State obtained a guilty verdict on one of the two PFMA counts in DC 06-103. The District Court imposed sentence on that guilty verdict (the one in DC 06-103) first, and it thus became Martz\u2019s \u201csecond\u201d PFMA \u201cconviction\u201d-a misdemeanor. Accordingly, when Martz was sentenced immediately thereafter in DC 06-48, that offense became his \u201cthird\u201d PFMA \u201cconviction\u201d-a felony. (As noted below, this analysis essentially resolves Martz\u2019s illegal-sentence claim under Issue 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">\u00b636 On December 18, 2006, when Martz made his motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial, a number of outcomes were possible with respect to the pending charges. First, he would be found not guilty in DC 06-48, which would moot the speedy trial issue. Second, he would be found guilty in DC 06-48 and would be found guilty in DC 06-103 of at least one of the two PFMA charges. In that situation, the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Court could sentence him first in DC 06-103 to a misdemeanor sentence and then in DC 06-48 to a felony sentence. (That is exactly what occurred here.) Third, he would be found guilty in DC 06-48 and would be found not guilty in DC 06-103 on both of the PFMA charges. In that situation, the charge in DC 06-48 could only have been his second conviction, and the District Court accordingly would have had to reduce it to a misdemeanor. The District Court seemed to suggest during the pretrial hearing that in this situation, it could then have imposed a misdemeanor sentence. We disagree and hold that the court could not have done so. Rather, in this particular situation, where the charge in DC 06-48 was reduced to a misdemeanor, the District Court would have been bound to reconsider Martz\u2019s speedy trial motion. If the motion had merit, the court would have been required to grant it, vacate the conviction, and dismiss the charge with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">\u00b637 To summarize, then, we hold that under the somewhat bizarre circumstances that existed on December 18 when the District Court considered Martz\u2019s speedy trial motion, the following course of action was proper. First, since Martz on that date stood accused in DC 06-103 of two counts of PFMA, and since one of those charges plausibly could serve as his \u201csecond\u201d PFMA \u201cconviction\u201d for purposes of sentencing him in the instant action, it was appropriate to treat the instant charge as a felony for purposes of the speedy trial statute and, thus, to deny Martz\u2019s speedy trial motion on the ground that the speedy trial statute did not apply. Critical to this conclusion is the fact that Martz never challenged the charge in this case (PFMA, \u201cfourth offense, a felony\u201d) for lack of probable cause. Yet, notably, between August 31, 2006, when the District Court dismissed without prejudice the two PFMA charges in DC 06-09 (second and third offenses) and September 20, 2006, when the State re-filed those charges in DC 06-103, Martz (1) had only one prior PFMA conviction and (2) stood accused of only one PFMA offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\u00b638 However, summary denial of Martz\u2019s speedy trial motion was contingent upon the State\u2019s obtaining a guilty verdict on at least one of the two PFMA charges in DC 06-103. Accordingly, if the State failed to do so on December 20, then the District Court was required to reconsider Martz\u2019s motion under \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA, and, if meritorious, to grant it.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">\u00b639  Before concluding, we note the State\u2019s contention that the speedy trial statute could not <em>ever </em>have applied to Martz in this case because he was charged with felony PFMA and, thus, never entered \u201ca plea upon a <em>misdemeanor </em>charge\u201d as contemplated by \u00a7 46-13-401(2), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>MCA (emphasis added). We agree with Martz, however, that this argument \u201celevates form over substance.\u201d We hold that the speedy trial statute could have applied here because Martz was charged in a single-count information with an offense that had the potential, depending on the outcome of the trial in DC 06-103, of being reduced to a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">\u00b640 <em>Issue 3. Did the District Court impose an illegal sentence in DC 06-48?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\u00b641 The District Court sentenced Martz to two years at the Montana Department of Corrections, with one year suspended. Martz contends that this sentence is illegal because he \u201chad only one conviction on the day of the event which gave rise to No. 48, and only one conviction on the day it was tried and reduced to judgment.\u201d In other words, Martz posits that \u201cthe conviction in No. 48 can never be anything other than a second conviction.\u201d As such, he argues that the District Court, at most, could have imprisoned him \u201cin the county jail not less than 72 hours or more than 1 year.\u201d Section 45-5-206(3)(a)(ii), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">\u00b642  We disagree. As explained in \u00b6 35, at the time Martz was sentenced on the instant charge on March 19, 2007, he had just been sentenced on the charge in DC 06-103. The charge in DC 06-103 was Martz\u2019s second PFMA conviction. (Recall that a \u201cconviction\u201d exists once sentence is imposed. <em>See Tomaskie, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9-12.) Accordingly, when Martz was sentenced in the instant action, the offense was properly treated as his third PFMA conviction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">On a third or subsequent conviction for partner or family member assault, the offender shall be fined not less than $500 and not more than $50,000 and be imprisoned for a term not less than 30 days and not more than 5 years. ... If the term of imprisonment exceeds 1 year, the person shall be imprisoned in the state prison.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">Section 45-5-206(3)(a)(iv), MCA. Whenever a person has been found guilty of an offense upon a verdict of guilty, a sentencing judge may suspend execution of sentence, impose a term of incarceration at a state prison to be designated by the Department of Corrections, or impose a commitment to the Department of Corrections. Section 46-18-201(2), (3)(c), (3)(d)(i), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">\u00b643 Here, the District Court sentenced Martz to two years at the Department of Corrections, with one year suspended. This sentence is legal under the foregoing statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">\u00b644 We hold that the District Court had jurisdiction over the PFMA charge in this case, that the District Court correctly denied Martz\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial, and that Martz\u2019s sentence is legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">\u00b645 As a final observation, when charges involve offenses that escalate in severity depending upon the number of the offense, the sorts of \u2018Which came first, the chicken or the egg?\u201d and \u201cWho\u2019s on first?\u201d issues raised in this appeal can typically be avoided by thoughtful charging and trial scheduling. While such considerations may appear as simply scheduling or housekeeping issues for prosecutors and trial courts, they can, as here, result in appeals presenting legal mazes that require an inordinate amount of time to sort through and resolve. Given this Court\u2019s limited time and resources, we hope that prosecutors and the trial courts will keep these considerations in mind in future cases involving charges of the type at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\u00b646 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b80-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b73-6\"> These are sometimes referred to as \u201chigh misdemeanors.\u201d <em>See e.g. State v.
