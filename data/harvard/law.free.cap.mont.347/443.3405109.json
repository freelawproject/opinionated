We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\u00b62 Dunning presents the following issues for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">\u00b63 Whether the District Corut abused its discretion by granting the State\u2019s motion in limine to limit inquiry into earlier statements by the alleged victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">\u00b64 Whether the District Corut abused its discretion by granting the State\u2019s motion to depose the alleged victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">\u00b65 Whether the District Court abused its discretion by granting the State\u2019s motion to excise portions of the alleged victim\u2019s deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">\u00b66 Whether the District Corut abused its discretion in sentencing Dunning.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">\u00b67 Dunning approached M.K. as she walked down Montana Avenue in Billings, Montana, on October 30,2005, on her way to visit a friend, Michael Reim (Reim). Draining introduced himself and asked M.K. if she was a homeless youth. M.K. told Dunning that she was homeless, but not a youth. M.K. had turned 18 just ten days earlier. Dunning smiled, reached out, and shook hands with M.K.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">\u00b68 M.K. was 5\u20192\u201d tall and weighed about 100 pounds at the time. M.K. had never before met Dunning. M.K. stopped shaking hands, but Dunning did not let go. Dunning continued to hold M.K.\u2019s hand and grabbed M.K.\u2019s wrist with his other hand. Dunning walked backwards and pulled M.K. toward his parked pickup truck. Dunning opened the passenger door of his pickup truck and told M.K. to get in. M.K. refused. Dunning climbed into the pickup truck and pulled M.K. inside. Dunning reached in front of M.K. to shut and lock the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-14\">\u00b69 Dunning pulled out of his parking spot and turned onto Montana Avenue. M.K. tried to unlock and open the door several times. Dunning repeatedly pushed the lock back down. Dunning drove to a deserted spot at the south end of Montana Avenue and parked behind a large dumpster.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-15\">\u00b610 Dunning told M.K. that she could trust him and that he would not hurt her. Dunning offered M.K. money and a motel room. Dunning grabbed M.K. in a bear hug and squeezed her tightly. Dunning kissed M.K. on the cheek and put his hand inside the back of M.K\u2019s pants. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Dunning touched the crack of M.K.\u2019s buttocks. Dunning squeezed harder as M.K. squirmed to get free. M.K. tried to persuade Dunning to stop. She first told him that she needed to find her boyfriend. M.K. then told Dunning that she was pregnant.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">\u00b611 After several minutes, a small red sports car made a u-tum at the end of Montana Avenue and parked right behind Dunning\u2019s pickup truck. Dunning stopped hugging M.K., but continued to hold her arm. Dunning had not released his hold of M.K., except to shift gears, from the time that he first had shaken her hand. Dunning told M.K. that he had decided to take her back to where he had found her.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">\u00b612 Dunning drove to the spot where he initially had pulled M.K. into his pickup truck and parked. Dunning sat and talked to M.K. for a few minutes with his pickup truck engine running. Dunning suddenly changed his mind and told M.K. that he had decided to take her to Miles City. Dunning pulled back onto Montana Avenue and stopped for a red light at the 27th Street intersection. Dunning released his hold on M.K. and waited for traffic. M.K. unlocked the door, opened it, and jumped out.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">\u00b613 M.K. landed on her feet, but soon lost her balance and hit her side on the ground. M.K. wrote Dunning\u2019s license plate number on her hand and quickly walked the opposite direction towards Reim\u2019s apartment. Reim drove M.K. to Mark Owen\u2019s (Owen) apartment to get M.K.\u2019s boyfriend, Terrance McManis (McManis). McManis lived with Owen. M.K., Reim, and McManis returned to Montana Avenue to look for Dunning. Dunning could not be found. M.K. called the police. The police arrested Dunning a short time later. Dunning admitted to police that he had offered M.K. money and a motel room. Dunning denied that he had restrained M.K., or that he had touched her inappropriately.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">\u00b614 The State charged Dunning with felony kidnapping and misdemeanor sexual assault. The court scheduled a jury trial for April 10, 2006. The State filed several motions in limine regarding the anticipated testimony of Owen and cross-examination of M.K. The State also filed a motion to depose M.K. and her boyfriend. The court held a hearing on the motions in limine and the motion for the court-ordered depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">\u00b615 The State sought to preclude Dunning from inquiring into M.K\u2019s sexual history, criminal history, alleged prior claims of rape, and other matters that the State argued should be excluded by the rape shield statute and rules of evidence. Dunning contested only the State\u2019s motion that sought to preclude testimony regarding M.K\u2019s alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>false claim of pregnancy. Owen stated in his witness interview that he believed M.K. to be a pathological liar. Owen had recalled an incident when M.K. had told him that she was pregnant, or he had heard that she was pregnant, and at some undisclosed time he saw her pull a feminine hygiene product from her backpack. Dunning wanted the jury to hear testimony regarding what Owen described as M.K.\u2019s false claim of being pregnant to help determine her credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">\u00b6 16 The State argued that Owen\u2019s prospective testimony was not proof that M.K. had lied about having been pregnant. The State pointed out that Owen did not know when he had seen M.K. with the feminine product in relation to her alleged claim of pregnancy, or that M.K. may have miscarried, or that M.K. mistakenly may have thought she had been pregnant. The State argued that this testimony should be excluded as the question of M.K.\u2019s pregnancy had not been an issue in this case. The court determined that the rape shield statute prohibited this testimony and that it would not be relevant under M. R. Evid. 402. The court further determined that this testimony would be more prejudicial than probative under M. R. Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\u00b617 The court also granted the State\u2019s motion for the depositions of M.K. and McManis. The State sought to serve M.K. with a subpoena for trial and a subpoena for deposition. The State argued that it preferred M.K\u2019s live testimony, but it wanted to use her deposition testimony if M.K. failed to appear for trial. M.K. was homeless. The State had been unable to find M.K. at the places that she usually patronized or through her acquaintances. The State also had learned that M.K. and McManis may have left the area. M.K. initially had responded to the State\u2019s and Dunning\u2019s requests to meet, but she recently had missed a scheduled interview. The State enlisted the assistance of the Sheriffs office, the Billings Police Department, and an additional detective in an unsuccessful attempt to find M.K. The court granted the motion for the depositions, but informed the parties that it would entertain arguments about whether M.K.\u2019s deposition would be used in lieu of her testimony if M.K. failed to appear for trial. The State deposed M.K. on March 24, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">\u00b618 The State moved to excise portions of M.K.\u2019s videotaped deposition and Dunning moved to strike and excise other portions of M.K.\u2019s videotaped deposition. The State objected to Dunning\u2019s questioning about why M.K. could not sleep at Owen\u2019s house or at the homeless shelter on the night of the incident. M.K. testified in her deposition that she could not stay at Owen\u2019s apartment because it was too small. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Owen claimed that M.K. was dishonest and as a result, had not been welcome to stay at his apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">\u00b619 The State argued that whether M.K. had been welcome to stay at Owen\u2019s apartment was irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial. Dunning contended that it was relevant to show that M.K. had no options other than to seek shelter with an acquaintance she had just met, such as Dunning, and that it reflected upon M.K\u2019s untruthfulness. Dunning contended that the encounter with M.K. had been voluntary and that she had lied about having been kidnapped. The court permitted Dunning to ask Owen if M.K. could have slept at his apartment to allow Dunning to establish his theory that M.K. had asked to sleep in his pickup truck. Dunning could not ask Owen, however, the reason why M.K. had not been welcome to sleep at his apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">\u00b620 M.K. testified in person at trial. A jury convicted Dunning of one count of felony kidnapping and one count of misdemeanor sexual assault. The court sentenced Dunning to 10 years in the Montana State Prison for the felony kidnapping and six months in the Yellowstone County Detention Facility for the misdemeanor sexual assault. The court set the terms to run concurrently. The court\u2019s written judgment provided that Dunning would be ineligible for parole as a necessary means for the protection of society. Dunning appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">\u00b621 We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion in limine for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Brasda, </em>2003 MT 374, \u00b6 14, 319 Mont. 146, \u00b6 14, 82 P.3d 922, \u00b6 14 (citations omitted). We review a district court\u2019s rulings on a discovery matter for abuse of discretion. <em>In re S.C., </em>2005 MT 241, \u00b6 16, 328 Mont. 476, \u00b6 16, 121 P.3d 552, \u00b6 16. A district court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Brasda, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">\u00b622 The law grants broad discretion to trial judges to determine the appropriate punishment for offenses. <em>State v. Oie, </em>2007 MT 328, \u00b6 8, 340 Mont. 205, \u00b6 8, 174 P.3d 937, \u00b6 8 (citations omitted). We will not review a sentence for mere inequity or disparity. <em>Oie, </em>\u00b6 8. We will review a criminal sentence only for its legality. <em>Oie, </em>\u00b6 8. A trial court\u2019s statutory interpretation presents a question of law that we review to determine whether it is correct. <em>Oie, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">\u00b623 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion by granting the State\u2019s motion in limine to limit inquiry into earlier statements by the alleged victim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">\u00b624 The State sought to preclude Dunning from allowing the jury to hear testimony of Owen that M.K. falsely had claimed to have been pregnant at some earlier time. The State also sought to limit cross-examination of M.K. regarding the same subject. The State argues that this testimony and cross-examination was irrelevant, would have been prejudicial, and would have confused the issues before the jury. Evidence is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d M. R. Evid. 401. Evidence that is relevant may be excluded, however, if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. M. R. Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">\u00b625 Dunning sought to offer Owen\u2019s testimony of M.K\u2019s alleged claim of a previous pregnancy to cast doubt upon M.K\u2019s truthfulness. M. R. Evid. 608 generally prohibits attacks on a witness\u2019s character and credibility through specific instances of conduct. M. R. Evid. 608 makes an exception if the specific instances of conduct are probative of the witness\u2019s \u201ctruthfulness.\u201d The truth as to M.K\u2019s alleged past claim of pregnancy is irrelevant as to whether Dunning fondled M.K. while he restrained her. Owen\u2019s proposed testimony regarding M.K\u2019s claim of having been pregnant in the past would have served no probative purpose as to whether M.K. was telling the truth regarding Dunning\u2019s sexual assault. Moreover, the possibility of Owen\u2019s testimony prejudicing the jury outweighs the testimony\u2019s probative value under M. R. Evid. 403. <em>State v. Grixti, </em>2005 MT 296, \u00b6 21, 329 Mont. 330, \u00b6 21, 124 P.3d 177, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">\u00b626 Dunning contends that the issue is not whether M.K. had been pregnant when she allegedly had told Owen, but whether she actually was telling the truth about a condition she was holding herself out to be. Dunning argues that he should have been allowed to explore this line of questioning to enable the jury to determine whether it bears on M.K\u2019s credibility. Dunning claims that the court\u2019s limit on cross-examination regarding M.K\u2019s previous claim to Owen of having been pregnant restricted Dunning\u2019s right to confront witnesses. The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution guarantee a criminal defendant the right to confront witnesses. Nothing in the Sixth Amendment or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Article II, Section 24 guarantees, however, that a defendant may confront a witness with irrelevant evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">\u00b627  The court allowed Dunning to cross-examine M.K. about a variety of subjects. The court also allowed Dunning to ask Owen about whether M.K. had been welcome to stay at his apartment. Owen\u2019s mere assertion that he had seen M.K. pull a feminine hygiene product out of her backpack at a time when she allegedly claimed to have been pregnant would not have established the fact M.K. was untruthful. Owen\u2019s testimony would have been an improper attack on her character with irrelevant evidence. <em>State v. MacKinnon, </em>1998 MT 78, \u00b6 39, 288 Mont. 329, \u00b6 39, 957 P.2d 23, \u00b6 39. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in granting the State\u2019s motions to preclude Dunning from questioning Owen about M.K.\u2019s alleged claim of a previous pregnancy. <em>Brasda, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">\u00b628 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion by granting the State\u2019s motion to depose the alleged victim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\u00b629 Dunning argues that the District Court abused its discretion in granting the State\u2019s motion to depose M.K. M.K. appeared and testified at the trial. The State never introduced M.K\u2019s video-taped deposition at trial. M.K.\u2019s testimony at trial rendered moot Dunning\u2019s challenge to the District Court\u2019s decision to approve the State\u2019s motion to depose M.K. <em>State ex. rel. Miller v. Murray, </em>183 Mont. 499, 503, 600 P.2d 1174, 1176 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">\u00b630 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion by granting the State\u2019s motion to excise portions of the alleged victim\u2019s deposition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">\u00b631 Dunning similarly argues that the District Court abused its discretion when it granted the State\u2019s motion to excise portions of M.K.\u2019s deposition. M.K.\u2019s testimony at trial rendered moot Dunning\u2019s challenge to the State\u2019s effort to excise portions of M.K.\u2019s videotaped deposition. <em>Murray, </em>183 Mont. at 503, 600 P.2d at 1176.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">\u00b632 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion by sentencing Dunning to 10 years in Montana State Prison.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">\u00b633 Dunning argues that the court violated \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA, when it imposed the parole ineligibility restriction on his sentence without written reasons for the restriction. Dunning contends that the court based its parole restriction, in its oral pronouncement of sentence, on the fact that Dunning was a level 3 sex offender. Dunning claims that he had never received a numerical designation and that his current offenses did not warrant a numerical designation. Dunning requests this Court to remand for resentencing on substantially correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>information as required by <em>State v. Dunfee, </em>2005 MT 147, \u00b6 50, 327 Mont. 335, \u00b6 50, 114 P.3d 217, \u00b6 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">\u00b634 The State counters that it requested Dunning\u2019s parole restriction on the grounds that he represents a complete danger to the community. The State points out that Dunning\u2019s history discloses that he had committed 19 sex-related offenses over a 30-year period, ranging from voyeurism, to obscene phone calls, to sexual assaults, and to indecent exposure. Dunning\u2019s misdemeanor sexual offenses escalated into his first felony conviction in 1992. Dunning has registered as a sex offender since 1993. Dunning conceded that he has not completed a sex offender treatment program.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">\u00b635 Dunning had undergone a psychosexual evaluation in connection with his first felony conviction in 1992. The evaluator deemed Dunning to be a high risk to re-offend and not amenable to community treatment. The 1992 evaluator\u2019s conclusion that Dunning represented a high risk to re-offend comports with a level 3 designation under current law. Section 46-23-509(2)(c), MCA. The 1992 evaluator established that Dunning had multiple victims and multiple offenses, no guilt or remorse, a projection of responsibility on the victim, and little regard for the impact on the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">\u00b636 The 1992 evaluator did not designate Dunning at a specific offender level as the statutory language in place at the time did not require numerical designations. The legislature amended the statute to require numerical designations after October 1, 1997. Section 46-23-509(5), MCA. Dunning conceded at the sentencing hearing, however, that he had been designated the equivalent of a level 3 offender following his 1992 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">\u00b637 The court ordered a current psychosexual evaluation of Dunning before the sentencing in this matter. The current evaluator agreed with the 1992 evaluator that Dunning remained a high risk to re-offend. Dunning\u2019s repeated offenses since his 1992 felony bears out his propensity to re-offend. In fact, the current evaluator concluded that Dunning\u2019s behavior had escalated from hands-off offenses to hands-on offenses. The evaluator strongly recommended that Dunning be sentenced to a long period of supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">\u00b638  Dunning\u2019s 1992 evaluation and his 2007 evaluation confirmed his high risk to re-offend, consistent with a level 3 offender. Section 46-23-509(2)(c), MCA. Dunning conceded that his 1992 conviction already had designated him the equivalent of a level 3 offender. Dunning remains an untreated sexual offender with a high risk to re-offend. The factual evidence presented to the court provided a sufficient basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>to support the court\u2019s conclusion that Dunning warranted the parole restriction for the protection of society. Section 46-18-202, MCA. The district court did not abuse its discretion when it imposed the parole ineligibility sentence. <em>Oie, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">\u00b639 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b471-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
