Toth was sentenced to five years at Montana State Prison, with the imposition of conditions of supervision if he receives an earlier release. Toth appeals, raising the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">\u00b62 1. Did the District Court err in denying Toth\u2019s motion to dismiss at the close of the State\u2019s case in chief for the State\u2019s failure to meet its burden of proof?</p>\n<p id=\"b205-14\">\u00b63 2. Did Toth\u2019s conviction for assault with a weapon subject him to double jeopardy?</p>\n<p id=\"b205-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b205-16\">\u00b64 Police arrested Toth on July 2, 2006, for misdemeanor assault, following reports of his involvement in an altercation in the men\u2019s restroom of the Irish Times Pub in Butte. Two men, Tyler Dockter and Matthew Palmer, told police that Toth and another man, Mike Gardipee, verbally threatened and punched them in the restroom. They further reported that the fight escalated when Toth pulled a knife out of his pocket and attempted to stab Dockter in the stomach. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>The State later filed an Information which charged Toth with assault with a weapon, a felony, alleging that Toth caused bodily injury with the knife or, alternatively, caused reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury with the knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">\u00b65 After the State presented its case in chief, Toth moved for a directed verdict<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the ground that the State had not met its burden of proof. The court denied the motion, concluding the testimony presented satisfied the State\u2019s burden and the case was sufficient to go to the jury. After completion of the two-day trial, the jury found Toth guilty of assault with a weapon for causing reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury with a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\u00b66 Toth appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">STANDARD OP REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">\u00b67 This Court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s conclusion regarding the sufficiency of evidence to support a conviction. <em>State v. Trujillo, </em>2008 MT 101, \u00b6 8, 342 Mont. 319, \u00b6 8, 180 P.3d 1153, \u00b6 8. The Court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, and determines whether a rationale trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Andrews, </em>274 Mont. 292, 295, 907 P.2d 967, 969 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">\u00b68 We have reviewed the merits of a defendant\u2019s double jeopardy claim, despite the failure to raise the issue in the district court, where the court could have determined from the record that the government lacked the power to charge a defendant. <em>State v. Cech, </em>2007 MT 184, \u00b6 9, 338 Mont. 330, \u00b6 9, 167 P.3d 389, \u00b6 9. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>State v. Boucher, </em>2002 MT 114, \u00b6 10, 309 Mont. 514, \u00b6 10, 48 P.3d 21, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">\u00b69 I. Did the District Court err in denying Toth\u2019s motion to dismiss at the closure of the State\u2019s case in chief for the State\u2019s failure to meet its burden of proof?</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">\u00b610 Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 45-5-213 sets forth the essential elements of assault with a weapon as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-12\">A person commits the offense of assault with a weapon if the person purposely or knowingly causes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>(a) bodily injury to another with a weapon; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-4\">(b) reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury in another by use of a weapon or what reasonably appears to be a weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao7n\">\u201cSerious bodily injury\u201d includes a bodily injury that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-5\">i. creates a substantial risk of death</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">ii. causes serious permanent disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the function or process of a bodily member or organ;or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">iii. at the time of injury, can reasonably be expected to result in serious permanent disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the function or process of a bodily member or organ.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Section 45-2-101(66), MCA. A \u201cweapon\u201d is broadly defined as \u201can instrument, article, or substance that, regardless of its primary function, is readily capable of being used to produce death or serious bodily injury.\u201d Section 45-2-101(79), MCA; <em>see also State v. R.B. </em>\u201cJ\u201d <em>C, </em>2004 MT 254, \u00b6 15, 323 Mont. 62, \u00b6 15, 97 P.3d 1116, \u00b6 15 (threatened use of an un-lit cigarette lighter can cause reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">\u00b611 Toth argues that no reasonable trier of fact could have concluded that the knife he allegedly used to threaten the victims with could have caused a reasonable apprehension of serious bodily harm, because the jury did not have enough information regarding the characteristics of the knife. Toth notes that the knife was never found and the eyewitnesses were unable to specifically describe the blade of the knife. Toth contends that, while a pocket knife might support a finding of apprehension of simple bodily injury, there was \u201cno evidence\u201d which would support a finding of <em>serious </em>bodily injury. He argues that evidence regarding \u201cthe length of the alleged blade and the corresponding physiological effects of an abdominal wound from such a blade\u201d was required. Toth relies primarily on <em>State v. Andrews, </em>wherein we held the State had failed to present sufficient evidence that a victim\u2019s injuries created a substantial risk of death. In response, the State discusses the evidence offered against Toth, including his statement to Dockter that \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you,\u201d the testimony of the victims about Toth drawing a knife, assaulting Dockter with it, and the cuts on Dockter\u2019s arm, arguing the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict that Toth had caused reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">\u00b612 The issue here is not identical to the issue in <em>Andrews. </em>There, a father was convicted of aggravated assault after a jury found he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>shaken his baby and caused the child serious bodily injury. <em>Andrews, </em>274 Mont. at 295, 907 P.2d at 969. The State elicited testimony from two physicians who established the child had suffered severe dehydration, weight loss, a fever, and lethargy resulting from \u201cshaken baby syndrome.\u201d <em>Andrews, </em>274 Mont. at 294-95, 907 P.2d at 968-69. We held that because no one had testified that the child\u2019s injuries were life threatening, a fact-finder could have found from the evidence that the child suffered bodily injury, but not <em>serious </em>bodily injury as defined in the code. <em>Andrews, </em>274 Mont. at 295, 907 P.2d at 969. Here, unlike <em>Andrews, </em>the State did not allege that Toth caused serious bodily injury, for which proof of the extent of the injury would be necessary. Rather, the State alleged that Toth, by use of a knife, caused reasonable apprehension of a serious bodily injury. Thus, the focus of the charge was the fear or apprehension that such an injury would occur-not that it did occur-and whether that fear was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"AKR\">\u00b613  To prove the elements of this charge, the State presented witnesses who testified that they had seen Toth wield a knife and that he had threatened to kill Dockter. Evidence of cuts which Toth made upon Dockter was introduced, and Dockter testified that he was \u201cpetrified\u201d that Toth was going to stab him in the stomach. Dockter testified that the knife was a \u201clocking blade\u201d knife that could fit in Toth\u2019s pocket. Though a knife was not recovered, we have held that the trier of fact need not have the actual weapon before it in order to convict a defendant of assault when the circumstantial evidence supports a finding that the defendant used a weapon. <em>State v. Longneck, </em>201 Mont. 367, 375, 654 P.2d 977, 981 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">\u00b614  Viewing the evidence in favor of the State, the jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Toth\u2019s actions of wielding a knife, threatening to kill, and cutting the victim caused the victim reasonable apprehension of being stabbed and seriously injured, even though the knife was not described with specificity or the nature of potential stab wounds it could inflict proved by medical evidence. We thus conclude that the District Court properly denied the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\u00b615 2. Did Toth\u2019s conviction for assault with a weapon subject him to double jeopardy?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\u00b616 The PSI prepared for Toth\u2019s sentencing listed as part of Toth\u2019s criminal history, a $170 bond forfeiture for disorderly conduct in Butte, Montana, on July 2, 2006, the same day of the altercation at the Irish Times Bar. No other information exists in the record relating to this event, and Toth did not raise a double jeopardy objection in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\u00b617 Toth argues that if the bond forfeiture for disorderly conduct listed in the PSI arises from the same events which led to his assault charge, double jeopardy would bar the further prosecution for assault. He asks that we remand the case for an evidentiary hearing on this issue. In response, the State argues that the record is insufficient to demonstrate that the disorderly conduct matter had any connection to the events for which Toth was charged with assault and thus, Toth failed to meet his burden to provide a factual basis for his claim and the District Court could not have determined that the government lacked the power to bring the assault charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\u00b618 Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provide that \u201cno person shall be twice put in jeopardy for the same offense.\u201d This prohibition against double jeopardy provides \u201cprotection against a separate prosecution for the same offense after acquittal, protection against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction, and protection against multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>State v. Barron, </em>2008 MT 69, \u00b6 14, 342 Mont. 100, \u00b6 14, 179 P.3d 519, \u00b6 14 (citing <em>State v. Anderson, </em>1998 MT 258, \u00b6 7, 291 Mont. 242, \u00b6 7, 967 P.2d 413 \u00b6 7. Section 46-11-504, MCA, bars the subsequent prosecution for an offense based on the same transaction for which a person has already been convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\u00b619  Toth\u2019s double jeopardy claim is based on his contention that a bond forfeiture is synonymous with a conviction, and would bar an additional prosecution arising from the same transaction. However, even if the record was sufficient to demonstrate that these charges were related, Toth\u2019s claim would nonetheless fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">\u00b620 The parties do not offer any authority suggesting that a bond forfeiture equates to a conviction for purposes of double jeopardy absent specific legislation to that effect. Faced with this same issue, the Supreme Court of South Carolina concluded otherwise, holding that, unless specified by the legislature, a bond forfeiture does not equal a conviction. <em>Scott v. S.C., </em>513 S.E.2d 100 (S.C. 1999). The <em>Scott </em>Court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">[A] Louisiana court stated in a defamation case that \u201c[a] conviction is a judicial determination of guilt. A forfeiture of bond is a decision by the person charged not to appear for trial, thereby avoiding a judicial determination of guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Hopkins v. Keith, </em>348 So. 2d 999, 1002 (La. Ct. App. 1977) (affirming summary judgment for defendant newspaper sued because story <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>failed to fully distinguish between bond forfeiture and conviction, a distinction that is unclear to much of the public). <em>See also </em>8A Am. Jur. 2d <em>Bail and Recognizance </em>\u00a7 113 (1997) (bond forfeiture proceeding \u201cdoes not involve the guilt or innocence, conviction or acquittal, of any person. Rather, a bail bond forfeiture and the judgment thereon against a surety is a civil action to enforce the surety\u2019s contract with the state\u201d); 8 C.J.S. <em>Bail </em>\u00a7\u00a7 5, 160-178 (1988) (discussing purpose and forfeiture of bail bond).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-4\">This Court has held that a bond forfeiture is equivalent to a conviction when the Legislature has defined it as a conviction by statute ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">We have found no case in South Carolina or elsewhere, and the parties have cited none, in which a court explicitly declared that a bond forfeiture is equivalent to a conviction, absent a statute declaring it to be a conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-6\"><em>Scott, </em>513 S.E.2d at 103-04. The <em>Scott </em>Court also noted that other states had reached the same conclusion. <em>Scott, </em>513 S.E.2d at 103, n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"APN\">\u00b621 A \u201cconviction\u201d is defined in Montana\u2019s code as \u201ca judgment or sentence entered upon a guilty or nolo contendre plea or upon a verdict or finding of guilt rendered by a legally constituted jury or by a court of competent jurisdiction authorized to try the case without a jury.\u201d Section 46-1-202(7), MCA. This definition does not include a bond forfeiture. The Legislature has expanded the definition of conviction to include bond forfeitures for particular purposes only. For example, the Legislature defined \u201cconviction\u201d to include bond forfeitures for purposes of the revocation or suspension of drivers\u2019 licensure and other motor vehicle regulations. Section 61-5-213, MCA (\u201cthe term \u2018conviction\u2019 means: ... (4) a forfeiture of bail or collateral deposited to secure the person\u2019s appearance in court ...\u201d). The Legislature also specifically defined \u201cconviction\u201d to include bond forfeitures for purposes of other offenses. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 45-5-206(3)(b), 45-5-220(5)(c), 45-5-62l(2)(b), MCA. Otherwise, the Legislature consistently mentions them separately. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 23-2-507(1), 37-47-341(5), 61-3-119(1)(b)(ii)(B), 87-1-102(2)(b), 87-4-427(1)(d), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">\u00b622  Bond forfeiture is essentially a civil action. It \u201cdoes not involve the guilt or innocence, conviction or acquittal, of any person.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>513 S.E.2d at 253-54 (quoting 8 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Bail and Recognizance </em>\u00a7 113 (1997)). A bond forfeiture is not admissible as evidence \u201cin any other civil action.\u201d Section 46-9-512(4), MCA. A person who fails to appear when the court so requires may be subject to criminal liability for bail-jumping or contempt, crimes which are separate and distinct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>from any civil liability. Sections 45-7-308, 309, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">\u00b623  The law\u2019s general treatment of a bond forfeiture as a civil matter and the distinction made by the Legislature between bond forfeitures and criminal convictions, including the specific inclusion of forfeitures within the definition of \u201cconviction\u201d for particular purposes only, lead us to conclude that, even if Toth\u2019s felony assault charge arose out of the same transaction as the disorderly conduct, jeopardy did not attach by Toth\u2019s bond forfeiture, and his claim must therefore fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\u00b624 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b211-6\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, WARNER and COTTER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b206-13\"> A motion for directed verdict in a criminal case is properly denominated as a motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence. <em>See State v.
