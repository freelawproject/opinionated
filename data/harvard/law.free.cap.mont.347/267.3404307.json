We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-13\">\u00b62 The Town raises the following issue on appeal: Whether the District Court erred in holding that MMIA did not have a duty to defend and indemnify the Town in an underlying action.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b288-15\">\u00b63 On December 12, 2003, the Town entered into a contract with AK Drilling, Inc. (AK) for the construction of a well. Delta Engineering, P.C. (Delta) was the project engineer. In October 2004, AK brought an action against the Town and Delta alleging that the Town\u2019s Mayor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>instructed AK to perform work beyond the scope of the contract, and that the Mayor represented to AK that the Town would pay for this work. When the town refused to pay, AK filed suit alleging breach of contract against the Town; negligent misrepresentation and constructive fraud against both the Town and Delta; and breach of professional duty against Delta.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\">\u00b64 MMIA was created by the Montana League of Cities and Towns to provide member towns with loss protection. MMIA issued a policy of insurance to the Town covering the period from July 1, 2004, through January 1, 2005. The extent of protection MMIA provided to the Town is defined in its Memorandum of Liability Coverage, Forms A and B.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\u00b65 Following service of AK\u2019s Complaint, the Town notified MMIA of the suit and requested that MMIA provide both a defense and indemnification under the terms of the policy. On December 10,2004, counsel for MMIA sent the Town a letter refusing to defend or provide coverage for the claims brought by AK citing policy exclusions for non-monetary damages, punitive damages, breach of contract, and liability based on estimated probable costs or faulty bid specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u00b66 Thereafter, the Town brought this action seeking a judgment that MMIA is obligated to defend and provide coverage for the claims brought against the Town by AK. The Town and MMIA filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the issues of duty to defend and indemnification. The District Court denied the Town\u2019s motion and granted MMIA\u2019s motion on the basis that MMIA did not have a duty to defend and indemnify the Town because the allegations contained in AK\u2019s Complaint were not covered events due to the contract exclusion in the policy. The Town appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling de novo using the same M. R. Civ. P. 56 criteria applied by the district court. <em>Eastgate Village Water and Sewer v. Davis, </em>2008 MT 141, \u00b6 18, 343 Mont. 108, \u00b6 18, 183 P.3d 873, \u00b6 18 (citing <em>Watkins Trust v.

Summary judgment is proper only when no genuine issues of material fact exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Eastgate Village, </em>\u00b6 18. Furthermore, all reasonable inferences which may be drawn from the offered proof must be drawn in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Eastgate Village, </em>\u00b6 18. If there is any doubt regarding the propriety of the summary judgment motion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>it should be denied. <em>Eastgate Village, </em>\u00b6 18 (citing <em>360 Ranch Corp. v.

The Town contends that the District Court erred when it relied entirely on the breach of contract exclusion of the policy to deny MMIA\u2019s defense and coverage obligations, ignoring AK\u2019s actual claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u00b611  An insurer\u2019s duty to defend its insured arises when a complaint alleges facts which represent a risk covered by the terms of an insurance policy. <em>Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co. v. Rumph, </em>2007 MT 249, \u00b6 14, 339 Mont. 251, \u00b6 14, 170 P.3d 934, \u00b6 14 (citing <em>Blair v. Mid-Continent Casualty Co., </em>2007 MT 208, \u00b6 15, 339 Mont. 8, \u00b6 15, 167 P.3d 888, \u00b6 15; <em>Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co. v. Staples, </em>2004 MT 108, \u00b6 20, 321 Mont. 99, \u00b6 20, 90 P.3d 381, \u00b6 20). An insurer must look to the allegations in the complaint to determine if coverage exists under the policy, thus giving rise to a duty to defend. <em>Rumph, </em>\u00b6 14. Moreover, the insurer must defend \u201cunless there exists an unequivocal demonstration that the claim against the insured does not fall under the policy\u2019s coverage.\u201d <em>Rumph, </em>\u00b6 14.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>\u00b612 The Memorandum of Liability Coverage (Form A) between MMIA and the Town declares that MMIA shall provide coverage to the Town for claims against the Town for bodily injury, personal injury, property damage and public official\u2019s errors and omissions. Section II of Form A states that MMIA\u2019s \u201cduty to defend shall arise when the complaint or claim alleges facts which would obligate [MMIA] to indemnify the insured if the alleged facts were proven.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\">\u00b613 AK\u2019s Complaint against the Town alleges claims of breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation and constructive fraud. The Town maintains that its policy with MMIA provides coverage for these claims under the personal injury and public official\u2019s errors and omissions provisions of the policy. We will analyze each of AK\u2019s claims against the Town in turn to determine whether MMIA has a duty to defend the Town.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\n<em>Count One-Breach of Contract</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u00b614 The Town alleges that AK\u2019s claim for breach of contract does not turn on the terms of the contract, but instead is a claim for negligence. The Town contends that AK\u2019s Complaint alleges that the Mayor knew or should have known that the Town was not going to pay for the work performed and that the Mayor should have disclosed this fact to AK in advance. Thus, the Town argues that the Mayor\u2019s alleged failure to act when she had a duty to act constitutes negligence and negligence is a claim which MMIA is obligated to defend under the terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"A0E\">\u00b615 MMIA argues on the other hand that there is no reference in Count One to any \u201cduty,\u201d only references to a contract being created and breached. Nevertheless, as MMIA points out in its brief on appeal, breach of contract claims are pled as breaches of duties, i.e., the duties created by each parties\u2019 obligations under the contract. <em>\u201cA </em>contract is a promise or a set of promises for the breach of which the law gives a remedy, or the performance of which the law in some way recognizes as a duty.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 1 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\u00b616 In Count One of its Complaint, AK set forth the facts leading up to its claim for breach of contract and specifically stated in \u00b6 24 that the Town \u201chas breached its Agreement\u201d with AK. Nowhere in Count One does AK refer to a breach of duty by the Mayor or any other claim that could be considered other than a breach of contract. Section IX.22. of Form A specifically excludes from coverage \u201c[a]ny liability arising out of failure to perform, or breach of, a contractual obligation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\u00b617 We have held that \u201cexclusions from coverage will be narrowly and strictly construed because they are contrary to the fundamental protective purpose of an insurance policy.\u201d <em>Swank Enterprises v. All </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number><em>Purpose Services, </em>2007 MT 57, \u00b6 27, 336 Mont. 197, \u00b6 27, 154 P.3d 52, \u00b6 27 (citing <em>Deonier &amp; Assoc. v. Paul Revere Life Ins., </em>2000 MT 238, \u00b6 45, 301 Mont. 347, \u00b6 45, 9 P.3d 622, \u00b6 45).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\u00b618 Here, contrary to being excluded from coverage, the Town argues that this claim falls under the personal injury coverage of the policy. Personal injury is defined in Section V.O. of Form A as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">\u201cPersonal Injury\u201d-means injury, other than Bodily Injury, including but not limited to one or more of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">1. False arrest, detention, imprisonment, or malicious prosecution;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">2. Wrongful entry or eviction or other invasion of private occupancy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-8\">3. <em>The publication or utterance of a libel or slander, including disparaging statements concerning the condition, value, quality or use of real or personal property; </em>or a publication or utterance in violation of the rights of privacy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\">4. Unlawful discrimination or violation of civil rights;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-10\">5. Shock, fright, mental anguish or mental injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-11\">6. Assault and battery, committed by, at the discretion of, or with the consent of a COVERED PARTY, for the purpose of protecting persons from injury, death, or property from damage. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">\u00b619 The Town claims that coverage here falls under subsection 3 of the personal injury provision of the policy regarding the \u201cpublication or utterance of a libel or slander.\u201d The Town maintains that in \u00b6 20 of its Complaint, AK \u201ccontends the Mayor disparaged the quality of AK\u2019s personal property used in the project.\u201d Contrary to the Town\u2019s assertions, \u00b6 20 does no such thing; there is no mention in \u00b6 20 of the Complaint of any actions on the part of the Mayor. Instead, \u00b6 20 refers to actions taken by Delta, the project engineer, in setting out items that had yet to be completed by AK under the contract, and items that did not comply with the terms of the contract. Furthermore, nowhere in the Complaint does AK contend that the Mayor \u201cdisparaged\u201d AK\u2019s personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-13\">\u00b620  Consequently, we hold that defense of this claim is excluded under the breach of contract provision of the Town\u2019s policy with MMIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-14\">\n<em>Count Two-Negligent Misrepresentation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ARO\">\u00b621 The Town argues that AK\u2019s claim for negligent misrepresentation relies on a claimed misstatement and improper conduct by the Mayor and that the claim is a tort. In support of this proposition, the Town relies on a previous statement of this Court that negligent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>misrepresentation requires the \u201cintent to induce reliance on a representation without any reasonable ground to believe that it is true. In other words, it requires <em>negligence </em>not <em>intent.\u201d Tripp v. Jeld-Wen, Inc., </em>2005 MT 121, \u00b6 30, 327 Mont. 146, \u00b6 30, 112 P.3d 1018, \u00b6 30 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-3\">\u00b622 Moreover, the Town alleges that this claim falls under the public official\u2019s errors and omissions coverage under its policy with MMIA. Public official\u2019s errors or omissions is defined in Section V.R. of Form A as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-4\">\u201cPublic Officials Errors and Omissions\u201d-means any act, omission, neglect, or breach of duty, including nonfeasance, misfeasance, and malfeasance by the COVERED PARTY in the discharge of their duties with the Entity, but shall not mean or include Bodily Injury, Personal Injury, or Property Damage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The Town contends that AK\u2019s Complaint is \u201creplete with allegations of the Mayor\u2019s alleged improper actions, misconduct and failure to act when a duty to act is alleged to have existed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\u00b623 According to the Town, this count in AK\u2019s Complaint alleges that the Mayor represented that the Town would pay for the work performed when the Town had no intention of paying, and that the Mayor made this representation when she knew or should have known that it was not true. However, no such allegation appears in AK\u2019s Complaint. Instead, Count Two was based upon the Mayor\u2019s request for work to be done and her offer that the Town would pay for it, a claim that is factually based in contract. Count Two of the Complaint is nothing more than allegations that the contract was modified by the Mayor\u2019s request for the work to be done and an actual or implied promise to pay for that work.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\u00b624  We have repeatedly held that it is the acts giving rise to the complaint which form the basis for coverage, not the complaint\u2019s legal theories or eonelusory language. <em>Travelers Cas. v. Ribi Immunochem Research, </em>2005 MT 50, \u00b6 40, 326 Mont. 174, \u00b6 40, 108 P.3d 469, \u00b6 40; <em>Trustees, Missoula Cty. Sch. v. P.E.I.C., </em>263 Mont. 121, 128, 866 P.2d 1118, 1122 (1993); <em>New Hampshire Ins. Group v. Strecker, </em>244 Mont. 478, 482, 798 P.2d 130, 132 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">\u00b625 The alleged negligent misrepresentations in Count Two of AK\u2019s Complaint are the same request for work and offer to pay which created the Town\u2019s contract with AK. Thus, the factual basis for Count Two is the Town\u2019s contract with AK, and, as such, defense of this claim is excluded under the Town\u2019s policy with MMIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>\n<em>Count Three-Constructive Fraud</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\u00b626 The constructive fraud count in AK\u2019s Complaint is only two sentences long. The first sentence incorporates the prior paragraphs of the Complaint by reference, and the second sentence alleges that the \u201cmisleading behavior described above constitutes constructive fraud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Avt\">\u00b627 On appeal, the Town maintains that Count Three alleges \u201cmisleading behavior\u201d by the Mayor and that this claim sounds in tort, not contract. However, \u201cmisleading behavior\u201d is merely a conclusory phrase. AK simply realleges in Count Three the facts previously pled in its first two counts. Moreover, AK does not set forth any facts in Count Three illustrating what the \u201cmisleading behavior\u201d is or how those facts could be considered constructive fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\u00b628 In Montana, constructive fraud is defined in \u00a7 28-2-406, MCA, as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">(1) any breach of duty which, without an actually fraudulent intent, gains an advantage to the person in fault or anyone claiming under him by misleading another to his prejudice or to the prejudice of anyone claiming under him; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">(2) any such act or omission as the law especially declares to be fraudulent, without respect to actual fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">A party asserting a claim of actual fraud must establish the following nine elements to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of actual fraud:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">(1) a representation; (2) the falsity of that representation; (3) the materiality of the representation; (4) the speaker\u2019s knowledge of the representation\u2019s falsity or ignorance of its truth; (5) the speaker\u2019s intent that the representation should be acted upon by the person and in the manner reasonably contemplated; (6) the hearer\u2019s ignorance of the representation\u2019s falsity; (7) the hearer\u2019s reliance upon the truth of the representation; (8) the hearer\u2019s right to rely upon the representation; and (9) the hearer\u2019s consequent and proximate injury or damages caused by their reliance on the representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-10\"><em>In re Estate of Kindsfather, 2005 </em>MT 51, \u00b6 17, 326 Mont. 192, \u00b6 17, 108 P.3d 487, \u00b6 17 (citing <em>State ex rel.

Armstrong, </em>244 Mont. 289, 293, 798 P.2d 84, 87 (1990)). While a claim of constructive fraud requires similar proof, a plaintiff \u201cneed not prove the fifth element relating to intent to deceive or dishonesty of purpose.\u201d <em>Berg, </em>279 Mont. at 175-76, 927 P.2d at 983 (citing <em>Davis, </em>258 Mont. at 293, 852 P.2d at 644; <em>Lee, </em>244 Mont. at 294, 798 P.2d at 88).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>\u00b629 In addition, M. R. Civ. P. 9(b) requires that \u201c[i]n all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.\u201d Here, AK did not state with particularity the circumstances constituting constructive fraud. As previously noted, the constructive fraud count in AK\u2019s Complaint is only two sentences long with the first sentence simply incorporating the prior paragraphs of the Complaint by reference, and the second sentence simply alleging that the \u201cmisleading behavior described above constitutes constructive fraud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\">\u00b630  As noted previously in this Opinion, an insurer must look to the allegations in the complaint to determine if coverage exists under the policy, thus giving rise to a duty to defend. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 11 (citing <em>Rumph, </em>\u00b6 14). Here, AK\u2019s inadequately pled claim of constructive fraud does not give rise to a duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">\u00b631 Furthermore, we also stated in this Opinion that constructive fraud requires a breach of duty. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 28 (citing \u00a7 28-2-406, MCA). In this case, the Mayor modified the contract by requesting that additional work be done, thus any duty the Mayor owed to AK arose from the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\u00b632 Once again, the factual basis for Count Three is the Town\u2019s contract with AK and defense of this claim is excluded under the Town\u2019s policy with MMIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">\u00b633  Because the claims in AK\u2019s Complaint against the Town are all grounded in contract, we hold that the District Court did not err in concluding that MMIA did not have a duty to defend and indemnify the Town based on the breach of contract exclusion in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">\u00b634 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b295-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-7\"> No argument was raised in the case <em>subjudice </em>that the insurer must consider facts or information outside the Complaint in order to determine coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b295-10\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"Atk\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">\u00b635 I dissent. I would liberally construe the allegations set forth in AK\u2019s Complaint, as <em>Staples </em>requires that we do, and remand with directions that MMIA assume the defense of the Town in the underlying action.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">\u00b636 In its Complaint, AK alleges that the Mayor instructed it to perform work beyond the scope of the contract. I disagree with this Court\u2019s conclusion that the allegations against the Mayor are subsumed within the breach of contract case. For one thing, the Mayor herself was not a party to the contract. While the Complaint is not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>model of draftsmanship, it does clearly assert that AK relied upon the representations of the Mayor to the effect that the Town would pay for the additional work the Mayor requested, and that the Mayor made such representations when the Town had no intention of paying for the extra work. Moreover, AK clearly asserts that it relied upon these representations to its detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\u00b637 The Court concludes that, notwithstanding the allegations of the Complaint, all of the claims contained therein are actually grounded in contract, and therefore there is no duty to defend. \u00b6 33. The Court is too categorical. Although there are clearly breach of contract claims asserted, tort claims are raised as well. In <em>Garden City Floral Co. v. Hunt, </em>126 Mont. 537, 255 P.2d 352 (1953), we noted that \u201cthe dividing line between breaches of contract and torts often lies in a twilight zone, where it is difficult to determine whether the case applies strictly to the one or to the other.\u201d <em>Hunt, </em>126 Mont. at 543, 255 P.2d at 356. I submit that under such circumstances, until the \u201cdividing line\u201d is clearly identified through discovery, the insurer has the duty to defend the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\u00b638 <em>In Staples, </em>we said: \u201cWhen a court compares allegations of liability advanced in a complaint with policy language to determine whether the insurer\u2019s obligation to defend was \u2018triggered,\u2019 a court must liberally construe allegations in the complaint so that all doubts about the meaning of the allegations are resolved in favor of finding that the obligation to defend was activated. Unless there exists an unequivocal demonstration that the claim against an insured does not fall within the insurance policy\u2019s coverage, an insurer has a duty to defend.\u201d <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 22 (internal citations omitted). We further noted that so long as the complaint raises allegations which, if proved, represent a covered risk, the duty to defend is imposed. <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 21. In my judgment, the Court here has wrongly construed the allegations of the Complaint in favor of the insurer so as to prematurely foreclose the duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">\u00b639 I would conclude that the Complaint sufficiently alleged facts that, if proven, would represent a covered risk. I would therefore reverse and remand with instructions that the insurer assume the defense of the underlying action, with a determination to be made later as to whether there is an obligation to indemnify. I respectfully dissent from our refusal to do so.</p>\n<judges id=\"b296-7\">JUSTICE LEAPHART joins the Dissent of JUSTICE COTTER.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
