Mike McGrath, Montana Attorney General; Mark W.

The Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County, accepted the plea agreement and imposed the recommended sentence, subject to several probation conditions. Hunter appeals two of his probation conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court abused its discretion when it imposed the alcohol-related conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\u00b63 In October 2006, Hunter altered a Percocet prescription so he could \u201cget more for the pain [he] was in at the time.\u201d He attempted to fill the prescription at the Costco pharmacy in Kalispell. Suspecting the prescription was a fake, the pharmacist called the doctor\u2019s office and verified the prescription was a forgery. After the police were called, Hunter admitted he forged the prescription.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">\u00b64 Hunter entered into a plea agreement with the State in which he agreed to plead guilty in exchange for a recommended deferred sentence of two years. At the sentencing hearing, the presentence investigation report (PSI) showed Hunter was cited in 2005 in Colorado for driving with a .06 blood alcohol content and in 1997 in Washington for a \u201cpublic disturbance.\u201d It recommended Hunter not possess or consume intoxicants-that is, drugs and alcohol-and that he submit to chemical testing for drugs and alcohol. Hunter admits to occasional past marijuana use, but states he has no history of alcohol abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">\u00b65 Hunter\u2019s counsel objected to the imposition of alcohol-related conditions. The District Court imposed the PSI\u2019s recommended conditions and entered judgment. Hunter appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">\u00b66 We review probation conditions for both legality and reasonableness. <em>State v. Ashby, </em>2008 MT 83, \u00b6 9, 342 Mont. 187, \u00b6 9, 179 P.3d 1164, \u00b6 9. Generally, a probation condition is legal if it falls within statutory parameters. <em>State v. Herd, </em>2004 MT 85, \u00b6 24, 320 Mont. 490, \u00b6 24, 87 P.3d 1017, \u00b6 24. If a condition is illegal, or exceeds statutory parameters, this Court will review the sentence even if the defendant failed to object to the sentence in the trial court. <em>State v. Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. 338, 343, 602 P.2d 997, 1000 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">\u00b67 In addition to explicit statutory sentencing parameters, a district court is authorized to impose on deferred or suspended sentences any reasonable condition necessary for rehabilitation or the protection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>the victim or society. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 9; \u00a7 46-18-201(4), MCA. For a condition to be reasonable, it must have <em>\u201ca </em>nexus to either the offense for which the offender is being sentenced, or to the offender himself or herself.\u201d <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 15. If the defendant contends that the nexus between the offender or offense and the condition is inadequate, the challenge is that the condition is \u201cobjectionable\u201d rather than illegal. <em>State v. Hameline, </em>2008 MT 241, \u00b6 12, 344 Mont. 461, \u00b6 12, 188 P.3d 1052, \u00b6 12. Objectionable conditions must be objected to in the trial court to qualify for appellate review. <em>State v. Kotwicki, </em>2007 MT 17, \u00b6 21, 335 Mont. 344, \u00b6 21, 151 P.3d 892, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\u00b68 Here, as noted above, Hunter\u2019s counsel objected to the alcohol-related conditions. Thus, notwithstanding Hunter\u2019s assertions that the conditions are illegal, the challenge is to objectionable conditions. We review the reasonableness of the probation conditions for an abuse of discretion. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\u00b69 A sufficient offense-related nexus can exist when the offense is indirectly connected to the condition. For example, in <em>State v. Greensweight, </em>2008 MT 185, \u00b6\u00b6 19-21, 343 Mont. 474, \u00b6\u00b6 19-21, 187 P.3d 613, \u00b6\u00b6 19-21, a connection existed between the offense of theft and chemical testing conditions because the defendant used the money he stole for rent and bills-money he lacked because of his drug habit. We also have held a sufficient nexus existed between the offense of sexual assault and intoxicant-based conditions because the defendant had been immersed in a drug environment during the time of the assault and his stated reason for the assault was being excluded from doing drugs with his family. <em>In re D.A.S., </em>2008 MT 168, \u00b6 12, 343 Mont. 360, \u00b6 12, 184 P.3d 349, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\u00b610 Further, a nexus exists between drug-related offenses and conditions related to alcohol, including chemical testing. We held the purposes of rehabilitating the defendant and protecting society were served by the imposition of alcohol-related conditions on defendants\u2019 sentences for possessing methamphetamine and marijuana-both dangerous drugs. <em>State </em>v. <em>Winkel, </em>2008 MT 89, \u00b6\u00b6 14-16, 342 Mont. 267, \u00b6\u00b6 14-16, 182 P.3d 54, \u00b6\u00b6 14-16; <em>State v. DeSchazo, </em>2008 MT 131, \u00b6 12, 343 Mont. 77, \u00b6 12, 183 P.3d 47, \u00b6 12. \u201cThe drug-related nature of [the defendant's offense alone suffices as a sufficient nexus to this condition.\u201d <em>Winkel, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">\u00b611  In the present case, Hunter\u2019s offense was fraudulently obtaining dangerous drugs. Forging a prescription to obtain a dangerous drug, rather than renewing a prescription through legal channels, is indicative of dependency. Prohibiting and monitoring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Hunter\u2019s consumption of both alcohol and drugs will help prevent him from \u201c\u2018repeat[ing] the same criminal conduct that gave rise to the sentence.\u2019\u201d <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 14 (quoting <em>State v. Ommundson, </em>1999 MT 16, \u00b6 11, 293 Mont. 133, \u00b6 11, 974 P.2d 620, \u00b6 11). Consequently, we conclude a sufficient nexus exists between Hunter\u2019s offense and the alcohol-related conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">\u00b612 We hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the alcohol-related conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">\u00b613 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b178-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, LEAPHART, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
