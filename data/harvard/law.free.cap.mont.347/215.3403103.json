We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">\u00b62 We consider the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">\u00b63 1. Does admission of Schneider\u2019s statements concerning his involvement in a murder, made to law enforcement officers during a custodial interrogation, conducted outside the presence of counsel appointed for Schneider on a different charge, violate Schneider\u2019s state constitutional rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">\u00b64 2. Does application of the <em>Cobb </em>\u201coffense-specific\u201d test violate Schneider\u2019s right to equal protection under state and federal constitutional law?</p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">\u00b65 On February 22,2004, Schneider and his companion, Lee Cowan (Cowan), were stopped and questioned by authorities in Pima County, Arizona, while trying to gain entrance to Mexico. Thereafter, Cowan confessed to murdering his mother and her boyfriend in Gallatin County, Montana. Authorities arrested both men.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">\u00b66 At the time of the arrest, Schneider was on probation for felony theft in the Fifth Judicial District Court, Madison County, Montana. As a condition of Schneider\u2019s probation, he was prohibited from leaving Montana without his probation officer\u2019s permission. Schneider had not sought permission to leave Montana before departing for Mexico with Cowan. As a result, the Madison County Attorney\u2019s Office filed a petition to revoke Schneider\u2019s deferred sentence on the ground that Schneider had \u201cleft his assigned district without the written permission of his supervising officer.\u201d An arrest warrant was issued on February 23, 2004, and on that same day, in response to the warrant, Arizona filed an \u201cinterim complaint\u201d against Schneider in Pima County Superior Court, charging him with the crime of being a fugitive from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>justice pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13-3842. Schneider appeared in Pima County Superior Court and was appointed a public defender, Verne Hill (Hill), to represent him. Schneider met with Hill two days later on February 25, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\u00b67 The next day, while still in custody in Arizona, law enforcement officers from the Gallatin County Sheriffs Office, the Pima County Sheriffs Office, and the Montana Division of Criminal Investigation interrogated Schneider regarding the Cowan murders. At the time of the interrogation, the officers were uncertain about Schneider\u2019s involvement with the murders. The officers initiated the interrogation and did not contact or seek permission to do so from Hill. However, before questioning Schneider, the officers advised Schneider of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Schneider waived those rights both orally and in writing, and did not indicate a desire for the assistance of counsel at any time during the questioning, wherein he made incriminating statements regarding his involvement with the Cowan murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\u00b68 On April 2, 2004, based on the incriminating statements made during the interrogation and in conjunction with other evidence obtained by law enforcement, the State charged Schneider with two counts of accountability for deliberate homicide. On October 6, 2004, Schneider moved to suppress the statements he made during the Arizona interrogation. After briefing and a hearing, the District Court denied Schneider\u2019s motion, primarily in reliance on the United States Supreme Court decision of <em>Texas v. Cobb, </em>532 U.S. 162, 121 S. Ct. 1335 (2001). Schneider then pled guilty to the accountability charges, reserving the right to appeal the District Court\u2019s order denying his motion to suppress. The court sentenced Schneider to two consecutive 100 year sentences. Schneider appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">\u00b69 We review the denial of a motion to suppress to determine if the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous, and whether its interpretation and application of the law is correct. <em>State v. Pierce, </em>2005 MT 182, \u00b6 12, 328 Mont. 33, \u00b6 12, 116 P.3d 817, \u00b6 12. Findings of fact are clearly erroneous if they are unsupported by substantial evidence, the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or review of the record convinces us that a mistake has been made. <em>Pierce, </em>\u00b6 12. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law and interpretations of the constitution <em>de novo. State v. Mizenko, </em>2006 MT 11, \u00b6 8, 330 Mont. 299, \u00b6 8, 127 P.3d 458, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b610 1. Does admission of Schneider\u2019s statements concerning his involvement in a murder, made to law enforcement officers during a custodial interrogation, conducted outside the presence of counsel appointed for Schneider on a different charge, violate Schneider\u2019s state constitutional rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b611 Schneider argues that law enforcement officers violated his Article II, Section 24 right to counsel under the Montana Constitution when they interrogated him about the Cowan murders during his Arizona confinement, without informing or seeking the permission of the attorney appointed to represent him on the Arizona fugitive from justice charge. Acknowledging that the United States Supreme Court rejected such a claim in <em>Cobb, </em>Schneider \u201crequests this Court ... provide more protections to the citizens of the State of Montana than that provided by the United States Constitution\u201d by interpreting Article II, Section 24 as more expansive than the corresponding Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Schneider contends that the \u201coffense specific\u201d application of the Sixth Amendment by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Cobb </em>to determine when the right to counsel attaches is \u201cproblematic\u201d and \u201cfraught with problems,\u201d and asks us to apply a \u201cfactually related test to issues concerning appointment of counsel\u201d under Article II, Section 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u00b612 In <em>Cobb, </em>Cobb was arrested and charged with burglary. Over a year later, police arrested Cobb based on a tip that he had murdered a woman and her daughter who had been missing since the burglary. During a custodial interrogation, outside the presence of Cobb\u2019s counsel for the burglary charge, Cobb confessed to the murders. Cobb sought to suppress his confession as a violation of the Sixth Amendment, arguing that the burglary and the murders were closely factually related such that his Sixth Amendment right, which had attached for the burglary charge, also attached for purposes of the murder investigation, making the interrogation without his counsel unlawful. <em>Cobb, </em>532 U.S. at 165-67, 121 S. Ct. at 1339-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\u00b613 The United States Supreme Court, Chief Justice Rehnquist writing, reaffirmed its earlier determination that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is \u201coffense specific,\u201d meaning that it only applies with respect to the charged offense and \u201cit cannot be invoked once for all future prosecutions ....\u201d <em>Cobb, </em>532 U.S. at 167, 121 S. Ct. at 1340 (citing <em>McNeil v. Wis., </em>501 U.S. 171, 175, 111 S. Ct. 2204, 2207 (1991)). Accordingly, the Court held that statements, which result from a defendant\u2019s un-counseled interrogation regarding offenses for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>the defendant has <em>not </em>been charged, are \u201cadmissible notwithstanding the attachment of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel on other charged offenses,\u201d and despite the fact that the defendant\u2019s counsel for the charged offense may not have been present at, or informed of, the interrogation. <em>Cobb, </em>532 U.S. at 168, 121 S. Ct. at 1340. However, the Court also recognized that, while the Sixth Amendment attaches only to charged offenses, \u201cthe definition of an \u2018offense\u2019 is not necessarily limited to the four corners of a charging instrument.\u201d <em>Cobb, </em>501 U.S. at 173, 111 S. Ct. at 1343. Rather, after the Sixth Amendment has attached, it \u201cencompass[es] offenses that, even if not formally charged, would be considered the same offense under the <em>Blockburger </em>test.\u201d <em>Cobb, </em>501 U.S. at 173, 111 S. Ct. at 1343. Thus, to define the term \u201coffense\u201d for purposes of the Sixth Amendment, the Supreme Court applied the definition of that term used in double jeopardy jurisprudence, noting that there was \u201cno constitutional difference between the meaning of the term \u2018offense\u2019 in the contexts of double jeopardy and of the right to counsel.\u201d <em>Cobb, </em>532 U.S. at 173, 121 S. Ct. at 1343; <em>see also Blockburger v. U.S., </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S. Ct. 180 (1932). Therefore, under the Sixth Amendment, \u201c\u2018where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u2019\u201d <em>Cobb, </em>532 U.S. at 173, 121 S. Ct. at 1343 (quoting <em>Blockburger, </em>284 U.S. at 304, 52 S. Ct. at 182).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Justice Breyer, joined by Justices Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg, dissented from the majority opinion. Lamenting the application of the <em>Blockburger </em>test, the dissent supported adoption of a \u201cclosely factually related\u201d test sought by Cobb. <em>Cobb, </em>532 U.S. at 186, 121 S. Ct. at 1350. The dissent asserted that the <em>Cobb </em>holding would permit the State, by simply charging only one of many possible offenses, to question nearly every person charged without first contacting counsel. <em>Cobb, </em>532 U.S. at 182-83, 121 S. Ct. at 1348-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\u00b614 Schneider urges that we interpret Article II, Section 24 more expansively than the United States Constitution\u2019s Sixth Amendment. He premises his argument upon Justice Breyer\u2019s dissent in <em>Cobb, </em>urging that \u201c[a]doption of the dissent\u2019s test in <em>Cobb </em>would give effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>to the plain language of Montana\u2019s Constitution and still preserve law enforcement\u2019s right to conduct interrogations in appropriate situations.\u201d The State asks that we reject Schneider\u2019s argument that a different outcome should result from application of the Montana Constitution. Unfortunately, the State offers little analysis regarding the possibility that the Montana constitutional right to counsel may not perfectly align with the federal constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\u00b615 Schneider notes correctly that \u201cthis Court has refused to march lock step with decisions of the United States Supreme Court.\u201d <em>See Woirhaye v. Mont. Fourth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>1998 MT 320, \u00b6 14, 292 Mont. 185, \u00b6 14, 972 P.2d 800, \u00b6 14 (\u201cwe have refused to \u2018march lock-step\u2019 with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of corresponding provisions in the federal constitution\u201d). Although we consider federal authority and have concluded that the Montana Constitution provides equivalent protections or analytical frameworks as the United States Constitution in some instances,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we nonetheless conduct an independent review to determine the separate and particular intent of the framers of the Montana Constitution. That intent is first to be \u201cdetermined from the plain meaning of the words used.\u201d <em>Woirhaye, </em>\u00b6 15. Where the meaning cannot be determined entirely from the plain wording, we consider the relevant legislative intent, which in the case of constitutional interpretation is the 1972 Constitutional Convention. <em>Kottel v. State, </em>2002 MT 278, \u00b6 9, 312 Mont. 387, \u00b6 9, 60 P.3d 403, \u00b6 9. We look to relevant precedent that has already interpreted the provision at issue. <em>Kottel, </em>\u00b6 9. We may also be guided by federal precedent. <em>Quigg, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u00b616 Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution is Montana\u2019s counterpart to the United States Constitution\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel. This section states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">Section 24. Rights of the accused. In all criminal prosecutions the accused shall have the right to appear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>defend in person and by counsel; to demand the nature and cause of the accusation; to meet the witnesses against him face to face; to have process to compel the attendance of witnesses in his behalf, and a speedy public trial by an impartial jury of the county or district in which the offense is alleged to have been committed, subject to the right of the state to have a change of venue for any of the causes for which the defendant may obtain the same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEz\">Schneider argues that the right to counsel under this provision should attach earlier in the criminal process than the \u201coffense specific\u201d Sixth Amendment would attach. He urges that this Court \u201cshould recognize the right to counsel attached at the time Mr. Schneider was appointed an attorney on February 23, 2004, and from that point forward the State should only have been permitted to interview Mr. Schneider concerning closely factually related matters with his counsel present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AVt\">\u00b617 The plain language of Section 24 does not expressly indicate at what point in time the right to counsel attaches. However, the language does expressly provide, both in the title and within the provision, that the rights to be protected are those belonging to \u201cthe accused.\u201d Further, the provision enumerates the rights of the accused which are protected, all of which apply within the context of formal \u201ccriminal prosecutions,\u201d a term used in the provision. <em>See State v. Reavley, </em>2003 MT 298, \u00b6 45, 318 Mont. 150, \u00b6 45, 79 P.3d 270, \u00b6 45 (right to counsel not violated because defendant \u201cwas not an \u2018accused\u2019 and there was no \u2018criminal prosecution\u2019 \u201d). These provisions are consistent with the characteristics of the Sixth Amendment right.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b618 This consistency is reflected in the deliberations on Article II, Section 24 duringthe 1972 Constitutional Convention, which indicated an intention on the part of the delegates to align Section 24 with the Sixth Amendment. The Bill of Rights Committee unanimously adopted Section 24, explaining that the Committee \u201cfelt [that Section 24] was an admirable statement of the fundamental procedural rights of an accused.\u201d Montana Constitutional Convention, Committee Proposals, Feb. 23, 1972, p. 641. Delegate James informed the Convention that \u201cthis section is basically the same as Article VI in the Bill of Rights in the federal Constitution adopted in 1791.\u201d Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 9, 1972, p. 1776. He further explained that Section 24 was the identical provision to Section 16 of the 1889 Constitution and that the Bill of Rights Committee had offered no changes because it \u201chas stood the test of time... [and] should be adopted as is.\u201d Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 9,1972, p. 1776. The convention transcripts reveal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>no dissatisfaction with the Sixth Amendment nor demonstrate any intention on the part of the convention delegates to expand Section 24 beyond the scope and purpose of the Sixth Amendment. Rather, specific comparison to the Sixth Amendment was made in adopting Section 24. Thus, it is particularly appropriate that we look to federal authority interpreting the Sixth Amendment for guidance. <em>Quigg, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"ALVe\">\u00b6 19 The Sixth Amendment provides that \u201cin all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right... to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. The Sixth Amendment right to counsel has been held not to attach until adversarial judicial proceedings are commenced by the state and, as it applies only to the charged offense, it is \u201coffense specific.\u201d <em>McNeil, </em>501 U.S. at 175, 111 S. Ct. at 2207; <em>see also U.S. v. Percy, </em>250 F.3d 720, 725 (9th Cir. 2001). After the right attaches and has been invoked, police may not question an accused about the crime for which he has been charged without first seeking permission from his appointed counsel. <em>McNeil, </em>501 U.S. at 175, 111 S. Ct. at 2207.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">\u00b620 The United States Supreme Court has noted that the \u201ccore purpose\u201d of the right to counsel contained in the Sixth Amendment is to \u201cassure aid at trial....\u201d <em>U.S. v. Gouveia, </em>467 U.S. 180, 188-89, 104 S. Ct. 2292, 2298 (1984). It has explained that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel secures a trial-based right, intended to ensure fairness in the adversarial process by minimizing any inherent advantages which might exist on the side of the state when it prosecutes an average non-law educated defendant. <em>See Strickland v. Wash., </em>466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 2063-64 (1984); <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 462-63, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 1022 (1938); <em>Powell v. Ala., </em>287 U.S. 45, 68-69, 53 S. Ct. 55, 64 (1932). The Supreme Court has extended the Sixth Amendment to what it calls \u201ccritical pretrial proceedings,\u201d including post-charge interrogations, and the Court\u2019s rationale for doing so demonstrates that the Sixth Amendment right remains grounded in formal adversarial proceedings. The Court has explained that extension of the Sixth Amendment is necessary where \u201c \u2018the accused [is] confronted, just as at trial, by the procedural system, or by his expert adversary, or by both,\u2019 in a situation where the results of the confrontation \u2018might well settle the accused\u2019s fate and reduce the trial itself to a mere formality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gouveia, </em>467 U.S. at 189, 104 S. Ct. at 2298 (alteration in original) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u00b621 We have been guided by federal authority in our right to counsel cases. Noting, in <em>Reavley, </em>that Montana law regarding when the right to counsel attaches \u201chas not always been consistent,\u201d we explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>\u201c[h]owever, the standard in Montana is <em>now clear and consistent with federal law </em>as enunciated in <em>Hayes.\u201d Reavley, </em>\u00b6 40 (emphasis added). <em>Reavley </em>explained the <em>Hayes </em>analysis of the Sixth Amendment right as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-4\">\u201cThe Sixth Amendment right to counsel does not attach until after the initiation of formal charges.\u201d <em>Hayes, </em>231 F.3d at 667; <em>Moran v. Burbine </em>(1986), 475 U.S. 412, 431, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 1146, 89 L. Ed. 2d 410, 427; <em>Kirby v. Illinois </em>(1972), 406 U.S. 682, 688, 92 S. Ct. 1877, 1881, 32 L. Ed. 2d 411, 417; <em>United States v. Gouveia </em>(1984), 467 U.S. 180, 185, 104 S. Ct. 2292, 2296, 81 L. Ed. 2d 146, 152. There must be both a \u201ccriminal prosecution\u201d and an \u201caccused\u201d in order for the Sixth Amendment right to attach. <em>Hayes, </em>231 F.3d at 669. Adversarial judicial proceedings must be formally initiated. <em>Hayes, </em>231 F.3d at 672 (citations omitted). Being the target of an investigation is not the equivalent to being formally charged with an offense and is insufficient to trigger the right to counsel. <em>Hayes, </em>231 F.3d at 674 (citations omitted). The existence of an attorney-client relationship itself is insufficient to trigger the Sixth Amendment protections. <em>Hayes, </em>231 F.3d at 671 (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-5\"><em>Reavley, </em>\u00b6 39. The <em>Hayes </em>Court re-emphasized that there must be both a \u201ccriminal prosecution\u201d and an \u201caccused\u201d in order for the Sixth Amendment to attach, and that the existence of an attorney-client relationship is insufficient by itself to trigger the protections of the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">\u00b622 <em>In Reavley, </em>which Schneider attempts to distinguish, we likewise found the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Moran <em>v. Burbine, </em>475 U.S. 412, 106 S. Ct. 1135 (1986), instructive. Reavley was interviewed by the police regarding two homicides. On the same day as the interview police were notified that Reavley had consulted counsel after leaving the station. The following day, Reavley\u2019s former girlfriend, in cooperation with the police, met with Reavley at a local hotel and recorded their conversation, during which Reavley made potentially incriminating statements. Shortly thereafter, Reavley was charged with two counts of murder in the first degree and the State sought to use the statements at trial. In reversing the district court\u2019s suppression of this evidence, we quoted with approval the consequences of the offense specific Sixth Amendment right:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">If proceedings have begun, \u201cthe government may not deliberately elicit incriminating statements from an accused out of the presence of counsel\u201d and any evidence so elicited will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>inadmissible. <em>Moran, </em>475 U.S. at 431, 106 S. Ct. at 1146 .... However, if proceedings have not been initiated, evidence obtained in exactly the same manner from the identical suspect would be admissible at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><em>Reavley, </em>\u00b6 44. Applying <em>Moran, </em>we concluded that Reavley\u2019s right to counsel was not violated because, despite the fact that Reavley obtained counsel for the potential charges for which he was under investigation, proceedings had not yet been initiated and therefore the right to counsel had not attached at the time he made the incriminating statements. <em>Reavley, </em>\u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\u00b623 Consequently, the wording of the text of Section 24, the Convention delegates\u2019 expressed intent, and our case law all demonstrate that the right to counsel under the Montana Constitution is a trial-based right which is consistent with the right provided by Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution. As such, the Montana right applies with respect to an offense when prosecution has been commenced for that offense, \u201ccannot be invoked once for all future prosecutions,\u201d and is \u201coffense specific.\u201d <em>McNeil, </em>501 U.S. at 175, 111 S. Ct. at 2207. The right also attaches for other \u201coffenses\u201d connected to the original offense under the Sixth Amendment analysis provided by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Cobb.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">\u00b624 Schneider argues that we should reject the United States Supreme Court\u2019s analysis, specifically its application of the <em>Blockburger </em>test, and expand the definition of \u201coffense\u201d by implementing a \u201cfactually related\u201d test mirroring Justice Breyer\u2019s dissent in <em>Cobb, </em>and thus grant him relief. Schneider argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">The majority\u2019s decision in <em>Cobb </em>really ignores the present day realities of the criminal justice system. It allows the prosecutor to sidestep fundamental rights of the poor and incarcerated persons, and almost renders meaningless representation by counsel at one of the critical stages of the proceeding... [T]he only workable rule for the question being raised in this case is the factually related test. The reason being because Appellant was questioned about a charge that could not be separated from the crime for which he had already been appointed counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">Schneider asserts that Arizona prosecutors charged him with being a fugitive from justice for the sole purpose of securing his detention so that he could be interrogated regarding his role in the Cowan murders. He argues that this technique was used in bad faith and is the primary evil which results from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s definition of \u201coffense.\u201d Accordingly, Schneider asserts that we should not follow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>the Supreme Court\u2019s lead in defining \u201coffense\u201d for the purposes of Section 24 because law enforcement will engage in \u201cdubious conduct\u201d and \u201cpick and choose when and how to charge a Defendant simply to avoid the protections afforded by Montana\u2019s Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">\u00b625 We note that Schneider\u2019s arguments against application of the <em>Blockburger </em>test, as just summarized, are policy-grounded. He asks this Court to adopt the factually related test because of the opportunities for abuse by law enforcement which he sees within the <em>Blockburger </em>test, and the corresponding deprivation of constitutional rights which could be occasioned by such abuse. Policy arguments surrounding this issue were made in <em>Cobb </em>and both sides offer such arguments here.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">\u00b626 The <em>Cobb </em>Court rejected the policy arguments offered in support of the factually related test. \u201cRespondent predicts that the offense-specific rule will prove \u2018disastrous\u2019 to suspects\u2019 constitutional rights and will \u2018permit law enforcement officers almost complete and total license to conduct unwanted and uncounseled interrogations.\u2019\u201d <em>Cobb, </em>532 U.S. at 171, 121 S. Ct. at 1342. The Court noted that there was \u201cno evidence that such a parade of horribles has occurred\u201d since the Court\u2019s earlier decision on this issue in <em>McNeil, </em>and that Cobb had failed to appreciate two considerations: that Fifth Amendment protections \u201cagainst compulsory self-incrimination and to consult with an attornejr\u201d continued to protect the rights of individuals during custodial investigations, and that \u201cthe Constitution does not negate societys interest in the ability of police to talk to witnesses and suspects, even those who have been charged with other offenses.\u201d <em>Cobb, </em>532 U.S. at 171-72, 121 S. Ct. at 1342-43. The Court explained that police are often unaware of the \u201csequence and scope of events they are investigating[,]\u201d making a factually related test impracticable because it would deter police from questioning suspects for fear that they would violate the Sixth Amendment guarantees. <em>Cobb, </em>532 U.S. at 173-74, 121 S. Ct. at 1343-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">\u00b627 We are not persuaded that Schneider\u2019s policy arguments have undermined the responses provided by the United States Supreme Court in rejecting the similar arguments in <em>Cobb, </em>or that the potential that law enforcement may act in bad faith necessitates adoption of his factually related test defining \u201coffense\u201d for purposes of Section 24. Like Cobb, Schneider has offered no evidence to support his contentions. Further, similar to Cobb\u2019s arguments, Schneider\u2019s arguments fail to acknowledge that officers cannot validly interrogate a defendant in a custodial setting without first warning him or her of the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>counsel contained in the Fifth Amendment and Section 25. Whether counsel is present or not, a defendant must waive his Fifth Amendment and Section 25 rights before his statements may be validly obtained. This is exactly what happened here. Schneider waived, both orally and in writing, his Fifth Amendment and Section 25 rights prior to the interrogation, and at no later time did he assert his right to remain silent or have an attorney present. Neither has Schneider challenged the validity of his waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. \u201cWe ought to question the wisdom of a judge-made preventative rule to protect a suspect\u2019s desire not to speak when it cannot be shown that he had that intent.\u201d <em>Cobb, </em>532 U.S. at 176, 121 S. Ct. at 1345 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Schneider clearly intended and voluntarily chose to talk to law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">\u00b628 Having disposed of Schneider\u2019s above-referenced arguments, we decline to analyze his proposed factually related test further. Schneider offers additional argument which relies upon our application of Section 24 in <em>State v. Johnson, </em>221 Mont. 503, 719 P.2d 1248 (1986). However, we overruled <em>Johnson </em>on this point in <em>State v. Buck, </em>2006 MT 81, \u00b6 47, 331 Mont. 517, \u00b6 47, 134 P.3d 53, \u00b6 47, wherein we explained that <em>Johnson </em>incorrectly relied upon Section 24 as a basis for its holding, and should have relied upon Section 25. <em>Buck, </em>\u00b6 47. Thus, <em>Johnson </em>cannot support Schneider\u2019s Section 24 arguments in favor of adoption of a factually related test. Whether there are additional legal arguments which would require adoption of an alternative definition of \u201coffense\u201d for purposes of Section 24 must therefore wait for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\u00b629  As a secondary matter Schneider asserts that, regardless of our resolution of the above issues, certain statements he made during the murder interrogation concerned the Arizona fugitive from justice charge, and should be suppressed under either the Sixth Amendment or \u201csame transaction\u201d test as defined by statute and applied in our double jeopardy cases. Schneider argues that these answers \u201cmust be suppressed because they contained proof to support the charge for which he had been appointed counsel.\u201d However, this argument is not relevant to this proceeding. While Schneider may seek to suppress statements related to the Arizona criminal proceeding, that case is not before us and his Sixth Amendment and \u201csame transaction\u201d arguments regarding those statements have no effect on our disposition of the issues herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\u00b630 2. Does application of the <em>Cobb </em>\u201coffense-specific\u201d test violate Schneider\u2019s right to equal protection under state and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>federal constitutional law?</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">\u00b631 Schneider argues that the offense specific nature of the Sixth Amendment and Article II, Section 24 right to counsel violates his right to equal protection guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution. In other words, he argues that the way in which the United States Supreme Court and this Court have interpreted the Sixth Amendment and Article II, Section 24, respectively, violates his right to equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\u00b632 The Fourteenth Amendment and Article II, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution \u201cembody a fundamental principle of fairness: that the law must treat similarly-situated individuals in a similar manner.\u201d <em>McDermott v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>2001 MT 134, \u00b6 30, 305 Mont. 462, \u00b6 30, 29 P.3d 992 \u00b6 30. When bringing a claim under the Equal Protection Clause, one must show \u201cintentional discrimination against him because of membership in a particular class, not merely that he was treated unfairly as an individual.\u201d <em>Losleben v. Oppedahl, </em>2004 MT 5, \u00b6 17, 319 Mont. 269, \u00b6 17, 83 P.3d 1271, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\u00b633  Here, Schneider fails to establish the threshold requirements of an equal protection claim. He neither defines a protected class to which he belongs nor demonstrates that two similarly situated classes are being treated differently. The \u201cscenarios\u201d offered to show potential disparate treatment are not supported by authority demonstrating application of equal protection principles in these contexts. True, some people may enjoy the right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment and Article II, Section 24, while others may not. However, neither this Comb nor the United States Supreme Comb violates equal protection when defining the contours of the right to counsel. Application of the Sixth Amendment and Article II, Section 24 to certain persons does not create classifications subject to the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or Article II, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">\u00b634 The District Court did not err in denying Schneider\u2019s motion to suppress his statements. Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b247-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-5\"> This is generally known as the <em>\u201cBlockburger\u201d </em>test, but is also referred to as the \u201csame-elements\u201d test.

As to Issue 1, however, I would dispose of Schneider\u2019s right to counsel claim based on an application of <em>Texas v. Cobb, </em>532 U.S. 162, 121 S. Ct. 1335 (2001), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>to facts of this case. I would affirm on that basis and go no further into the right to counsel issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">\u00b636 Specifically, I would not address the applicability of Article II, Section 24. For one thing, even if we were to accept Schneider\u2019s proposed \u201cclosely factually related\u201d test for purposes of analysis under Article II, Section 24, it is quite a stretch to conclude, as Schneider asserts, that the charge of fugitive from justice filed by Arizona authorities is \u201cclosely factually related\u201d to the investigation by Montana authorities into Schneider\u2019s role in the deaths of Cowan\u2019s mother and boyfriend in Montana. It is unnecessary for us to consider whether or not to adopt a test proposed by the appellant for use under the Montana Constitution when the appellant has not even demonstrated that he is entitled to relief under that test if we were to adopt ifc-as is the case here. Accordingly, \u201cbased on the long-standing principle . . . that courts should avoid constitutional issues wherever possible,\u201d <em>State v. Carlson, 2000 </em>MT 320, \u00b6 17, 302 Mont. <em>508, </em>\u00b6 17, 15 P.3d 893, \u00b6 17; <em>accord Wolfe v. Dept. of Labor and Industry, </em>255 Mont. 336, 339, 843 P.2d 338, 340 (1992); <em>State v. Still, </em>273 Mont. 261, 263, 902 P.2d 546, 548 (1995), I would not reach Schneider\u2019s Article II, Section 24 theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\u00b637 Aside from the fact that it is unnecessary for us to interpret and apply Article II, Section 24 in this case-given Schneider\u2019s inability to prevail under his proposed \u201cclosely factually related\u201d test-Schneider\u2019s argument in this connection is too undeveloped to undertake a distinctive application of state constitutional principles. He refers to Article II, Section 24 and Montana\u2019s Constitution several times in his brief; however, he does not offer a cogent analysis of the right to counsel issue on independent state constitutional grounds. Likewise, as the Court correctly observes, the State \u201c[u]nfortunately . . . offers little analysis regarding the possibility that the Montana constitutional right to counsel may not perfectly align with the federal constitutional right.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 14. Indeed, the Gallatin County Attorney\u2019s brief on appeal mentions Article II, Section 24 only twice, and in passing. There is not even a hint in the State\u2019s brief of the analysis that the Court includes at \u00b6\u00b6 15-28 of the Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\u00b638 Our caselaw in this regard is well-settled. It is not this Court\u2019s job to conduct legal research on a party\u2019s behalf or to develop legal analysis that may lend support to the party\u2019s position. <em>See Johansen v. Dept. of Natural Resources and Conservation, </em>1998 MT 51, \u00b6 24, 288 Mont. 39, \u00b6 24, 955 P.2d 653, \u00b6 24; <em>In re Marriage of McMahon, </em>2002 MT 198, \u00b6 6, 311 Mont. 175, \u00b6 6, 53 P.3d 1266, \u00b6 6; <em>State v. Zakovi, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>2005 MT 91, \u00b6 28, 326 Mont. 475, \u00b6 28, 110 P.3d 469, \u00b6 28; <em>State v. Gomez, </em>2007 MT 111, \u00b6 33, 337 Mont. 219, \u00b6 33, 158 P.3d 442, \u00b6 33; <em>State v. Miller, </em>2008 MT 106, \u00b6 15, 342 Mont. 355, \u00b6 15, 181 P.3d 625, \u00b6 15. Thus, in <em>State v. Johnson, </em>2005 MT 48, 326 Mont. 161, 108 P.3d 485, we declined to address the defendant\u2019s constitutional challenge because we could not \u201cmake such a determination on the basis of the abbreviated arguments before <em>us.\" Johnson, </em>\u00b6 11. Likewise, in <em>State v. Garrymore, </em>2006 MT 245, 334 Mont. 1, 145 P.3d 946, the defendant asserted-similarly to Schneider\u2019s assertion here-that Article II, Sections 24 and 26 of the Montana Constitution afford a greater jury trial right than does the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution; yet, critically, he \u201cfail[ed] to offer a compelling reason why the greater jury trial right in Montana dictate[d] a different result in his case.\u201d <em>Garrymore, </em>\u00b6 39. As a result, we found his argument \u201ctoo undeveloped to undertake a distinctive application of state constitutional principles,\u201d and we accordingly did not consider the argument further. <em>Garrymore, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38, 39. The identical situation exists here. Schneider\u2019s observation that this Court has refused to march lockstep with decisions of the Supreme Court when interpreting Article II, Section 24, is only the first step in an analysis that he and the State both fail to articulate in their briefs. It is injudicious for this Court to render a decision concerning the meaning and substance of a constitutional right based on such plainly inadequate briefing.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">\u00b639 Lastly, as noted, the specific argument underlying the Court\u2019s decision in favor of the State was not argued by the State in this appeal. For that matter, it was not addressed by the District Court. Although the District Court referred twice to Article II, Section 24, the court did not analyze this provision. Rather, the court grounded its decision in the Sixth Amendment and <em>Cobb. </em>We have stated the principle so often it has become mantra: This Court will not address an issue raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See e.g. State v. Schaff, </em>1998 MT 104, \u00b6 26, 288 Mont. 421, \u00b6 26, 958 P.2d 682, \u00b6 26; <em>State v. Brown, </em>1999 MT 133, \u00b6 19, 294 Mont. 509, \u00b6 19, 982 P.2d 468, \u00b6 19; <em>State v. Adgerson, </em>2003 MT 284, \u00b6 12, 318 Mont. 22, \u00b6 12, 78 P.3d 850, \u00b6 12; <em>State v. Vaughn, </em>2007 MT 164, \u00b6 44, 338 Mont. 97, \u00b6 44, 164 P.3d 873, \u00b6 44; <em>State v. LaFreniere, </em>2008 MT 99, \u00b6 11, 342 Mont. 309, \u00b6 11, 180 P.3d 1161, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\u00b640 Despite these well-settled rules, the Court constructs a far-reaching Opinion which effectively limits the reach of Article II, Section 24\u2019s Right to Counsel Clause to the \u201coffense specific\u201d interpretation placed on the Sixth Amendment by the Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>in <em>Cobb. </em>However well-reasoned the Court\u2019s approach may appear to be, we simply do not need to reach this issue. We ought not to render, sua sponte, a decision which severely cabins a fundamental right under the Montana Constitution where the appellant has not demonstrated he is entitled to relief under the test he proffers and where the parties have not adequately briefed the issue in the trial court and this Court. <em>Cf. Garrymore, </em>\u00b6 15 n. 3 (\u201cWe have decided a number of cases addressing or touching on the meaning of an \u2018illegal\u2019 sentence for purposes of the <em>Lenihan </em>rule ... but have not fully addressed the contours of the term. Further development of this issue, and reconciliation of inconsistencies in these and other cases, may be necessary. <em>However, neither of the parties has cited to any of these cases or offered such argument, and we thus deem it inappropriate to undertake such issues until they have been properly raised and briefed.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u00b641 Whether viewed from the perspective of the defendant or the prosecution, we have, with no necessary purpose, constructed an interpretation of Article II, Section 24 from whole cloth. We are doing the work that counsel should have done. In sum, we should not address Schneider\u2019s Article II, Section 24 theory. Doing so is contrary to M. R. App. P. 12(1)f. and (2) and our well-settled jurisprudence discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\u00b642 In closing, I add the following observation concerning the Court\u2019s equating of the right to counsel under Article II, Section 24 with the right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 23.1 see no continued utility to the <em>Blockburger </em>test. Montana has adopted its own definitions of \u201cincluded offense,\u201d <em>see </em>\u00a7 46-1-202(9), MCA, and \u201csame transaction,\u201d <em>see </em>\u00a7 46-1-202(23), MCA, and its own blackletter law governing prosecutions based on the same transaction, <em>see </em>\u00a7 46-11-503, MCA. Unless one or more of these statutes is held to be in violation of the federal constitution, we should be applying Montana\u2019s law in Montana cases to the exclusion of federal precedents that do not align with the statutes our Legislature has adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u00b643 For these reasons, I specially concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
