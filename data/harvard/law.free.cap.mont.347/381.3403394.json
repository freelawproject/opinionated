Jess (Jess) appeals from the order of the Twenty-Second Judicial District Court, denying her petition for reinstatement of her drivers\u2019 license, which was suspended pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-402(4), MCA. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">\u00b62 On the night of May 17, 2007, Deputy Smith followed Jess\u2019 vehicle as it traveled westbound on Highway 10 leaving Columbus, Montana. Smith noted that the vehicle was traveling 45 miles per hour (mph) in a 70 mph zone, and observed it touch or cross the highway fog line and the centerline a number of times. Smith stopped Jess\u2019 vehicle, and she was ultimately arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. During the course of Smith\u2019s investigation, Jess refused to take a preliminary breath alcohol test, resulting in the suspension of her license.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\u00b63 Jess petitioned the District Court for reinstatement of her drivers\u2019 license pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-403, MCA, challenging two aspects of Deputy Smith\u2019s stop. She argued that Smith lacked particularized suspicion to make the stop, and that under \u00a7 7-32-303(5)(a), MCA, because he had not yet completed the basic training course at the Montana Law Enforcement Academy, he was ultimately without statutory authority to arrest her. The District Court denied Jess\u2019 petition, concluding that Deputy Smith had the authority to make the arrest, and that he had sufficient particularized suspicion to effectuate a traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\u00b64 The court interpreted \u00a7 7-32-303(5)(a), MCA, as revoking the authority to arrest where a deputy fails to attend law enforcement academy training within 1 year of his initial appointment. It disagreed with Jess\u2019 contention that the statute instead provided that Deputy Smith was without arrest authority until he completed law enforcement academy training, concluding that the statutory language did not support her interpretation. The District Court also concluded that Deputy Smith had sufficient experience to form a particularized suspicion of a potentially intoxicated driver. Finally, the court concluded that Deputy Smith\u2019s observation of Jess\u2019 vehicle touching the centerline, touching and crossing the fog line, and traveling well under the speed limit provided sufficient objective data to support a particularized suspicion that Jess was driving while under the influence of alcohol in violation of Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">\u00b65 We restate the dispositive issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">\u00b66 1. Did the District Court err in concluding that Deputy Smith was statutorily authorized to arrest Jess?</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">\u00b67 2. Did Deputy Smith have sufficient experience and objective data to form a particularized suspicion that Jess was driving under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>influence of alcohol?</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u00b68 When reviewing a District Court\u2019s ruling on a petition for reinstatement of a drivers\u2019 license, we determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact were clearly erroneous, and whether its conclusions of law were incorrect. <em>Clark v. State ex rel. Driver Improvement Bureau, </em>2005 MT 65, \u00b6 6, 326 Mont. 278, \u00b6 6, 109 P.3d 244, \u00b6 6. In such cases, the petitioner bears the burden of proving that the State\u2019s action was improper. <em>Widdicombe v. State ex rel. Lafond, </em>2004 MT 49, \u00b6 7, 320 Mont. 133, \u00b6 7, 85 P.3d 1271, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">\u00b69 On appeal, Jess challenges the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Deputy Smith had the statutory authority to arrest her while unsupervised. The thrust of her argument is that he did not have the authority to operate as a peace officer without direct supervision until he completed law enforcement academy training. Jess cites the following statute in support of her argument, which states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">it is the duty of an appointing authority to cause each peace officer appointed under its authority to attend and successfully complete, <em>within 1 year of the initial appointment, </em>an appropriate peace officer basic course .... Any peace officer ... who fails ... to complete the basic course ... forfeits the position, authority, and arrest powers accorded a peace officer in this state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Section 7-32-303(5)(a), MCA (emphasis added). Jess\u2019 argument is at odds with the plain language of the statute, which is ultimately inapplicable to this case. It provides only that a peace officer forfeits their authority if they fail to complete the required basic course within one year of their date of appointment. Deputy Smith was appointed in September, 2006, and Jess was arrested in May, 2007. He was therefore not yet subject to the forfeiture provisions of the statute, and by necessary extension, retained his power to arrest Jess.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">\u00b610 Jess also argues that Deputy Smith was a reserve officer, and thus under \u00a7 7-32-216, MCA, he was not authorized to serve as a peace officer without direct supervision. However, she fails to provide any support for her assertion that Smith was a reserve officer. The undisputed record reflects that as of the date of Jess\u2019 stop and arrest, Smith was a deputy sheriff for Stillwater County. Under \u00a7 7-32-303(1), MCA, a deputy sheriff is a peace officer. Section 7-32-216, MCA, is thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>also inapplicable to the instant case. At the time of Jess\u2019 arrest, Deputy Smith was a peace officer, not a reserve officer. Therefore, he was statutorily authorized to serve without direct supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">\u00b611 We turn now to Jess\u2019 contention that Deputy Smith lacked a particularized suspicion to stop her vehicle. The District Court\u2019s review of Jess\u2019 petition for reinstatement was confined to a determination of whether the arresting officer had reasonable grounds to believe the petitioner had been driving or was in actual physical control of a vehicle upon a way of the state open to the public while under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Section 61-8-403(4)(a)(i), MCA. For the purposes of the statute governing a petition for reinstatement of a drivers\u2019 license, the statutory standard of \u201creasonable grounds\u201d is effectively equivalent to particularized suspicion. <em>Widdicombe, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"AjV\">\u00b612 When reviewing a petition for reinstatement of a drivers\u2019 license, we use the following two part test to determine whether a police officer had a particularized suspicion to make an investigative stop. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 9. The state must show (1) objective data from which an experienced officer can make certain inferences; and (2) a resulting suspicion that the occupant of a certain vehicle is or has been engaged in wrongdoing. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 9; citing <em>State v. Brander, </em>2004 MT 150, \u00b6 6, 321 Mont. 484, \u00b6 6, 92 P.3d 1173, \u00b6 6. \u2018Whether a particularized suspicion exists is a question of fact based on the totality of the circumstances surrounding the investigative stop.\u201d <em>State v. Thompson, 2006 MT </em>274, \u00b6 7, 334 Mont. 226, \u00b6 7, 146 P.3d 756, \u00b6 7. We noted in <em>Brander </em>that \u201c[t]he question is not whether any one of Brander\u2019s driving aberrations was itself \u2018illegal\u2019 but rather, whether [the officer] could point to specific and articulable facts, which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant the intrusion.\u201d <em>Brander, </em>\u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"AOi\">\u00b613 We have addressed the issue of what type of objective data can be used to support a particularized suspicion of a potentially intoxicated driver in several factually similar cases. In <em>Brander, </em>we held that the deputy\u2019s testimony that he observed the vehicle moving very slowly and meandering and crossing the fog line was sufficient to uphold the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the deputy had a particularized suspicion to effectuate a traffic stop. <em>Brander, </em>\u00b6 7. An officer\u2019s observation of a vehicle touching or crossing the centerline several times can also provide a particularized suspicion that a driver is potentially intoxicated. <em>See Widdicombe, </em>\u00b6 14. Finally, we reiterate that \u201c[i]t is not necessary that an officer observe a moving violation to support a particularized suspicion of driving under the influence.\u201d <em>Brander, </em>\u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>\u00b614 In this case, the District Court denied Jess\u2019 petition because it found that Deputy Smith had a particularized suspicion based upon his observations that Jess\u2019 vehicle was traveling at 45 mph in a 70 mph zone, her vehicle touched and crossed the fog line repeatedly, and touched the centerline on one occasion. Under the cases discussed above, these observations, taken together, represent sufficient objective data to support a particularized suspicion that Jess was driving under the influence in violation of Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">\u00b615 Jess argues that under our precedent, an officer\u2019s stop cannot be based merely upon a vehicle driving slowly, or crossing the fog line. She cites <em>State v. Lee, </em>282 Mont. 391, 938 P.2d 637 (1997); and <em>State v. Lafferty, </em>1998 MT 247, 291 Mont. 157, 967 P.2d 363, for those respective propositions. This argument fails to give effect to the standard by which a particularized suspicion is formed and reviewed by this Court. Particularized suspicion is based upon the totality of the circumstances surrounding the stop. <em>Thompson, </em>\u00b6 7. Jess\u2019 attempt to isolate the officer\u2019s individual observations from the totality of the circumstances surrounding her arrest is unpersuasive. In sum, Jess has failed to meet her burden of proving that under the totality of the circumstances, Deputy Smith lacked sufficient objective data to form a particularized suspicion that she was driving under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"Axn4\">\u00b616 Finally, Jess argues that Deputy Smith had insufficient experience to form particularized suspicion of a potentially intoxicated driver. She again cites <em>State v. Lafferty </em>in support of her argument. (1998 MT 247, 291 Mont. 157, 967 P.2d 363.) <em>Lafferty </em>did not address, even tangentially, the question of the officer\u2019s experience or training as it applied to forming a particularized suspicion of a potentially intoxicated driver. Rather, <em>Lafferty </em>examined the sufficiency of an officer\u2019s corroborating observations where the officer receives an anonymous informant tip of a potentially intoxicated driver. It is not our role to conduct legal research on the appellant\u2019s behalf, or to guess at her precise position. <em>State v. St. Germain, </em>2007 MT 28, \u00b6 41, n. 1, 336 Mont. 17, \u00b6 41, n. 1, 153 P.3d 591, \u00b6 41, n. 1. Other than her misplaced reliance on <em>Lafferty, </em>Jess provides no authority in support of her position that Deputy Smith was not sufficiently experienced to form a particularized suspicion of an intoxicated driver. While we are not obligated to undertake any further review, we agree with the District Court that Deputy Smith had sufficient experience to testify as to his particularized suspicion that Jess was driving while impaired. The uncontroverted record shows that Smith attended 280 hours of reserve training, 24 hours of DUI training with the Montana Highway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Patrol, and had made a number of DUI arrests both with and without the assistance of a more experienced officer prior to his stop of Jess. In sum, he was sufficiently experienced to form a particularized suspicion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\u00b617  We conclude that Deputy Smith was statutorily authorized to arrest Jess, and that he had sufficient experience and objective data to support a particularized suspicion that Jess was potentially intoxicated. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Jess\u2019 petition for reinstatement of her drivers\u2019 license.</p>\n<judges id=\"b406-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, NELSON and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
