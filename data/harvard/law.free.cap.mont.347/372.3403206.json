We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">\u00b62 We restate the issue as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err by affording full faith and credit to an order entered in Illinois, which dismissed Cook\u2019s FELA claim for interstate <em>forum non conveniens </em>and ordered Cook to re-file in Indiana?</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">\u00b64 This case originates from a claim filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois (\u201cCircuit Court\u201d). In Illinois, Cook sought to recover damages under FELA for injuries Cook allegedly sustained to his knees while working as a railroad conductor for Soo Line. Shortly after the complaint was filed in Illinois, however, Soo Line moved to dismiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>the claim on the basis of interstate <em>forum non conveniens, </em>which the Circuit Court granted. In dismissing the claim, the Circuit Court ordered Cook to re-file in Indiana, stating, \u201cThis case is dismissed, to be re-filed in Indiana State Court or [the United States District Court] for the Southern District of Indiana as stated on the record.\u201d According to Soo Line, the Circuit Court dismissed the case, in part, because \u201cCook and most of the witnesses reside[d] in Indiana\u201d and because \u201cCook worked the majority of his career in Indiana,\u201d the State in which Cook allegedly sustained his work-related injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">\u00b65 Cook, however, did not appeal the Illinois order or re-file in Indiana. Instead, Cook filed his FELA claim in Cascade County, Montana, even though Cook did not live or work for Soo Line in Montana. In the complaint, Cook stated that jurisdiction in Montana was proper under FELA because of Soo Line\u2019s ownership of railroad track \u201cin or around Sweet Grass, Montana, located in Toole County, Montana.\u201d After the claim was filed in Cascade County, the parties stipulated to transferring the case to Lewis and Clark County, the location of Soo Line\u2019s registered agent. Thereafter, Soo Line again sought to dismiss Cook\u2019s claim, arguing to the District Court that the Circuit Court\u2019s order in Illinois was a final judgment entitled to full faith and credit in Montana. Specifically, Soo Line contended that the Illinois order was \u201centitled to <em>res judicata </em>effect\u201d in Montana and stated that \u201c[b]ecause the proper forum for this action was already determined by the Cook County court to be Indiana, [Cook] cannot simply disregard that Order and re-file the case [in Montana].\u201d In response, Cook argued that \u201ca dismissal on the grounds of interstate <em>forum non conveniens </em>is not a final adjudication on the merits as would be required for the elements of <em>res judicata ...\u201d </em>Thus, according to Cook, the Illinois order was not entitled to full faith and credit in Montana. Finally, Cook claimed the Circuit Court did not have authority to order Cook to re-file the case in Indiana and that it therefore had no effect on his ability to re-file his FELA claim in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u00b66 The District Court granted Soo Line\u2019s motion and dismissed Cook\u2019s claims on the basis that the Illinois order was a final judgment entitled to full faith and credit in Montana. Cook appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>In re Marriage of Fontenot, </em>2006 MT 324, \u00b6 20, 335 Mont. 79, \u00b6 20, 149 P.3d 28, \u00b6 20. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Further, \u201cthis Court is not bound by the determinations of the trial court on questions of law and we are free to draw our own conclusions from the evidence presented.\u201d <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. McElvain, </em>221 Mont. 138, 144-45, 717 P.2d 1081, 1085 (1986) (citing <em>Sharp v. Hoerner Waldorf Co., </em>178 Mont. 419, 584 P.2d 1298 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err by affording full faith and credit to an order entered in Illinois, which dismissed Cook\u2019s FELA claim for interstate <em>forum non conveniens </em>and ordered Cook to re-file in Indiana?</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\u00b69 Cook contends that the District Court erred by affording the Illinois order full faith and credit in Montana and dismissing Cook\u2019s FELA claim on the basis of <em>res judicata. </em>Cook argues that, \u201c[u]nder Illinois law, a dismissal for interstate <em>forum, non conveniens </em>is not a final judgment on the merits for purposes of <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel, and thus is not entitled to full faith and credit in Montana.\u201d While Cook does not dispute that the Full Faith and Credit Clause requires courts in Montana to recognize a valid judgment from another state, he argues that \u201cfinality is not the only prerequisite to the application of <em>res judicata.\u201d </em>He claims that the pertinent question is whether the judgment in Illinois was made \u201con the merits.\u201d Since a dismissal for <em>forum non conveniens </em>is not \u201con the merits\u201d in Illinois, Cook reasons that it cannot have preclusive effect or be afforded full faith and credit in Montana. Cook also argues that the portion of the Circuit Court\u2019s decision ordering him to re-file in Indiana was not a valid judgment, thus precluding full faith and credit in Montana. Cook states that the Circuit Court \u201chad no authority or jurisdiction to either transfer Cook\u2019s FELA case to another state or to dictate venue upon refiling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">\u00b610 Soo line, however, argues that the Illinois judgment was \u201ca final judgment entitled to ftdl faith and credit in Montana.\u201d In support of its position, Soo Line cites a decision from an Illinois appellate court which concludes that a \u201cchange of venue on <em>forum non conveniens </em>grounds\u201d is a \u201cfinal and appealable order <em>\u201d Nemanich v. Dollar Rent-A-Car Services, </em>90 Ill. App. 3d 484, 489, 413 N.E.2d 178, 182 (1980). Therefore, according to Soo Line, the judgment was final in Illinois for purposes of full faith and credit and entitled to <em>res judicata </em>effect in Montana. In light of these arguments, Soo Line contends that the District Court correctly afforded preclusive effect to the Illinois court\u2019s dismissal of Cook\u2019s FELA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>\u00b611 We note first that the District Court did not specifically state in its order that it dismissed Cook\u2019s FELA claim on the basis of <em>res judicata, </em>even though Cook and Soo Line argued the issue in their briefing on the motion to dismiss. Instead, the District Court stated that \u201c[a] grant, but not the denial, of a <em>forum non conveniens </em>motion is a final judgment appealable as such, even when the order of dismissal is conditional\u201d (citing 32A Am. Jur. 2d <em>Federal Courts </em>\u00a7 1359), and that the order in Illinois \u201cwas a final order which [Cook] could have appealed but chose not to do so.\u201d Based on the foregoing, the District Court concluded that the dismissal in Illinois for interstate <em>forum non conveniens </em>was a final judgment entitled to full faith and credit in Montana. However, it is undisputed that the effect of the District Court\u2019s dismissal was to preclude Cook from litigating his FELA claim in Montana. Accordingly, we begin our analysis with a discussion of whether the dismissal in Illinois on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens </em>had any preclusive effect in the State of Montana-especially given Montana\u2019s open door policy with respect to FELA cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u00b612 Generally, the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>(more commonly known as claim preclusion) provides \u201cthat a final judgment on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive as to causes of action or issues thereby litigated, as to the parties and their privies ....\u201d <em>Brault v. Smith, </em>209 Mont. 21, 26, 679 P.2d 236, 238-39 (1984) <em>(citing Meagher Co. Newlan Creek Water Dist. v. Walter, </em>169 Mont. 358, 361, 547 P.2d 850, 852 (1976)). In <em>Brault, </em>we also noted that \u201c[t]he basic proposition behind the doctrine of res judicata has always remained the same: a party should not be able to relitigate a matter he or she has already had an opportunity to litigate.\u201d However, we also noted in <em>Thoring v. LaCounte, </em>225 Mont. 77, 79-80, 733 P.2d 340, 341-42 (1987), that \u201cthe application of res judicata presumes a judgment was rendered on the merits of the case, the policy being that a lawsuit should bring not only justice to the parties, but also provide a final resolution to the controversy.\u201d To determine whether a judgment was rendered on the merits, we look to the local law of the state that issued the judgment, and \u201cwill recognize a judgment not on the merits only as to the issues actually decided.\u201d <em>Thoring, </em>255 Mont. at 80, 733 P.2d 340 at 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u00b613  As Cook points out, a dismissal for <em>forum non conveniens </em>in Illinois is not an adjudication on the merits. <em>Wakehouse v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>353 Ill. App. 3d 346, 351, 818 N.E.2d 1269, 1275 (2004) (see also <em>A. W. Wendell &amp; Sons v. Qazi, </em>254 Ill. App. 3d 97, 626 N.E.2d 280 (1993). In <em>Wakehouse, </em>the Appellate Court of Illinois, Third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>District, addressed the issue of whether a plaintiff was precluded from re-filing a claim in Illinois when the claim had already been dismissed for <em>forum non conveniens </em>in another Illinois county. 353 Ill. App. 3d at 347-48, 818 N.E.2d at 1272-73. Upon addressing the issue, the court determined that the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>did not preclude the plaintiff from re-filing in another Illinois county since a dismissal for <em>forum non conveniens </em>was not an adjudication on the merits. <em>Wakehouse, </em>353 Ill. App. 3d at 351, 818 N.E.2d at 1275. However, the court determined that the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens </em>itself precluded the plaintiff from re-filing in another Illinois county since the first court to hear the case in Illinois had already determined that the state of Illinois was an inconvenient forum for the claim. <em>Wakehouse, </em>353 Ill. App. 3d at 352-53, 818 N.E.2d at 1276-77. The court in <em>Wakehouse, </em>however, did not make any pronouncement with regard to whether the plaintiff was precluded from re-filing in another state. In the present case, because a dismissal for <em>forum non conveniens </em>is not a final adjudication on the merits in Illinois, the Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal of Cook\u2019s FELA claim for <em>forum non conveniens </em>in Illinois cannot have preclusive effect under a theory of <em>res judicata </em>in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b614 This conclusion is supported by our decision in <em>Thoring, </em>in which we addressed the issue of whether the Full Faith and Credit Clause or the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>barred a \u201cplaintiff from relitigating claims previously dismissed with prejudice\u201d by a trial court in North Dakota. 225 Mont. at 79, 733 P.2d at 341. In <em>Thoring, </em>a resident of Montana brought a wrongful death claim on behalf of his daughter in North Dakota and Montana against a Montana bar that had allegedly served alcohol to an individual whose driving killed three people, including the plaintiff\u2019s daughter, on a highway in North Dakota. 225 Mont. at 79, 733 P.2d at 341. In North Dakota, the North Dakota Supreme Court ultimately determined that a Montana bar could not be held liable under the North Dakota Dram Shop Act, but made no determination about the liability of the parties under Montana law. <em>Thoring, </em>225 Mont. at 81, 733 P.2d at 342-43. In Montana, the district court granted partial summary judgment to the bar upon finding that the North Dakota court\u2019s decision was <em>res judicata </em>to the applicability of the North Dakota Dram Shop Act, but denied summary judgment as to the bar\u2019s liability in Montana. <em>Thoring, </em>225 Mont. at 79, 733 P.2d at 341. On appeal, we determined that the sole issue litigated in North Dakota was whether \u201cNorth Dakota\u2019s Dram Shop Act applied extraterritorially\u201d to the owners of the Montana bar and that liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>under Montana law had not been decided. <em>Thoring, </em>225 Mont. at 81, 733 P.2d at 343. Ultimately, we held that the \u201cextraterritorial effect of the North Dakota Dram Shop Act... was decided on the merits,\u201d and under the full faith and credit clause and \u00a7 26-3-203, MCA, relitigation [was] barred under the doctrine of res judicata.\u201d <em>Thoring, 225 </em>Mont. at 81, 733 P.2d at 343. However, we also held that the bar\u2019s liability in Montana \u201cwas not litigated and decided in the North Dakota courts\u201d and that \u201cMontana courts [were] free to examine the issue.\u201d <em>Thoring, 225 </em>Mont. at 81, 733 P.2d at 343. In this case, the only issue actually decided by the Circuit Court in Illinois was that Illinois was not an appropriate forum and, further, that Indiana was evidently a more appropriate forum for Cook\u2019s FELA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">\u00b615 Furthermore, in the context of a dismissal for <em>forum non conveniens, </em>the Full Faith and Credit Clause does not require the District Court in Montana to afford preclusive effect to Cook\u2019s claim. The Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution states that \u201c[flull faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state.\u201d U.S. Const, art. IV, \u00a7 1. It is well established that, pursuant to the Full Faith and Credit Clause, \u201ca valid judgment rendered in one state must be recognized in a sister state.\u201d <em>Thoring, </em>225 Mont. at 80, 733 P.2d at 342 (citing Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws Section 93 (1971)). We have stated, citing the United States Supreme Court, that the obligation owed to a final judgment under the Full Faith and Credit Clause is \u201cexacting\u201d and that the judgment \u201cshould have the same credit, validity, and effect, in every court of the United States, which it had in the state where it was pronounced.\u201d <em>Carr v. Bett, </em>1998 MT 266, \u00b6 39, 291 Mont. 326, \u00b6 39, 970 P.2d 1017, \u00b6 39 (citing <em>Underwriters National Assur. Co., </em>455 U.S. 691, 704, 102 S. Ct. 1357, 1365 (1982)). Likewise, \u00a7 26-3-203, MCA, states that \u201c[t]he effect of a judicial record of a sister state is the same in this state as in the state where it was made ....\u201d Finally, the Full Faith and Credit Clause \u201crequires every State to give a judgment at least the <em>res judicata </em>effect which the judgment would be accorded in the State which rendered it.\u201d <em>Carr, </em>\u00b6 39 (quoting <em>Durfee v. Duke, </em>375 U.S. 106, 109, 84 S. Ct. 242, 244 (1963)). Soo Line claims that, pursuant to the full faith and credit obligations outlined above, the District Court in Montana was required to give the Illinois order preclusive effect in Montana. Specifically, Soo Line claims that \u201cMontana must give the Illinois judgment the same effect it would be afforded in the State of Illinois-i.e. deem the judgment final and order Cook to re-file in Indiana.\u201d However, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>this line of reasoning, Soo Line assumes that the portion of the Circuit Court\u2019s decision ordering Cook to re-file in Indiana precluded Cook from re-filing in Montana. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u00b616  Under the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens, </em>a court can decline jurisdiction and dismiss a case even if the claim is otherwise appropriate. Generally the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens </em>assumes that there is another, more appropriate forum for the claim. In the federal system, courts are authorized to transfer a case to an appropriate forum upon dismissing a case for <em>forum non conveniens. See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a) (stating that \u201cFor the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought.\u201d). However, unlike the federal courts, state courts have no authority to transfer a case to a different state under this doctrine. In this case, however, the Circuit Court did not attempt to transfer the case to Indiana. Instead, the Circuit Court dismissed the case and ordered Cook to re-file in Indiana, even though Cook had numerous venue options available to him under FELA. Specifically, FELA provides that \u201can action may be brought in a district court of the United States, in the district of the residence of the defendant, or in which the cause of action arose, or in which the defendant shall be doing business at the time of commencing such action.\u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 56. FELA also provides for concurrent jurisdiction between state and federal courts. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 56. Therefore, under FELA, Cook was authorized to bring his claim in the State of Montana if jurisdiction under \u00a7 56 of FELA could be otherwise established.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\u00b617  Soo Line cannot point to any authority for the proposition that Cook was limited to one forum-Indiana-under either federal or state law regarding FELA claims. Given FELA\u2019s broad venue provisions and this State\u2019s well-settled policy of opening its doors to such claims, we conclude that the District Court sitting in Montana was not required to give the portion of the Illinois decision ordering Cook to re-file in Indiana full faith and credit in Montana. <em>See State ex rel. Burlington N. R.R. v. Dist. Ct., </em>270 Mont. 146, 891 P.2d 493, 498 (1995) (stating that \u201cunder federal case law FELA is to be given a liberal construction in favor of injured railroad employees so that it may accomplish its humanitarian and remedial purposes.\u201d). In reaching this conclusion, we note that Cook is precluded from filing in Illinois under the Illinois Circuit Court\u2019s <em>forum non conveniens </em>dismissal. Although the Illinois Circuit Court ordered Cook to re-file his FELA claim in Indiana, we conclude that the Illinois order did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>preclude Cook from filing his FELA claim in Montana so long as jurisdiction in this State is otherwise appropriate. Thus, the District Court erred by affording full faith and credit to the portion of the Illinois decision ordering Cook to re-file in Indiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">\u00b618 The District Court\u2019s order of dismissal is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b400-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, RICE, MORRIS and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b400-6\">JUSTICE WARNER</author>\n<p id=\"AAj\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\u00b619 I concur with the Court\u2019s Opinion as it correctly states the applicable law. However, this case is a lucent example of why, as a matter of basic fairness to the parties and to the citizens of Montana, this Court should revisit its decision of <em>State ex rel. Burlington N. R.R. Co. v. Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>270 Mont. 146, 154-56, 891 P.2d 493, 498-500 (1995), and like cases, where this Court has flatly rejected the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens </em>in FELA cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">\u00b620 The common law doctrine <em>of forum non conveniens </em>allows a court to refuse to entertain an action even when jurisdiction is authorized by the letter of the law. It is applied when the ends of justice and the convenience of witnesses would be promoted by trial in another jurisdiction. <em>Haug v. Burlington N. R.R. Co., </em>236 Mont. 368, 375, 770 P.2d 517, 521 (1989). The courts of Montana may utilize this doctrine in a non-discriminatory fashion in FELA cases. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 56; <em>Mo. ex rel. S. Ry. Co. v. Mayfield, </em>340 U.S. 1, 3, 71 S. Ct. 1, 2 (1950). I am of the opinion that Montana courts should be open to all those who have a claim that is legitimately made here. However just as Congress has provided, each claim should be examined and the doctrine <em>forum non conveniens </em>should be available in Montana, just as it is in Illinois, to fairly examine this FELA case and decide whether it may be more appropriately and justly tried elsewhere.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
