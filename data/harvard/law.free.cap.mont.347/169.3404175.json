We affirm in part and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it imposed probation conditions restricting Heddings\u2019 use of alcohol and requiring that he submit to regular breathalyzer tests?</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in imposing the probation condition requiring Heddings to submit to polygraph testing?</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">\u00b65 Both parties agree the probation conditions requiring that Heddings obtain prior approval before residing with a minor (condition 25) and before associating with someone who has a minor child (condition 35) should be clarified to specifically indicate they do not apply to his current wife and biological daughter. Thus, we will not address this issue and we remand to the District Court to limit the scope of conditions 25 and 35 consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b190-15\">\u00b66 Heddings was charged with one count of felony incest. The charge was based on multiple incidents of Heddings sexually abusing his two step-daughters during a period from 1994 to 2001. Heddings entered into a plea agreement with the State where he pled guilty to the one count of felony incest in exchange for the State recommending a sentence of twenty years with sixteen suspended. The District Court followed the plea agreement and sentenced Heddings to the Department of Corrections (DOC) for twenty years, with sixteen suspended and imposed additional probation conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>\u00b67 Before sentencing, a licensed clinical psychologist conducted a comprehensive psychosexual evaluation of Heddings. In his evaluation report, the psychologist made overall recommendations for Heddings\u2019 treatment. The recommendations included the following: \u201cMr. Heddings should abstain from any alcohol or drugs (unless medically indicated) while completing sex offender therapy,\u201d and \u201cMr. Heddings should have frequent and mandatory to a [sic] urinalysis upon the request of his probation officer or therapist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\u00b68 The psychosexual evaluation, including the psychologist\u2019s treatment recommendations, was included in the Presentence Investigation Report (PSI), which the District Court reviewed before sentencing Heddings. At sentencing, the court made the following statement: \u201c[the psychologist] found the Defendant to be of a type sex offender who is a situational and indiscriminate offender with no particular preference for children but who will use them as sexual objects. The nature and duration of the Defendant\u2019s conduct warrants serious consequences.\u201d The court, however, acknowledged Heddings would be incarcerated for a federal prison term for other charges and sentenced Heddings to the DOC for a term of twenty years with sixteen suspended, to run concurrently with the federal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">\u00b69 The following probation conditions are at issue in Heddings\u2019 appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">2. Defendant shall not possess or consume intoxicants/alcohol, nor shall he enter any place intoxicants are the chief item of sale. He shall submit to Breathalyzer testing for alcohol as requested by his supervising officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">19. Defendant shall not have contact with any individual under the age of eighteen (18) except his biological children, unless accompanied by an approved and appropriately trained, responsible adult who is aware of the Defendant\u2019s sexual conviction and approved by his supervising officer and his sex offender treatment provider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">25. Defendant\u2019s residence, changes and any co-habitants must have prior approval of his supervising officer. The Defendant shall not reside in a residence where there are any children under the age of eighteen (18) without the written approval of his therapist and supervising officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">31. Defendant shall not have contact with his victim or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>immediate family unless approved by the victim\u2019s therapist, offender\u2019s therapist and supervising officer, except with his biological daughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-4\"><em>34. </em>Defendant shall submit to annual polygraph testing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">35. Defendant shall not date, live with, or otherwise align himself with any person with children under the age of eighteen (18) without the express approval of his therapist and supervising officer. If this approval is granted, they shall both be involved with his treatment to the extent that his treatment provider recommends.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\u00b610 At sentencing, Heddings\u2019 counsel objected to the alcohol/breathalyzer condition but did not object to imposition of the annual polygraph test. Heddings now appeals the imposition of the alcohol and breathalyzer (condition #2) and polygraph (condition #34) conditions and requests that conditions #25 and #35, restricting his interaction with minors or the victim\u2019s family, be remanded to clarify they do not include his wife or biological daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">\u00b611  In <em>State v. Ashby, </em>2008 MT 83, 342 Mont. 187, 179 P.3d 1164, we set forth a new standard of review of challenged probation conditions. We first review the condition for legality. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 9. A sentencing condition is illegal if the sentencing court lacked statutory authority to impose it, if the condition falls outside the parameters set by the applicable sentencing statutes, or if the court did not adhere to the affirmative mandates of the applicable sentencing statutes. <em>State v. Stephenson, </em>2008 MT 64, \u00b6 15, 342 Mont. 60, \u00b6 15, 179 P.3d 502, \u00b6 15. This determination is a question of law and, as such we review the condition\u2019s legality de novo. If the challenged condition is illegal, we will reverse it. If the condition is legal, we will review it for an abuse of discretion, determining whether it constitutes a \u201creasonable restriction or condition considered necessary for rehabilitation or for the protection of the victim or society.\u201d <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">\u00b612 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it imposed probation conditions restricting Heddings\u2019 use of alcohol and requiring that he submit to regular breathalyzer tests?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">\u00b613 Heddings argues that \u201c[b]ecause there is no nexus between the crime or offender and the conditions of probation, the alcohol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>restriction and the requirement of submission to breathalyzer tests are improper conditions and should be stricken.\u201d The State argues that \u201cthe sentencing court\u2019s decision to restrict alcohol use during the suspended portion of Heddings\u2019 sentence was reasonable and not an abuse of discretion ....\u201d The State also asserts \u201cHeddings is a situational, opportunistic child molester. Allowing him to drink, with his history, would only give him more opportunities to fail and increase the likelihood that he would [reoffend].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">\u00b614 Sentencing courts have statutory authority to impose \u201creasonable restrictions or conditions\u201d during a suspended portion of a sentence, including conditions for probation. Section 46-18-201(4), MCA. The sentencing judge may impose restrictions she \u201cconsiders necessary to obtain the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society,\u201d as long as the limitation is \u201creasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society.\u201d Section 46-18-202(1), (1)(f), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\u00b615 This Court recently clarified our standard for reviewing sentencing conditions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">In imposing conditions of sentence, a sentencing judge may impose a particular condition of probation so long as the condition has a nexus to either the offense for which the offender is being sentenced, or to the offender himself or herself .... We caution, however, that courts may impose offender-related conditions only in those cases in which the history or pattern of conduct to be restricted is recent, and significant or chronic. A passing, isolated, or stale instance of behavior or conduct will be insufficient to support a restrictive probation condition imposed in the name of offender rehabilitation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-7\"><em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">\u00b616 The psychologist\u2019s recommendation is sufficient to establish a nexus between Heddings and the necessity for a condition restricting alcohol. Although Heddings claims his offenses did not involve the use of alcohol, he does not challenge the accuracy or validity of the PSI. The PSI addresses, among other things, Heddings\u2019 history of compulsive sexual behavior, alcohol abuse and drug use. Based on this history and his overall evaluation of Heddings, the psychologist made a number of recommendations, including that Heddings abstain from using alcohol while completing sex offender treatment and that he undergo mandatory urinalysis. The District Court then used its discretion to apply the restriction to Heddings\u2019 entire period of probation. The risk of recidivism of sex offenders is high and it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>within the court\u2019s discretion to impose conditions to reduce this likelihood and \u201cto obtain the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">\u00b6 17  Based on the case-specific recommendation of the psychologist, we hold a nexus exists between the alcohol restriction/breathalyzer requirement of condition #2 and Heddings as an offender. The condition is \u201creasonable\u201d and \u201cnecessary for rehabilitation or for the protection of the victim or society.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\u00b618 <em>Did the District Court err in imposing the probation condition requiring Heddings to submit to polygraph testing?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">\u00b619 Because Heddings did not object to this condition in the District Court and because the condition was legal, we will not address it substantively on appeal. This Court does not review on appeal an issue to which the party failed to object at the trial court. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 22; \u00a7 46-20-104(2), MCA. Furthermore, we have specifically refused to review an unchallenged condition in light of the defendant\u2019s failure to object at the district court level. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 22; <em>State v. Ommundson, </em>1999 MT 16, \u00b6 2, 293 Mont. 133, \u00b6 2, 974 P.2d 620, \u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">\u00b620 Heddings asserts that \u201c[requiring polygraph testing as a condition of probation or parole is illegal\u201d and \u201c[a]ppellate review in the absence of an objection is proper because this provision of the sentence is not merely objectionable, but could not be enforced.\u201d Despite Heddings\u2019 characterization of the issue as whether the condition requiring polygraph testing is a \u201clegal\u201d condition, the issue is not one of legality. The condition imposed does not exceed statutory authority or fall outside the parameters or affirmative mandates of the sentencing statutes and it is, therefore, a legal sentence. <em>Stephenson, </em>\u00b6 15. Thus, Heddings is not entitled to review under <em>State v. Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. 338, 343, 602 P.2d 997, 1000 (1979) (allowing appellate review of a sentence not objected to at the trial court if it is illegal or exceeds statutory mandates). Rather, the question is whether the District Court abused its discretion to impose \u201creasonable restrictions or conditions\u201d or conditions \u201creasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society.\u201d Sections 46-18-201(4), 202(1)(f), MCA. Furthermore, while Heddings is correct in asserting polygraph tests are inadmissible in any court proceeding in Montana, this Court has declined to extend that prohibition to mean polygraph tests as mandated as a condition of probation are illegal. See <em>State v. Hameline, </em>2008 MT 241, \u00b6 20, 344 Mont. 461, \u00b6 20, 188 P.3d 1052, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">\u00b621  As stated above, this Court will not review a condition imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>under the sentencing court\u2019s discretionary authority under \u00a7 46-18-201 or -202 unless the objection was raised in the district court. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 22; \u00a7 46-20-104(2), MCA. Heddings did not object in the District Court to the condition that he submit to polygraph testing and, thus, we decline to address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\u00b622  The District Court properly exercised its discretion in imposing the alcohol and breathalyzer probation restrictions. Heddings did not object to the condition requiring polygraph tests at the trial court and, thus, we will not address that issue on appeal. Finally, the conditions limiting Heddings\u2019 contact with minors or the victims\u2019 immediate family should be clarified to indicated they do not include Heddings\u2019 wife or biological daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\u00b623 Affirmed in part, remanded in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b195-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b195-8\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"As_\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">\u00b624 I specially concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">\u00b625 As today\u2019s Opinion reflects, this Court no longer reviews a sentencing condition of the sort at issue here for legality. For instance, we observe that the polygraph condition \u201cdoes not exceed statutory authority or fall outside the parameters or affirmative mandates of the sentencing statutes and it is, therefore, a legal sentence,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 20, but we do not explain why that is the case. To the contrary, as the Court candidly concedes in \u00b6 21, \u201cthis Court will not review a condition imposed under the sentencing court\u2019s discretionary authority under \u00a7 46-18-201 or -202 unless the objection was raised in the district court,\u201d in which case we only review for abuse of discretion (see <em>e.g. </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 15-17).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">\u00b626 While I disagree with this approach, it is the procedure adopted by the Court in <em>State v. Stiles, </em>2008 MT 390, 347 Mont. 95, 197 P.3d 966. And though I continue to maintain that the sentencing issue in <em>Stiles </em>was wrongly decided and that the distinction drawn in that case between \u201clegality\u201d and \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d for purposes of reviewing sentencing conditions is legally incorrect under the applicable statutes, <em>see Stiles, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-50 (Nelson, J., dissenting), <em>Stiles </em>is the law of the land. Accordingly, as to the sentencing issues presented by Heddings, I specially concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
