We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred by denying Maki\u2019s motion to dismiss the charges on double jeopardy grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">\u00b63 Due in part to the manner in which this case proceeded in the District Court, the factual record before us is rather undeveloped. The parties do not dispute, however, that Maki was convicted in 1991 of five offenses in federal court and sentenced to a term of imprisonment, followed by a term of federal supervised release. In January of 2006, Maki was serving the term of federal supervised release when federal probation officers, assisted by a detective from the Missoula County Sheriffs Office, located and seized a plastic baggie of methamphetamine and various items identified as precursors to the manufacture of methamphetamine at Maki\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\u00b64 In February of 2006, the United States District Court for the District of Montana entered a judgment entitled \u201cJUDGMENT IN A CRIMINAL CASE (For Revocation of Probation or Supervised Release).\u201d The federal revocation judgment indicates that Maki admitted violating two conditions of his term of supervised release, described as \u201cStandard Condition #7 (possess/use of marijuana and meth.)\u201d and \u201cviolation of state/fed laws (mfg./distrib. marijuana/meth).\u201d The federal court committed Maki to the custody of the United States Bureau of Prisons to be imprisoned for 50 months on each of the 5 charges in the underlying case, to be served concurrently, followed by supervised release for 10 months on each of the 5 charges, to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">\u00b65 In December of 2006, the State of Montana charged Maki by information with the felony offenses of criminal possession of dangerous drugs and criminal possession of precursors. The charges were based on the evidence seized during the search of Maki\u2019s residence in January of 2006. Maki pled not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">\u00b66 In January of 2007, Maki moved to dismiss the charges on double jeopardy grounds, pursuant to \u00a7 46-11-504, MCA, and Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution. Maki attached the federal revocation judgment from February of 2006. He asserted he would face double punishment for the same conduct that formed the basis for the federal revocation if the prosecution continued. The State responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>\u00b67 The District Court denied Maki\u2019s motion at a hearing. The court reasoned Maki had not faced new charges in the federal court, and double jeopardy did not apply with respect to the federal court\u2019s earlier use of Maki\u2019s possession of the items seized in January of 2006 as a basis for revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\u00b68 Maki and the State entered into a plea agreement under which Maki would plead guilty to the two drug offenses in exchange for the State\u2019s recommendation for, among other things, sentences of 4 years commitment to the Department of Corrections and 15 years commitment to the Department of Corrections with 10.5 years suspended, to run concurrently to each other and to the sentence imposed upon his federal revocation. The District Court accepted Maki\u2019s guilty pleas, and entered judgment and sentence in accordance with the parties\u2019 plea agreement. Maki appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\u00b69 A district court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss a criminal charge on double jeopardy grounds presents a question of law that we review for correctness. <em>State v. Cech, </em>2007 MT 184, \u00b6 7, 338 Mont. 330, \u00b6 7, 167 P.3d 389, \u00b6 7 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">\u00b610 <em>Did the District Court err by denying Maki\u2019s motion to dismiss the charges on double jeopardy grounds?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">\u00b611 In an ordinary criminal case, the entry of a voluntary guilty plea constitutes a waiver of all nonjurisdictional defects and defenses, including claims of constitutional rights violations which occurred prior to the plea. See <em>State v. Kelsch, </em>2008 MT 339, \u00b6 8, 346 Mont. 260, \u00b6 8, 194 P.3d 670, \u00b6 8 (citations omitted). With the consent of the prosecutor and the approval of the court, however, a defendant may enter a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, reserving the right to appeal the adverse determination of any specified pretrial motion. <em>See Kelsch, </em>\u00b6 9 (citing \u00a7 46-12-204(3), MCA). Here, Maki entered into a plea agreement that did not reserve the right to appeal from the adverse determination of his motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds, and nothing else of record reflects a reserved right to appeal any matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">\u00b612 Maki asserts as athreshold matter that, pursuant to <em>Cech, </em>he may raise this double jeopardy issue on appeal despite his failure to reserve the right to appeal in the District Court. In <em>Cech, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9-10 (citations omitted), we applied a limited \u201cjurisdictional grounds exception\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>utilized by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in concluding the defendant who had pled guilty did not waive his double jeopardy assertion-despite failing to reserve the issue for appeal-because the record before the district court was sufficient for the court to determine whether the State lacked power to bring the charges at issue in light of constitutional prohibitions against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">\u00b613 In response, the State observes only that Maki did not reserve the right to appeal in the District Court. It does not offer substantive argument regarding either Maki\u2019s position that he is entitled to raise this issue despite his failure to reserve the right to appeal in the District Court, or his reliance on <em>Cech. </em>Thus, we conclude the State has conceded that this issue is properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">\u00b614 Maki asserts his state prosecution for felony charges is barred under \u00a7 46-11-504, MCA, or Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution. We address these assertions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\u00b615 Section 46-11-504, MCA, provides in pertinent part that \u201c[w]hen conduct constitutes an offense within the jurisdiction of any state or federal court, a prosecution in any jurisdiction is a bar to a subsequent prosecution in this state if: (1) the first prosecution resulted in an acquittal or in a conviction and the subsequent prosecution is based on an offense arising out of the same transaction!.]\u201d This statutory \u201cmultiple prosecutions\u201d provision applies if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">(1) a defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes an offense within the jurisdiction of the court where the first prosecution occurred and within the jurisdiction of the court where the subsequent prosecution is pursued;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">(2) the first prosecution resulted in an acquittal or a conviction; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-9\">(3) the subsequent prosecution is based on an offense arising out of the same transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-10\"><em>Cech, </em>\u00b6 13 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">\u00b616 Maki makes brief assertions that the first and third prongs of the <em>Cech </em>analysis were met, and the State does not directly address those assertions. Regarding the second prong, Maki concedes the federal revocation for possessing the methamphetamine and precursors was neither a \u201cprosecution\u201d nor a \u201cconviction.\u201d He asserts, however, that we must decide whether the revocation of his federal supervised release and corresponding 50-month federal imprisonment satisfy the second prong, and contends the second prong should be satisfied whenever a defendant is merely subject to prosecution and imprisoned pursuant to any form of proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>\u00b617  In construing a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA; <em>State v. Mainwaring, </em>2007 MT 14, \u00b6 15, 335 Mont. 322, \u00b6 15, 151 P.3d 53, \u00b6 15 (citation omitted). As noted above, \u00a7 46-11-504, MCA, states in part that a \u201cprosecution\u201d in any jurisdiction bars a subsequent prosecution in Montana if the \u201cfirst prosecution resulted in an acquittal or in a conviction.\u201d Nothing of record suggests that Maki\u2019s federal revocation proceeding constituted a \u201cprosecution\u201d and, as noted above, Maki concedes it was not. We conclude that the revocation of Maki\u2019s federal supervised release was not a prosecution as contemplated in \u00a7 46-11-504, MCA, and, therefore, the statute did not bar the State\u2019s prosecution of Maki for felony drug charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">\u00b618 Purportedly as part of his statutory argument, Maki also asserts that double jeopardy applies to \u201cmultiple punishments.\u201d In support, he advances <em>State v. Guillaume, </em>1999 MT 29, \u00b6 19, 293 Mont. 224, \u00b6 19, 975 P.2d 312, \u00b6 19. <em>Guillaume </em>did not discuss multiple punishments in relation to \u00a7 46-11-504, MCA, however; it discussed multiple punishments in relation to the constitutional provision we address further below.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\u00b619 Maki\u2019s constitutional argument is based on Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution, which states in pertinent part that \u201c[n]o person shall be again put in jeopardy for the same offense previously tried in any jurisdiction.\u201d Maki observes our determination in <em>Guillaume </em>that Article II, Section 25 provides greater protection against multiple punishments for the same offense than does the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>See Guillaume, </em>\u00b6 16. He also points to our statement in <em>Guillaume, </em>\u00b6 17, that \u201c[w]e are guided by the fundamental principle embodied in double jeopardy. Simply put, double jeopardy exemplifies the legal and moral concept that no person should suffer twice for a single act.\u201d On these bases, he asserts Article II, Section 25 bars his state prosecution because he was punished via his federal revocation for possessing the very methamphetamine and precursors leading to the charges filed by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\u00b620 The entire constitutional and above-referenced statutory \u201cmultiple punishments\u201d argument in Maki\u2019s opening brief is under two pages long and based solely on <em>Guillaume. </em>Our holding in <em>Guillaume </em>was that the double jeopardy provision of the Montana Constitution prohibited a weapon enhancement when the use of a weapon was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>element of the underlying offense-a conclusion which does not relate in any way to revocation proceedings. <em>See Guillaume, </em>\u00b6 16. Absent authorities other than <em>Guillaume </em>or developed argument relating <em>Guillaume </em>to the issue presented here, we reject Maki\u2019s unsupported assumption that his federal revocation constituted a \u201cpunishment\u201d for purposes of double jeopardy analysis under Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">\u00b621 Maki also advances a number of arguments in his reply brief. Having considered them, we conclude that-with one exception-we need not address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u00b622 We do address, briefly, one point raised in Maki\u2019s reply brief. Maki advances certain language from <em>State v. Walker, </em>2001 MT 170, \u00b6 12, 306 Mont. 159, \u00b6 12, 30 P.3d 1099, \u00b6 12, and <em>State v. Lange, </em>237 Mont. 486, 489, 775 P.2d 213, 215 (1989), which he asserts supports his position that he was \u201cpunished\u201d in the federal revocation proceeding. The original version of this language-shortened in <em>Walker </em>and Lange-was our statement in <em>Matter of Ratzlaff, </em>172 Mont. 439, 446, 564 P.2d 1312, 1316 (1977), that \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s subsequent conduct, not his original offense, forms the basis of revocation and reinstates the original sentence. Petitioner is not being punished twice for the same offense.\u201d Contrary to Maki\u2019s assertion, the foregoing language does not characterize a sentence imposed in a revocation proceeding as a \u201cpunishment.\u201d The language clarifies that the basis of a revocation is the violation of a sentencing condition and that a revoked sentence is not a second punishment for the underlying offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\u00b623  We hold the District Court did not err in denying Maki\u2019s motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">\u00b624 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b49-8\">JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
