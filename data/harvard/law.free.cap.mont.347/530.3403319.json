We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">\u00b62 Matt raises three issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">1. Did the District Court err in limiting Matt\u2019s cross-examination of one of the State\u2019s witnesses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">2. Did Matt\u2019s trial counsel provide constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">3. Was Matt\u2019s constitutional right to be present at all critical stages of his trial violated and, if so, was the violation harmless error?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">\u00b63 Because we conclude that Matt\u2019s conviction must be reversed under Issue 3, we do not address Issues 1 and 2. Moreover, since this case is being remanded for a new trial, we do not provide substantial details regarding the facts underlying the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">\u00b64 The State of Montana filed an information, and subsequently an amended information, charging Matt with deliberate homicide, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-102(1)(b), MCA (commonly known as \u201cfelony murder\u201d). As alleged in the State\u2019s probable-cause affidavit, the body of Steven Rodriguez was found the morning of June 22, 2004, submerged in an irrigation canal near the Clark Fork River in Missoula, Montana. The medical examiner determined that the cause of death was drowning and that Rodriguez had nonlethal injuries consistent with having been in a fight. Following an investigation, the State developed the theory that Matt, Rodriguez, Andrew Greybull, and Kevin Oldhorn had been drinking together under the Madison Street Bridge and that Matt, Greybull, and Oldhorn had taken turns beating up Rodriguez, who was \u201ctoo drunk to defend himself.\u201d Allegedly, Matt, Greybull, and Oldhorn threw Rodriguez in the canal several times, and Greybull and Oldhorn took turns holding Rodriguez\u2019s head underwater for ten to fifteen seconds at a time. They eventually left Rodriguez\u2019s body floating in the canal. According to the State, Greybull removed Rodriguez\u2019s boots during the course of these events and later sold them at a local pawnshop, and Matt then used the money obtained from selling the boots to purchase vodka.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">\u00b65 The State charged that Matt, with the purpose to promote oi facilitate the offense of robbery, aided, abetted, or attempted to aid Greybull and/or Oldhorn in the planning or commission of the robberj of Rodriguez, and that in the course of said robbery, Matt or othei persons legally accountable for the robbery caused the death oi Rodriguez. Matt pleaded not guilty to this offense, and the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>proceeded to trial in April 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">\u00b66 At the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, the trial judge, the prosecutor, and defense counsel met in the judge\u2019s chambers. Matt was not present. At the outset, the judge inquired of defense counsel, \u201cDo you have Mr. Matt coming?\u201d to which defense counsel responded, \u201cI don\u2019t mind if he\u2019s not here.\u201d A discussion took place off the record, and then, back on the record, defense counsel added, \u201cI don\u2019t need my client here. This is legal. He doesn\u2019t get any of this anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\u00b67 Four matters were addressed during the in-chambers conference. First, defense counsel renewed an objection to testimony by a police detective concerning Matt\u2019s interview with authorities. She noted that the court had reserved ruling on this objection, and she argued that the detective\u2019s testimony was cumulative of the auditory recording played to the jury and that the prejudicial effect of the testimony outweighed any probative value it might have. The prosecutor responded that he had elicited the testimony in question for the purpose of clarifying certain inconsistencies in Matt\u2019s statements. The court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">\u00b68 Second, defense counsel requested permission to call Dave McCarthy, a probation officer, to testify about the reputation for truthfulness of Shaun Nimocks, one of the State\u2019s witnesses. The court ruled that McCarthy could testify about Nimocks\u2019s reputation for truthfulness but that McCarthy could not testify about any underlying offenses or underlying allegations concerning probation violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">\u00b69 Third, defense counsel requested permission to present the testimony of a police officer who was in possession of a note which (according to counsel) Oldhorn had written to Matt while in jail and jail staff had intercepted. The prosecutor objected, arguing that the note constituted hearsay and that defense counsel could not lay a proper foundation for it. The court ruled that the note was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">\u00b610 Fourth, defense counsel moved to dismiss the charge for insufficient evidence. She argued that the prosecutor had failed to prove the elements of the underlying felony of robbery beyond a reasonable doubt, as required to satisfy the felony-murder rule under \u00a7 45-5-102(1)(b), MCA. Moreover, she argued that the prosecutor had failed to establish a \u201ccausal connection\u201d between the felonious act and Rodriguez\u2019s death. Lastly, she argued that the accomplice testimony presented by the prosecution during its case was insufficient because it was uncorroborated. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">\u00b611 The jury ultimately found Matt guilty of felony homicide, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>District Court sentenced him to 100 years in the Montana State Prison without the possibility of parole. Matt now appeals his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">\u00b612 Whether a criminal defendant\u2019s right to be present at a critical stage of his trial has been violated is a question of constitutional law. <em>Price v. State, </em>2007 MT 307, \u00b6 10, 340 Mont. 109, \u00b6 10, 172 P.3d 1236, \u00b6 10; <em>see also State v. Mizenko, </em>2006 MT 11, \u00b6 8, 330 Mont. 299, \u00b6 8, 127 P.3d 458, \u00b6 8. This Court\u2019s review of a question of constitutional law is plenary. <em>State v. LaFreniere, </em>2008 MT 99, \u00b6 7, 342 Mont. 309, \u00b6 7, 180 P.3d 1161, \u00b6 <em>7; In re A.S., </em>2004 MT 62, \u00b6 9, 320 Mont. 268, \u00b6 9, 87 P.3d 408, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">\u00b613 Was <em>Matt\u2019s constitutional right to be present at all critical stages of his trial violated and, if so, was the violation harmless error?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">\u00b6 14 Matt contends that his state and federal constitutional rights were violated because he was not included at the conference held at the close of the State\u2019s case in the trial judge\u2019s chambers. Specifically, Matt relies on his rights of confrontation and due process under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and his rights to appear and defend in person and to meet the witnesses against him face to face under Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution. Matt argues that the in-chambers conference was a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of his trial and that he did not effectively waive his right to be present at this conference. Matt further argues that the violation of his constitutional right to be present cannot be deemed harmless, and he therefore concludes that his conviction must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">\u00b6 15 In response, the State argues that the in-chambers conference was not a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of Matt\u2019s trial because \u201c[n]o witnesses were questioned\u201d and \u201cthe issues discussed were purely legal.\u201d The State also contends that a violation of a defendant\u2019s right to be present at a critical stage of the trial is not necessarily a \u201cstructural\u201d violation. Thus, the State asserts that we must affirm Matt\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">The Right to be Present</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">\u00b616 The federal constitutional right to be present at all criminal proceedings is one of the most basic rights contained in the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>State v. Tapson, </em>2001 MT 292, \u00b6 14, 307 Mont. 428, \u00b6 14, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>41 P.3d 305, \u00b6 14 (citing <em>Illinois v. Allen, </em>397 U.S. 337, 338, 90 S. Ct. 1057, 1058 (1970)). Although rooted \u201cto a large extent\u201d in the Confrontation Clause, the right to be present is also protected by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause \u201cin some situations where the defendant is not actually confronting witnesses or evidence against him.\u201d <em>United States v. Gagnon, </em>470 U.S. 522, 526, 105 S. Ct. 1482, 1484 (1985) (per curiam). A defendant has \u201ca due process right to be present in his own person whenever his presence has a relation, reasonably substantial, to the fullness of his opportunity to defend against the charge.\u201d <em>Kentucky v. Stincer, </em>482 U.S. 730, 745, 107 S. Ct. 2658, 2667 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted). The right to be present stems in part from the fact that by his physical presence, the defendant can hear and see the proceedings and can participate in the presentation and preservation of his rights. <em>Bustamante v. Eyman, </em>456 F.2d 269, 274 (9th Cir. 1972); <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>2004 MT 53, \u00b6 16, 320 Mont. 161, \u00b6 16, 85 P.3d 1279, \u00b6 16. The right is also designed to safeguard the public\u2019s interest in a fair and orderly judicial system. <em>Bustamante, </em>456 F.2d at 274-75; <em>accord Tapson, </em>\u00b6 14. Thus, the right to personal presence at all critical stages of the trial is a \u201cfundamental right[ ] of each criminal defendant.\u201d <em>Rushen v. Spain, </em>464 U.S. 114, 117, 104 S. Ct. 453, 455 (1983) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">\u00b617 Separate and independent of this federal right, \u201cthe right to appear and defend in person\u201d is contained in the Declaration of Eights of Montana\u2019s 1972 Constitution. <em>See </em>Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 24. As such, it is a fundamental right. <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 15. In <em>State v. Reed, </em>65 Mont. 51, 210 P. 756 (1922), we considered identical language in Article III, Section 16 of Montana\u2019s 1889 Constitution and observed that a defendant \u201chas the legal right to be present when the jury are hearing his case, and at all times during the proceeding of the trial, when anything is done which in any manner affects his right.\u201d <em>Reed, </em>65 Mont. at 58, 210 P. at 758 (internal quotation marks omitted). The fundamental right to be present applies without exception to those stages of the proceedings that are deemed \u201ccritical.\u201d <em>State v. Roedel, </em>2007 MT 291, \u00b6 59, 339 Mont. 489, \u00b6 59, 171 P.3d 694, \u00b6 59. This Court has defined \u201ccritical stage\u201d as \u201cany step of the proceeding where there is potential for substantial prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Ranta v. State, </em>1998 MT 95, \u00b6 17, 288 Mont. 391, \u00b6 17, 958 P.2d 670, \u00b6 17 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">\u00b618 With these principles in mind, we conclude below that (1) the in-chambers conference was a critical stage of Matt\u2019s trial, (2) Matt did not waive his right to be present at the conference, and (3) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>violation of Matt\u2019s right to be present is not harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Critical Stage</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">\u00b619 This Court has not directly addressed whether an in-chambers conference where evidentiary issues and a motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence are argued by counsel and ruled on by the trial judge constitutes a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the trial. We observe, however, that the District Court\u2019s consideration of Matt\u2019s motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence was clearly a step in the proceedings where there was \u201cpotential for substantial prejudice\u201d to Matt. <em>Ranta, </em>\u00b6 17. At that point, the charge of felony homicide could have been dismissed and Matt set free. The fact that his motion was denied and his trial on the charge accordingly resumed most certainly \u201caffect[ed] his right.\u201d Reed, 65 Mont. at 58, 210 P. at 758. The denial of the motion established that, in the District Court\u2019s view, the State had presented sufficient evidence upon which a rational trier of fact could find the essential elements of felony homicide beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See State v. Rosling, </em>2008 MT 62, \u00b6 35, 342 Mont. 1, \u00b6 35, 180 P.3d 1102, \u00b6 35. This, in turn, moved Matt one step closer to conviction and, ultimately, imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">\u00b620 Similarly, the District Court\u2019s consideration of and ruling on the evidentiary issues raised by defense counsel constituted a critical stage of Matt\u2019s trial. <em>See e.g. Talton v. Warden, </em>370 A.2d 965, 967-68 (Conn. 1976); <em>People v. Thomas, </em>208 N.W.2d 51, 56-57 (Mich. App. 1973); <em>People v. Tellier, </em>648 N.Y.S.2d 659, 660 (N.Y. App. Div. 2d Dept. 1996); <em>People v. Casiano, </em>743 N.Y.S.2d 405, 405-06 (N.Y. App. Div. 1st Dept. 2002); <em>State v. Addison, </em>496 S.E.2d 412, 413-14 (N.C. App. 1998); <em>LaPointe v. State, </em>166 S.W.3d 287, 296-98 (Tex. App. 3d Dist. 2005). The evidentiary issues raised and argued at the in-chambers conference included: (1) whether the District Court would sustain defense counsel\u2019s objection to testimony by a police detective concerning inconsistencies in Matt\u2019s statements to authorities; (2) whether defense counsel could call a probation officer in order to impeach witness Nimocks\u2019s credibility, and what the parameters of defense counsel\u2019s questioning of this witness would be; and (3) whether defense counsel could introduce into evidence the note allegedly written by Oldhom to Matt while in jail. Each of these issues, regardless of the District Court\u2019s ultimate rulings, had the potential to prejudice Matt\u2019s defense substantially.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">\u00b621 Finally, we do not agree with the State\u2019s suggestion that the in-chambers conference was not a critical stage of Matt\u2019s trial because the issues discussed were \u201cpurely legal.\u201d Even assuming, for the sake of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>argument, that Matt would not have fully grasped the legal aspects of the issues being discussed, there are other reasons why the conference constituted a critical stage of his trial. Perhaps most obvious is the fact that every criminal defendant in this state has the constitutional right to appear and defend \u201cin person.\u201d Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 24. In this connection, Matt could have participated in the preservation of his rights at the conference. <em>See Kennedy, </em>\u00b6 16 (\u201c[B]y his or her physical presence, a defendant can hear and see the proceedings, and can participate in the preservation of his or her rights.\u201d). He could have observed whether his attorney was advocating for him zealously and professionally. He could have observed the demeanor of the trial judge and the prosecutor. He could have heard their arguments, statements, and rulings regarding the evidentiary issues and his motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence. He could have provided information bearing on the matters being discussed. Based on his observations, he could have decided to change his plea in the hope of a more lenient sentence. His observations also could have informed his decision to pursue an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Ultimately, it was Matt who bore the consequences of the District Court\u2019s rulings on the matters raised by defense counsel-matters which, as stated above, had the potential to prejudice Matt\u2019s defense substantially.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">\u00b622  For these reasons, we hold that under Article II, Section 24, the in-chambers conference at which the District Court heard arguments on evidentiary issues and ruled on Matt\u2019s motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence constituted a critical stage of his trial, for which Matt had a constitutional right to be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">\u00b623 The State contends that even if the in-chambers conference was a critical stage of Matt\u2019s trial, defense counsel \u201cvalidly waived her client\u2019s presence\u201d when she told the trial judge on the record: \u201cI don\u2019t need my client here. This is legal. He doesn\u2019t get any of this anyway.\u201d Matt, however, argues that any purported waiver of his right to be present was not valid. We agree with Matt.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">\u00b624  \u201cWaiver\u201d is defined as \u201cthe voluntary abandonment of a known right.\u201d <em>State v. Bird, </em>2001 (2002<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) MT 2, \u00b6 35, 308 Mont. 75, \u00b6 35, 43 P.3d 266, \u00b6 35 (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>State v. McCarthy, </em>2004 MT 312, \u00b6 32, 324 Mont. 1, \u00b6 32, 101 P.3d 288, \u00b6 32. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>As noted, the right to appear and defend in person is a fundamental right. <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 15. Before a defendant can waive a fundamental right, such waiver, to be recognized by the courts, must be informed and intelligent, for there can be no waiver by one who does not know his rights or what he is waiving. <em>McCarthy, </em>\u00b6 32; <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 36. Thus, if a defendant chooses to waive his right to be present at a critical stage of the trial, the trial court must obtain an on-the-record personal waiver by the defendant acknowledging that the defendant voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly waives that right. <em>McCarthy, </em>\u00b6 32; <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 38; <em>see also Tapson, </em>\u00b6 28; <em>Roedel, </em>\u00b6 59; <em>State v. Aceto, </em>2004 MT 247, \u00b6\u00b6 45-46, 323 Mont. 24, \u00b6\u00b6 45-46, 100 P.3d 629, \u00b6\u00b6 45-46. This Court will not engage in presumptions of waiver. <em>McCarthy, </em>\u00b6 32; <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 35; <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 25; <em>see also State v. Walker, </em>2007 MT 34, \u00b6 14, 336 Mont. 56, \u00b6 14, 153 P.3d 614, \u00b6 14 (\u201cWe refuse to presume that a defendant waived a constitutional right.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">\u00b625 Here, because the in-chambers conference constituted a critical stage of Matt\u2019s trial, any decision to waive his right to be present had to be voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly made by Matt himself. <em>McCarthy, </em>\u00b6 32; <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 38; <em>Aceto, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 45-46. There is nothing in the record, however, amounting to an on-the-record personal waiver by Matt of his right to appear in person at the conference. For that matter, nothing in the record establishes that Matt was fully apprised of this right. <em>Cf. Tapson, </em>\u00b6 27 (\u2018While Tapson\u2019s counsel professed to waive these rights, there is nothing in the record to indicate that Tapson himself was apprised of these rights, nor is there anything in the record indicating that he personally made a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of these rights.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">\u00b626 In this regard, and contrary to the State\u2019s argument, defense counsel\u2019s remarks regarding Matt\u2019s absence are not sufficient to establish a valid waiver. Defense counsel's statements that \u201cI don\u2019t mind if he\u2019s not here\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t need my client here\u201d do not suggest that Matt, himself, had made an informed and voluntary decision to waive his right. Rather, they suggest that defense counsel personally did not see the need for Matt\u2019s presence. Of course, that perspective misses the mark, since the right at issue here is not defense counsel\u2019s to waive if she does not \u201cneed\u201d her client present. Rather, the right and the decision to waive it are personal to the defendant. <em>See State v. Martin, </em>695 N.W.2d 578, 586 (Minn. 2005) (\u201cWhile the defendant can waive his right to be present at a stage of trial, the decision to waive the right is not for counsel to make but a personal decision for defendant to make after consultation with counsel.\u201d (internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>marks omitted)), <em>abrogated on other grounds, State v. Moua Her, </em>750 N.W.2d 258, 265 n. 5 (Minn. 2008); <em>see also Bradshaw v. State, </em>806 A.2d 131, 137 (Del. 2002) (\u201cThe general rule is that the right to be present is a right that is personal to a defendant, and may not be waived by that defendant\u2019s counsel.\u201d); <em>People v. Lofton, </em>740 N.E.2d 782, 797 (Ill. 2000) (\u201cWhen the accused is not present in person, the error is not cured by the presence of his counsel, as his attorney has no power to waive his right to be present.\u201d). The error here, therefore, is that the record does not affirmatively show that Matt himself voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly waived his right to be present at the conference. <em>McCarthy, </em>\u00b6 32; <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 38; <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">\u00b627 The premise underlying the State\u2019s argument is that defense counsel may, on the defendant\u2019s behalf, effectively waive his fundamental right to be present. The State cites no authority in support of this proposition. More importantly, because Article II, Section 24 guarantees the defendant\u2019s fundamental right to appear and defend \u201cin person,\u201d we are not persuaded that this right may, as here, be summarily waived by counsel absent an on-the-record personal acknowledgment by the defendant that he has been advised of the right to be present and, after consultation with counsel, has voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly given counsel his proxy to waive that right. <em>McCarthy, </em>\u00b6 32; <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 38. Such a waiver by Matt is not established here.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">\u00b628  In sum, defense counsel\u2019s statements do not constitute an effective waiver of Matt\u2019s right to be present at the in-chambers conference, and the record does not contain a voluntary, intelligent, and knowing waiver of this right by Matt personally. For these reasons, we reject the State\u2019s contention that Matt waived his right of presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Harmless Error</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">\u00b629 Having determined that Matt was not present at a critical stage of his trial and that he did not waive his right to be present, we turn to the final inquiry: whether this constitutional violation was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">\u00b630 The Supreme Court has said that \u201cthere may be some constitutional errors which in the setting of a particular case are so unimportant and insignificant that they may, consistent with the Federal Constitution, be deemed harmless, not requiring the automatic reversal of the conviction.\u201d <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 22, 87 S. Ct. 824, 827 (1967). Before a federal constitutional error can be held harmless under <em>Chapman, </em>the reviewing court \u201cmust be able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>386 U.S. at 24, 87 S. Ct. at 828. Critically, \u201c[t]he State bears the burden of proving that an error passes muster under this standard.\u201d <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 630, 113 S. Ct. 1710, 1717 (1993); <em>see also Chapman, </em>386 U.S. at 24, 87 S. Ct. at 828 (\u201c[T]he original common-law harmless-error rule put the burden on the beneficiary of the error either to prove that there was no injury or to suffer a reversal of his erroneously obtained judgment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">\u00b631 At the same time, the Supreme Court has recognized that \u201c[s]ome constitutional violations ... by their very nature cast so much doubt on the fairness of the trial process that, as a matter of law, they can never be considered harmless.\u201d <em>Satterwhite v. Texas, </em>486 U.S. 249, 256, 108 S. Ct. 1792, 1797 (1988); <em>see also Chapman, </em>386 U.S. at 23, 87 S. Ct. at 827-28 (\u201c[T]here are some constitutional rights so basic to a fair trial that their infraction can never be treated as harmless error.\u201d). However, the Supreme Court has found a constitutional violation to be subject to \u201cautomatic reversal\u201d only in \u201ca very limited class of cases.\u201d <em>Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 8, 119 S. Ct. 1827, 1833 (1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). Examples of such violations include lack of an impartial trial judge <em>(Tumey v.

Ct. 617 (1986)), and an erroneous reasonable-doubt instruction to the jury <em>(Sullivan v. Louisiana, </em>508 U.S. 275, 113 S. Ct. 2078 (1993)). <em>See Chapman, </em>386 U.S. at 23 n. 8, 87 S.

Ct. at 1265.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">\u00b633 For purposes of analyzing whether the violation of Matt\u2019s right of presence under Article II, Section 24 constitutes harmless error, we will apply the Supreme Court\u2019s harmless-error framework, with one modification, as summarized below. In so doing, we acknowledge that we must \u201cguarantee the minimum rights established by the United States Constitution\u201d but that we otherwise \u201care not compelled to march lock-step with pronouncements of the United States Supreme Court,\u201d <em>State v. Martinez, </em>2003 MT 65, \u00b6 51, 314 Mont. 434, \u00b6 51, 67 P.3d 207, \u00b6 51, since the provisions of Article II \u201ceach constitute separate and enforceable constitutional rights insofar as the jurisdiction of the State of Montana extends,\u201d <em>Madison v. Yunker, </em>180 Mont. 54, 60, 589 P.2d 126, 129 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">\u00b634 We have long recognized the proposition that not all constitutional violations amount to reversible error. <em>See e.g. State v. LaMere, </em>2000 MT 45, \u00b6\u00b6 22, 39, 298 Mont. 358, \u00b6\u00b6 22, 39, 2 P.3d 204, \u00b6\u00b6 22, 39; <em>State v. Johnson, </em>233 Mont. 473, 476-77, 760 P.2d 760, 761-62 (1988). We have also recognized that a constitutional violation requires automatic reversal of a conviction if the violation contaminates the framework within which the trial proceeds or if the constitutional right is so basic to a fair trial that its infraction can never be treated as harmless. <em>See LaMere, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23, 48-50. Conversely, a constitutional violation that falls outside this limited class of \u201cautomatic reversal\u201d cases must be evaluated for harmlessness. <em>See LaMere, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22, 39-45; <em>see also e.g. State v. Gladue, </em>208 Mont. 174, 182-83, 677 P.2d 1028, 1032 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"AfB\">\u00b635 Thus, the first question is whether, under the circumstances of the particular case, the violation of the right to be present constitutes a \u201cstructural defect\u201d-i.e., whether it contaminated the framework within which the trial proceeded or casts so much doubt on the fairness of the trial that it cannot be treated as harmless-thus requiring automatic reversal. If the violation does not fall in this category, the second question is whether the violation is harmless. In this connection, the Supreme Court has made it clear that \u201c[t]he State bears the burden of proving that an error passes muster under [the harmless-error] standard.\u201d <em>Brecht, </em>507 U.S. at 630, 113 S. Ct. at 1717; <em>see also Chapman, </em>386 U.S. at 24, 87 S. Ct. at 828. In implementing this rule, however, we decline to employ the \u201cbeyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>doubt\u201d terminology articulated in <em>Chapman, </em>386 U.S. at 24, 87 S. Ct. at 828, and subsequent cases. \u201cBeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d is a standard prescribed for a trier of fact. <em>See Oberson v. United States Dept. of Agriculture, </em>2007 MT 293, \u00b6 34, 339 Mont. 519, \u00b6 34, 171 P.3d 715, \u00b6 34 (Leaphart, Nelson, &amp; Cotter, JJ., concurring) <em>(citing Branson School Dist. RE-82 v. Romer, </em>161 F.3d 619, 636 n. 15 (10th Cir. 1998)). In <em>Chapman, </em>the Supreme Court acknowledged that \u201c[t]here is little, if any, difference\u201d between a \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard and a \u201c[no] reasonable possibility standard. <em>Chapman, </em>386 U.S. at 24, 87 S. Ct. at 828; <em>see also United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 679 n. 9 105 S. Ct. 3375, 3382 n. 9 (1985). Notably, we apply the latter standard when evaluating whether erroneously admitted evidence contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>See State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, \u00b6 46, 306 Mont. 215, \u00b6 46, 32 P.3d 735, \u00b6 46. Likewise, here, we conclude that the \u201cno reasonable possibility standard is preferable, in terms of terminology, to the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard, given that there is little, if any, difference between these two standards in terms of the burden on the State, and given that this Court does not sit as a fact-finder when evaluating a constitutional violation for harmlessness. Accordingly, the burden on the State is to demonstrate that there is no reasonable possibility the violation of the defendant\u2019s Article II, Section 24 right to be present prejudiced the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"A5B-\">\u00b636 We note that the foregoing analytical approach is similar to, but distinguishable from, the framework set forth in <em>Van Kirk. </em>In <em>Van Kirk, </em>we articulated a two-step analysis for determining whether an alleged error prejudiced a criminal defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial and, therefore, is reversible. As here, the first step is to determine whether the claimed error is \u201cstructural,\u201d i.e., whether it affects the framework within which the trial proceeds. <em>See Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 38. We noted that structural error \u201cis presumptively prejudicial and is not subject to harmless error review.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 38. At this juncture, however, the <em>Van Kirk </em>analysis diverges from the approach set out above for analyzing right-of-presence violations. In <em>Van Kirk, </em>we explained that, in contrast to \u201cstructural\u201d error, \u201ctrial\u201d error \u201ctypically occurs during the presentation of a case to the jury\u201d and \u201cis amenable to qualitative assessment by a reviewing court for prejudicial impact relative to the other evidence introduced at trial.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 40. We held that, \u201cin order to prove that trial error was harmless, the State must demonstrate that there is no reasonable possibility that the inadmissible evidence might have contributed to the conviction.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 47. \u201cTo do this,\u201d we explained, \u201cthe State must demonstrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>that the fact-finder was presented with admissible evidence that proved the same facts as the tainted evidence and, qualitatively, by comparison, the tainted evidence would not have contributed to the conviction.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">\u00b637 Notably, this \u201ctrial error\u201d test also places the burden on the State to demonstrate that the error was harmless. But the substantive inquiries under the test, which focus on admissible and inadmissible evidence (see <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 40-47), are unsuitable for determining whether a nonstructural, right-of-presence violation is harmless. For one thing, the right to be present at a critical-stage proceeding serves a broader range of interests than simply ensuring that inadmissible evidence is properly excluded at trial. As explained above, the right more generally guarantees the defendant the ability to appear and defend in person and to participate in the presentation and preservation of his or her rights. Moreover, violation of the right to be present is not necessarily harmless just because there is no reasonable possibility inadmissible evidence contributed to the conviction. If the trial judge communicates with a deliberating jury in the defendant\u2019s absence (see <em>e.g. State v. Tapson, </em>discussed below), a qualitative assessment of the evidence introduced at trial does not reveal whether this violation is harmless. For these reasons, we conclude that <em>Van Kirk\u2019s </em>\u201ctrial error\u201d test is inapt here and that the State must demonstrate harmlessness in light of the interests the right of presence was designed to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">\u00b638  To summarize, therefore, we hold that once it has been established that the defendant\u2019s fundamental right to be present has been violated, prejudice is presumed. If the violation constitutes a \u201cstructural defect,\u201d then the presumption of prejudice is conclusive, since the error is not amenable to harmless-error analysis. If the violation is not structural, then the State has the burden to rebut the presumption by demonstrating there is no reasonable possibility the violation prejudiced the defendant in light of the interests the right of presence was designed to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">\u00b639 Although this approach has not been articulated in this manner in our recent right-of-presence cases, the approach is nevertheless consistent with our resolutions of those cases. In <em>State v. Tapson, </em>2001 MT 292, 307 Mont. 428, 41 P.3d 305, we decided that Tapson\u2019s right to be present was violated when the trial judge entered the jury room to deliver new verdict forms and to instruct the jury, without counsel or Tapson present and without a waiver by Tapson of his right to be present. <em>See Tapson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14-33. As to whether this violation was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>harmless, we observed that \u201c[although the most important factor here is the actual intrusion of the Judge into the jury room during deliberations, the lack of a record makes it impossible to say that, beyond a reasonable doubt, there was no prejudice to the defendant, and therefore harmless error.\u201d <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 31 (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we held that the district court had committed reversible error by entering the jury room. <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 33. Implicit in our reasoning are the conclusions that the constitutional violation was amenable to harmless error review and that, absent a showing of harmlessness in the record, the conviction had to be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">\u00b640 Similarly, in <em>State v. Bird, </em>2001 (2002) MT 2, 308 Mont. 75, 43 P.3d 266, we determined that Bird\u2019s right to be present was violated due to his exclusion from a number of individual voir dire sessions conducted in chambers. <em>See Bird, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23-40. On the question of whether this violation was harmless, we held that \u201cjury selection errors are \u2018structural\u2019 errors and as such, they are not amenable to harmless error review.\u201d <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 39 (citing <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 39-50). Accordingly, we reversed Bird\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>Bird, </em>\u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">\u00b641 In <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>2004 MT 53, 320 Mont. 161, 85 P.3d 1279, the trial judge questioned one of the jurors in chambers concerning the juror\u2019s telephone contact, on the second day of trial, with a detective who was scheduled to testify. <em>See Kennedy, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 1, 8, 10. We held that this meeting between the judge and the juror constituted a critical stage of Kennedy\u2019s trial. <em>Kennedy, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26-27. We further held that the court violated Kennedy\u2019s right of presence when it excluded him from this meeting. <em>Kennedy, </em>\u00b6 27. With regard to whether this violation was harmless, we first observed that, unlike <em>Tapson, </em>the record was sufficient to assess whether Kennedy had been prejudiced. <em>Kennedy, </em>\u00b6 33. We ultimately concluded that the error was harmless, reasoning that \u201csuch exclusion did not cause Kennedy prejudice because any opportunity Kennedy missed to question [the juror] about his conversation with [the detective] was mooted when [the juror] was removed from the jury panel and [the detective] was excluded as a witness.\u201d <em>Kennedy, </em>\u00b6 34. Thus, we found the error in excluding Kennedy from the meeting to be harmless based on the impact (or lack thereof) that this violation had on his right to an impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">\u00b642 Lastly, in <em>State v. Mann, </em>2006 MT 160, 332 Mont. 476, 139 P.3d 159, we concluded that the district court violated Mann\u2019s constitutional right to be present when it excluded him from a pretrial hearing, the purpose of which was to decide whether Mann would represent himself or proceed with his current counsel. <em>Mann, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17, 21. During this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>hearing, defense counsel portrayed Mann in a negative light. <em>See Mann, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-21. On the question of whether this violation required reversal, we first noted that \u201cwe consider the effect the violation has on the defendant to determine whether the defendant suffered any conceivable prejudice.\u201d <em>Mann, </em>\u00b6 15. We then observed that Mann\u2019s exclusion from the hearing prevented him from exercising in a meaningful way his constitutional rights to receive effective assistance of counsel or to represent himself at trial. <em>Mann, </em>\u00b6 21. Accordingly, we reversed his conviction and remanded for a new trial. <em>Mann, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"APd\">\u00b643 Turning now to the case at hand, the first question we must answer is whether, under the circumstances of this case, the violation of Matt\u2019s right to be present at the in-chambers conference constituted a \u201cstructural defect.\u201d <em>Cf. Rushen v. Spain, </em>464 U.S. 114, 117 n. 2, 104 S. Ct. 453, 455 n. 2 (1983) (per curiam) (observing that \u201cviolations of the right to be present dining all critical stages of the proceedings\u201d are subject to harmless error analysis, \u201cunless the deprivation, by its very nature, cannot be harmless\u201d). Matt suggests that the violation constitutes a structural defect under <em>Tapson </em>and <em>Bird. </em>The State, however, argues based <em>on Kennedy </em>and <em>Mann </em>that the violation is not structural. We agree with the State. Nothing discussed at the conference and ruled on by the District Court concerned or affected the framework within which Matt\u2019s tried proceeded or necessarily rendered the trial fundamentally unfair. The court overruled defense counsel\u2019s objection to testimony by a police detective, granted defense counsel's request to call a probation officer to impeach witness Nimocks\u2019s credibility, denied defense counsel\u2019s request to introduce into evidence the note allegedly written by Oldhorn to Matt while in jail, and denied defense counsel\u2019s motion to dismiss for insufficient evidence. None of these issues and rulings contaminated the trial mechanism along the lines that a biased judge, lack of counsel, an erroneous reasonable-doubt instruction, or a jury-selection error would.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">\u00b644 Having determined that the constitutional violation here was not structural, the second question is whether the State has demonstrated that there is no reasonable possibility the violation prejudiced Matt in light of the interests the right of presence was designed to protect. In this regard, we note that the State does not provide a harmless-error analysis in its appellate brief. Rather, the State\u2019s analysis under Issue 3 focuses on two matters: whether the in-chambers conference was a critical-stage proceeding, and whether defense counsel validly waived Matt\u2019s right to be present at the conference. The State does assert that Matt has failed to demonstrate how his absence \u201cmade the in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>chambers conference unfair\u201d and how his presence \u201cmay have made a difference.\u201d These assertions, however, reflect an incorrect assumption that Matt has the burden to demonstrate prejudice flowing from the violation of his right to be present. Apparently in the State\u2019s view, if the right of presence is violated, then the violation is presumed harmless and the defendant has to demonstrate the contrary in order to obtain relief. We reject this approach, not only because it is directly contrary to Supreme Court precedent, <em>see Brecht, </em>507 U.S. at 630, 113 S. Ct. at 1717 (\u201cThe State bears the burden of proving that an error passes muster under [the harmless-error] standard.\u201d), but also because it is not logically sound, <em>see Chapman, </em>386 U.S. at 24, 87 S. Ct. at 828 (\u201c[T]he original common-law harmless-error rule put the burden on the beneficiary of the error either to prove that there was no injury or to suffer a reversal of his erroneously obtained judgment.\u201d). That the burden to show harmlessness is on the State should come as no surprise, given that we reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction in <em>Tapson </em>because it was \u201cimpossible to say that... there was no prejudice to the defendant, and therefore harmless error,\u201d <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 31 (internal quotation marks omitted), and given that the State has the burden under our analogous test in <em>Van Kirk </em>\u201cto demonstrate that the error at issue was not prejudicial,\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">\u00b645  Accordingly, because the State has not met its burden of demonstrating that there is no reasonable possibility Matt was prejudiced by the violation his right to be present at the in-chambers conference, we hold that this constitutional error cannot be deemed harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">\u00b646 The in-chambers hearing held in Matt\u2019s absence at the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief was a critical stage of his trial, Matt did not validly waive his right to be present at the hearing, and failing to include him at the hearing violated his right under Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution to appear and defend in person. The State has not met its burden of demonstrating that this error was harmless. Accordingly, we reverse Matt\u2019s conviction of deliberate homicide (felony murder), vacate the District Court\u2019s judgment, and remand this case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">\u00b647 Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b566-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b557-8\"> <em>Bird </em>was decided January 15, 2002, and, thus, should have been given a 2002 designation.

The Court invents a burden on the State to somehow show beyond a reasonable doubt there is no reasonable possibility that Matt\u2019s absence from the hearing at the close of the State\u2019s evidence prejudiced him. The Court then ignores the record as well as \u00a7 46-20-701(1), MCA, and concludes the judgment must be reversed-not because Matt was prejudiced, but because the State did not present a sufficient response to an argument that Matt did not make.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">\u00b649 Today, the Court sneaks up on the State by creating a new burden it must satisfy if prejudice is alleged. The Court\u2019s holding today contravenes our holding in <em>State v. Peters, </em>146 Mont. 188, 405 P.2d 642 (1965). In <em>Peters, </em>the defendant was not present on motions to exclude evidence and dismiss the information. The Court held a defendant\u2019s constitutional and statutory right to be present at trial does not encompass proceedings before the court involving matters of law because he would have merely been a spectator. <em>Peters, </em>146 Mont. at 196, 405 P.2d at 646-47. At the hearing in question in this case, only matters of law were discussed. As the record is complete, and Matt points to nothing of substance where he could have been of assistance to his counsel, nor to any error in the District Court\u2019s rulings; this Court should not reverse a conviction on appeal because the State did not invent a prejudice argument for Matt and then proceed to successfully refute it.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">\u00b650 No previous Montana precedent concerning the right to be present requires the State to satisfy a \u201cburden.\u201d <em>See Mann, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-17; <em>State v. Riggs, </em>2005 MT 124, \u00b6 54, 327 Mont. 196, \u00b6 54, 113 P.3d 281, \u00b6 54; <em>Kennedy, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32-34; <em>State v. Stroud, </em>210 Mont. 58, 67-68, 683 P.2d 459, 464 (1984); <em>See also DuBray v. State, </em>2008 MT 121, \u00b6\u00b6 36-37, 342 Mont. 520, \u00b6\u00b6 36-37, 182 P.3d 753, \u00b6\u00b6 36-37. If a defendant\u2019s right to be present at a critical stage of his trial is denied, courts are to review for possible constitutional violations \u201c \u2018in light of the whole record.\u2019 \u201d <em>U.S. v. Rosales-Rodriguez, </em>289 F.3d 1106, 1110 (9th Cir. 2002) (quoting <em>U.S. v. Gagnon, </em>470 U.S. 522, 526-27, 105 S. Ct. 1482, 1484 (1985)). \u00b651 In <em>Tapson </em>there is a reference to \u201creasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Tapson, </em>\u00b6 31. But, the Court imposes no burden on the prosecution to show the error was harmless. Rather than place some sort of burden on the State at the appellate level, this Court should carefully examine the record to determine if the denial of the right to be present could have reasonably contributed to a conviction. If our examination of the record reveals a defendant was prejudiced by his absence, or if the record is inadequate to determine the defendant was not prejudiced by his absence, we have no choice but to reverse a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>\u00b652 In <em>Riggs, </em>the Court determined the district court\u2019s error was harmless because \u201cthe defendant ... made no persuasive claim of prejudice arising\u201d from his absence when the court spoke to two jurors outside of his presence. <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 54. The Court recently reiterated the <em>Riggs </em>language in <em>DuBray. DuBray, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 36-38. From this language in <em>Riggs </em>and <em>DuBray, </em>it is obvious a defendant must make a persuasive claim to the appellate court that he was prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">\u00b653 The Court today posits the State \u201cincorrectfly] assum[ed]\u201d Matt has the burden to demonstrate prejudice. Opinion, \u00b6 44. However, there is no indication the State assumed anything. It responded in the only way it could to an unsupported assertion of prejudice-by pointing out that the record showed no prejudice. <em>Riggs </em>and <em>DuBray </em>stand for the proposition that a defendant who wishes his conviction reversed on appeal because he was absent from a hearing must point to something in the record indicating he might have been prejudiced. Matt did not do so. His real argument is that his absence constitutes structural error and reversal is automatic.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">\u00b654 At the appellate level, parties do not present evidence to carry a \u201cburden\u201d of \u201cpersuading a fact-finder to view the facts in a way that favors that party.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>190 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 7th ed., West 1999). They make arguments. This Court\u2019s job is to consider the arguments, review the record, and then determine which party\u2019s argument is more persuasive. By statute and applicable precedent, our appellate review of the record is not to be conducted in terms of burdens of proof. Rather, the decision is to be made by a review of the record to determine if the error resulted in prejudice, as required by \u00a7 46-20-701(1), MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">Whenever the record on appeal contains any order, ruling, or proceeding of the trial court against the convicted person affecting the convicted person\u2019s substantial rights on the appeal of the cause, together with any required objection of the convicted person, the supreme court on that appeal shall consider the orders, rulings, or proceedings and the objections thereto and shall reverse or affirm the cause on the appeal according to the substantial rights of the respective parties, as shown upon the record. A cause may not be reversed by reason of any error committed by the trial court against the convicted person unless the record shows that the error was prejudicial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Section <em>46-20-701(1), </em>MCA. This approach is consistent with our analysis in <em>Mann </em>and <em>Kennedy </em>where, at the prejudice phase of the analysis, there are no discussions of burdens or standards of proof. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number><em>Mann, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-21; <em>Kennedy, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">\u00b655 The Court quotes <em>Mann, </em>saying: \u201c[o]n the question of whether this violation required reversal, we first noted that, \u2018we consider the effect the violation has on the defendant to determine whether the defendant suffered any conceivable prejudice.\u2019 \u201d Opinion, \u00b6 42. <em>Mann </em>does not place a burden on the State. The language quoted by the Court does not limit this Court\u2019s ability to consider the entire record.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">\u00b656 The Court\u2019s statement in \u00b6 14-that Matt argues the violation of his constitutional right to be present at the hearing at the close of the State\u2019s evidence cannot be deemed harmless-is misleading. In the issues Matt presents for appellate review, he first recites a portion of what happened at the hearing, and then states, as a fact, his constitutional right to be present was violated. The thrust of Matt\u2019s argument concerning this appeal issue is simply that this Court, in <em>Bird </em>and in <em>Tapson, </em>concluded a structural error existed if a defendant was not present at a critical stage of his trial, and had not waived his presence. Matt then acknowledges the Court backed away from that rule in <em>Kennedy, </em>but goes on to state that <em>Kennedy </em>is no longer good law as the United States District Court disagreed with that decision. Thus, Matt\u2019s primary argument is that this Court should conclude his absence at the hearing in question was structural error, and thus the judgment must automatically be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">\u00b657 In an offhand assertion, without even attempting a harmless error analysis, Matt\u2019s brief states in a conclusory fashion that it is \u201ceasy to conceive\u201d how his absence created prejudice. Matt does not make any argument supported by authorities that any of the rulings of the District Court at the hearing in question were erroneous, that things would have been different had he been there, or that he was in any way led astray. He only states in a conclusory fashion he was prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">\u00b658 In \u00b6 15, the Court mentions that the State argued the in-chambers hearing was not a critical stage of the trial. The Court decides this was a critical stage of the trial. The Court then notes the State argued that a violation of a defendant\u2019s right to be present is not necessarily a structural error. The Court agrees that Matt\u2019s absence was not a structural error. The Court then reverses Matt\u2019s conviction by overlooking that the State responded in the only way it could to Matt\u2019s ofihand, unsupported claim he was somehow prejudiced by his absence at a critical stage of his trial. As Matt did not say how he was prejudiced, the State pointed out in its response brief that Matt failed to demonstrate how his absence prejudiced him.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>\u00b659 Matt made no attempt to point out any error in the District Court\u2019s rulings at the in-chambers hearing. He did not make a cogent argument how his presence would have made any substantial difference. Nor did he make any intelligible argument concerning how he suffered prejudice because of his absence. The Court has ignored its oft repeated rule that it will not consider unsupported arguments in support of positions taken on appeal. <em>State v. Humphrey, </em>2008 MT 358, \u00b6 11, 346 Mont. 150, \u00b6 11, 194 P.3d 643, \u00b6 11 (declining to consider an issue because defendant\u2019s argument consisted of an \u201coffhand assertion\u201d supported only by one distinguishable case); <em>State v. Ochadleus, </em>2005 MT 88, \u00b6 32, 326 Mont. 441, \u00b6 32, 110 P.3d 448, \u00b6 32 (citing <em>State v. Rodarte, </em>2002 MT 317, \u00b6 15, 313 Mont. 131, \u00b6 15, 60 P.3d 983, \u00b6 15). Even under the Court\u2019s incorrect analysis of the law, it is improper to reverse the judgment because the State did not adequately refute arguments Matt did not make.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">\u00b660 The record affirmatively shows that Matt\u2019s presence at the hearings would have been useless, as the District Court\u2019s rulings were all correct. The United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution do not assure \u201c\u2018the privilege of presence when presence would be useless, or the benefit but a shadow.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Schenk, </em>151 Mont. 493, 499, 444 P.2d 861, 864 (1968) (quoting <em>Snyder v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, </em>291 U.S. 97, 54 S. Ct. 330 (1934), <em>overruled on other grounds, Malloy v. Hogan, </em>378 U.S. 1, 84 S. Ct. 1489 (1964)). The end result of this case is that a deliberate homicide conviction is reversed, based on the shadow of a benefit-at best-to Matt.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">\u00b661 Matt and his counsel will be thrilled that the Court has taken this opportunity to reverse his conviction by creating a new appellate burden that he neither thought of nor argued for, and that the State had no inkling that it was required to satisfy. However, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b570-6\">DISTRICT COURT JUDGE MCKINNON, sitting in for JUSTICE MORRIS, joins in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b570-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"Aqz\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">\u00b662 I concur in the Court\u2019s Opinion. I write separately to address the foregoing Dissent\u2019s reliance on <em>State v. Riggs, </em>2005 MT 124, 327 Mont. 196, 113 P.3d 281, and <em>DuBray v. State, </em>2008 MT 121, 342 Mont. 520, 182 P.3d 753. In my view, both cases are readily distinguishable on their procedural facts and, therefore, also inapplicable on the law. I premise my concurrence, however, on a much more fimdamental-indeed, fatal-flaw in relying on <em>Riggs </em>and <em>DuBray.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">\u00b663 The United States Supreme Court has held that, \u201cbefore a federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>constitutional error can be held harmless, the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>See Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S. Ct. 824, 828 (1967). Implicit in this standard is the premise that a constitutional error is harmful on its face, unless shown to be otherwise. Indeed, the Supreme Court pointed out that \u201cthe original common-law harmless-error rule put the burden on the beneficiary of the error either to prove that there was no injury or to suffer a reversal of his erroneously obtained judgment.\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>386 U.S. at 24, 87 S. Ct. at 828. Accordingly, the Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[t]he State bears the burden of proving that an error passes muster under [the Chapman] standard.\u201d <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 630, 113 S. Ct. 1710, 1717 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"Atv\">\u00b664 This Court is not required to march lockstep with pronouncements of the United States Supreme Court if Montana\u2019s Constitution provides greater protection than is guaranteed by the United States Constitution. We are required, however, to guarantee the minimum rights established by the United States Constitution. <em>See State v. Martinez, </em>2003 MT 65, \u00b6 51, 314 Mont. 434, \u00b6 51, 67 P.3d 207, \u00b6 51. As a result, we simply cannot-in the face of a violation of the constitutional right to be present at critical stages-ignore the Supreme Court\u2019s determination that the State bears the burden of proving that a constitutional error passes muster under the <em>Chapman </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"Agv\">\u00b665 Finally, the Dissent\u2019s concern over the burden placed on the State here is, in my view, somewhat excessive. The \u201cburden\u201d being placed in this case is, first, on defense counsel to stop purporting to waive the rights of the accused being represented and, instead, to insist on the presence of the client. The burden is placed, secondarily, on the trial court to stop allowing such nonchalant waivers. If counsel for the accused and for the State work to ensure that criminal defendants are present at critical stages, the State will not face any additional burden at all.</p>\n<judges id=\"b571-4\">JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON and LEAPHART join in the foregoing special concurrence of CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b571-5\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"AYc\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">\u00b666 I cannot conclude there is reversible error when a trial judge, dining a mid-trial conference, inquires of defense counsel concerning the presence of the defendant and receives defense counsel's assurance that the defendant\u2019s presence is not necessary, and then conducts the conference without the defendant. I agree with the State that we should affirm on waiver grounds, as I believe defense counsel's actions constitute invited error and that reversal on such grounds -undermines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>our legal system.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">\u00b667 Of course, no objection was made with regard to Matt\u2019s presence in the conference at issue here. Just the opposite, in response to the District Court\u2019s inquiry, defense counsel assured the court that the conference could continue without the Defendant. In <em>Williams v. Fla., </em>687 So. 2d 858 (Fla. Dist. App. 1997), the Florida court concluded that such actions by defense counsel with regard to his client\u2019s presence during trial constituted \u201cinvited error\u201d which was not reversible. \u201cIt is well-established law that where the trial judge has extended counsel an opportunity to cure any error, and counsel fails to take advantage of the opportunity, such error, if any, was invited and will not warrant reversal.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>687 So. 2d at 859 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">\u00b668 Here, the District Court gave defense counsel the explicit opportunity to correct the error, but counsel did not do so. Under these circumstances, defense counsel's waiver of the defendant\u2019s right to appear should be affirmed to protect the integrity of the trial process from invited error. A trial judge must be able to rely upon the assurances given by defense counsel in response to issues raised by the judge during the course of the trial if the legal system is to properly function. We should not burden the judge with the duty of second-guessing defense counsel\u2019s trial decisions, as there is a process in place for counsel\u2019s actions to be later challenged and reviewed. Indeed, a trial involves numerous potential waivers of a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, such as the decision to forego cross-examination of a state witness, the decision for a defendant to testify, and the decision to pass a jury panel for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">\u00b669 I would affirm on the basis of this invited error. The Defendant, if he chose, could pursue the recourse of challenging his counsel\u2019s actions within a post-conviction proceeding as ineffective.</p>\n<judges id=\"b572-7\">DISTRICT COURT JUDGE MCKINNON joins in the dissenting Opinion of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
