Belanger appeals the revocation of his deferred sentence by the Twentieth Judicial District Court, Sanders County. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">\u00b62 The State filed an information in March 2003 charging Belanger with one count of sexual assault, a felony, and one count of sexual intercourse without consent, also a felony. These offenses allegedly occurred in January 2003. The parties ultimately entered into a plea agreement under \u00a7 46-12-211(1)(b), MCA. Pursuant to the agreement, the State filed an amended information charging Belanger with one count of criminal endangerment, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-207, MCA, and Belanger pleaded guilty to this offense on January 13, 2004. The District Court accepted the plea and the plea agreement. Thereafter, on April 13, 2004, the court sentenced Belanger in accordance with the plea agreement. Specifically, the court deferred imposition of sentence for three years and placed Belanger on formal probation for the term of the deferment.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">\u00b63 Belanger\u2019s probation was subject to a number of conditions. Of relevance here are Conditions 10, 16, 18, and 21, which stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">10. The Defendant shall comply with all city, county, state, and federal laws, and ordinances, and conduct himself/herself as a good citizen. The Defendant shall report any arrests or contacts with law enforcement to the Probation/Parole Officer within 72 hours. The Defendant shall at all times be cooperative and truthful in all communications and dealings with the Probation/Parole Officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">16. The Defendant shall register as a Violent Offender pursuant to \u00a746-23-501 et seq.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">18. The Defendant, under the supervision and direction of the Probation/Parole Officer, shall enroll under, actively participate in and successfully complete all phases of a treatment program for sexual offenders offered by any competent treatment center or counselor determined by the Probation/Parole Officer to be appropriate under the circumstances. The Defendant shall follow any treatment plans recommended by the counselors or psychologists. The Defendant shall continue treatment for as long as the Probation/Parole Officer deems necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-9\">21. The Defendant shall not use or possess a personal computer to view, possess or use pornography. Defendant shall not use, view or possess erotica, X-rated videos, adult books or magazines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>such as Play-Boy or Penthouse, frequent adult book stores, topless bars, massage parlors, or use the service of prostitutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">\u00b64 On September 29, 2004, the State filed a petition to revoke Belanger\u2019s deferred sentence. According to the probation/parole officer\u2019s Report of Violation, Belanger allegedly violated Conditions 10, 18, and 21 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\">Condition 10: \u201cTwo minor males have come forward and reported to the Sanders County Sheriffs office and this writer that the Defendant has made repeated requests to trade sex for money.\u201d Condition 18: \u201cThe Defendant was ordered by the Court to enter Sex Offender Treatment on 4/13/04 and he signed the rules of Probation also stating he was to enter into treatment. The Defendant was given a chance to enter into an interstate transfer prior to entering treatment, when the transfer was denied the Defendant was again ordered to start treatment. The Defendant did not enter treatment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">Condition 21: \u201cThe Defendants [sic] landlord/employer brought to this officer a Missoula Library book about homosexual teenagers and an adult sex magazine they found in the Defendants [sic] room which they searched after hearing of the two minors [sic] report. The landlord was not acting as an agent of this office or the police at the time of the search.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">\u00b65 Belanger denied all of the allegations, and the matter proceeded to revocation hearing on January 25, 2005. The State called three witnesses, and Belanger testified in his own defense. During the course of the hearing, Belanger objected to evidence related to the incident underlying the alleged violation of Condition 10 on the ground that he had been charged in a separate action with an offense arising out of that incident. The District Court sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">\u00b66 The District Court ultimately found that the State had met its burden of proof, and the court accordingly revoked Belanger\u2019s deferred sentence. Thereafter, the court sentenced him to the Department of Corrections for a period of ten years, with five years suspended. The court imposed on Belanger\u2019s suspended sentence the same terms and conditions set forth in the court\u2019s original April 2004 judgment. Belanger now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">\u00b67 Belanger raises two issues on appeal, which we restate as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATk\">1. Was the District Court\u2019s decision to revoke Belanger\u2019s deferred sentence supported by a preponderance of the evidence in favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>of the State?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-4\">2. Is Condition 16, requiring Belanger to register as a violent offender, illegal?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\u00b68 The State concedes Issue 2. The State observes that criminal endangerment is not one of the crimes for which registration as a violent offender is required under \u00a7\u00a7 46-23-502(9) and -504(1), MCA, and that registration as a violent offender was not part of the parties\u2019 plea agreement as permitted under \u00a7 46-23-512, MCA. Accordingly, we only address Issue 1 in this Opinion. Moreover, we order that Condition 16 of the District Court\u2019s April 19, 2004 Judgment be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">\u00b69 The standard for revocation of a suspended or deferred sentence is whether the judge is reasonably satisfied that the conduct of the probationer has not been what he agreed it would be if he were given liberty. <em>State v. Averill, </em>2001 MT 161, \u00b6 22, 306 Mont. 106, \u00b6 22, 30 P.3d 1059, \u00b6 22. We review a district court\u2019s decision to revoke a deferred or suspended sentence to determine whether the court\u2019s decision was supported by a preponderance of the evidence in favor of the State and, if so, whether the court abused its discretion. Section 46-18-203(6), (7), MCA; <em>State v. Price, </em>2008 MT 319, \u00b6 13, 346 Mont. 106, \u00b6 13, 193 P.3d 921, \u00b6 13; <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>2002 MT 47, \u00b6 17, 309 Mont. 1, \u00b6 17, 43 P.3d 318, \u00b6 17. A district court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily without the employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">\u00b610 <em>Was the District Court\u2019s decision to revoke Belanger\u2019s deferred sentence supported by a preponderance of the evidence in favor of the State?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">\u00b611 Given that the District Court did not permit evidence relating to the alleged violation of Condition 10, the only conditions at issue here are Condition 18 (enroll in a treatment program for sexual offenders) and Condition 21 (do not use, view, or possess adult books or magazines, etc.). Belanger contends that the State did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Belanger violated either or both of these conditions. We conclude that the evidence related to Condition 21 is sufficient to resolve this issue. <em>See State v. Gillingham, </em>2008 MT 38, \u00b6 28, 341 Mont. 325, \u00b6 28, 176 P.3d 1075, \u00b6 28 <em>(\u201cA </em>single violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>of the conditions of a suspended sentence is sufficient to support a district court\u2019s revocation of that sentence.\u201d); <em>State v. Baird, </em>2006 MT 266, \u00b6 17, 334 Mont. 185, \u00b6 17, 145 P.3d 995, \u00b6 17 (\u201cThere are no minor violations of probationary agreements and even one violation may be sufficient for revocation [of a deferred sentence].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">\u00b612 Again, Condition 21 states, in pertinent part, as follows: \u201cDefendant shall not use, view or possess erotica, X-rated videos, adult books or magazines such as Play-Boy or Penthouse, frequent adult book stores, topless bars, massage parlors, or use the service of prostitutes.\u201d The State clarifies in its appellate brief that it \u201cdid not contend below, nor does it now, that possession of the library book was a probation violation.\u201d Accordingly, we focus exclusively on the magazine as the basis for revoking Belanger\u2019s probation. The testimony at the revocation hearing reflects that Belanger\u2019s landlord found a magazine under Belanger\u2019s bed. Although Belanger denied that the magazine was his, the District Court evidently did not find his testimony in this regard to be credible. Belanger acknowledges on appeal that the District Court\u2019s implicit finding that he used, viewed, or possessed the magazine \u201cwas within [the court\u2019s] discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">\u00b613 Thus, the crux of the issue is whether the magazine comes within the meaning of \u201cadult books or magazines such as Play-Boy or Penthouse.\u201d The evidence reflects that it does. Sandy Van Skyock, Belanger\u2019s probation/parole officer, testified that the magazine contained photographs of \u201c[m]ales and females engaging in sexual acts without clothing.\u201d Van Skyock testified that, in her opinion, it was \u201can adult book or magazine.\u201d Belanger did not challenge that opinion. To the contrary, defense counsel referred to the magazine on one occasion during the hearing as \u201cthat x-rated magazine\u201d and on another as \u201ca 2002 pornographic magazine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">\u00b614  Belanger contends that the District Court could not have determined whether the magazine qualified as \u201cpornography\u201d or \u201cerotica\u201d without actually seeing the magazine, which was not introduced by the State into evidence. We express no view on that contention for the simple reason that it is irrelevant. Condition 21 prohibited \u201cadult books or magazines such as Play-Boy or Penthouse.\u201d The District Court determined that the magazine found under Belanger\u2019s bed qualified as an \u201cadult\u201d magazine \u201csuch as Play-Boy or Penthouse.\u201d We hold that the evidence was sufficient to support the District Court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">\u00b615 Belanger has not argued any other basis for concluding that the District Court abused its discretion in revoking his probation. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment with one exception: We order that Condition 16 (requiring Belanger to register as a violent offender) be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\u00b616 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded with instructions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b86-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES MORRIS, COTTER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
