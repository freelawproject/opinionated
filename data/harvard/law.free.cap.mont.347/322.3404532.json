After a contested case hearing, the hearing examiner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>awarded judgment against Denke on her claims against the City and partial judgment in favor of Denke on her claims against Shoemaker. The Human Rights Commission affirmed the examiner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">\u00b62 Denke then filed a petition for judicial review in the Twentieth Judicial District Court, Sanders County. In the course of the proceedings, Shoemaker filed a bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Montana. As a result, the District Court stayed the proceedings as they relate to Shoemaker. The proceedings continued, however, with respect to the City; and the court ultimately denied Denke\u2019s petition on the same grounds relied on by the hearing examiner-namely, that the City is immune from suit and is not liable for Shoemaker\u2019s actionable retaliatory conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\u00b63 Denke now appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Having considered the issues and arguments presented, we hold that the District Court erred in its conclusions that the City is immune from suit and that the City is not liable for Shoemaker\u2019s actionable retaliatory conduct. We therefore reverse the District Court\u2019s order denying Denke\u2019s petition for judicial review and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">\u00b64 As noted, the District Court did not rule on Denke\u2019s petition for judicial review insofar as it relates to Shoemaker. Thus, Denke\u2019s claims against Shoemaker are not at issue in this appeal. At the same time, however, Shoemaker\u2019s actions and the hearing examiner\u2019s rulings with respect to those actions are intertwined with Denke\u2019s claims against the City, and they provide essential context for the issues addressed herein. For that reason, the factual background of this case and the hearing examiner\u2019s decision are set forth below in comprehensive detail. But we express no view in this Opinion on the merits of Denke\u2019s petition for judicial review vis-\u00e1-vis Shoemaker, as that is a matter to be addressed by the District Court in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">I. The Events Leading up to Denke\u2019s Instant Human Rights Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">\u00b65 Denke began working for the City of Thompson Falls in the early 1980s. At all times pertinent to this case, her job title was \u201cTown Clerk/Finance Officer.\u201d The mayor was her immediate supervisor, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>her job duties included acting as city treasurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">\u00b66 In 1998 and early 1999, the City hired a certified public accountant to examine the City\u2019s bookkeeping and records. The CPA identified several problems and recommended procedures to improve the City\u2019s financial recordkeeping. A number of City Council members worked with Denke and the CPA to remedy the problems; and by the spring of 1999, the CPA reported that the books were in good order. In addition, the City authorized the CPA to implement the recommended procedural changes, for which the CPA charged $50.00 per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">\u00b67 As a member of the City Council, Shoemaker received the CPA\u2019s report and participated in the decision to authorize the CPA\u2019s work. Yet, despite the explanations provided by the CPA, Shoemaker (who had no accounting expertise) thought that Denke was responsible for causing the City to incur the expense of implementing the new recordkeeping procedures. He also believed that the City Council had tabled too many agenda items, particularly involving reports about ongoing City business, and that Denke was responsible for failing to provide completed reports and sufficient information to address the items the City Council had tabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">\u00b68 In August 1999, Denke filed a Human Rights complaint with the Department of Labor and Industry alleging sexual harassment and retaliation by the mayor. In October of that year, the City Council met in executive session, which was open to the public, and agreed to settle this complaint and Denke\u2019s companion federal complaint filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Shoemaker objected to the settlement on several grounds. He questioned the merits of Denke\u2019s claim, opining that it was filed in response to criticisms of her job performance rather than legitimately inappropriate treatment. He also expressed disagreement with the laws providing remedies for sexual harassment, and he resented the notion of a state agency investigating the City\u2019s conduct and interfering with the City\u2019s autonomy in resolving something that, in Shoemaker\u2019s view, was purely a local matter. Nevertheless, despite his objections, Shoemaker voted to approve the settlement. The parties then submitted the settlement agreement to the Human Rights Bureau of the Department of Labor and Industry for approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">\u00b69 As part of the proposed settlement, the parties agreed not to discuss its terms with anyone. In addition, the mayor, the city attorney, and the members of the City Council (including Shoemaker) signed a separate document, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-8\">The undersigned acknowledge, pursuant to Montana Law, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>they shall not discriminate against or retaliate against Kathy Denke, Town Clerk for the City of Thompson Falls, as a result of her filing a discrimination complaint against the City and it\u2019s [sic] personnel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\u00b610 In December 1999, Shoemaker received some questions and comments from citizens concerning the settlement of Denke\u2019s complaint. In addition, he heard a rumor that the City had paid $15,000.00 to settle the case, though the terms of the settlement agreement he had voted to approve did not include any such payment. Shoemaker felt defensive as a result of the public comments and speculation, and he worried that his constituents might blame him for an excessive settlement. Thus, he decided to respond publicly. To that end, Shoemaker requested that the mayor put him on the agenda for the next City Council meeting. The mayor did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\u00b611 Shoemaker then wrote a letter (dated January 6, 2000) to the local newspaper, the Sanders County <em>Ledger, </em>in which he purported to tell \u201cthe rest of the story.\u201d He noted that the mayor had refused his request to be put on the agenda, and he stated that there were \u201cthings going on at city hall that the public should know about.\u201d He contended that the <em>Ledger\u2019s </em>editor and co-owner, Tom Eggensperger, who was also a member of the City Council, never printed any \u201cnegative city business,\u201d perhaps due to \u201csome kind of conflict of interest.\u201d Of particular relevance to the case at hand, Shoemaker also asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au6\">The city had an audit in 1998 which shows there was poor bookkeeping at city hall. In fact it was so bad it is now costing the city $50.00 per hour to get it corrected. This money was actually wasted, as the bookkeeping is already paid for. Maybe this is money that could have been used on city streets. This is your tax dollar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">And now to top everything off the city clerk filed sexual harassment charges against the Mayor and the city. This is why I wanted on the agenda, to talk about this with all parties present. I feel that as I represent the city that I have been accused of something that I had nothing to do with and should have a right to speak out publicly in my defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">So far I have heard a \u201cHe did\u201d but I have not heard a \u201cI did not.\u201d Shoemaker called for the mayor\u2019s \u201cimmediate resignation\u201d and also suggested that \u201cthe Clerk [i.e., Denke] should take a long hard look and also resign.\u201d He signed the letter: \u201cMaurice Shoemaker, Council Person Ward #1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>\u00b612 Eggensperger printed Shoemaker\u2019s letter, except for the three paragraphs quoted above, and attributed it to \u201cMaurice Shoemaker, Councilperson Ward 1, Thompson Falls.\u201d Eggensperger also printed a response to Shoemaker\u2019s conflict-of-interest allegations, as well as the following explanation for not printing Shoemaker\u2019s letter in its entirety: \u201cMr. Shoemaker\u2019s letter was edited considerably as we felt he made accusations that were either unfair, unsubstantiated, a misrepresentation of the facts or inappropriate given his position on the council.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">\u00b613 Unhappy about the editorial comments and deletions, Shoemaker made copies of his original letter available to citizens. He also read the deleted paragraphs to persons who called him and inquired about the letter and editorial comments. Then, on January 19, 2000, Shoemaker wrote a second letter to the <em>Ledger. </em>He accused Eggensperger again of \u201cbiased\u201d reporting and having a conflict of interest. He repeated his complaint about not being put on the agenda and insinuated that the mayor may have \u201csomething to hide.\u201d He also articulated the following \u201cREASON I WANTED ON THE AGENDA\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">The city clerk filed a sexual harassment charge against the MAYOR and the city. At this time has there been a settlement or a pay off? If so whow [sic] and how much? Who got the money, the clerk and the MAYOR or what happened? I do not know as nothing has been told to me. Some one seems to want to sweep this under the carpet and not let the public know about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">It is for this reason that I believe the MAYOR should resign.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">It is for this and various other reasons that I believe that the clerk should also resign.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Shoemaker noted that he was \u201cwriting this as a concerned citizen of Thompson Falls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">\u00b614 It does not appear that Shoemaker\u2019s second letter was published in the <em>Ledger, </em>but he did provide copies of the letter to a number of citizens, including Laurie Brass. On or about January 24, 2000, Brass and others who had learned of Shoemaker\u2019s actions and views started circulating petitions calling for the mayor to place Shoemaker on the agenda for the February 14 council meeting \u201cto talk about the sexual harassment charges filed against the mayor and the city by the city clerk.\u201d A copy of one of the petitions, which is included in the record, contains twenty signatures and refers to a \u201csecond page.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">\u00b615 Denke received hostile comments in person and by telephone as a result of Shoemaker\u2019s letters and the petitions. Meanwhile, Shoemaker learned on January 27 that the Human Rights Bureau had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>approved the settlement that the City Council (including Shoemaker) had reviewed and agreed to in October 1999. However, Shoemaker did not convey this information to the people who were circulating the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">\u00b616 The first item on the agenda for the February 14, 2000 council meeting was titled \u201cHuman Rights Complaint-Maurice Shoemaker/Laurie Brass.\u201d Due to the size of the anticipated crowd, the meeting convened at the Community Center building, which has a meeting room substantially larger than the City Council chambers. Approximately 75 people attended, including Denke, who feared that her absence would aggravate the situation and further jeopardize her reputation and her job.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\u00b617 At the commencement of the meeting, the mayor, who normally presided over council meetings, resigned and walked out. As a result, Linda McKahan, who was the senior council member present, assumed the duty of chairing the meeting. As described below, the discussion related to Denke\u2019s Human Rights complaint was prolonged, and much of the citizen participation at the meeting pertained to this subject. McKahan, who was not experienced in chairing a council meeting of this nature, did not know how appropriately to limit the discussion; so, she did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\u00b618 Shoemaker began with lengthy remarks about the <em>Ledger\u2019s </em>alleged censorship and the mayor\u2019s refusal to put him on the previous agenda. He then discussed the rumors regarding the amount of the settlement of Denke\u2019s complaint, which were inconsistent with his understanding of the settlement agreement, and the absence of any confirmation during a council meeting that the settlement had been accepted. Shoemaker suggested repeatedly that council members were \u201csweeping it under the rug\u201d and \u201ckeeping it behind closed doors.\u201d He commented that he had not heard an apology to date from either the mayor or Denke. He told the assembly that Denke had agreed with his account of what happened between her and the mayor; however, when he turned to Denke and asked her to acknowledge her supposed agreement with him, Denke refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">\u00b619 Following Shoemaker\u2019s remarks, numerous citizens, members of the council, and the city attorney spoke in a free-ranging discussion. In addition, Brass began circulating copies of documents she had obtained from the Human Rights Bureau\u2019s investigative file. The city attorney and some council members pointed out that the settlement agreement contained a confidentiality clause; but Shoemaker argued that because the October 1999 session (during which the council <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>discussed the proposed settlement) had been open to the public, the matter was open for discussion at the present meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">\u00b620 Many of the citizen comments during the meeting were not per se attacks on Denke, but rather were critical and suspicious of how council and government business was conducted. Some citizens, however, did make comments suggesting that Denke had been a willing participant in the sexual harassment, while others insinuated or directly asserted that Denke had voluntarily engaged in sexual activity with the mayor at work during working hours. When the discussion lagged, council members asked if there were any other comments, prefatory to closing the discussion and moving on to the next agenda item. That inquiry repeatedly prompted additional comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\u00b621 Denke attended the entire council meeting, seated prominently in front of the crowd. Her attendance was not mandatory; but, as noted, she anticipated that there would be discussion regarding her Human Rights complaint and the settlement, and she did not want to be conspicuously absent. Subsequently, the <em>Missoulian </em>newspaper printed an extensive article reporting on the meeting and the public comments that had been made during it. Radio stations in western Montana and as far away as Great Falls also broadcast reports about the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">II. Denke\u2019s Instant Human Rights Complaint, and the Final Agency Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">\u00b622 On March 3, 2000, Denke filed two Human Rights complaints with the Montana Department of Labor and Industry, alleging that Shoemaker and the City had unlawfully retaliated against her for filing and prosecuting her 1999 sexual harassment and retaliation claims. The Department consolidated the two complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">\u00b623 Regarding Shoemaker, Denke alleged that the following actions were retaliatory: publishing or causing to be published false public statements about her job performance, the 1999 Human Rights complaint, and the settlement of that complaint; making public references to the settlement, contrary to the confidentiality provision in the settlement agreement; publicly calling for her resignation; circulating or encouraging the circulation of petitions to place Shoemaker on the February 14 council meeting agenda to discuss the complaint and the settlement; causing the mayor to place him on the agenda to discuss these matters; falsely stating that he did not know the terms of the settlement; stating at the February 14 council meeting that he had not yet heard an apology from Denke for her complaint; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>and making, soliciting, encouraging, or failing to limit false, defamatory, humiliating, and abusive comments to and about Denke during the council meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\u00b624 As for the City, Denke alleged that the City, through the City Council, retaliated against her by making, soliciting, encouraging, or failing to limit false, defamatory, humiliating, and abusive comments to and about Denke during the February 14 council meeting. Denke also alleged that the City was liable for Shoemaker\u2019s unlawful actions.</p>\n<p id=\"ALi\">\u00b625 Denke\u2019s complaint proceeded to a two-day contested case hearing in December 2000. Thereafter, on November 16, 2001, the hearing examiner entered a Final Agency Decision, which included detailed findings of fact, a legal opinion as to Shoemaker\u2019s and the City\u2019s respective liability, and a determination as to the amount of Denke\u2019s damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u00b626 With regard to Shoemaker\u2019s January 6 letter, the examiner found as follows. Shoemaker had no informed source reporting that the bookkeeping problems in 1998 were Denke\u2019s fault; and while he believed Denke was responsible for those problems, Shoemaker \u201cpersonally could not tell an asset from an angle iron under generally accepted accounting principles.\u201d Shoemaker also had no information to contradict the CPA\u2019s 1999 report that the City\u2019s books were in good order. Furthermore, Shoemaker\u2019s assertion that it was Denke\u2019s fault the City had to spend $50.00 per hour for the CPA to make changes in accounting procedures was made \u201cwith reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the statement.\u201d Shoemaker included this statement in his letter in furtherance of his goal of getting on the council meeting agenda to discuss Denke\u2019s Human Rights complaint and because he disapproved of Denke for filing that complaint. According to the examiner, Shoemaker took this action \u201cwith retaliatory animus toward Denke.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">\u00b627 As for the January 19 letter, the examiner entered the following findings. At the time he wrote this letter, Shoemaker knew the terms of the settlement, knew exactly who would receive money under the settlement, knew how much money was contemplated by the settlement, and knew or reasonably should have known that the settlement submitted to the Human Rights Bureau was exactly the settlement he had voted for. Furthermore, he wrote the letter, with the false statements it contained about his knowledge of the settlement, because he wanted a chance to tell citizens during a council meeting that the City had not made a $15,000.00 settlement payment and to repeat his objections to sexual harassment liability law. The examiner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>found that Shoemaker\u2019s question about who received the settlement money contained a \u201cdeliberate suggestion\u201d that Denke and the mayor had colluded to obtain a settlement from the City based on a meritless sexual harassment claim and then had split the proceeds. Shoemaker, however, had no factual basis for these insinuations; indeed, he made the statements \u201cwith knowledge of their provably false connotations.\u201d In short, Shoemaker wrote the letter in furtherance of his goal of getting on the council meeting agenda to discuss Denke\u2019s Human Rights complaint and the settlement, and he took this action \u201cwith retaliatory animus toward Denke.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">\u00b628 The hearing examiner entered a number of findings concerning injuries suffered by Denke. In particular, before attending the February 14 council meeting, she suffered severe emotional distress upon learning of the publication of Shoemaker\u2019s letters and receiving hostile comments in the community triggered by those publications. As a result of the meeting and the associated publicity, she suffered physical, emotional, and mental harm, which in turn caused her to miss a substantial number of work days and wages for those days. She required hospitalization for suicidal ideation and inability to function. Her ability to cope with her physical and emotional problems and the stresses of everyday life was \u201cseriously compromised.\u201d The examiner found that although much of the harm suffered by Denke resulted from the council meeting and the associated publicity, she suffered discrete severe emotional distress because of Shoemaker\u2019s letters-specifically, his assertion that it was her fault the City had to spend $50.00 per hour for the CPA to implement changes in accounting procedures, and his insinuation that she and the mayor had colluded to obtain payment in settlement of a meritless sexual harassment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\u00b629 Turning to the legal issues, the hearing examiner first determined that Denke had established a prima facie case of unlawful retaliation by both the City and Shoemaker. Specifically, she proved that she had engaged in an activity protected by the Human Rights Act-namely, filing and prosecuting her 1999 Human Rights complaint-and that Shoemaker and the City had subjected her to \u201csignificant adverse acts,\u201d including \u201ccoercion, intimidation and harassment.\u201d Moreover, because these adverse acts occurred while Denke\u2019s complaint was pending or within six months after its resolution, the examiner observed that Denke was entitled to a \u201cdisputable presumption of retaliatory motive.\u201d In addition, the examiner noted that Denke had presented direct evidence of Shoemaker\u2019s retaliatory motive-e.g., his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>efforts to get on the agenda to discuss the settlement of her complaint, his letters in which he wrote about the complaint and its merits, his criticisms of her job performance, his suggestion that she resign, and his discussion of these matters at the council meeting. This direct evidence, along with the disputable presumption, satisfied the requirement of a \u201ccausal connection\u201d between the adverse acts and the protected activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\u00b630 The hearing examiner then considered several affirmative defenses asserted by Shoemaker and the City: privilege under \u00a7 27-1-804, MCA; legislative immunity under \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA; and the constitutional right to free speech. At the outset, the examiner observed that the significant adverse acts established by Denke consisted of or related to speech. The examiner thus characterized this case as involving a \u201cconflict\u201d between the right to free speech on one hand and the right to be free from illegal retaliation on the other. Noting that \u201cthere is little to no current Montana law defining the interaction between the Human Rights Act\u2019s prohibition against retaliation and these affirmative defenses,\u201d the examiner proceeded on the premise that \u201cprivileged, immune or constitutionally protected communications cannot be retaliatory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\u00b631 Concerning Shoemaker\u2019s comments at the February 14 council meeting, the examiner decided that \u00a7 27-1-804(2), MCA, applied. This provision includes within the definition of \u201cprivileged publication\u201d one that is made \u201cin any legislative or judicial proceeding or in any other official proceeding authorized by law.\u201d Section 27-1-804(2), MCA. As to Shoemaker\u2019s letters, the examiner determined as follows: the statutory privilege did not apply because the letters were not published \u201cin the proper discharge of an official duty\u201d or \u201cin any legislative or judicial proceeding or in any other official proceeding authorized by law,\u201d \u00a7 27-1-804(1), (2), MCA; statutory immunity did not apply because publishing the letters did not constitute \u201cthe lawful discharge of an official duty associated with legislative acts of the legislative body,\u201d \u00a7 2-9-111(3), MCA; but the constitutional free speech protections articulated <em>in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 84 S. Ct. 710 (1964), and its progeny did apply, except to the statements made with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity in the January 6 letter that Denke had engaged in poor bookkeeping and thus caused the City to spend $50.00 per hour for a CPA to correct the problem, and except to the provably false suggestion in the January 19 letter that Denke had colluded with the mayor to obtain payment from the City to settle a meritless sexual harassment claim. The examiner concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Shoemaker had illegally retaliated against Denke when he circulated these statements and innuendos in his letters, and the examiner awarded Denke $7,500.00 to rectify the severe emotional distress she had suffered as a result of Shoemaker\u2019s illegal discriminatory actions. The examiner also imposed injunctive relief pursuant to \u00a7 49-2-506(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">\u00b632 As for the City, the examiner determined that the comments made during the February 14 council meeting related to Denke\u2019s job performance and her Human Rights complaint were privileged under \u00a7 27-1-804(2), MCA, and that the City, therefore, could not be held liable for those comments. The examiner further determined, though with no supporting analysis, that \u201c[t]here is neither law nor fact upon which to base a ruling that the city was responsible for Shoemaker\u2019s acts in writing the letters.\u201d The examiner thus concluded that \u201cthe city is not responsible for his retaliatory conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">\u00b633 Lastly, as to the \u201cregulation\u201d of the council meeting, the examiner first observed that \u201cShoemaker and some of his supporters made comments that confirmed they viewed sexual harassment as an improper subject for government regulation,\u201d and \u201csome of the comments were premised upon the theory that any victim of sexual harassment was responsible for the harassment by encouraging or colluding in the inappropriate sexual overtures or behavior of the harasser.\u201d But, the examiner reasoned, however \u201crepugnant\u201d such comments may be, \u201cdisagreement with the law is an appropriate subject for comment during a city council meeting regarding settlement of a claim \"under that law.\u201d Furthermore, the examiner opined that while \u201cthe council could have limited these comments, in terms of time or topic,\u201d \u201cwhether and how to limit comment during a council meeting is a legislative act.\u201d Thus, the examiner decided that the conduct of McKahan, the other council members, and the city attorney in allowing an unlimited public discussion of the Denkerelated agenda item during the February 14 council meeting \u201cconsisted of the discharge of official duties associated with the council\u2019s legislative acts,\u201d for which the City is immune from suit under \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">\u00b634 In short, the hearing examiner ruled that the City \u201cdid not illegally retaliate against Denke, since its actions complained of were protected speech or immune legislative acts,\u201d and the City \u201cwas not responsible for Shoemaker\u2019s illegal retaliation.\u201d The examiner accordingly dismissed Denke\u2019s charges of discrimination against the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>\u00b635 Denke then appealed to the Human Rights Commission (\u201cHRC\u201d) the denial of her claim that Shoemaker and the City had retaliated against her during the February 14 council meeting and the denial of her claim that the City was liable for Shoemaker\u2019s unlawful retaliatory actions. The HRC affirmed the hearing examiner\u2019s Final Agency Decision in all respects. We note, in addition, that Shoemaker filed a cross-appeal in the HRC, which the HRC dismissed on procedural grounds. We affirmed that dismissal in <em>Shoemaker v. Denke, </em>2004 MT 11, 319 Mont. 238, 84 P.3d 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">III. Denke\u2019s Petition for Judicial Review, and the District Court\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">\u00b636 Pursuant to \u00a7 2-4-702, MCA, Denke filed a petition for judicial review in the District Court on May 23, 2002. Shoemaker filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Montana in February 2003, and the District Court accordingly stayed the proceedings on Denke\u2019s petition insofar as it relates to Shoemaker. Thus, we do not address Denke\u2019s claims against Shoemaker. As for her claims against the City, Denke contended that the HRC erred in two respects: first, in its conclusion that the City is immune from suit for its allegedly retaliatory conduct, and second, in its conclusion that the City is not liable for the acts Shoemaker performed within the scope of his employment or agency.</p>\n<p id=\"ARd\">\u00b637 The District Court disagreed with Denke\u2019s contentions. The court observed that \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA, grants governmental entities immunity for legislative acts, and the court decided that \u201cthe conducting of a city council meeting by the city is a legislative act.\u201d Next, the court concluded that under \u00a7 27-1-804, MCA, the City is not liable for the comments made by persons at the February 14 council meeting. The court also cited \u00a7 27-1-804, MCA, for the proposition that the City is not liable for Shoemaker\u2019s letters, though this contradicts the determination by the hearing examiner and the HRC that the statutory privilege does not apply to Shoemaker\u2019s letters. Lastly, the court held that Shoemaker \u201cwas not acting within the scope of his duties as a councilperson when he wrote the defamatory letters to the editors\u201d and that the City, therefore, was not liable for this conduct. The court accordingly denied Denke\u2019s petition for judicial review insofar as it applies to the City of Thompson Falls. Denke now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">\u00b638 Denke raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\">1. Is the City immune from suit on Denke\u2019s retaliation claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>against it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-4\">2. Is the District Court\u2019s order denying Denke\u2019s petition for judicial review overbroad?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">3. Is the City hable for Shoemaker\u2019s actionable retaliatory conduct?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">\u00b639 The standards for reviewing a final decision of the HRC are whether the agency\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the agency\u2019s interpretation and application of law are correct. Section 2-4-704(2)(a), MCA; <em>CEnTech Corp. v. Sprow, </em>2006 MT 27, \u00b6 20, 331 Mont. 98, \u00b6 20, 128 P.3d 1036, \u00b6 20; <em>O\u2019Neill v. Dept. of Revenue, </em>2002 MT 130, \u00b6 10, 310 Mont. 148, \u00b6 10, 49 P.3d 43, \u00b6 10. A factual finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence in the record, if the fact-finder misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of the record leaves the court with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>See Benjamin v. Anderson, </em>2005 MT 123, \u00b6 31, 327 Mont. 173, \u00b6 31, 112 P.3d 1039, \u00b6 31; In <em>re Montana All-Alcoholic Beverages Resort License, </em>2008 MT 165, \u00b6 26, 343 Mont. 331, \u00b6 26, 184 P.3d 324, \u00b6 26. This Court employs these same standards when reviewing the district court\u2019s order affirming or reversing the HRC\u2019s decision. <em>CEnTech, </em>\u00b6 20; <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">\u00b640 <em>Issue 1. Is the City immune from suit on Denke\u2019s retaliation claim against it?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">I. Clarification of the Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">\u00b641 Denke filed the instant Human Rights action claiming that the City had unlawfully retaliated against her in the way it \u201cregulated\u201d the February 14 council meeting. Denke\u2019s theory is that \u201cmoving the meeting place to accommodate the expected large crowd and allowing unlimited discussion... of Denke\u2019s sexual harassment complaint, that included personal attacks on Denke,\u201d constituted unlawful retaliation. She points out, based on testimony at the contested case hearing, that the City Council imposed limits on discussions at other council meetings. In one particular instance, the City Council was considering a complaint against a law enforcement officer, and the mayor limited the speakers\u2019 comments to what they personally knew (as opposed to hearsay). In another instance, in order to receive as many comments from the public as possible concerning a water issue, a time limit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>three minutes per speaker was imposed. In Denke\u2019s view, the City treated her differently by not imposing these same sorts of limitations on the discussion at the February 14 council meeting and by \u201cactually encouraging] further, unlimited comment.\u201d The City did so, according to Denke, in retaliation for her filing and prosecuting her 1999 Human Rights complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\u00b642 As noted in the background discussion above, the hearing examiner did not reach the question of whether the manner in which the City conducted the council meeting constituted unlawful retaliation. The examiner did determine that (1) \u201cDenke presented evidence that. . . the city subjected her to coercion, intimidation and harassment\u201d and (2) \u201cAll of the conduct at issue in this case occurred while Denke\u2019s prior complaint against the city was pending or within six months after its resolution. Thus, she is entitled to the disputable presumption of retaliatory motive.\u201d However, the examiner did not address whether the City had overcome this presumption. Rather, the examiner reasoned that (1) \u201cthe council could have limited [comments made during the meeting], in terms of time or topic,\u201d but (2) \u201cwhether and how to limit comment during a council meeting is a legislative act.\u201d The examiner concluded that for such legislative acts, the City is immune from suit under \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA, and, having reached this conclusion, decided that \u201cno further analysis is necessary\u201d regarding the manner in which the City conducted the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\u00b643 In short, the hearing examiner essentially concluded that whether or not the City\u2019s challenged conduct was unlawful under the Human Rights Act, the City is immune from suit for that conduct and Denke\u2019s retaliation claim, therefore, must be dismissed. The HRC and the District Court both affirmed this conclusion based on the same rationale. Thus, in light of this procedural posture of the case, the question of whether the City\u2019s conduct of the council meeting actually amounted to unlawful retaliation is not before us, and we accordingly express no view on that question. Rather, the specific issue here is whether the examiner (and the HRC and the District Court) erred in determining that decisions regarding how to conduct a city council meeting are, in all instances, \u201clegislative acts\u201d for which the City is immune under \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">\u00b644 Denke contends that the hearing examiner erred in applying \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA, to the case at hand. She points out that in <em>Dagel v. City of Great Falls, </em>250 Mont. 224, 819 P.2d 186 (1991), this Court held that \u201charassment by a supervisor\u201d is not a \u201clegislative act\u201d under \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA. <em>See Dagel, </em>250 Mont. at 233, 819 P.2d at 191. Denke argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>\u201c(j]ust as harassment is not considered a \u2018legislative act\u2019 under the statute, neither should retaliation be so considered.\u201d In addition, relying in large part on <em>Bechard v. Rappold, </em>287 F.3d 827 (9th Cir. 2002), Denke argues that \u201cthe City\u2019s regulation of the meeting was more administrative in nature than legislative.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 2-9-111(1)(c)(ii), MCA (stating that \u201cthe term legislative act does not include administrative actions undertaken in the execution of a law or public policy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\u00b645 The City disagrees and, also relying on <em>Bechard, </em>presents an argument that \u201cthe decision to use a larger building to accommodate greater attendance and the decision to allow and not restrict public comment\u201d were immune legislative acts. Wholly aside from this immunity argument, however, the City also renews its free speech and statutory privilege defenses. Specifically, the City argues that it cannot be held liable for statements made during the February 14 council meeting because those statements were privileged under \u00a7 27-1-804, MCA, and were protected by the constitutional free speech principles articulated <em>in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 84 S. Ct. 710 (1964). Along these same lines, the City also contends that it could not lawfully have regulated what was said at the meeting. These arguments appear to be offered as alternative grounds for concluding that the City cannot be held liable to Denke for its conduct of the meeting and, therefore, for upholding the District Court\u2019s order denying her petition for judicial review. <em>See e.g. Peterson v. Eichhorn, </em>2008 MT 250, \u00b6 21, 344 Mont. 540, \u00b6 21, 189 P.3d 615, \u00b6 21 (\u201cWe uphold a district court\u2019s judgment if the court reaches the correct result, regardless of the court\u2019s reasoning.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u00b646 For the reasons which follow, we agree with Denke that the hearing examiner, the HRC, and the District Court erred in their respective applications of \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA, to the case at hand. Furthermore, we conclude that the City\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 27-1-804, MCA, and <em>New York Times </em>is misplaced. However, we do agree, in part, with the City\u2019s argument that it could not lawfully have regulated what was said at the council meeting. Because our partial agreement with the City\u2019s regulation argument may limit Denke\u2019s entitlement to relief, it is useful to address that argument first, followed by a discussion of the immunity issue. Lastly, we address the City\u2019s alternative theories based on statutory privilege and <em>New York Times.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">II. The City\u2019s Regulation Argument</p>\n<p id=\"A8I\">\u00b647  The City contends that there are \u201clegal limits\u201d on the City Council\u2019s \u201cability to restrict speech\u201d at a council meeting. We agree. \u201cIt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>is axiomatic that the government may not regulate speech based on its substantive content or the message it conveys.\u201d <em>Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the Univ. of Virginia, </em>515 U.S. 819, 828, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 2516 (1995). Nor may government, in the realm of private speech or expression, favor one speaker over another. <em>Rosenberger, </em>515 U.S. at 828, 115 S. Ct. at 2516. Indeed, viewpoint discrimination is \u201can egregious form of content discrimination,\u201d and the government \u201cmust abstain from regulating speech when the specific motivating ideology or the opinion or perspective of the speaker is the rationale for the restriction.\u201d <em>Rosenberger, </em>515 U.S. at 829, 115 S. Ct. at 2516. These well-settled principles are mandated not only by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, but also by Article II, Section 7 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u00b648 It follows from these principles that when the government opens a forum for discussion of certain subject matter, it may not impose restrictions that discriminate among viewpoints on that subject. <em>See Dorn v. Board of Trustees, </em>203 Mont. 136, 146, 661 P.2d 426, 431 (1983); <em>Rosenberger, </em>515 U.S. at 829, 115 S. Ct. at 2516; <em>Perry Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Perry Local Educators\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>460 U.S. 37, 61, 103 S. Ct. 948, 964 (1983) (Brennan, Marshall, Powell, &amp; Stevens, JJ., dissenting). Accordingly, to the extent Denke complains that the City Council should have regulated or otherwise controlled the particular viewpoints expressed by speakers related to her 1999 Human Rights complaint during the February 14 council meeting, her claim must fail. <em>See City of Madison, Joint School Dist. No. 8 v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission, </em>429 U.S. 167, 176, 97 S. Ct. 421, 426 (1976) (\u201cWhatever its duties as an employer, when the board sits in public meetings to conduct public business and hear the views of citizens, it may not be required to discriminate between speakers on the basis of . . . the content of their speech.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u00b649 We do not agree, however, with the City\u2019s suggestion that it is powerless to impose any restrictions at all on discussions at council meetings. For one thing, the hearing examiner stated that \u201cthe council could have limited [comments made during the meeting], in terms of time or topic,\u201d and the City has neither cross-appealed from nor challenged this portion of the examiner\u2019s decision at any point during the course of this litigation. Moreover, while the City argues at some length that content-based restrictions on speech are not permitted, the City concedes in a footnote that \u201creasonable time and place restrictions are probably permitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u00b650 In any event, the law in this area is well-settled, and it clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>supports the hearing examiner\u2019s statement. Time, place, and manner restrictions that preserve a city council\u2019s legitimate interest in conducting efficient and orderly meetings are permissible, so long as the restrictions are reasonable and viewpoint neutral. <em>See e.g. City of Madison, </em>429 U.S. at 175 n. 8, 97 S. Ct. at 426 n. 8 (speech may be confined to the specified topic at hand); <em>White v. City of Norwalk, </em>900 F.2d 1421, 1425 (9th Cir. 1990) (same); <em>Rowe v. City of Cocoa, </em>358 F.3d 800, 803 (11th Cir. 2004) (same); <em>Wright v. Anthony, </em>733 F.2d 575, 577 (8th Cir. 1984) (upholding a five-minute limit on each speaker); <em>Kindt v. Santa Monica Rent Control Bd., </em>67 F.3d 266, 271 (9th Cir. 1995) (three-minute limit); <em>Shero v. City of Grove, </em>510 F.3d 1196, 1203 (10th Cir. 2007) (three-minute limit); <em>Jones v. Heyman, 888 </em>F.2d 1328, 1329, 1333 (11th Cir. 1989) (holding that a truculent speaker may be restricted or even removed); <em>Eichenlaub v. Township of Indiana, </em>385 F.3d 274, 281 (3d Cir. 2004) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\u00b651  While we conclude that reasonable and viewpoint-neutral limitations on speech at a council meeting may be imposed, we by no means retreat from \u201c \u2018the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes -unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.\u2019 \u201d <em>Skinner v. Pistoria, </em>194 Mont. 257, 261, 633 P.2d 672, 674-75 (1981) (quoting New <em>York Times, </em>376 U.S. at 270, 84 S. Ct. at 721). As we stated in <em>Skinner, </em>\u201c[t]he concern which all citizens have in the proper conduct of public affairs by public officials requires that there be wide freedom to criticize that conduct, even though the criticism be unjustified or extravagant.\u201d <em>Skinner, </em>194 Mont. at 262, 633 P.2d at 675. We reaffirm these views. At the same time, however, we conclude that imposition of reasonable and viewpoint-neutral time, place, and maimer restrictions at a city council meeting will not unduly hamper debate on public issues or criticism of the conduct of public affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\u00b652 In sum, we agree with the City that it could not lawfully have regulated the particular viewpoints expressed by speakers related to Denke\u2019s 1999 Human Rights complaint during the February 14 council meeting. We also conclude that the City may impose reasonable and viewpoint-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions on speech for the purpose of conducting its council meetings in an efficient and orderly manner. In so holding, we caution that failing to impose such restrictions does not necessarily constitute unlawful retaliation. That question depends on the laws defining and prohibiting unlawful retaliation; and with respect to the February 14 council meeting, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>hearing examiner must complete the retaliation analysis in the first instance on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">III. The Immunity Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u00b653 We next address whether the City is immune from suit for its conduct of the council meeting with regard to the Denke-related agenda item. Given our holding above in Section II, the City could not have regulated the particular viewpoints expressed by speakers on this topic, but it could have imposed reasonable and viewpoint-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions on the discussion. Accordingly, the immunity issue here relates only to Denke\u2019s complaint that the City failed to impose such restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\u00b654 Montana\u2019s 1972 Constitution abolishes the common-law doctrine of sovereign immunity from suit. <em>See </em>Mont. Const. art, II, \u00a7 18; <em>Silvestrone v. Park County, </em>2007 MT 261, \u00b6 12, 339 Mont. 299, \u00b6 12, 170 P.3d 950, \u00b6 12. At the same time, however, the Constitution provides that immunity may be established by specific provision enacted by a supermajority of both houses of the Legislature. Specifically, Article II, Section 18 states: \u201cThe state, counties, cities, towns, and all other local governmental entities shall have no immunity from suit for injury to a person or property, except as may be specifically provided by law by a 2/3 vote of each house of the legislature.\u201d Thus, governmental immunity exists in this state only as provided by statutes enacted by a two-thirds vote of both houses. <em>See e.g. Whiting v. State, </em>248 Mont. 207, 221-22, 810 P.2d 1177, 1186 (1991). Section 2-9-111, MCA, is such a statute. Likewise, although not addressed by the hearing examiner, the HRC, or the District Court, the City also cites \u00a7 2-9-114, MCA, which was enacted pursuant to Article II, Section 18\u2019s exception. These provisions establish governmental immunity from suit for the acts and omissions enumerated therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">\u00b655 Application of the sovereign immunity defense does not mean that there is an absence of duty to the plaintiff; rather, where the immunity defense exists, the breach of duty is simply not actionable against the sovereign. <em>Orr v. State, </em>2004 MT 354, \u00b6 55, 324 Mont. 391, \u00b6 55, 106 P.3d 100, \u00b6 55. Thus, although the government may fail in its duty or obligation to the plaintiff, it is not subject to suit for such conduct if the conduct falls within the statutory grant of immunity. Perhaps recognizing the severity of this result, we have said that \u201cit is \u2018our duty to strictly construe any attempted governmental immunity-that is, every act expanding statutory immunity must be clearly expressed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mitchell v. Univ. of Montana, </em>240 Mont. 261, 265, 783 P.2d 1337, 1339-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>40 (1989) (quoting <em>B.M. v. State, </em>200 Mont. 58, 62, 649 P.2d 425, 427 (1982)). Consistent therewith, our approach has been to limit governmental immunity to that which is granted by the plain wording of the immunity statutes. <em>See e.g. Mitchell, </em>240 Mont. at 263-65, 783 P.2d at 1339-40; <em>Montana Vending, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., </em>2003 MT 282, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, 318 Mont. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, 78 P.3d 499, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18. Accordingly, in the case at hand, we must strictly construe the grants of immunity in \u00a7\u00a7 2-9-111 and -114, MCA, in determining whether they include the conduct alleged to give rise to Denke\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">\u00b656 Section 2-9-111(2), MCA, provides that \u201c[a] governmental entity is immune from suit for a legislative act or omission by its legislative body, or any member or staff of the legislative body, engaged in legislative acts.\u201d The term \u201cgovernmental entity\u201d includes municipalities. Section 2-9-111(1)(a), MCA. Furthermore, the term \u201clegislative act,\u201d as applicable in the case at hand, means \u201cactions by a legislative body that result in creation of law or declaration of public policy.\u201d Section 2-9-111(1)(c)(i)(A), MCA. The hearing examiner opined that \u201cwhether and how to limit comment during a council meeting is a legislative act.\u201d Similarly, the District Court expressed the view that \u201cthe conducting of a city council meeting by the city is a legislative act.\u201d These statements are correct in the sense that conducting a city council meeting and placing (or failing to place) limits on the discussion of a particular agenda item at the meeting are actions taken by a legislative body. However, such actions here, which did not \u201cresult in creation of law or declaration of public policy,\u201d do not fall within the plain wording of the term \u201clegislative act\u201d as defined in \u00a7 2-9-111(1)(c)(i)(A), MCA. Accordingly, strictly construing the grant of governmental immunity as provided by the plain wording of this statute, we hold that the City\u2019s conduct of the discussion of the Denkerelated agenda item is not encompassed within that statutory grant.</p>\n<p id=\"APD\">\u00b657 Section 2-9-114, MCA, provides that \u201c[a] local governmental entity and the elected executive officer thereof are immune from suit for damages arising from the lawful discharge of an official duty associated with vetoing or approving ordinances or other legislative acts or in calling sessions of the legislative body.\u201d Here, there were no ordinances under consideration during the discussion of the Denkerelated agenda item, and neither that discussion nor the regulation thereof involved legislative acts. However, the statute grants immunity for the lawful discharge of an official duty \u201cin calling sessions of the legislative body.\u201d Although Denke\u2019s claim appears to rest on the manner in which the council meeting was <em>conducted, </em>for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>which the City is not immune from suit under \u00a7 2-9-114, MCA, we note that to the extent Denke\u2019s claim rests on the \u201ccalling\u201d of the meeting itself, the City is immune under \u00a7 2-9-114, MCA, for that particular act.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\u00b658 Given the foregoing conclusions, we need not address the parties\u2019 dispute over whether decisions regarding how to conduct the February 14 council meeting were \u201clegislative acts\u201d under the test articulated in <em>Bechard. </em>We hold that the City cannot prevail in asserting either \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA, or \u00a7 2-9-114, MCA, as a defense to Denke\u2019s claim of unlawful retaliation based on the City\u2019s conduct of the discussion of the Denke-related agenda item at the council meeting. We accordingly reverse the District Court\u2019s determination that the City is immune from suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">IV. The City\u2019s Statutory Privilege and <em>New York Times </em>Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">\u00b659 The City contends that the statements made at the February 14 council meeting were privileged and constitutionally protected and that the City, therefore, cannot be held liable for those statements. In this connection, the City relies on <em>Skinner v. Pistoria, </em>194 Mont. 257, 633 P.2d 672 (1981), the statutory privilege contained in \u00a7 27-1-804, MCA, and <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 84 S. Ct. 710 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\"><em>\u00b660 Skinner </em>was a defamation action that arose out of statements made by Pistoria at a meeting of the Great Falls City Commission during the time reserved for public comment. Pistoria\u2019s statements included an accusation that Skinner and other police officers had misused police department funds. Skinner claimed that these statements were made with a malicious personal motive and that they exposed him to hatred, contempt, ridicule, and obloquy, caused him to be shunned and avoided, and injured him in his occupation. <em>See Skinner, </em>194 Mont. at 259-61, 633 P.2d at 673-74. This Court held, however, that \u00a7 27-1-804(2), MCA, confers an absolute privilege on publications made in an \u201cofficial proceeding authorized by law,\u201d so long as the publications are made \u201cto the proper authorities responsible for the interest being expressed.\u201d <em>Skinner, </em>194 Mont. at 263, 633 P.2d at 676. Thus, if Pistoria\u2019s statements about the conduct of certain police officers were made at a proper proceeding, then the question of whether the statements were maliciously motivated was irrelevant. <em>Skinner, </em>194 Mont. at 263, 633 P.2d at 676. We concluded that the absolute privilege applied to Pistoria\u2019s statements for the following reasons: the meeting was an official meeting authorized by law; it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>proper for Pistoria to address the commission because it was the governing body of the city; it was proper for him to address the city manager because the manager supervises the police department; and it was proper for him to address the chief of police because the police chief supervises all city police officers. <em>Skinner, </em>194 Mont. at 264, 633 P.2d at 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">\u00b661 The City contends that the similarity between <em>Skinner </em>and the case at hand is \u201cstartling\u201d and that <em>Skinner </em>\u201cglaringly\u201d supports the conclusion that the statements and comments made at the February 14 council meeting were privileged. The City also cites <em>New York Times </em>for the proposition that \u201cour free citizenry has the right to criticize its public officials,\u201d even with \u201cobnoxious comments.\u201d The City avers that the <em>New York Times </em>decision disdains any attempts \u201cto stifle critique of public officials\u201d and that speech is constitutionally protected even if it is \u201cuntrue, useless and very offensive.\u201d Thus, on the assumption that Denke was a \u201cpublic official\u201d as contemplated by <em>New York Times, </em>the City maintains that her complaint about \u201cretaliatory speech\u201d was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\u00b662 We conclude that the City\u2019s reliance on <em>Skinner, </em>\u00a7 27-1-804, MCA, and <em>New York Times </em>is misplaced. <em>Skinner </em>was a defamation suit against an individual who spoke at a Great Falls City Commission meeting. The instant action, however, is not a defamation suit. Nor is it against anyone who spoke at the February 14 council meeting (aside from Shoemaker, whose liability is not at issue in this appeal). And we do not perceive in Denke\u2019s arguments any suggestion that the City should be held liable for statements made by anyone at the meeting other than Shoemaker. Denke does intimate at a couple of points in her opening brief that the City itself \u201cdefamed\u201d her; however, as discussed above, this does not appear to be the substance of her claim against the City. And if it is one of her theories of liability, she offers no explanation or analysis of how the City \u201cdefamed\u201d her, thus rendering the theory improperly presented for appellate review. <em>In re Marriage of McMahon, </em>2002 MT 198, \u00b6 6, 311 Mont. 175, \u00b6 6, 53 P.3d 1266, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\u00b663 For these reasons, <em>Skinner </em>and \u00a7 27-1-804, MCA, are inapt, and the same can be said of <em>New York Times. </em>Even if Denke, as a municipal Town Clerk/Finance Officer, qualifies as a \u201cpublic official\u201d or \u201cpublic figure\u201d under New <em>York Times </em>and its progeny the principles articulated in those cases respecting the intersection of constitutional free speech and defamation law are not at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><em>\u00b664 </em> In sum, we hold that the City cannot prevail in asserting either \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA, or \u00a7 2-9-114, MCA, as a defense to Denke\u2019s claim of unlawful retaliation based on the City\u2019s conduct of the discussion of the Denke-related agenda item at the February 14 council meeting. As for the alternative defenses raised by the City, we conclude that \u00a7 27-1-804, MCA, and New <em>York Times </em>are inapplicable here; and while we agree with the City that it could not lawfully have regulated the particular viewpoints expressed by speakers related to Denke\u2019s 1999 Human Rights complaint, we disagree with the City\u2019s contention that it could not have imposed any restrictions on the discussion at all. We accordingly reverse the hearing examiner\u2019s, the HRC\u2019s, and the District Court\u2019s immunity determinations and remand this matter for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">\u00b665 <em>Issue 2, Is the District Court\u2019s order denying Denke\u2019s petition for judicial review overbroad?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\u00b666 Denke contends that the District Court\u2019s order denying her petition for judicial review is overbroad. The District Court held that the City was not liable for Shoemaker\u2019s letters because he \u201cwas not acting within the scope of his duties as a councilperson when he wrote the defamatory letters.\u201d In addition, however, the court also stated that the City \u201cis not liable for Councilman Shoemaker\u2019s letters to the editor, or for comments made by those attending the council meeting <em>because of\u00a7 27-1-804, MCA protecting privileged communication and the Montana Supreme Court case of </em>Skinner vs. Pistoria, <em>194 Mont. 257, 633 P.2d 672 (1981)\u201d </em>(emphasis added). As Denke correctly points out, this latter rationale not only is beyond the scope of the issues before the District Court, but also amounts to a sua sponte reversal of a final determination concerning Shoemaker\u2019s liability for his letters.</p>\n<p id=\"Al4\">\u00b667 First, a ruling that the City is not liable for comments made \u201cby those attending the council meeting\u201d is overbroad, since Denke has not sought to hold the City liable for the comments of anyone except Shoemaker. Second, the proceedings in the District Court related to Shoemaker were stayed by virtue of his filing a bankruptcy petition. As a result, a ruling that Shoemaker\u2019s comments at the council meeting were privileged under \u00a7 27-1-804, MCA, is premature. Third, the hearing examiner determined that \u00a7 27-1-804, MCA, did <em>not </em>apply to Shoemaker\u2019s letters. As explained above, Shoemaker forfeited his appeal of this determination. <em>See Shoemaker v. Denke, </em>2004 MT 11, 319 Mont. 238, 84 P.3d 4. Thus, the District Court was not in a position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>to enter a contrary ruling that his letters <em>were </em>privileged under \u00a7 27-1-804, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">\u00b668 For these reasons, it is necessary to vacate the District Court\u2019s statement in its Order Denying Petition for Judicial Review that \u201cthe Respondent city of Thompson Falls is not liable for Councilman Shoemaker\u2019s letters to the editor, or for comments made by those attending the council meeting because of \u00a7 27-1-804, MCA protecting privileged communication and the Montana Supreme Court case of <em>Skinner vs. Pistoria, </em>194 Mont. 257, 633 P.2d 672 (1981).\u201d If and when the bankruptcy stay is lifted, the District Court may then revisit the issue of whether Shoemaker\u2019s comments at the February 14 council meeting were privileged and, if necessary, the issue of whether the City is liable for those comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">\u00b669 <em>Issue 3. Is the City liable for Shoemaker\u2019s actionable retaliatory conduct?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">\u00b670 The hearing examiner determined that Shoemaker illegally retaliated against Denke when he circulated his January 6 and January 19 letters. In particular, the examiner held Shoemaker liable for (1) the statements in the January 6 letter, made with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity, that it was Denke\u2019s fault the City had to spend $50.00 per hour for the CPA to implement changes in accounting procedures and (2) the provably false suggestion in the January 19 letter that Denke and the mayor both received payments from the City to settle her sexual harassment and retaliation claims against the mayor. The examiner awarded Denke $7,500.00 for the severe emotional distress she suffered as a result of Shoemaker\u2019s illegal discriminatory actions. As for Shoemaker\u2019s comments at the February 14 council meeting, however, the examiner decided those were privileged under \u00a7 27-1-804(2), MCA. Thus, the examiner denied relief on this portion of Denke\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">\u00b671 Denke contends that the City may be held liable for Shoemaker\u2019s \u201cactionable\u201d conduct. It is necessary here to identify which conduct by Shoemaker presently qualifies as \u201cactionable.\u201d As noted, the HRC dismissed his cross-appeal on procedural grounds, and this Court affirmed that dismissal in <em>Shoemaker v. Denke, </em>2004 MT 11, 319 Mont. 238, 84 P.3d 4. As a result, there are no further determinations to be made with respect to Shoemaker\u2019s liability for the retaliatory statements and innuendos in his letters; the award of $7,500.00 in favor of Denke is final. But with respect to Shoemaker\u2019s comments at the February 14 council meeting, Denke asserted in her petition for judicial review that the HRC erred in its conclusion that those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>comments were privileged under \u00a7 27-1-804, MCA. Due to the bankruptcy stay in the District Court, this issue has not yet been decided. In other words, it remains to be determined by the District Court-and, if an appeal ensues, by this Court-whether Shoemaker is subject to liability for the comments he made related to Denke\u2019s 1999 Human Rights Complaint at the council meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">\u00b672 Accordingly, Denke appropriately limits her discussion under Issue 3 to the City\u2019s liability for Shoemaker\u2019s retaliatory statements and innuendos in his letters, and we do the same. At this point in time, that is the only \u201cactionable\u201d conduct for which the City might be held liable. We express no view on the City\u2019s liability for the comments made by Shoemaker at the February 14 council meeting, as it has not yet been determined, as a final matter, whether those statements are in fact \u201cactionable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">\u00b673 Respondeat superior is a doctrine of the law of agency by which the consequences of one person\u2019s actions may be attributed to another person. <em>Saucier v. McDonald\u2019s Restaurants of Montana, </em>Inc., 2008 MT 63, \u00b6 64, 342 Mont. 29, \u00b6 64, 179 P.3d 481, \u00b6 64. Denke points out, and the City does not dispute, that an employer may be liable, on the basis of respondeat superior, for an illegal discriminatory act by its employee. <em>See Vainio v. Brookshire, </em>258 Mont. 273, 278-79, 852 P.2d 596, 600 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">\u00b674 An employer is liable for the acts of an employee only when the employee is acting \u201cwithin the scope of his or her duties to the employer.\u201d <em>Bowyer v. Loftus, </em>2008 MT 332, \u00b6 8, 346 Mont. 182, \u00b6 8, 194 P.3d 92, \u00b6 8; <em>see also Kenyon v. Stillwater County, </em>254 Mont. 142, 146, 835 P.2d 742, 745 (1992) (\u201cGovernmental entities in Montana are subject to liability for their own wrongful conduct and that of their employees acting within the scope of their duties.\u201d (citing \u00a7 2-9-102, MCA)). Whether an act was within the scope of employment is generally a question of fact; however, it is a question of law for the court when only one legal inference may reasonably be drawn from the facts. <em>Bowyer, </em>\u00b6 8. Based on these principles, the relevant questions are (1) whether Shoemaker was an employee of the City in January 2000 and (2) whether his actions occurred within the scope of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">\u00b675 With respect to the first question, Denke cites <em>Kenyon </em>and \u00a7 2-9-101(2), MCA (1999), for the proposition that Shoemaker was a City employee. Section 2-9-101(2), MCA, defines \u201cemployee\u201d as \u201can officer, employee, or servant of a governmental entity, including elected or appointed officials,....\u201d In <em>Kenyon, </em>we held that for liability purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>under Montana statutes, \u201celected county officials are employees of the <em>county Kenyon, </em>254 Mont. at 146, 835 P.2d at 745 (citing \u00a7 2-9-101, MCA). Extending this holding to the case at hand, Denke asserts that elected city officials are employees of the city. The City concedes that Shoemaker was \u201cemployed\u201d by the City in January 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">\u00b676 With respect to the second question, Denke proffers three reasons why Shoemaker was acting within the scope of his employment when he wrote the letters. First, Denke cites Shoemaker\u2019s testimony at the contested case hearing that he wrote both letters \u201cas a private citizen and as a Thompson Falls council person.\u201d Second, Denke notes that Shoemaker signed the January 6 letter as \u201cMaurice Shoemaker, Council Person Ward #1.\u201d Third, Denke contends that the City admitted this point in the course of the proceedings before the Department of Labor and Industry. In response, the City offers three arguments why respondeat superior liability should not apply here. We address those three arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\u00b677 First, citing <em>Vainio </em>and <em>E.E.O.C. v. Hacienda Hotel, </em>881 F.2d 1504, 1515 (9th Cir. 1989), the City claims that respondeat superior applies in the discrimination context only if the discriminatory act was committed by the complainant\u2019s \u201csupervisor.\u201d Thus, the City contends, since Shoemaker was not Denke\u2019s supervisor, the City is not liable for his unlawful retaliatory conduct. The cases cited by the City, however, do not support such a rule. It is true that <em>Vainio </em>and <em>Hacienda Hotel </em>involved discrimination (specifically, sexual harassment) by a \u201csupervisor,\u201d but neither case states that respondeat superior applies only to conduct by a \u201csupervisor.\u201d In fact, what we stated in <em>Vainio </em>was that \u201c[a]ll that is needed to make [the employer] subject to the administrative proceeding is for [the employee] to allege that [the perpetrator], <em>an agent </em>of [the employer], committed unlawful sexual discrimination.\u201d <em>Vainio, </em>258 Mont. at 279, 852 P.2d at 600 (emphasis added). This statement is consistent with the fact, noted above, that respondeat superior is a doctrine of the law of agency. <em>Saucier, </em>\u00b6 64.</p>\n<p id=\"Av9\">\u00b678 Second, the City invokes Aristotle\u2019s <em>Logica </em>for the proposition: \u201cSomething has to be <em>or </em>not be. Something cannot both be <em>and </em>not be.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Applying this principle here, the City argues that either Shoemaker was engaged in \u201clegislative behavior\u201d when he wrote the letters, in which case his statements were privileged under \u00a7 27-1-804, MCA, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>he was not engaged in \u201clegislative behavior\u201d when he wrote the letters, in which case he was not acting within the scope of his employment. \u201cEither way,\u201d the City asserts, \u201cDenke loses.\u201d The City also posits that \u201cAristotle would have agreed with the HRC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">\u00b679 At first glance, the City\u2019s reasoning has some appeal. Essentially, the City argues that if Shoemaker\u2019s letters were not published \u201cin the proper discharge of an official duty\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 27-1-804(1), MCA, as the hearing examiner found, then he could not have been acting \u201cwithin the scope of his duties to the City\u201d for purposes of respondeat superior liability. The flaw in the City\u2019s reasoning, however, is the assumption that these two standards are equivalent. They are not. Unlawful retaliatory conduct does not qualify as \u201cthe proper discharge of an official duty\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 27-1-804(1), MCA. In contrast, the doctrine of respondeat superior is designed to hold an employer liable for the wrongful conduct of its employee. The doctrine actually contemplates that wrongful conduct (such as unlawful retaliation) was committed within the scope of employment. Accordingly, the fact that Shoemaker\u2019s retaliatory statements were not privileged under \u00a7 27-1-804(1), MCA, does not mean that the City cannot be held liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior for his making those statements-Aristotle\u2019s <em>L\u00f3gica </em>notwithstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\u00b680 Third, and lastly, the City simply denies that Shoemaker was acting within the scope of his employment when he wrote the letters. The City claims that \u201cShoemaker is a legislator\u201d and was not acting \u201cwithin the scope of his employment as a legislator.\u201d The City reasons that \u201cShoemaker wrote and sent the letters on his own time outside of any sort of Council meeting.\u201d We agree with Denke, however, that the City\u2019s denials directly contradict the City\u2019s prior admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\u00b681 In its brief in support of its motion for summary judgment filed in the Department of Labor and Industry, the City made a number of assertions concerning Shoemaker\u2019s function in writing the January 2000 letters. First, the City explained that Shoemaker felt it was his \u201clegislative duty\u201d to provide a forum for the townspeople to discuss Denke\u2019s job performance and the settlement of her 1999 Human Rights complaint, and when the mayor initially refused his request to be put on the agenda, Shoemaker wrote the two letters out of frustration, which in turn prompted the mayor to provide Shoemaker the forum he had requested (a place on the council meeting agenda). Second, the City asserted that \u201c[a]s a City Council Person, Shoemaker has a responsibility to his constituency to examine, debate and even verbally attack the Clerk if he disapproves of the clerk\u2019s job performance.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Third, the City acknowledged that Shoemaker\u2019s letters \u201cweren\u2019t written either in legislative chambers or during an actual legislative session,\u201d but the City argued that certain \u201cactions by local government legislators are absolutely privileged,\u201d including Shoemaker\u2019s various statements in his letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">\u00b682 In addition to these assertions, the City explicitly took the view that Shoemaker was acting as \u201ca legislator\u201d when he took his concerns about Denke to the press:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-5\">The H.R.C. should also note that Shoemaker was forced to go to the press with his legislative concerns after Shoemaker was denied his right to air his concerns about Denke at a city council meeting. <em>H.R.C. Final Invest. Rep. </em>p. 7, para. 3. It\u2019s ironic that Shoemaker was denied access to the city council meeting by the perpetrator of the originally alleged sexual harassment. <em>Infra. </em>It\u2019s hard to imagine a state agency not recognizing, that in the United States of America, a legislator has both the moral obligation and the legally protected right to take his concerns about a public official to the press after being denied the right to air his concerns during a legislative session.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\u00b683 The City acknowledges these statements but contends they were made in support of \u201caffirmative defenses.\u201d Yet, the City offers no insight whatsoever as to how this fact bears on our analysis. We have held that a party or its attorney may make judicial admissions in a brief supporting a motion for summary judgment and that such an admission \u201chas a conclusive effect upon the party who makes it, and prevents that party from introducing further evidence to prove, disprove, or contradict the admitted fact.\u201d <em>Bitterroot Int\u2019l Systems, Ltd. v. Western Star Trucks, Inc., </em>2007 MT 48, \u00b6\u00b6 41-43, 336 Mont. 145, \u00b6\u00b6 41-43, 153 P.3d 627, \u00b6\u00b6 41-43. The City cites no authority for the proposition that the rules of judicial admissions do not apply to affirmative defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">\u00b684 Of course, to be binding a judicial admission must be \u201can unequivocal statement of fact.\u201d <em>In re Raymond </em>W. <em>George Trust, </em>1999 MT 223, \u00b6 37, 296 Mont. 56, \u00b6 37, 986 P.2d 427, \u00b6 37. Here, the City asserted in its brief, on more than one occasion, that Shoemaker was acting in his role as a \u201clegislator\u201d or \u201ccouncilperson\u201d when he wrote the January 2000 letters. The City referred to Shoemaker\u2019s \u201clegislative duty\u201d and \u201cresponsibility to his constituency\u201d to provide a forum in which to \u201cexamine, debate and even verbally attack\u201d Denke if he disapproved of her job performance. The City characterized Shoemaker\u2019s letter writing as a means to fulfill this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>duty/responsibility. Indeed, the City explicitly argued that <em>\u201ca </em>legislator has both the moral obligation and the legally protected right to take his concerns about a public official to the press after being denied the right to air his concerns during a legislative session.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">\u00b685 The City\u2019s assertions are confirmed by the actual language of Shoemaker\u2019s letters. Shoemaker signed the January 6 letter as \u201cMaurice Shoemaker, Council Person Ward #1.\u201d In this letter, he purported to reveal information that he, as a councilperson, wanted the public to know, such as the fact that there were \u201cthings going on at city hall that the public should know about.\u201d Shoemaker asserted that the <em>Ledger </em>never printed any of the \u201cnegative city business,\u201d and he stated: \u201cSome of you will be surprised. Believe me, we do not have a perfect city government.\u201d Shoemaker explained that he was writing this letter because the mayor had refused to put him on the next council meeting agenda to discuss matters which \u201cconcerned the city and should be of interest to the public.\u201d Likewise, in his January 19 letter, Shoemaker indicated his desire to inform the public of what was going on at city hall, and he lamented the fact that the mayor had refused to put him on the agenda. Shoemaker stated: \u201cI believe that what goes on at city hall should not be kept from the public.\u201d As noted, the City stated in its summary judgment brief that Shoemaker, as \u201ca legislator,\u201d had \u201cboth the moral obligation and the legally protected right to take his concerns about a public official to the press after being denied the right to air his concerns during a legislative session.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">\u00b686  We conclude that the City\u2019s statements constitute judicial admissions that Shoemaker was acting in his capacity as a councilperson when he wrote the January 2000 letters. We further conclude that these judicial admissions preclude the City from arguing now the diametrically opposite position that Shoemaker was <em>not </em>acting within the scope of his employment as a legislator when he wrote the letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">\u00b687 Aside from the rules of judicial admissions, Denke also directs our attention to \u00a7 2-9-305, MCA (1999). Subsection (1) states that \u201c[i]t is the purpose of this section to provide for the immunization, defense, and indemnification of public officers and employees civilly sued for their actions taken within the course and scope of their employment.\u201d Section 2-9-305(1), MCA. Subsection (5), in turn, provides that in an action against a governmental entity based on the conduct of an employee, the employee is immune from liability if the governmental entity \u201cacknowledges\u201d that the employee\u2019s conduct arose \u201cout of the course and scope of the employee\u2019s employment\u201d (except in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>circumstances not relevant here). Section 2-9-305(5), MCA. This provision lends further support to our conclusion that the City\u2019s \u201cacknowledgements\u201d in its motion for summary judgment render the City liable for Shoemaker\u2019s conduct in circulating the unlawful retaliatory statements and innuendos in his letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">\u00b688 In light of the City\u2019s admissions that Shoemaker was a City employee in January 2000 and was acting in his capacity as a councilperson when he wrote the letters, the City may be held liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior for this retaliatory conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">\u00b689 We hold that the City cannot prevail in asserting \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA, or \u00a7 2-9-114, MCA, as a defense to Denke\u2019s claim of unlawful retaliation based on the City\u2019s conduct of the discussion of the Denkerelated agenda item at the February 14 council meeting. We accordingly reverse the District Court\u2019s contrary conclusion and remand with instructions that the District Court order the hearing examiner to make a determination, in the first instance, as to whether the City\u2019s conduct of the February 14 council meeting constituted unlawful retaliation as alleged by Denke.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">\u00b690  We further hold that the City is liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior for Shoemaker\u2019s illegal retaliation against Denke arising out of his January 2000 letters. We reverse the District Court\u2019s contrary conclusion and remand with instructions that the District Court enter judgment in favor of Denke on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">\u00b691 In addition, for the reasons explained in Issue 2, we vacate the statement in the District Court\u2019s Order Denying Petition for Judicial Review that the City \u201cis not liable for Councilman Shoemaker\u2019s letters to the editor, or for comments made by those attending the council meeting because of \u00a7 27-1-804, MCA protecting privileged communication and the Montana Supreme Court case of <em>Skinner vs. Pistoria, </em>194 Mont. 257, 633 P.2d 672 (1981).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">\u00b692 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b371-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-11\"> During the pendency of this appeal, Mark Alan Denke was substituted as Personal Representative of the Estate of Kathlyn N.

Section 2-9-111(3), MCA, would shield both the City and Shoemaker, as a member of the City Council, from a suit for damages <em>if </em>they had been engaged in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>lawful discharge of an official duty associated with legislative acts. A \u201clegislative act\u201d includes those actions that result in creation of law or declaration of public policy. Section 2-9-111(1)(c)(i)(A), MCA. A \u201clegislative act\u201d does not include administrative actions. Section 2-9-111(1)(c)(ii), MCA. I fail to see how either the City\u2019s or Shoemaker\u2019s conduct constituted legislative action.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">\u00b694 Under <em>Bechard v. Rappold, </em>287 F.3d 827, 829 (9th Cir. 2002), a court should consider two questions when determining whether an act is legislative. First, a court must determine whether the act involves ad hoc decision making or the formulation of policy; and second, whether the act applies to a few individuals or to the public at large. <em>Bechard, </em>287 F.3d at 829. A court also should consider whether the act was formally legislative and whether the act bears all the hallmarks of traditional legislation. <em>Bechard, </em>287 F.3d at 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\u00b695 The City passed no laws and formulated no policies during the meeting. The City discussed no proposed laws or policies during its meeting. The City limited the discussions to Denke\u2019s HRC complaint. A decision to demote and to discharge a specific individual constitutes an \u201cadministrative\u201d act for which legislative immunity does not apply. <em>Bechard, </em>287 F.3d at 829. The City did not even discuss any law or formulation of new policy regarding Denke\u2019s HRC complaint. The City also made additional administrative decisions-in direct opposition to their non-retaliation agreement-to use a larger building to accommodate greater attendance at the meeting and to allow unlimited public comment on Denke\u2019s employment matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\u00b696 The City now argues that Denke, in her role as a long-time city clerk, should have \u201cnoticed that offending public officials with obnoxious comments is in itself a traditional hallmark of legislation in our country.\u201d I fail to understand how placing an item on the agenda of a public meeting specifically to denigrate a City employee\u2019s right to bring an action against her supervisor\u2019s alleged sexual harassment bears the hallmark of traditional legislation. The City enjoys no legislative immunity pursuant to \u00a7 2-9-111(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">\u00b697 I agree with the Court, \u00b6 88, that the doctrine of respondeat superior transfers responsibility for Shoemaker\u2019s actions to the City. Legislative immunity offers no protection to the City for Shoemaker\u2019s conduct as a City Council member because his actions were not legislative. Shoemaker\u2019s actions in no way concerned the creation of a new law or declaration of public policy. He claims to have grown concerned about Denke\u2019s HRC complaint after community members approached him to clarify the settlement amount. Shoemaker testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>that these community members informed him that rumors had circulated that Denke had received a $15,000 settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">\u00b698 Shoemaker knew these rumors to be false as he had signed the settlement agreement specifying that Denke would receive $508 in medical bills and restoration of her sick leave. Shoemaker also knew that the settlement agreement obligated the City not to retaliate against Denke as a result of her decision to file the HRC complaint. Shoemaker believed, however, that the community\u2019s rumors of a higher settlement amount made him look bad and that \u201ca finger had been pointed at him as a representative of the City.\u201d As a result, Shoemaker felt unburdened to retaliate against Denke in direct contravention of the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\u00b699 Shoemaker claimed that he wanted time on the agenda to answer questions concerning the settlement agreement arising from Denke\u2019s sexual harassment charges against the mayor: \u201cI do not know [who got the money or what happened] as nothing has been told to me. Some one [sic] seems to want to sweep this under the carpet and not let the public know about it!\u201d Shoemaker, as a signatory to the settlement agreement, however, possessed specific knowledge of both Denke\u2019s allegations and the terms of the settlement agreement. In fact, the City and Denke settled Denke\u2019s HRC action at a regularly called meeting of the City Council that was open to the public at Denke\u2019s election. Shoemaker attended that meeting. He reviewed the terms of the settlement agreement. And he approved the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"AFO\">\u00b6100 Shoemaker\u2019s insistence to have Denke\u2019s settlement agreement placed on the agenda applied solely to Denke and did not constitute policy making. Shoemaker sat on the stage at the meeting in his capacity as a member of the City Council. Shoemaker engaged in no legislative acts when he used his City Council position to smear Denke to protect his own political reputation and promote his \u201cpersonal philosophy.\u201d <em>Bechard </em>provides no protection for Shoemaker\u2019s actions and he should not be allowed to seek refuge behind \u00a7 2-9-111, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"ANp\">\u00b6101 Shoemaker\u2019s behavior taken as a whole, although it contains elements of speech, represents precisely the type of action that the Montana Human Rights Act prohibits. At the very least, the settlement agreement that Shoemaker signed in his official capacity precluded this type of craven attack. Denke\u2019s odyssey drives home the old maxim: \u201cYou don\u2019t fight City Hall.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>942 F.2d 585, 597 (9th Cir. 1991) (Noonan, J., dissenting).</p>\n<judges id=\"b373-6\">JUSTICES LEAPHART and WARNER join in the foregoing special concurrence.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
