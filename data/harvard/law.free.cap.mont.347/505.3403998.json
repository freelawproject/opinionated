A jury convicted Normandy of the charge. Normandy appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">\u00b62 Normandy raises two issues on appeal which we restate as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">\u00b63 Issue 1: Was Normandy denied a fair trial because of surprise in the introduction of expert testimony by a witness not listed by the State as an expert?</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">\u00b64 Issue 2: Did the District Court err in refusing to dismiss a prospective juror for cause?</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">\u00b65 On October 6, 2006, Tina Normandy (Tina) called 911 from outside a local grocery store and reported she was assaulted earlier that night at her home by Normandy, her husband. Officers responded to the parking lot and spoke with Tina. Sergeant Zae Hudson (Hudson) interviewed Tina and testified at trial she was \u201cscared to death.\u201d In their conversation Hudson ascertained that earlier in the evening Tina was home with the kids while her husband was at a bar with friends. When he arrived home, the two began to argue and Normandy threw a cup of Alka-Seltzer at her and pushed her to the ground. At this point, Tina ran from the house and hid, waiting for Normandy to leave. She returned to the house to check on the children a short time after Normandy left. Tina stated Normandy returned almost immediately and was angrier than before. He grabbed her by the throat and pushed her onto the couch, holding her down for about a minute.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">\u00b66 In a separate interview conducted later, Tina told Pete Clarkson (Clarkson), an investigator with the Ravalli County Attorney\u2019s Office, that Normandy punched her hard enough while on the couch that she saw stars. She said that when Normandy released her, she fled the trailer and hid for awhile-fearing he was after her-before making her way to the store to call 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-12\">\u00b67 After speaking with Tina in the parking lot Hudson drove to the trailer, with Tina in the front seat. Hudson testified that Tina appeared fearful and did not want to make any contact with Normandy. Hudson believed that Tina crouched down so that Normandy could not see her in the car. After a brief conversation, Normandy was arrested and placed in the back of the patrol car.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>\u00b68 In addition to the information she gave to Hudson on the night of the incident, Tina also told Clarkson and a volunteer victim\u2019s advocate a similar story of the incident. Tina also described the incident in a sworn statement attached to a petition requesting a temporary order of protection against Normandy.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">\u00b69 On October 23, 2006, the State filed an Information charging Normandy with felony PFMA and trial was scheduled for April 9, 2007. About a week before trial, Tina contacted the County Attorneys Office and recanted all her previous statements. Trial was held as scheduled, the potential jurors proceeded through voir dire and opening statements were presented. When called to testify at trial Tina said all of the allegations she made against her husband were lies.</p>\n<p id=\"A1T\">\u00b610 During trial, the State called Valerie Widmer (Widmer), the victim advocate for Ravalli County, to testify as an expert. Counsel for Normandy objected, claiming she was not listed as an expert and should not be allowed to testify as one. The objection was overruled. Widmer testified that based on her experience and education, it is very common for battered women to recant.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\u00b611 Upon the conclusion of trial the jury found Normandy guilty of felony partner or family member assault. Normandy timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">\u00b612 We review a district court\u2019s ruling allowing testimony of a witness to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Bailey </em>2004 MT 87, \u00b6 11, 320 Mont. 501, \u00b6 11, 87 P.3d 1032, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">\u00b613 We review a trial court\u2019s denial of a challenge for cause to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Golie, </em>2006 MT 91, \u00b6 6, 332 Mont. 69, \u00b6 6, 134 P.3d 95, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">\u00b614 Issue 1: Was Normandy denied a fair trial because of surprise in the introduction of expert testimony by a witness not listed by the State as an expert?</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">\u00b615 Normandy complains that the District Court erred in admitting the testimony of the State\u2019s expert Valerie Widmer, whom he maintains was a devastating surprise witness. He contends the court should have precluded her from testifying because the State failed to list her as an expert witness or provide a report detailing her expected testimony. In the alternative, he asks that we declare unconstitutional the discrepancy between the obligations imposed upon the defendant for expert witness disclosure, found at \u00a7 46-15-323, MCA, and those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>imposed upon the prosecutor at \u00a7 46-15-322, MCA. He asks for the latter relief based upon grounds of \u201cfundamental unfairness,\u201d and seeks plain error review of the constitutional issue. In response, the State urges us to affirm, arguing that the constitutional issue was not raised below and should not be reviewed under plain error, and that in any event, it fully complied with the witnesses disclosure requirements imposed upon it under \u00a7 46-15-322(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">\u00b616 Section 46-15-322, MCA, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\">(1) Upon request, the prosecutor shall make available to the defendant for examination and reproduction the following material and information within the prosecutor\u2019s possession or control:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">(a) the names, addresses, and statements of all persons whom the prosecutor may call as witnesses in the case in chief;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">(c) all written reports or statements of experts who have personally examined the defendant or any evidence in the particular case....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">By contrast, \u00a7 46-15-323, MCA, requires the defendant to provide the prosecutor with the names and addresses of the experts it expects to call at trial, together with their reports and the results of their investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">\u00b617 On April 3, 2007, the prosecution filed a notice of submission of witness list. The list included Widmer\u2019s name. At trial it was established Widmer did not prepare a written report for her testimony. After a brief discussion of the requirements of \u00a7 46-15-322(1), MCA, the judge allowed the prosecution to continue the examination of Widmer. The judge stated he did not see any statutory requirement that the State identify a witness as an expert or non-expert. The court noted her name had been made available to the defense, and that since no report was prepared, the statute had not been violated. Therefore, her testimony was admissible under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">\u00b618 We acknowledge there is a discrepancy between the statutory obligations imposed on the respective parties. While the defense is required to designate which of its proposed witnesses are experts (\u00a7 46-15-323(6)(b), MCA) the State is under no similar duty, being required only to disclose the names of \u201call persons\u201d it may call as witnesses. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-15-322(1)(a), MCA. However, the defendant raised no constitutional challenge in the District Court to this inconsistency. It is axiomatic that we will not review an argument, much less a constitutional challenge, that is raised for the first time on appeal. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number><em>Ford v. State, </em>2005 MT 151, \u00b6 12, 327 Mont. 378, \u00b6 12, 114 P.3d 244, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">\u00b619 We further note that this Court avoids constitutional issues whenever possible. <em>Suburst School Dist. No. 2 v. Texaco, </em>2007 MT 183, \u00b6 62, 338 Mont. 259, \u00b6 62, 165 P.3d 1079, \u00b6 62 <em>(citing Trust v. Yellowstone County, </em>2002 MT 201, \u00b6 24, 311 Mont. 194, \u00b6 24, 53 P.3d 1268, \u00b6 24). \u201cCertain constraints govern the Court\u2019s power to determine the constitutionality of statutes. Among those constraints is the principle that we will not rule on the constitutionality of a legislative act if we are able to decide the case without reaching constitutional considerations.\u201d <em>Trust, </em>\u00b6 24 <em>(quoting State v. Still, </em>273 Mont. 261, 263, 902 P.2d 546, 548 (1995)). Here, the subject statutes clearly set forth the respective pre-trial responsibilities of the prosecutor and the defendant, so we are able to decide this case without reaching constitutional issues. Because the State fully complied with the requirements of \u00a7 46-15-322, MCA, and we decline to address Normandy\u2019s constitutional claim arising from the discrepancies in the respective disclosure statutes, we hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion in allowing Widmer to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">\u00b620 Issue 2: Did the District Court err in refusing to dismiss a prospective juror for cause?</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">\u00b621 A challenge for cause as to a prospective juror may be granted if a court determines the juror has \u201ca state of mind in reference to the case or to either of the parties that would prevent the juror from acting with entire impartiality and without prejudice to the substantial rights of either party.\u201d Section 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">\u00b622  In determining whether a juror should be excused for cause, the court must examine both the statutory language and the totality of the circumstances. <em>State v. Robinson, </em>2008 MT 34, \u00b6 8, 341 Mont. 300, \u00b6 8, 117 P.3d 488, \u00b6 8. If voir dire raises serious doubts about the ability to be fair and impartial the juror should be removed. <em>Robinson, </em>\u00b6 8. If a juror has a fixed opinion of the defendant\u2019s guilt, the district court should excuse the juror. <em>Robinson, </em>\u00b6 9. However, if the prospective juror merely expresses concern about impartiality but believes he can fairly weigh the evidence, the court is not required to remove the juror. <em>Robinson, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">\u00b623 Here, a prospective juror stated during voir dire that he had a predisposition against domestic violence because it had affected his wife in her first marriage. However, he did not voice a predisposition regarding the guilt or innocence of Normandy, and asserted he could be fair and impartial. In discussing the potential bias, the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>conversation occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-4\">Defense: So would you agree there is a bias?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">Juror: Yes. But the bias would be mainly toward probably sentencing rather than guilt or innocence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">Defense: You understand in Montana the jury has nothing to do with sentencing; you only find whether or not -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABm\">Juror: No, I didn\u2019t understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">Defense: So it only applies to whether or not the facts fit. So you are saying you have a bias toward sentencing, which means you\u2019re already looking at getting to a guilty verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">Juror: No, but if it came in guilty, I would lean toward a heavier sentence than a lighter sentence if I did not have this bias.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-9\">Court: All right. Well, sir, now you do understand, then, the jury\u2019s task in this case is merely to determine whether or not this Defendant committed this particular offense and you will not be involved in any of the sentencing phase?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-10\">Juror: Okay. I did not understand that. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-11\">Court: And do you, at this point in the trial, do you feel you could give the Defendant a fair trial as to whether or not he committed the offense of domestic violence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-12\">Juror: I could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-13\">Court: So the bias you have, as I understand it, is merely against that type of an offense, and that\u2019s natural and logical. It is a crime. But you\u2019re saying you have no bias against this Defendant merely because he\u2019s been charged with that offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-14\">Juror: No, no, not that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-15\">Court: And do you feel you could base any verdict solely on the evidence presented in the courtroom and the jury instructions and nothing else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-16\">Juror: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-17\">At no time during the voir dire did the juror state or infer that he had a fixed opinion on the guilt or innocence of Normandy.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-18\">\u00b624 Normandy relies on <em>Golie </em>to support his assertion that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the challenge for cause. In <em>Golie, </em>a potential juror stated that DUI was a sore subject for him due to his past experience with a drunk driver, and that he was angry at drunk drivers and the attorneys involved in his incident. <em>Golie, </em>\u00b6 26. The prospective juror also expressed he \u201cprobably\u201d was angry, \u201cprobably\u201d could be unbiased, but would not want a juror like him if he were on trial. <em>Golie, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-12. The District Court denied the challenge for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>cause, and on appeal we reversed that decision concluding that the prospective juror possessed a state of mind that would prevent him from being impartial. <em>Golie, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">\u00b625  By contrast, the prospective juror in this case expressed his concerns about the crime of domestic violence because such violence had affected his wife in her first marriage. However, he made it clear that he was biased against the crime, not the defendant. Unlike the juror in <em>Golie, </em>whose left arm was shattered as a result of the actions of a drunk driver and who repeatedly insisted that the defendant would not want him as a juror in his DUI case <em>(Golie, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-12), the juror in this matter was unequivocal in his assertion that he could be fair in assessing whether the defendant was guilty of the charged offense. Therefore, we conclude that <em>Golie </em>is inapposite, and that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Normandy\u2019s challenge of the subject juror for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">\u00b626 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b531-6\">JUSTICES WARNER, MORRIS, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
