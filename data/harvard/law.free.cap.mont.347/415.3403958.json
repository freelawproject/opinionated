The Defendants and Appellees are Montana Board of Environmental Review (BER or the Board) and Montana Department ofEnvironmental Quality (DEQ). Defendant Intervenors are Northern Plains Resource Council (NPRC) and Tongue River Water Users\u2019 Association (TRWUA).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">\u00b62 This case arises from the regulation of the discharge into state waterways of salty water produced from coal bed methane (CBM) production. This water is called \u201cCBM produced water.\u201d CBM produced water, which contains naturally high levels of sodium and salts, is frequently discharged by industries to surface waters. As a result, the water quality of the receiving waters can be degraded. Additionally, when land is subsequently irrigated with surface water mixed with CBM produced water, there is a potential threat to the irrigated agriculture as the salt from the water may accumulate in the plants\u2019 root systems and impair plant growth. In recognition of this potential impact, the State regulates the discharge of two harmful components of CBM produced water-sodium adsorption ratio (SAR<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) and electrical conductivity (EC<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>). The EPA is currently studying the coal bed methane sector to determine if federal effluent guidelines for these parameters are appropriate. 71 Fed. Reg. 76644, 76656 (Dec. 21, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"AK6\">\u00b63 In both 2003 and 2006, BER revised its rules regulating EC and SAR. Pennaco challenged these revised rules in the Twenty-Second Judicial District Court. BER filed a motion for summary judgment and Pennaco filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The District Court granted BER\u2019s motion and denied Pennaco\u2019s. On appeal, Pennaco challenges the standard of review applied by the District Court, as well as the court\u2019s conclusions that BER did not fail to comply with relevant rules in promulgating new standards for EC and SAR.

Marathon holds leases for oil and gas production in Montana. Pennaco is a wholly owned subsidiary of Marathon and is actively pursuing coal bed natural gas development in the Powder River Basin (the Basin) in Wyoming. Nance Petroleum and Yates Petroleum are out-of-state corporations also pursuing coal bed natural gas development in the Basin in Montana and Wyoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">\u00b69 To produce coal bed natural gas, a well is drilled into the selected coal seam. On the surface of the coal are molecules of methane gas, held in place by water pressure from a coal seam aquifer. In order to release the natural gas, the water pressure must be released. This is accomplished by pumping water out of the coal seam which causes the methane to detach from the coal and rise to the surface. The regulations imposing restrictions on the discharge of this pumped water are the source of this dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">\u00b610 The federal Clean Water Act, enacted in 1972 (the Act), delegates the responsibility for enforcing the Act to states that meet specific criteria. States are required to enact water protection laws consisting of three elements: establishment of a \u201cdesignated use\u201d for each water body-e.g., recreation, irrigation, etc.; establishment of numeric or narrative water quality standards for each water body designed to prevent impairing the water quality for that particular use; and adoption of a nondegradation policy to maintain and protect a state\u2019s water resources. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 131.10, 131.11, and 131.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">\u00b611 Between 1972 and 2003, EC and SAR, among other parameters, were regulated in Montana exclusively by narrative standards, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>opposed to numeric standards. The Administrative Rules of Montana (ARMs) set forth a general prohibition against discharging substances that create concentrations or combinations of materials which are toxic or harmful to human, animal, plant or aquatic life, or that would produce undesirable aquatic life. Admin. R. M. 17.30.637(1)(d)-(e). The State also established a nondegradation policy for its water. Admin. R. M. 17.30.705. \u201cDegradation\u201d is \u201ca change in water quality that lowers the quality of high-quality waters for a parameter. The term does not include those changes in water quality determined to be nonsignificant pursuant to 75-5-301(5)(c).\u201d Section 75-5-103(5), MCA. Additionally, the ARMs specify that \u201cdegradation\u201d \u201cis defined in 75-5-103, MCA, and also means any increase of a discharge that exceeds the limits established under or determined from a permit or approval issued by the department prior to April 29, 1993.\u201d Admin. R. M. 17.30.702(3). \u201cHigh-quality waters\u201d are defined as \u201call state waters, except: ... surface waters that: are not capable of supporting any one of the designated uses for their classification ....\u201d Section 75-5-103(10)(b)(i), MCA. The State established specific criteria for determining whether an activity would result in nonsignificant changes in existing water quality. Admin. R. M. 17.30.715. With some exception for changes in the quality of water for any parameter for which there were only narrative water quality standards (i.e., EC and SAR before 2003), any changes that would not have a measurable effect on any existing or anticipated use or cause measurable changes in aquatic life or ecological integrity were viewed as insignificant and would not trigger a nondegradation review. Admin. R. M. 17.30.715(1)(g) and (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-3\">\u00b612 In early 2000, at the behest of the Water Pollution Control Advisory Council, DEQ began investigating the effect of CBM produced water on soils and stream life to determine whether to implement numeric standards for this type of discharge. In May 2002, DEQ completed two alternative draft rules, both of which set a range of numeric water quality standards for EC and SAR on the rivers and streams in the Powder River Basin. Both proposals were accompanied by technical support documents explaining the rationale and scientific basis for the proposed rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">\u00b613 In early June 2002, NPRC, TRWUA and other Powder River Basin water rights holders filed a petition for rulemaking urging BER to adopt numeric standards for EC and SAR. BER put out three proposals for public comment and held two public meetings. Industry opposed the numeric standards arguing that the existing narrative standard was sufficient. While the public comment period was open, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>BER received extensive information from scientists and technical people, the EPA, environmental groups and irrigators.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">\u00b614 In 2003, BER adopted numeric standards for EC and SAR for three rivers and a creek making up the Powder River Basin. Admin. R. M. 17.30.670. These standards established specific levels for EC and SAR discharges into the waters of the Basin from November 1 through March 1 each year. They also established lower levels of allowable discharges from March 2 through October 31. In addition, the Board expressly provided that the nonsignificance criteria that were in place at that time and applied to parameters regulated by narrative standards <em>only, </em>would continue to apply to EC and SAR, despite the fact that EC and SAR would now have numeric standards. It rejected irrigators\u2019 requests to designate EC and SAR as \u201charmful\u201d parameters at that time but agreed to explore a method of tracking natural EC to address nondegradation issues. The effect of employing numeric criteria for the discharge of EC and SAR but retaining the narrative \u201cnonsignificant\u201d criteria for nondegradation review of these parameters was to potentially allow discharges that could degrade water quality up to the numeric water quality standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">\u00b615 In 2005, NPRC and a group of irrigators filed another petition for rulemaking asking BER to adopt rules to require treatment of CBM produced water. They also requested again that BER designate EC and SAR as \u201charmful\u201d parameters. BER put this out for public comment and held three hearings and a public meeting. In May 2006, BER rejected the proposal to require treatment but designated EC and SAR as \u201charmful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\u00b616 In June 2006, Pennaco challenged the validity of the EC and SAR water quality standards promulgated by BER in 2003 and 2006. It filed an action in the Twenty-Second Judicial District Court under Montana Administrative Procedure Act (MAPA), Montana Declaratory Judgment Act (MDJA), Montana Water Quality Act (WQA) and Montana Environmental Policy Act (MEPA) seeking to invalidate the 2003 and 2006 rules adopted by BER. Pennaco claimed the 2003 rules had no sound scientific basis. Pennaco also claimed BER and DEQ failed to prepare a MEPA-required environmental impact statement (EIS). In February 2007, BER moved for summary judgment asserting that no genuine issues of material fact existed and that the administrative record showed that it had validly exercised its authority to issue the challenged rulemakings. In April 2007, Pennaco filed a cross-motion for summary judgment arguing that BER had not validly exercised its authority because the rulemakings were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>supported by the required sound, scientific justification. After briefing and joint submission of Agreed Facts, the court held oral argument in July 2007. In October 2007, the District Court granted BER\u2019s motion and denied Pennaco\u2019s cross-motion. Pennaco appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">\u00b617 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, and apply the same criteria applied by the district court pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 56(c). A district court properly grants summary judgment only when no genuine issues of material fact exist, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Sampson v. National Farmers Union Property, </em>2006 MT 241, \u00b6 7, 333 Mont. 541, \u00b6 7, 144 P.3d 797, \u00b6 7 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">\u00b618 An agency\u2019s conclusions of law are reviewed to determine if they are correct. This same standard of review is applicable to both the district court\u2019s review of the administrative decision and our subsequent review of the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Indian Health Board v. Mont. Dept. of Labor, </em>2008 MT 48, \u00b6 11, 341 Mont. 411, \u00b6 11, 177 P.3d 1029, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">\u00b619 <em>Did the District Court erroneously apply a standard of review that was too deferential and inapplicable to agency rulemakings?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">\u00b620 In the District Court\u2019s 33-page decision, the court acknowledged that Pennaco brought this action under multiple statutes-MAPA, \u00a7\u00a7 2-4-101 to -711, MCA, MDJA, \u00a7\u00a7 27-8-101 to -313, MCA, the Montana WQA, \u00a7\u00a7 75-5-101 to -1126, MCA, and MEPA, \u00a7\u00a7 75-1-101 to -1112, MCA. The court cited \u00a7 2-4-506(2), MCA, which is within the Judicial Notice and Declaratory Rulings section of MAPA, and provides that a court may declare an administrative rule invalid only if \u201cthe rule was adopted with an arbitrary or capricious disregard for the purpose of the authorizing statute.\u201d Citing \u00a7 2-4-305(6), MCA, in the Adoption and Publication of Rules section of MAPA, the court explained that a rule comports with the administrative procedure act if it is (a) consistent and not in conflict with the applicable statute, and (b) reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">\u00b621 The District Court also determined that an agency decision involving \u201csubstantial agency expertise\u201d must be reviewed to determine whether the agency acted arbitrarily, capriciously or unlawfully. Relying on <em>Marsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Council, </em>490 U.S. 360, 378 (1989) and <em>North Fork Pres. v. Dept. of State Lands, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>238 Mont. 451, 458-59, 778 P.2d 862, 867 (1989), the court noted that when we reviewed an agency\u2019s decision to forego an EIS, we applied an arbitrary, capricious or unlawful standard. The District Court also explained how to review an agency decision for arbitrariness or capriciousness, again relying on both U.S. Supreme Court and Montana Supreme Court authority. Applying these standards, the District Court held that, based on BER\u2019s underlying statutory authority (also analyzed by the court), the agency rulemakings were consistent with supportive scientific data and the authorizing statutes. The court found that the 2003 rules were motivated by BER\u2019s concerns of projected CBM development in the Powder River Basin<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the difficulty for DEQ staffers to objectively and consistently translate the existing narrative standards. The court determined that the protection mandated by both federal and state water laws warranted proactive measures by BER.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">\u00b622 On appeal, Pennaco claims the District Court mistakenly applied the standard of review in the declaratory judgment provisions of MAPA when it should have applied the standard set forth in the section of MAPA for the adoption and publication of rules. Additionally, Pennaco maintains that WQArequires that \u201crules should be adopted only on the basis of sound, scientific justification\u201d and the Board should \u201cseriously consider the impact of the proposed rule.\u201d Pennaco summarizes the applicable rules and asserts that under MAPA and WQA, the District Court was required to consider whether the 2003 and 2006 rules were: (1) based on serious consideration of their impact; (2) adopted <em>only </em>on the basis of sound, scientific justification and <em>not </em>on the basis of projections and conjecture; (3) consistent with and not in conflict with the statute; and (4) reasonably necessary to effectuate the purposes of the WQA. It opines that failure to satisfy any of these substantive standards mandated that the District Court declare the rules invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\u00b623 Pennaco argues that the District Court should have first looked to the substantive standards in part 3 of MAPA, i.e., the Adoption and Publication of Rules section, to discern if the rules met the required substantive standards. It opines that the rules did not comply because they had no \u201csound scientific basis.\u201d Pennaco maintains that only after determining if the substantive standards are satisfied should the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>then look to part 5 of MAPA and specifically to \u00a7 2-4-506(1) and (2), MCA, to determine if either provision would allow a finding of invalidity. Pennaco maintains that by going first to \u00a7 2-4-506(2), MCA, (and without consideration of subsection (1)), the District Court overlooked the actual and correct standard of review in part 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\">\u00b624 Pennaco also posits that the court\u2019s determination of the standard of review was erroneously based on cases from this Court that did not involve either agency rulemakings or challenges under MAPA. It farther claims that the court ignored applicable cases addressing agency rulemaking. Relying on <em>Bell v. Dept. of Licensing, </em>182 Mont. 21, 23, 594 P.2d 331, 333 (1979), and <em>Board of Barbers, Etc. v. Big Sky College, Etc., </em>192 Mont. 159, 161, 626 P.2d 1269, 1270 (1981), Pennaco argues that this Court has stated that the \u201cMAPA test of \u2018reasonable necessity to effectuate the purposes of the statute\u2019 should be applied.\u201d Pennaco maintains that the application of the wrong standard of review requires this Court to vacate and remand for \u201cthe more searching review demanded by MAPA and the WQA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">\u00b625 Pennaco also asserts that the District Court failed to heed our directive that it give less deference to agency interpretations that are inconsistent or recent, and that the Board\u2019s decision to \u201cflip-flop\u201d and reverse its consistent thirty-year-old narrative approach to regulating EC and SAR was not entitled to the critical deference given it by the District Court. Pennaco claims that BER\u2019s decision to classify EC and SAR as \u201charmful\u201d parameters in 2006 was a direct reversal of its 2003 decision to not do so. It argues that the 2006 decision lacked scientific support and therefore is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">\u00b626 Pennaco proffers that application of the incorrect standard of review lowered the threshold for demonstrating the validity of the rules. It maintains that it provided the District Court with substantial evidence showing that BER had no sound scientific basis for its 2003 and 2006 rulings but by applying the wrong standard of review the court gave too much deference to BER\u2019s rulemaking decisions. It asserts that a numeric limit for EC and SAR was unnecessary because scientific studies showed that CBM-related discharges had not and would not adversely impact the state\u2019s water quality; therefore, the narrative standard was adequate to protect the state\u2019s water.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\u00b627 Pennaco also argues that the District Court misinterpreted the standard it employed; the standard was not simply \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d but rather an \u201carbitrary and capricious disregard for the purpose of the authorizing statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">\u00b628 BER counters that Pennaco failed to identify any clear error by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>the District Court and therefore failed to meet the burden of establishing reversible error. Furthermore, the Board asserts that the adoption of the numerical standards for EC and SAR was timely, necessary, scientifically and EPA supported. BER claims that it \u201cwas inundated with science\u201d dining the 2003 public comment period and that the adopted numeric standards fell within the range of science presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">\u00b629 BER posits that \u00a7 2-4-302, MCA, governs adoption of rules and <em>not </em>the review of those rules by the judicial branch. BER reiterates that the standard propounded by Pennaco-whether the rules: (1) were based on sound science (WQA); (2) were reasonably necessary (MAPA); and (3) not in conflict with the statute (MAPA)-was actually employed by the District Court when it considered the matter in the manner required by \u00a7 2-4-506(2), MCA. While BER does not disagree with Pennaco\u2019s argument vis-a-vis recent or inconsistent rulings, it claims that it is inapplicable here as BER had sound reasons for reevaluating protections to the Basin\u2019s water system from these parameters based on projected significant CBM development. BER opines that this Court should not expand judicial review of agency decisions to include reweighing the science, second-guessing BER and substituting our decision for that of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\u00b630 Furthermore, BER defends the District Court\u2019s reliance on the standard of review applied in various administrative cases which Pennaco argued was inapposite. The Board avers that <em>Winchell v. DNR, </em>1999 MT 11, 293 Mont. 89, 972 P.2d 1132, <em>Johansen v. State, </em>1999 MT 187, 295 Mont. 339, 983 P.2d 962 <em>(Johansen II), Johansen v. State, Dept. of Natural Resources, </em>1998 MT 51, 288 Mont. 39, 955 P.2d 653 <em>(Johansen I), </em>and <em>North Fork, </em>involve judicial review of a final agency decision where no review was specifically provided under MAPA. These cases, BER submits, illustrate that judicial review is limited, especially when the court is reviewing an agency decision that requires substantive agency expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">\u00b631 Intervenors NPRC and TRWUA assert that MAPA does not contain an explicit standard of review for administrative rules as it does for contested cases; therefore, absent such an explicit standard, the District Court correctly drew guidance from \u00a7 2-4-506(2), MCA, and from administrative law decisions issued by this Court. They argue that the District Court was correct because Pennaco failed to show how numeric standards are inconsistent with the protective purposes of state and federal water quality laws. Under the CWA, the Montana WQA and the Montana Constitution, establishment of water quality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>standards and nondegradation requirements is required pursuant to BER\u2019s duty to protect the environment. They maintain that under any standard of review adopted by this Corut, the District Court correctly upheld BER\u2019s adoption of the 2003 and 2006 rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\">\u00b632 Intervenors suggest that the 2003 rule adopting numeric criteria but retaining the narrative nonsignificant criterion for nondegradation review violated the nondegradation policy and was constitutionally suspect. As a consequence, they argue, BER\u2019s 2006 designation of these pollutants as \u201charmful\u201d corrected this error by establishing a numeric nondegradation standard for EC and SAR which resulted in the similar treatment of all parameters for which numeric criteria had been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">\u00b633 Pennaco replies that MAPA gave rise to this cause of action, not the MDJA, and therefore MAPA\u2019s standard of review controls. It posits that the declaratory judgment provisions do not <em>give rise </em>to a cause of action; rather, they simply allow a court to declare the rights, liabilities, and remedies of the parties once a cotut resolves the dispute. Pennaco proffers that if the standard in the MDJA applied there would be no point to MAPA having a standard of review since parties challenging agency actions typically plead declaratory judgment as a basis for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\u00b634 Pennaco clarifies that it is not arguing that BER was precluded from switching to a numeric nondegradation criterion after retaining the narrative criteria in 2003; rather, it is arguing that before reversing its previous rej ection of the numeric nondegradation criteria, the WQA required BER to provide a sound scientific justification for its action. Changing its position on \u201cpolicy\u201d grounds (to provide that EC and SAR not be treated differently from other parameters controlled by numeric criteria) does not satisfy the requirement for a \u201csound scientific justification.\u201d Nevertheless, argues Pennaco, even if BER could appropriately rely on a policy reason, its policy justifications are unpersuasive. Under the narrative standards in effect between 2003 and 2006, BER already had the authority to limit discharges of EC or SAR to levels that did not cause further degradation of the receiving waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">\u00b635  We conclude the District Court applied an appropriate standard of review to BER\u2019s 2003 and 2006 rulemakings. The court\u2019s decision specifically addressed the factors in \u00a7 2-4-305(6)(a) and (b), MCA, in that the rules were consistent with the requirements of the CWA and the WQA, and were reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute, i.e., the protection of the state\u2019s waters, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>particularly in light of the projected growth of the CBM sector in the Basin and DEQ\u2019s difficulty in issuing objective and consistent discharge permits. The court found that BER reviewed copious scientific data and relied on this data to draft rules that had sufficient scientific justification, thereby finding that WQA\u2019s mandate for \u201csound, scientific justification\u201d was met. Additionally, based on consideration of all the circumstances, the court determined that BER had not adopted rules with an \u201carbitrary and capricious disregard for the purpose of the statutes.\u201d This determination satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 2-4-506, MCA. Given the multiplicity of Acts under which Pennaco sought review (see \u00b6 16), the standard of review assembled by the District Court from these different sources was not erroneous under the circumstances with which it was presented. For these reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s application of an appropriate standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">\u00b636 <em>Did the District Court err in concluding that BER was authorized to designate EC and SAR harmful in 2006 when BER had refused to do so in 2003?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\u00b637 In response to Pennaco\u2019s complaints that BER had no scientific justification in 2006 to reverse its previous decision rejecting requests to classify EC and SAR as \u201charmful\u201d parameters, the District Court determined that BER\u2019s classification of EC and SAR as \u201charmful\u201d was consistent with the federal CWA in that it was designed to protect uses and high quality water. The court also concluded \u201cwhat the BER did in 2006 was treat discharges of EC and SAR for purposes of nondegradation review in the same manner as all other constituents for which there are numeric standards.\u201d The court recognized that BER held public hearings, received significant comments, and clearly articulated its reasons for changing its position and that BER\u2019s ruling was \u201centirely consistent with the legislative directive <em>to </em>establish \u2018objective and quantifiable criteria for various parameters.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\u00b638 On appeal, Pennaco maintains that the lack of scientific justification for the reversal in position renders the rule invalid. BER counters that it is charged with protecting the state\u2019s water under both the CWA and Montana\u2019s WQA. It maintains that it had sufficient scientific evidence to support imposition of numeric criteria in 2003 and that this same scientific data supported its 2006 decision to reclassify EC and SAR as \u201charmful.\u201d Moreover, it defends its decision on the ground that re-classification of the two parameters resulted in the uniform treatment of all parameters for which numeric criteria had been established, rather than the irregular regulation of EC and SAR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>that resulted from the 2003 ruling. BER asserts that this policy change was within its authority, was supported by scientific data, and was required to protect high quality waters in Montana from degradation. BER\u2019s rationale for its decision appears in its Notice of Amendment issued in May 2006:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-3\">The board finds that EC and SAR should be categorized as \u201charmful\u201d for the purpose of implementing Montana\u2019s nondegradation policy. The board notes that the intent of Montana\u2019s nondegradation policy is to protect the increment of \u201chigh quality\u2019 water that exists between ambient water quality and the numeric water quality standards.... Given that numeric standards have been adopted for EC and SAR, the board is uncomfortable with the inconsistency of the current \u201cnarrative\u201d classification of EC and SAR, which is used solely for parameters for which no numeric standards have been adopted. Since all other parameters with numeric water quality standards are classified as either carcinogenic, toxic, or harmful, the board believes that EC and SAR should be treated in a similar manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5v\">\u00b639 We are not persuaded by Pennaco\u2019s argument that BER\u2019s decision should be afforded decreased deference by virtue of the fact that it is a reversal of an earlier decision. Pennaco relies for this argument upon <em>National Wildlife Fed. v. Nat\u2019l Marine Fish. Serv., </em>422 F.3d 782 (9th Cir. 2005), in which the U. S. Court of Appeals stated \u201c[a]n agency interpretation of a relevant provision which conflicts with the agencys earlier interpretation is \u2018entitled to considerably less deference,\u2019 than a consistently held agency view.\u201d <em>National Wildlife, </em>422 F.3d at 799. However, we conclude that <em>National Wildlife </em>is inapposite. In that case, the district court found invalid two NMFS opinions issued over a period of four years. In its second opinion, according to the court, the agency had directly reversed its earlier opinion, but erroneously failed to take account of several significant factors in doing so. Here, by contrast, BER\u2019s decision to classify EC and SAR as \u201charmful\u201d for purposes of nondegradation review was not as much a reversal of an earlier decision as it was a recognition that it had created an inconsistent regulatory scheme with its 2003 rules. Moreover, while rejecting a 2003 request to classify these parameters as harmful at the time, BER had expressly agreed to continue studying the effects of these pollutants. Upon learning that its 2003 rule potentially allowed dischargers to discharge a level up to the numeric standards regardless of the background level of these parameters in the receiving waters, BER revised its rule to create consistency of regulation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>protect the Basin\u2019s water.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">\u00b640  We conclude that BER was authorized to classify EC and SAR as \u201charmful\u201d under its mandate to protect the waters of Montana and to achieve regulatory consistency with other parameters for which numeric standards had been adopted. While this may have been a policy-based decision, there appears to be adequate scientific justification in the rulemaking record. This rule protected high quality water by requiring permit writers to stop short of allowing degradation up to the standard; it was reasonably necessary to ensure consistency in permitting and protection of the receiving waters, and it was consistent with the authorizing statutes. The District Court did not err in so concluding.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">\u00b641 <em>Did the District Court err in concluding that BER\u2019s revised rule was not \u201cmore stringent\u201d than federal law, and therefore BER was not statutorily required to issue written findings of fact?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">\u00b642 Finally, Pennaco argues that BER was statutorily required to issue written findings because it adopted rules that were more stringent than corresponding federal rules. The District Court rejected this argument, as do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">\u00b643 The District Court noted that DEQ issued two legal opinions to BER stating that neither the 2003 numeric water quality standard nor the 2006 nonsignificance criteria were more stringent than comparable or corresponding federal regulations. The court rejected Pennaco\u2019s argument that when EPA approved the earlier-promulgated \u201cnarrative\u201d water quality standard (presumably around 1972), the narrative standard became the federal standard so that the adoption of numeric standards constituted a \u201cmore stringent\u201d standard. The court similarly rejected Pennaco\u2019s argument that when EPA approved the narrative nonsignificance criteria in 2003, this became the federal standard. The District Court stated that Pennaco offered no legal authority for its proposition that EPA\u2019s <em>approval </em>of state narrative standards \u201cfederalizes\u201d such standards in such a way as to trigger the \u201cwritten justification\u201d requirement in the Montana statutes. The District Court determined that neither the plain language of the statutes nor the legislative histories supported Pennaco\u2019s interpretation. It further concluded that \u00a7\u00a7 75-5-203 and -309, MCA, requiring such written findings, were triggered by EPA-promulgated regulations or criteria, not mere approval of a state standard. The court concluded that because there were no corresponding federal numeric standards for EC or SAR, BER\u2019s adoption of numeric standards was not \u201cmore stringent\u201d than a federal standard. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>further opined that the classification of EC and SAR as \u201charmful\u201d parameters was consistent with the federal CWA rather than \u201cmore stringent\u201d or in conflict with federal requirements. Accordingly, because the 2006 classification was not more stringent than or in conflict with federal standards, no additional written findings were required.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-3\">\u00b644 We find no fault with the District Court\u2019s analysis. We disagree with Pennaco\u2019s argument that EPA\u2019s approval of BER\u2019s revised rules in 2003 established federal criteria for EC and SAR, the subsequent revision of which would constitute a more stringent standard triggering written findings. Furthermore, we find no authority to support a conclusion that BER\u2019s classification of EC and SAR as \u201charmful\u201d parameters and the consequential nondegradation review rule constitute a \u201cmore stringent\u201d standard in light of the fact that EPA has not adopted a corresponding standard. The revised rule is consistent with 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 131.11(a)(1) which requires states to adopt water quality standards to protect designated uses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-4\">131.11(a) Inclusion of pollutants: (1) States must adopt those water quality criteria that protect the designated use. Such criteria must be based on sound scientific rationale and must contain sufficient parameters or constituents to protect the designated use. For waters with multiple use designations, the criteria shall support the most sensitive use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">\u00b645 In addition, BER\u2019s 2006 nondegradation rule appears to be consistent with EPA\u2019s antidegradation policy at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 131.12, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">(a) The State shall develop and adopt a statewide antidegradation policy and identify the methods for implementing such policy pursuant to this subpart. The antidegradation policy and implementation methods shall, at a minimum, be consistent with the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">(1) Existing instream water uses and the level of water quality necessary to protect the existing uses shall be maintained and protected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\">(2) Where the quality of the waters exceed levels necessary to support propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and recreation in and on the water, that quality shall be maintained and protected unless the State finds, after full satisfaction of the intergovernmental coordination and public participation provisions of the State\u2019s continuing planning process, that allowing lower water quality is necessary to accommodate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>important economic or social development in the area in which the waters are located. In allowing such degradation or lower water quality, the State shall assure water quality adequate to protect existing uses fully. Further, the State shall assure that there shall be achieved the highest statutory and regulatory requirements for all new and existing point sources and all cost-effective and reasonable best management practices for nonpoint source control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">\u00b646 Lastly, while not determinative of our decision here, we note that subsequent to the District Court proceedings in this matter, the EPA issued a letter on February 29, 2008, approving BER\u2019s revision to the nondegradation provision in ARM 17.30.670(6), and stating that the revised rule was consistent with the requirements of the CWA and EPA\u2019s antidegradation provisions codified at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 131.12. EPA stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">The revised water quality standards amend Montana\u2019s nondegradation requirements applicable to [EC and SAR] for the ... Powder River [Basin]. The revision to ARM 17.30.670(6) classifies EC and SAR as \u201charmful\u201d parameters for the purposes of making nonsignificance determinations for high quality waters. Specifically, the revised rule now reads: \u201cEC and SAR are harmful parameters for the purposes of the Montana Water Quality Act, Title 75, Chapter 5, MCA.\u201d EC and SAR, therefore, now will be subject to the nonsignificance criteria in ARM 17.30.715(1)(f), which provides, in part, that changes in high quality waters will be considered nonsignificant where \"... changes outside of a mixing zone designated by the department are less than 10% of the applicable standard and the existing water quality level is less than 40% of the standard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Thus, EPA expressly approved BER\u2019s 2006 nondegradation rule as being consistent with its mandates.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">\u00b647  Based on the record, the District Court correctly concluded that BER\u2019s 2003 and 2006 rules have a scientific basis, are reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the applicable statutes, are consistent and not in conflict with the relevant statutes, have not been adopted with an arbitrary and capricious disregard for the purpose of the authorizing statutes, and are consistent with and not more stringent than EPA\u2019s antidegradation policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">\u00b648 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b450-9\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, MORRIS, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-5\"> SAR is the concentration of sodium relative to calcium and magnesium in water.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b437-6\"> EC-electrical conductivity of water means the ability of water to conduct an electrical current at 25 degrees C.
