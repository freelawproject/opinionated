Baker appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court violate Montana\u2019s sentencing policies in sentencing Baker?</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court violate Baker\u2019s constitutional rights in sentencing her?</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court violate \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201(4)(o) and -202(1)(f), MCA, by revoking Baker\u2019s driving privileges for 40 years?</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">\u00b66 On the afternoon of April 29, 2006, Baker was driving on U.S. Highway 2 west of Columbia Falls, Montana, when she lost control of her vehicle and slid into oncoming traffic. Baker\u2019s car hit a motorcycle driven by William Daniel Haller, Jr., killing him instantly. Baker\u2019s sister, who was a passenger in Baker\u2019s car, also died in the accident. Baker was injured and flown to a hospital, where a blood sample revealed that her blood alcohol level was more than twice the legal limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">\u00b67 The State of Montana charged Baker with two counts of vehicular homicide while under the influence of alcohol, and Baker entered a guilty plea. At the sentencing hearing, the State presented many witnesses regarding the tragic loss of Haller\u2019s life. Two relatives of Baker\u2019s testified, on her behalf, that she had become a problem drinker and needed help. Phoebe Titus, a chemical dependency expert who had interviewed Baker, testified on Baker\u2019s behalf that she concluded Baker was an alcoholic. Titus recommended that Baker undergo long-term alcoholism treatment in a structured environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">\u00b68 The District Court sentenced Baker to 15 years in prison, all suspended, on the first count of vehicular homicide while under the influence, and 25 years in prison, 5 suspended, on the second count. The sentences are to be served consecutively. The court also imposed conditions, including one which prohibits Baker from operating a motor vehicle during her 40-year sentence. The court gave several reasons for the sentence it imposed, including the devastating loss incurred as a result of Baker\u2019s action, its great concern with Baker\u2019s reported inability to stop drinking even after the accident, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>acknowledgement of the legislative determination that vehicular homicide is a more reprehensible crime than negligent homicide and, thus, subject to stricter statutory punishment. Baker did not object to any part of the sentence imposed. She now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\u00b69 As a general rule, we review criminal sentences for legality only. Equitable claims must be presented to the Sentence Review Division. <em>See State v. Herd, </em>2004 MT 85, \u00b6 22, 320 Mont. 490, \u00b6 22, 87 P.3d 1017, \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\u00b610 Under certain circumstances, we review sentencing conditions under a two-tiered procedure. We first review the condition for legality, to determine whether it falls within statutory parameters. If the condition is legal, we then review its reasonableness to determine whether the district court has abused its discretion. <em>See State v. Ashby, </em>2008 MT 83, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9, 342 Mont. 187, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9, 179 P.3d 1164, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9; <em>State v. Hameline, </em>2008 MT 241, \u00b6 8, 344 Mont. 461, \u00b6 8, 188 P.3d 1052, \u00b6 8 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">\u00b611 As suggested above, however, such reviews depend initially on other considerations. We will review a sentence for legality even if the claim was not raised in the district court. <em>State v. Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. 338, 343, 602 P.2d 997, 1000 (1979). Conversely, we consider an argument that a sentencing condition was objectionable, but otherwise legal, only if the argument was raised in the district court. <em>See State v. Kotwicki, </em>2007 MT 17, \u00b6 18, 335 Mont. 344, \u00b6 18, 151 P.3d 892, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">\u00b612 Did the District Court violate Montana\u2019s sentencing policies in sentencing Baker?</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">\u00b613 Baker contends the District Court\u2019s 40-year sentence is illegal because it violates Montana\u2019s correctional and sentencing policies as set forth in \u00a7 46-18-101, MCA. Specifically, she asserts the lengths of her sentences are not understandable, commensurate with the punishment imposed on other persons committing the same offense or neutral with respect to her race, as required by \u00a7 46-18-101(3)(a), (b) and (c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">\u00b614 \u201cA person convicted of vehicular homicide while under the influence shall be imprisoned ... for a term not to exceed 30 years.\u201d Section 45-5-106(3), MCA. Here, the District Court sentenced Baker to fewer years in prison than allowed by statute for each of her two convictions of vehicular homicide while under the influence. Her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>sentences are well within the statutory parameters as to length and, consequently, we conclude they are legal. <em>See Ashby, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\u00b615  Baker\u2019s contentions that the terms of incarceration violate statutory sentencing policies are equity issues, review of which lies with the Sentence Review Division, not this Court. <em>See State v. Legg, </em>2004 MT 26, \u00b6 53, 319 Mont. 362, \u00b6 53, 84 P.3d 648, \u00b6 53. As a result, we decline to consider this issue further.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">\u00b6 16 Did the District Court violate Baker\u2019s constitutional rights in sentencing her?</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">\u00b617 Baker points out that the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 22 of the Constitution of the State of Montana guarantee against cruel or unusual punishment; Article II, Section 4 of Montana\u2019s Constitution guarantees equal protection <em>of </em>the laws and no discrimination by the State in the exercise of a person\u2019s civil or political rights on account of race; and Article II, Section 17 guarantees no deprivation of life, liberty or property without due process of law. Baker asserts her sentence of 40 years in prison with 20 years suspended violates all of these constitutional guarantees because, she claims, the court sentenced her based on her race. Stated differently, Baker contends the sentence is illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">\u00b618 In her opening brief, Baker advanced no case law and presented no legal analysis in support of her constitutional arguments. M. R. App. P. 12(l)f requires the argument section of an appellant\u2019s opening brief to contain the contentions with respect to the issues, the reasons therefor and citations to the authorities relied upon. The appellant bears the burden of establishing error by a trial court. <em>State v. Torgerson, </em>2008 MT 303, \u00b6 36, 345 Mont. 532, \u00b6 36, 192 P.3d 695, \u00b6 36 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">\u00b619  We conclude Baker has failed to establish that the District Court violated her constitutional rights in imposing terms of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">\u00b620 Did the District Court violate \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201(4)(o) and - 202(1) (f), MCA, by revoking Baker\u2019s driving privileges for 40 years?</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">\u00b621 Section 46-18-201(4)(a) through (n), MCA, authorizes a sentencing court to impose certain \u201creasonable restrictions\u201d on an offender during any deferred or suspended portion of a sentence. Sections 46-18-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>201(4)(o) and -202(1)(f), MCA, allow a sentencing judge to impose any other limitation on the sentence reasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society. Baker contends-for the first time on appeal-that the condition that she not operate a motor vehicle during her entire 40-year sentence violates both of these statutes because it is neither reasonable nor reasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victims and society. Thus, she argues, the condition is illegal. Baker is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">\u00b622 In <em>Hameline, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-14, we clarified that challenges to sentencing conditions imposed under \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-20l(4)(o) and -202(1)(f), MCA, are to objectionable sentences rather than to illegal sentences. We do not review objectionable sentencing conditions on appeal unless the argument was raised in the district court. <em>See Kotwicki, </em>\u00b6 18. Because Baker failed to contest the driving ban in the District Court, we decline to address her argument further.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u00b623 We conclude that Baker, having failed to challenge this objectionable sentencing condition in the District Court, cannot raise the argument here.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">\u00b624 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b183-7\">JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER, COTTER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
