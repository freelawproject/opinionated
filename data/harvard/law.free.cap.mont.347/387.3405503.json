We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"A7V\">\u00b62 Locke presents the following issue for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b407-23\">\u00b63 Whether the district court properly denied Locke\u2019s motion to withdraw his <em>Alford </em>plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">\u00b64 Officers responded to a report of a fight near the 1-90 ramp at Van Buren Street in Missoula, Montana, on May 28, 2005. The report involved ajuvenile panhandling for money. Officer Hebert encountered Locke and a female companion. Locke and the woman volunteered that nothing had happened and that they were not with \u201cthe boy.\u201d Officer Hebert had not mentioned a boy\u2019s involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u00b65 The boy\u2019s mother later approached the officers to inform them that Locke had assaulted her hearing-impaired son. Through his mother, the boy, age 13, stated that he had seen Locke and his female companion soliciting money from drivers at the interchange. He had decided to try the same thing. The boy had been standing at the interchange for a short time when a driver stopped and gave him five dollars. Locke approached the boy, punched him in the stomach with his left fist, and punched him in the lower back with his right fist. According to the boy, Locke then reached into the boy\u2019s pocket and took the five dollars that the driver had given him. Locke told the officers that the boy was lying. Locke contended that the boy had swung first at him and that he had done nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\u00b66 Locke initially pled \u201cnot guilty\u201d to the felony robbery charge. Locke later informed the court, however, that he thought it was in his best interest to enter a plea of guilty and waive his rights. The court examined the information and affidavit and determined that a factual basis existed for the charge. The court accepted Locke\u2019s <em>Alford </em>plea. The court ordered a presentencing investigation (PSI) report and scheduled sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">\u00b67 The court reviewed the plea agreement and the PSI before sentencing. The PSI indicated that Locke still professed his innocence. The court advised Locke of the three types of pleas, including the right to plead \u201cnot guilty.\u201d Locke again expressed his desire to enter an <em>Alford </em>plea. The court explained to Locke that his <em>Alford </em>plea meant that he was not admitting to the crime, but that he believed the State could prove that he had committed the crime. Locke indicated that he understood the meaning of his <em>Alford </em>plea. Locke further confirmed to the court that he understood that his <em>Alford </em>plea would result in a plea agreement that would allow him to receive a suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">\u00b68 The court advised Locke that it would not revisit his original offense if it ever revoked his suspended sentence. Locke responded affirmatively to the court that he understood. The court advised the parties that it would follow the plea agreement. The court sentenced Locke to the Montana State Prison for five years. The court suspended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Locke\u2019s sentence, imposed terms and conditions for the suspension, and released him on January 3, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\u00b69 The State petitioned to revoke Locke\u2019s suspended sentence on March 2, 2006, for violations of the no alcohol and no bars condition of his suspended sentence. The State submitted a report of violations that included three infractions. Locke\u2019s first infraction occurred when he admitted on January 9, 2006, that he drank a beer on his way from court to the probation office. Locke further admitted that he drank the following three days before his arrest by his probation officer. Locke\u2019s second infraction happened when officers arrested him on February 7, 2006, for drinking in downtown Missoula. Locke agreed to a breathalyzer that revealed a blood alcohol content of 0.246. Locke\u2019s third infraction took place on February 23, 2006, when his probation officer arrested him for arriving drunk at a scheduled probation appointment. Locke again agreed to a breathalyzer that revealed a blood alcohol content of 0.222.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u00b610 Locke admitted to the violations. The court revoked Locke\u2019s suspended sentence and sentenced him to a five-year commitment with the Department of Corrections (DOC). The court allowed credit for time previously served. The court remanded Locke to the custody of the DOC on March 14, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\u00b611 Locke timely filed a self-represented litigant petition for post-conviction relief in which he had alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. The District Court appointed counsel to represent Locke in the post-conviction proceeding. Locke filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The District Court entered an order denying Locke\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea. Locke appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">\u00b612 We review a defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw a guilty plea to determine if the guilty plea was voluntary. <em>State v. Phillips, </em>2007 MT 117, \u00b6 12, 337 Mont. 248, \u00b6 12, 159 P.3d 1078, \u00b6 12 (citations omitted). Our determination of whether a plea was voluntary involves a mixed question of law and fact that we review de novo. <em>Phillips, </em>\u00b6 12. We review the underlying factual findings to determine if they are clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Jones, </em>2008 MT 331, \u00b6 12, 346 Mont. 173, \u00b6 12, 194 P.3d 86, \u00b6 12 (citations omitted). We review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the law for correctness. <em>Jones, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">\u00b613 <em>Whether the district court properly denied Locke\u2019s motion to withdraw his Alford plea.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\u00b614 Locke\u2019s <em>Alford </em>plea enabled him to enter a plea agreement that provided for a suspended sentence rather than the possible maximum term for felony robbery. Locke argues, however, that the court failed to establish a factual basis for his <em>Alford </em>plea when it reviewed only the information and affidavit. Locke claims that the court\u2019s failure to establish a factual basis to support the plea provides \u201cgood cause\u201d to withdraw his <em>Alford </em>plea, as allowed by \u00a7 46-16-105(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">\u00b615 The crux of the issue on appeal is not whether the court\u2019s colloquy with Locke established a factual basis to support Locke\u2019s <em>Alford </em>plea. The issue for review is whether Locke <em>voluntarily </em>entered an <em>Alford </em>plea. <em>Phillips, </em>\u00b6 12 (emphasis added). Guilty pleas must be voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. <em>Phillips, </em>\u00b6 24. A plea is voluntary only when the defendant is aware fully of the direct consequences of the plea, including any commitments made to him by the court, the State, or his own counsel. <em>Jones, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">\u00b616 The State filed the information and charged Locke with felony robbery. Locke appeared before the court, represented by counsel, and entered a plea of \u201cnot guilty.\u201d Locke assured the court that he understood the proceedings, consequences, charge, and his rights. Locke later appeared before the court and changed his plea to \u201cguilty\u201d by entering an <em>Alford </em>plea. Locke again confirmed to the court that he understood the proceedings, consequences, charge, and his rights. Locke conceded that the \u201cfacts in the complaint\u201d established a factual basis for the charge and his plea. The court inquired whether Locke believed the <em>Alford </em>plea to be in his best interest as required by \u00a7 46-12-212(2), MCA. Locke responded affirmatively. Locke told the court that he believed that the jury would be swayed by the victim\u2019s hearing impairment and rule against him if his case went to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">\u00b617 The court addressed Locke\u2019s renewed claim of innocence at the sentencing hearing and explained to Locke that he had the right to choose \u201cnot guilty.\u201d The court further explained the meaning of his <em>Alford </em>plea and asked Locke if he understood. Locke responded affirmatively. The court asked Locke if he understood that his <em>Alford </em>plea allowed him to obtain the benefit of the plea agreement offered by the State. Locke again responded affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">\u00b618 Locke argues that our decision in <em>State v. Frazier, </em>2007 MT 40, \u00b6 21, 336 Mont. 81, \u00b6 21, 153 P.3d 18, \u00b6 21, required the District Court to elicit admissions from him regarding the offense. <em>Frazier </em>addressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>a claim of an involuntary guilty plea that required the Court to interpret subsection (1) of \u00a7 46-12-212, MCA. <em>Frazier, </em>\u00b6 21. Locke, by contrast, professed his innocence throughout the proceedings. Section 46-12-212(2), MCA, nevertheless allowed the court to accept an <em>Alford, </em>plea if a factual basis existed to support the charge and the plea would have been in Locke\u2019s best interest. This statutory procedure permits a defendant to plead guilty without actually admitting to the charge if a defendant has reviewed the evidence against him, if the defendant is capable of making a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent choice, and if the record contains strong evidence of guilt. <em>See </em>Commission Comments to \u00a7 46-12-212(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">\u00b619 Nothing in the record indicates that Locke was not capable of making a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent choice. Locke repeatedly confirmed to the court that he had reviewed the evidence against him. He understood the claims made by the victim. Locke admitted to having been at the scene of the alleged assault. Locke expressly maintained his innocence, however, and thus the District Court had to look to other sources, independent from any admissions by Locke, for strong evidence to support the charge. The information and affidavit provided that source. Locke further informed the court that he felt the jury would believe the alleged victim\u2019s version of events. Locke opted to accept the State\u2019s plea agreement that resulted in a suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\u00b620 The Dissent contends that the court\u2019s review of the information and affidavit could not establish strong evidence of Locke\u2019s guilt in light of the fact that the affidavit \u201cshowed nothing more than that Locke was at the scene of the crime.\u201d \u00b6 29. The affidavit certainly placed Locke at the scene of the crime. The affidavit also asserted that Locke knew, without prompting, the reason for the police officers\u2019 arrival at the scene. Locke and his companion initially declared that nothing had happened and that they were not with \u201cthe boy.\u201d The officer had not yet mentioned the involvement of any boy.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\u00b621 The affidavit noted that the victim claimed that Locke had punched him and taken money from him. Nothing in the affidavit cast doubt upon the victim\u2019s credibility. As noted by the District Court, however, the affidavit cast doubt upon Locke\u2019s credibility. The affidavit asserted that Locke had changed his story from his initial claim that nothing had happened. Locke told officers that the \u201ckid was lying\u201d about having had money taken from him. Locke further told the officer that the kid had thrown the first punch. Like many criminal prosecutions, the case likely would have involved resolution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>competing claims about what happened. The jury would have been required to weigh the evidence based on the credibility of Locke and the victim to determine which version of events should prevail. <em>State v. Stucker, </em>1999 MT 14, \u00b6 22, 293 Mont. 123, \u00b6 22, 973 P.2d 835, \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajm\">\u00b622 Finally, the District Court anticipated Locke\u2019s eventual claim of an involuntary plea when it accepted Locke\u2019s <em>Alford </em>plea and imposed the suspended sentence recommended by the plea agreement. The following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-4\">Court: Throughout this Pre-sentence Investigation, you continually claim you are innocent of this charge. And, as you know, you have a choice when you enter a plea of-you can enter a plea of not guilty, a plea of guilty, or a plea of nolo contendere, or an Alford plea. And the plea that you entered was an Alford plea-that was the plea-identified in here as an Alford plea-or nolo contendere-and the plea that you entered was the type in which you said I am not admitting that I did these things but I think the State can prove that I did this crime. This crime being robbery. And in exchange for entering that plea, you received a plea agreement that is set out in this form. Do you understand that, as well?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">Defendant: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">Court: And I bring this-I bring this matter up because frequently when people are on a sentence-like you have here which calls for a suspended sentence-and they are facing a revocation of that sentence because they violated probation, they want to go back to the original crime and say why should-you shouldn\u2019t even be revoking me on this because I never did the crime in the first place. Okay. But I\u2019m telling you now, if that occasion ever occurs, we don\u2019t discuss this original crime because it\u2019s history-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6o\">Locke: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">Court: - and that\u2019s the way it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\">Locke: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">Court: And I\u2019m telling you upfront so, if you\u2019re back here again, I don\u2019t want to hear about it that I didn\u2019t really do this crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-N\">Okay? Are we clear on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-10\">Locke: We\u2019re clear, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">\u00b623  Despite the court\u2019s prescience, Locke brought the identical claim upon risk of revocation of his suspended sentence that he assured the court that he would not. It is well settled, however, that a district court\u2019s decision is presumed correct and an appellant bears the burden of establishing error. <em>State v. Buck, </em>2006 MT 81, \u00b6 30, 331 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Mont. 517, \u00b6 30, 134 P.3d, 53, \u00b6 30. Locke has failed to establish that he entered his <em>Alford </em>plea involuntarily. Our review of the record clearly demonstrates that Locke voluntarily entered his <em>Alford </em>plea. <em>Phillips, </em>\u00b6 12; <em>Jones, </em>\u00b6 12. Locke\u2019s voluntary <em>Alford </em>plea disposes this issue as he has failed to establish error on appeal. <em>Buck, </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">\u00b624 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b413-5\">JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b413-6\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"AbvT\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\u00b625 I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">\u00b626 Section 46-12-212(2), MCA, sets out the requirements for the Court\u2019s acceptance of an <em>Alford </em>plea. This statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\">A defendant who is unwilling to admit to any element of the offense that would provide a factual basis for a plea of guilty may, with the consent of the court, enter a plea of guilty or may, with the consent of the court and the prosecutor, enter a plea of nolo contendere to the offense if the defendant considers the plea to be in the defendant\u2019s best interest and the court determines that there is a factual basis for the plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">\u00b627 In <em>State v. Frazier, </em>2007 MT 40, 336 Mont. 81, 153 P.3d 18, this Court set out the standards for the trial court\u2019s determination of the factual basis for the plea when the defendant enters an <em>Alford </em>plea. Specifically, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-11\">If a defendant is \u201cunwilling to admit to any element of the offense,\u201d the court must reject the guilty plea or treat the plea as an \u201cAlford plea\u201d and apply the stricter standards of \u00a7 46-12-212(2), MCA, which requires \u201cstrong evidence of guilt.\u201d <em>See Commission Comments </em>to \u00a7 46-12-212, MCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-12\"><em>Frazier, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">\u00b628 Here, the District Court did not properly determine a factual basis for accepting defendant\u2019s <em>Alford </em>plea. The court failed to elicit admissions from Locke or consider any actual evidence from the State beyond the allegations in the affidavit and information, so as to determine Locke\u2019s involvement in the offense. The District Court failed to question Locke regarding any fact other than whether he understood what he was doing. Indeed, the trial judge did not ask Locke or the prosecutor a single question regarding the actual offense to which Locke was entering his <em>Alford </em>plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-14\">\u00b629 Rather, the court merely reviewed the information and the affidavit in support of the information and then accepted the plea, without more. The District Court\u2019s reliance on the information and supporting affidavit was insufficient to determine a factual basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>establishing \u201cstrong evidence of guilt\u201d for accepting the plea. The affidavit contained nothing more than a statement of probable cause for leave to grant the filing of the information. Moreover, the affidavit showed nothing more than that Locke was present at the scene of the crime. That fact, in turn and in and of itself, is insufficient to establish criminal responsibility. <em>State v. Flatley, </em>2000 MT 295, \u00b6 12, 302 Mont. 314, \u00b6 12, 14 P.3d 1195, \u00b6 12 (\u201cMere presence at the scene of a crime is ... insufficient to establish criminal responsibility. <em>State ex rel. Murphy v. McKinnon </em>(1976), 171 Mont. 120, 125, 556 P.2d 906, 909.\u201d). Finally, the affidavit simply contained conflicting versions of the alleged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">\u00b630 While the Court goes to some length to justify reaching the Opinion\u2019s result, what is most troubling is that the Court\u2019s approach simply ignores what we required in <em>Frazier. </em>The Court\u2019s decision here stands for the proposition that, now, all that \u00a7 46-12-212(2), MCA, requires is for the trial court to look at the affidavit and information; make factual judgments and credibility determinations from the mere allegations contained in those documents; and, from that cold paper review, determine the defendant\u2019s guilt. The trial judge never needs to ask either the defendant or the prosecutor a single question; the court needs no actual \u201cevidence\u201d of the defendant\u2019s guilt at all. If this suffices for the \u201cstrong evidence of guilt\u201d that we required in <em>Frazier, </em>then it is impossible to envision what a lesser quantum of evidence might be.</p>\n<p id=\"ANG\">\u00b631 Instead of perpetuating the facade of a precedent we choose not to follow, we should simply overrule <em>Frazier </em>and its progeny and avoid the pretense that these cases still stand for any principle of law which we will enforce in some future case.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">\u00b632 I would follow our precedent. I conclude that the trial court\u2019s failure to elicit admissions from Locke or consider any actual evidence from the State beyond the conflicting allegations in the affidavit and information, in order to determine defendant\u2019s involvement in the offense, was clear error. The District Court\u2019s colloquy in accepting Locke\u2019s plea was insufficient as a matter of law to establish \u201cstrong evidence of guilt.\u201d The trial court\u2019s failure to elicit admissions or obtain other evidence of guilt violates the unambiguous requirements of \u00a7 46-12-212(2), MCA, as interpreted by this Court in <em>Frazier.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\u00b633 Accordingly, I would reverse and remand, and direct the District Court to allow Locke to withdraw his <em>Alford </em>plea. From our failure to do so, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
