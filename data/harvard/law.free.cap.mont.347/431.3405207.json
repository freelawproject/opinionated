After a jury trial in the Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County, Neal was awarded $7,358.56 in damages and $1,275.00 in attorney fees. Neal appeals and Nelson cross-appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err by denying Neal\u2019s motion for a new trial after determining that substantial credible evidence supported the jury\u2019s award of $7,358.56 in damages?</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by admitting defendant\u2019s expert testimony about Neal\u2019s prior knee and back injuries?</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying Neal\u2019s proposed jury instruction on multiple causation?</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">\u00b66 4. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by allowing Dr. Wilson to testify after concluding that the financial information the court had ordered Dr. Wilson to provide was satisfactory?</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">\u00b67 5. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by awarding Neal attorney fees pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 37(c) after Nelson failed to admit prior to trial that Neal had been injured in the car accident?</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">\u00b68 On the morning of October 30, 2002, Neal was sitting in his vehicle at a stop light when Nelson negligently drove into the rear of Neal\u2019s vehicle. Neither vehicle\u2019s airbags deployed in the collision. Neal, a firefighter with the Kalispell Fire Department, did not request any medical treatment at the scene. Both parties drove away in their vehicles after the highway patrol completed its investigation. Later that same day, Neal visited his personal chiropractor, Dr. Steven Biggs, who diagnosed Neal with a cervical sprain/strain, thoracic sprain/strain, and muscle spasms.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">\u00b69 At the time of the accident, Neal was on leave from work with the Kalispell Fire Department due to a work-related knee injury. He continued periodic treatment with Dr. Biggs for his neck injury, and by January 2003, was reporting a pain level of two on a scale of one-to-ten. However, Dr. Biggs ordered an MRI of Neal\u2019s neck in February 2003 because a knot in Neal\u2019s neck was only improving slowly. After reviewing the MRI, Dr. Biggs advised Neal that he may eventually need surgery on his neck if he continued to wear his firefighting helmet at work. Dr. Biggs referred Neal to Dr. Robert Hollis, a neurosurgeon. Dr. Hollis did not, as Neal now asserts, state that Neal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>would more likely than not need surgery. Rather, Dr. Hollis reported that Neal could \u201ccontinue his conservative measures knowing that at some point he may require surgical decompression.\u201d According to his report admitted at trial, Dr. Hollis did not advise Neal against wearing ahelmet or continuing on as a firefighter. Dr. Hollis then referred Neal to Dr. Steven Martini, who recommended that Neal consider physical therapy, facet injections, or a nuclear medicine scan, as appropriate. Neal did not follow those recommendations or request a second opinion regarding whether he should retire from firefighting.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\u00b610 Neal did not report his neck injury to Dr. Jonathan Bechard when he visited the Veteran\u2019s Administration Clinic in March 2003, but did report the work-related knee injury, as well as chronic low back pain that occasionally bothered him. After recovering from his knee injury and returning to work on April 1, 2003, Neal did not miss any work due to the neck strain, but retired at the end of 2003, and continued to wear his firefighting helmet during that time. Neal did not report his neck pain to the Kalispell Fire Department, explaining that the Department required firefighters to be \u201c100 percent\u201d healthy in order to work. Upon announcing his retirement later that year, Neal underwent an exit physical with RNP Alison Charman at Kalispell Diagnostic Services. Once again Neal reported his knee injury and chronic lower back pain, but did not report any problems with his neck.</p>\n<p id=\"A8U\">\u00b611 Prior to trial, Nelson admitted negligence in causing the car accident but denied that he had caused Neal\u2019s neck injury. The central issue at trial was whether Neal\u2019s neck injury forced him to retire five years earlier than he had planned. According to Neal, he did not decide to retire until after Dr. Biggs told him to avoid activities requiring the use of a helmet, including firefighting, in February 2003. Other testimony and evidence revealed that Neal had told a doctor nearly five years before the accident that he was considering retiring in 1999. In addition, four days after the accident, on November 4, 2002, Neal advised the Public Employees Retirement Administration (PERS) that he was considering retiring at the end of 2002. In January 2003, one month before his conversation with Dr. Biggs, Neal also submitted an application to Flathead Valley Community College to teach in their Fire Science/EMS Department. All of this occurred before Neal was advised against wearing a helmet at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\u00b612 Neal underwent an Independent Medical Evaluation (IME) with Dr. Lennard Wilson just prior to trial. Dr. Wilson agreed that Neal suffered a neck sprain or strain as a result of the accident, but stated that 90 percent of people with such injuries get better. Dr. Wilson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>testified that Neal could have kept working as a firefighter without having surgery, even though he had reached maximum medical improvement, but would likely continue to experience some chronic pain in his neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">\u00b613 At the close of trial, the jury found that Neal was injured and that Nelson\u2019s negligence caused Neal\u2019s injury. However, the jury awarded Neal only $7,358.56, which matched the amount he had requested for past medical expenses. Neal moved the District Court for a new trial on damages, arguing that the jury disregarded uncontroverted evidence that Neal suffered pain and will incur future medical expenses as a result of his neck injury. The District Court denied Neal\u2019s motion for a new trial, observing that the evidence demonstrated a significant dispute regarding the nature, cause, and severity of Neal\u2019s injuries, and therefore it was possible that the jury\u2019s award included compensation for both past medical expenses and future pain and suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\u00b614 Neal appeals. Additional facts will be discussed herein as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">\u00b615 We recently clarified our standard of review of a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a new trial, where the basis of the motion is insufficiency of the evidence, in <em>Giambra v. Kelsey, </em>2007 MT 158, \u00b6\u00b6 24-27, 338 Mont. 19, \u00b6\u00b6 24-27, 162 P.3d 134, \u00b6\u00b6 24-27. \u201cOur review of a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a new trial where the basis of the motion is insufficiency of the evidence is de novo. Like the district court, we determine whether there was substantial evidence to support the verdict.\u201d <em>Giambra, </em>\u00b6 27 (citing <em>Renville v. Taylor, </em>2000 MT 217, \u00b6 14, 301 Mont. 99, \u00b6 14, 7 P.3d 400, \u00b6 14). In determining whether substantial evidence supports the verdict, we view the evidence in a light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>Jenks v. Bertelsen, </em>2004 MT 50, \u00b6 30, 320 Mont. 139, \u00b6 30, 86 P.3d 24, \u00b6 30. Where substantial evidence supports a verdict, the verdict generally cannot be overturned or vacated. <em>Giambra, </em>\u00b6 26. We may not substitute our judgment for that of the jury as to the proper amount of damages. <em>Moore v. Beye, </em>2005 MT 266, \u00b6 11, 329 Mont. 109, \u00b6 11, 122 P.3d 1212, \u00b6 11, <em>overruled on other grounds by Giambra, </em>\u00b6 27 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">\u00b616 A district court has broad discretion to determine the admissibility of evidence. <em>Seeley v. Kreitzenberg Rentals, LLC, </em>2007 MT 97, \u00b6 14, 337 Mont. 91, \u00b6 14, 157 P.3d 676, \u00b6 14, <em>overruled on other grounds by Giambra, </em>\u00b6 27. We therefore review a district court\u2019s ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>on the admissibility of evidence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Seeley, </em>\u00b6 14. Likewise, we review a district court\u2019s decision to give or refuse a proposed jury instruction for an abuse of discretion. <em>Giambra, </em>\u00b6 28. We review discovery rulings for abuse of discretion as well. <em>Bugger v. McGough, </em>2006 MT 248, \u00b6 20, 334 Mont. 77, \u00b6 20, 144 P.3d 802, \u00b6 20. We also review a district court\u2019s imposition of sanctions under M. R. Civ. P. 37 for an abuse of discretion. <em>Linn v. Whitaker, </em>2007 MT 46, \u00b6 13, 336 Mont. 131, \u00b6 13, 152 P.3d 1282, \u00b6 13. In reviewing for an abuse of discretion, \u201c[w]e consider whether the trial court in the exercise of its discretion acted arbitrarily without the employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason, in view of all the circumstances, ignoring recognized principles resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Linn, </em>\u00b6 13 (citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\u00b617 1. Did the District Court err by denying Neal\u2019s motion for a new trial after determining that substantial credible evidence supported the jury\u2019s award of $7,358.56 in damages?</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\u00b618 Neal argues that the uncontroverted evidence at trial established that Neal experienced pain and suffering as a result of his injury, and therefore the jury\u2019s damage award is not supported by the evidence. Neal\u2019s claim for past medical expenses amounted to $7,358.56-the same amount awarded by the jury. As such, Neal argues the jury failed to award any damages for his pain and suffering or future medical treatment, and that this is illegal under Montana law. Accordingly, Neal contends that the District Court should have granted his motion for a new trial on damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">\u00b619 \u201c[A]lthough it is within the jury\u2019s province to weigh the evidence and determine credibility, a jury is not free to disregard uncontradicted, credible, nonopinion evidence.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>284 Mont. at 443, 945 P.2d at 50. We have held that \u201cwhere a jury fails to award any damages when the only evidence of record supports an award, that verdict is not supported by substantial evidence and may be set aside.\u201d <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6 24 (quoting <em>Thompson, </em>284 Mont. at 446, 945 P.2d at 52).</p>\n<p id=\"AlT\">\u00b620 In <em>Renville, </em>the plaintiff sought damages after being rear-ended in a collision. <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6 5. The defendant admitted fault, leaving for trial the issue of whether the defendant caused injury to the plaintiff and, if so, the amount of the plaintiffs damages. <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6 12. A jury found that the plaintiff was injured as a result of the accident, but only awarded damages for her past medical expenses. The plaintiff had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>presented evidence of other damages including future medical expenses, lost earnings and earning capacity, pain and suffering, and loss of ability to pursue her occupation and established course of life. We reversed the district court for failing to grant a new trial. <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\u00b621 <em>In Jenks, </em>we reached a different result by distinguishing <em>Renville. Jenks </em>also involved a rear-end collision. <em>Jenks, </em>\u00b6 5. The main issue at trial was the nature and extent of one of the plaintiffs injuries; the parties disagreed about the plaintiff\u2019s damage claims for past medical expenses, future medical expenses, loss of earnings, and general damage claims. <em>Jenks, </em>\u00b6 7. Relying on <em>Renville, </em>the plaintiff argued that the past medical expenses, past and future wage loss, and continuing pain requiring future medical treatment unquestionably amounted to more than the jury\u2019s total award of $9,873.00 and required a new trial. <em>Jenks, </em>\u00b6 31. We noted, however, that <em>Renville </em>required reversal of a jury award which was insufficient to cover <em>uncontested </em>expenses. Unlike <em>inRenville, </em>the damages alleged in <em>Jenks </em>were in dispute. <em>Jenks, </em>\u00b6 36. We noted that the evidence presented at trial \u201crevealed a significant dispute in the nature, cause, and severity of the injury, the need for future treatment, the existence and amount of past and future wage loss, and pain and suffering.\u201d <em>Jenks, </em>\u00b6 36. Therefore, we refused to overturn the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Jenks, </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\u00b622 Similarly, <em>in Magart v. Schank, </em>2000 MT 279, <em>302 </em>Mont. 151, 13 P.3d 390, the plaintiff challenged a jury verdict that did not award damages for lost earning capacity. <em>Magart, </em>\u00b6 7. The case arose out of an auto accident in which the defendant admitted negligence. The plaintiff was awarded damages for past and future medical expenses, past lost earnings, past and future pain and suffering, and loss of established course of life, but not lost earning capacity. The plaintiff argued that his continuing shoulder problems were evidence that he would not be able to continue working as a cement truck driver or garage door installer. <em>Magart, </em>\u00b6 7. However, testimony at trial indicated that the plaintiff had left his truck driving job because he found a different job, not because of difficulties caused by his injury. <em>Magart, </em>\u00b6 14. With respect to the precise issue of plaintiffs employment as a garage door installer, we recognized that even though the defendant did not present direct evidence to contradict the plaintiffs testimony that he experienced pain and difficulty installing garage doors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">[t]his does not mean that where there is direct testimony in the record, uncontradicted by other <em>direct </em>testimony, that the court or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>jury is bound thereby or cannot render a decision contrary to such direct testimony. <em>A jury is entitled to weigh the testimony against adverse circumstantial evidence </em>and other factors which may affect the credibility of the witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><em>Magart, </em>\u00b6 15 (emphasis added) (citation and internal quotations omitted). The jury had been shown a videotape of the plaintiff working without apparent difficulty, and such evidence could have provided a reasonable basis for the jury to conclude that the plaintiffs shoulder injury did not impair his ability to work. <em>Magart, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\u00b623 Both of the medical providers who testified on behalf of Neal, as well as the defendant\u2019s medical expert, acknowledged that Neal suffered from chronic neck pain as a result of the accident. However, there was conflicting evidence as to the nature and extent of Neal\u2019s injuries. For example, while Neal argues that he was \u201cforced to give up well established course of life activities and hobbies\u201d and that \u201cwearing his fire fighter\u2019s helmet at work aggravated his neck,\u201d Neal continued to work for nine months after recovering from his knee injury, and no evidence was presented indicating that he was hindered in the performance of his firefighting duties. For all intents and purposes, Neal was working at \u201c100 percent\u201d pursuant to the Kalispell Fire Department\u2019s health policy. Neal told Nurse Charman at his exit exam that he planned to continue working with the county haz-mat team after retiring, which at times would require wearing a self-contained breathing apparatus and full protective gear. He did not tell her, or his physician at the Veteran\u2019s Administration Clinic, about pain in his neck. Furthermore, neither the defendant\u2019s medical expert nor anyone else offered testimony regarding the cost of future treatment, with the exception of Dr. Martini\u2019s approximation regarding the cost of surgery-the necessity of which was disputed by Dr. Wilson. The jury was thus free to conclude that Neal\u2019s prior work-related knee injury and chronic back pain were just as significant in causing his retirement as his neck injury was.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u00b624  This Court cannot speculate as to what the jury was doing or whether they left pain and suffering damages out of their award. It is quite possible that the jury did not believe Neal\u2019s injury was as severe as he claimed or that all of his medical expenses were necessary. It is conceivable, for example, that the jury considered only those medical expenses incurred before Neal returned to work as being \u201cnecessary,\u201d and thus awarded a smaller amount than Neal requested. Other scenarios are equally as likely. Importantly, however, we are not at liberty to speculate as to the jury\u2019s division of damages. While it seems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>like a close call because the jury awarded damages in the exact amount of Neal\u2019s past medical expenses, the fact that these expenses were contested at trial, and that no special verdict form was used indicating the precise amounts awarded, makes it impossible for this Court to second-guess the jury award. <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 11. Substantial credible evidence supports the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the $7,358.56 awarded to Neal includes some amount for pain and suffering. <em>Giambra, </em>\u00b6 26. Accordingly, the jury\u2019s verdict is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">\u00b625 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by admitting defendant\u2019s expert testimony about Neal\u2019s prior work-related knee and back injuries?</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u00b626 Neal argues that the District Court erred by allowing Nelson\u2019s defense medical expert, Dr. Wilson, to testify with regard to Neal\u2019s other ailments, including a previous knee injury, chronic lower back pain, and some stress and depression issues. During his trial deposition, which was played for the jury, Dr. Wilson occasionally referenced Neal\u2019s knee and back problems in the context of discussing Neal\u2019s medical history, as well as in response to questions regarding whether Neal\u2019s neck injury would have prevented Neal from continuing his employment as a firefighter. Dr. Wilson did not offer an opinion as to whether he believed Neal\u2019s knee and back injuries contributed to Neal\u2019s retirement. Nonetheless, Neal argues these references to \u201cunrelated medical conditions mislead the jury and appeal to speculation without proof of a medical connection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">\u00b627 The District Court determined, and we agree, that Dr. Wilson\u2019s references to Neal\u2019s prior knee injury and back pain were relevant to whether Neal retired from the Kalispell Fire Department because of his neck injury. Dr. Wilson testified that Neal could have continued working as a firefighter in spite of his neck injury. Dr. Wilson noted that NeaL worked as many as sixty hours a week, without any worsening in his neck, after returning from his knee injury. The jury may have inferred from evidence of Neal\u2019s other injuries that those may have caused his retirement. However, Dr. Wilson\u2019s testimony did not require the jury to reach that conclusion, nor did it encourage that result. However, because Neal was claiming that his retirement was caused by Nelson\u2019s negligence, it was relevant for Nelson to point out that Neal had suffered from other ailments prior to retiring.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">\u00b628 Further, Neal himself elicited references to those injuries before Dr. Wilson\u2019s trial deposition was played for the jury. <em>See Hando v. PPG Indus., Inc., </em>272 Mont. 146, 150, 900 P.2d 281, 283 (1995). During his direct examination, Neal testified that after the accident, \u201cI called Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Biggs, who had treated me for lower back strains in the course of my work before ....\u201d Likewise, Neal referred to the fact that he was recovering from knee surgery in 2003-which, as he described it, was \u201ca Work Comp situation\u201d-when he applied for a position as an EMT instructor at Flathead Valley Community College. Dr. Biggs also testified that he had treated Neal \u201cmany times\u201d for \u201cmultiple injuries to his low back and to his knees.\u201d All of this testimony was introduced during Neal\u2019s case-in-chief-well before Dr. Wilson\u2019s discussion of Neal\u2019s prior injuries. The District Corut did not abuse its discretion by allowing Dr. Wilson\u2019s testimony as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">\u00b629 Neal also argues that he was prejudiced by Dr. Wilson\u2019s discussion of how psychological factors can play a role in an individual\u2019s experience with chronic pain. However, Neal only objected to this testimony on the basis of foundation and relevance. Neal did not object to this testimony on the basis of prejudice. \u2018We have previously held that in order to preserve an objection to the admission of evidence for purposes of appeal, the complaining party must make a timely objection or motion to strike and <em>state the specific grounds for its objection.\u201d Schuff v. Jackson, </em>2002 MT 215, \u00b6 30, 311 Mont. 312, \u00b6 30, 55 P.3d 387, \u00b6 30 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). Because Neal failed to object to Dr. Wilson\u2019s \u201cdepression\u201d testimony on the basis of prejudice, he waived the issue for purposes of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\u00b630 3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying Neal\u2019s proposed jury instruction on multiple causation?</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\u00b631 Neal argues that Nelson\u2019s \u201crepeated reference to [Neal\u2019s] unrelated medical conditions and injuries and Defendant\u2019s arguments [that] other causes caused Neal\u2019s damages\u201d warranted a jury instruction on multiple causation. The District Court disagreed, observing that \u201cthis is definitely a single cause accident.\u201d The District Court instructed the jury that \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s conduct is a cause of the injury if it helped produce it and if the injury would not have occurred without it.\u201d The District Court did not give Neal\u2019s proposed multiple cause instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">\u00b632 \u201cIn those cases which do not involve issues of intervening cause, proof of causation is satisfied by proof that a party\u2019s conduct was a cause-in-fact of the damage alleged.\u201d <em>Busta v. Columbus Hosp. Corp., </em>276 Mont. 342, 371, 916 P.2d 122, 139 (1996). We held in <em>Busta </em>that, \u201cwith the exception of those cases involving allegations of independent intervening cause or multiple causes,\u201d it is sufficient to instruct the jury as to single causation only. <em>Busta, </em>276 Mont. at 371, 916 P.2d at 139. In contrast, \u201cwhere there are allegations that <em>the acts of more </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number><em>than one person </em>combined to produce a result (e.g., when the plaintiff alleges negligence and the defendant alleges contributory negligence, or when there are multiple defendants), we acknowledge that the recommended cause-in-fact instruction would be confusing and misleading.\u201d <em>Busta, </em>276 Mont. at 371, 916 P.2d at 139 (emphasis added). In those cases, the multiple cause instruction is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"AzcZ\">\u00b633 The central issue at Neal\u2019s trial was whether the neck injury resulting from Nelson\u2019s negligence caused Neal to retire. Neal correctly points out <em>float Busta </em>did not involve a situation such as his, where the plaintiff is faced with multiple \u201ccauses\u201d of his alleged <em>damages </em>rather than the acts of multiple individuals causing an injury. While Neal contends that the same principle applies to both scenarios, Nelson argues that there was no allegation that Neal\u2019s neck injury was caused by anyone other than Nelson, and as a result, the multiple cause instruction would not be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">\u00b634  We can find no authority for the proposition that the \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test and multiple cause instruction is appropriate where multiple causes are alleged to have brought about certain damages, but not the event or injury itself. It does not appear that the multiple cause instruction would fit into a situation in which only one negligent defendant is involved, and such an instruction may well have been confusing to the jury where, as here, the defendant merely implied that the plaintiffs damages were not caused by the defendant\u2019s acts. Under the case as presented to the jury, we cannot conclude that the District Court abused its discretion by failing to give a multiple causation instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\u00b635 4. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by allowing Dr. Wilson to testify after concluding that the financial information the court had ordered Dr. Wilson to provide was satisfactory?</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">\u00b636 Neal served interrogatories on Nelson seeking, among other things, the amount of income Nelson\u2019s medical expert, Dr. Wilson, derives from conducting IMEs. After various objections, exchanges of information, and the involvement of the District Court, Nelson provided Neal with the number of IMEs Dr. Wilson had performed during the previous three years, the names of the insurance companies that had retained Dr. Wilson to perform those IMEs, and the fees Dr. Wilson charged for the IMEs and related deposition and trial testimony. Nelson objected to providing Dr. Wilson\u2019s personal financial information and the total income he derives from conducting IMEs.</p>\n<p id=\"ACu\">\u00b637 Neal moved to compel Nelson\u2019s response and the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>initially granted Neal\u2019s motion. Nelson then moved the District Court to reconsider, and submitted an affidavit from Dr. Wilson stating that approximately twenty percent of his medical practice involves conducting IMEs, while the other eighty percent is devoted to treating patients suffering from neurological disorders. The affidavit also explained that the fees for IMEs conducted by Dr. Wilson\u2019s were not paid to Dr. Wilson himself, but rather were paid to either Wellcare, a nonprofit corporation at Community Medical Center which paid Dr. Wilson a regular salary, or to Dr. Wilson\u2019s private practice. According to Dr. Wilson\u2019s affidavit, he does not keep records of the separate income derived from IMEs, and it would be extremely burdensome, if not impossible, for him to calculate that amount. Neal moved to exclude Dr. Wilson\u2019s testimony on the basis of his refusal to provide the personal financial information requested. The District Court was satisfied with Dr. Wilson\u2019s explanation, however, and revised its order to allow Dr. Wilson to testify, thus denying Neal\u2019s motion in limine to exclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">\u00b638 The District Court wisely recognized that it needed to \u201cstrike the proper balance between a party\u2019s need for information concerning an expert witness\u2019s potential bias and the doctor\u2019s rights of privacy and the right to be free from burdensome and intrusive discovery requests.\u201d The District Court determined that Dr. Wilson\u2019s disclosure of the number of IMEs he conducted, the fees his employer charged for those IMEs, and the percentage of his practice that involved conducting IMEs, was sufficient under <em>Hegwood v. Montana Fourth Judicial District Court, </em>2003 MT 200, 317 Mont. 30, 75 P.3d 308. This Court\u2019s statement in <em>Hegwood </em>that \u201ca plaintiff ... might well be allowed to discover information such as... the income derived from [IMEs]\u201d is not a mandatory requirement that such information be provided under every circumstance. <em>Hegwood, </em>\u00b6 17. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by allowing Dr. Wilson to testify after he disclosed the available details of his IME practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">\u00b639 5. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by awarding Neal attorney fees pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 37(c) after Nelson failed to admit prior to trial that Neal had been injured in the car accident?</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\u00b640 Nelson argues on cross-appeal that the District Court abused its discretion by awarding Neal $1,275.00 in attorney fees. Neal argued he was entitled to fees because Nelson had denied his second request for admission, which asked Nelson to admit that Neal was injured in the accident. Nelson\u2019s medical expert, Dr. Wilson, concluded that Neal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>sustained a neck injury in the collision after conducting Neal\u2019s IME, but Nelson still did not admit that Neal was injured. The jury subsequently agreed that Neal was injured. The District Court concluded Nelson\u2019s denial required Neal to prove causation at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"A6K\">\u00b641 M. R. Civ. P. 37(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-4\">If a party fails to admit the genuineness of any document or the truth of any matter as requested under Rule 36, and if the party requesting the admissions thereafter proves the genuineness of the document or the truth of the matter, the requesting party may apply to the court for an order requiring the other party, the other party\u2019s attorney or both to pay the reasonable expenses incurred in making that proof, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. The court shall make the order unless it finds that (1) the request was held objectionable pursuant to Rule 36(a), or (2) the admission sought was of no substantial importance, or (3) the party failing to admit had reasonable ground to believe that the party might prevail on the matter, or (4) there was other good reason for the failure to admit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Neal\u2019s counsel provided an affidavit attesting to an additional 8.5 hours of time spent proving Neal was injured at trial. Nelson argues that \u201cneither Neal\u2019s discovery nor his proof at trial would have been different had Nelson\u2019s response been an admission.\u201d However, none of the exceptions within Rule 37(c) precluded the District Court from awarding Neal his reasonable attorney fees. <em>See Springer v. Becker, </em>284 Mont. 267, 280, 949 P.2d 641, 649 (1997). Nelson\u2019s own medical expert concluded that Nelson caused Neal\u2019s neck injury, yet Neal was nonetheless required to prove that issue at trial. Under our applicable standard of review, the District Court did not abuse its discretion by awarding Nelson his reasonable attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\u00b642 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b462-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
