We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the WCC err by refusing to apply judicial decisions retroactively to only claims in \u201cactive\u201d litigation?</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">\u00b64 2. Did the WCC err in its final definition of a \u201csettled\u201d claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">\u00b65 3. Did the WCC err when it concluded that the terms \u201cclosed\u201d and \u201cinactive\u201d were not included in our <em>Schmill II </em>directive?</p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">\u00b66 4. Did the WCC err by refusing to impose a two-year limit on the retroactivity of judicial decisions for workers\u2019 compensation claims?</p>\n<p id=\"b167-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b167-15\">\u00b67 This is the second time this case has been before us. In <em>Flynn v. State Compensation Ins. Fund, </em>2002 MT 279, 312 Mont. 410, 60 P.3d 397 <em>(Flynn I), </em>we held that after a claimant successfully recovers social security disability benefits, thereby allowing the State Fund or other workers\u2019 compensation insurer to offset benefits paid to the claimant, the insurer, pursuant to the common fund doctrine, must bear a proportionate share of the costs and attorney fees incurred by the claimant in pursuing social security benefits. <em>Flynn I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-18. Accordingly, we reversed the WCC\u2019s judgment to the extent it declined to apply the common fund doctrine to Flynn\u2019s request for reasonable apportionment of attorney fees. <em>Flynn 1, </em>\u00b6 18. On remand, the WCC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>determined that the holding in <em>Flynn I </em>applied retroactively and that Flynn\u2019s attorney was \u201centitled to common fund attorney fees from claimants who benefited from the decision.\u201d That decision is not appealed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\u00b68 Thereafter, in <em>Schmill v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp., </em>2005 MT 144, 327 Mont. 293, 114 P.3d 204 <em>(Schmill II), </em>we concluded that our decision in <em>Schmill v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp., </em>2003 MT 80, 315 Mont. 51, 67 P.3d 290 <em>(Schmill I) </em>applied retroactively. However, in reliance on our decision in <em>Dempsey v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>2004 MT 391, 325 Mont. 207, 104 P.3d 483, we recognized that \u201cretroactive application does not mean that prior contrary rulings and settlements are void <em>ab initio.\u201d Schmill II, </em>\u00b6 17. Rather, the policy of finality dictates that \u2018\u201cretroactive effect of a decision... does not apply to cases that became final or were settled prior to a decision\u2019s issuance.\u2019\u201d <em>Schmill II, </em>\u00b6 17 (quoting <em>Dempsey, </em>\u00b6 31) (ellipsis in original). We recognized that many \u201cclaims are settled, closed, or inactive\u201d but indicated that we could not determine from the record which claims in the context of workers\u2019 compensation law should be considered \u201cfinal or settled.\u201d <em>Schmill II, </em>\u00b6 19. Accordingly, we left \u201cthat initial determination to the WCC.\u201d <em>Schmill II, </em>\u00b6 19. The WCC thereafter informed all parties involved in common fund cases via email that it would \u201cuse <em>Flynn </em>as a general model for determining the <em>final, closed, or inactive issue\u201d </em>remanded in <em>Schmill II, </em>and invited their participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\u00b69 On September 29, 2006, the WCC issued its \u201corder determining status of final, settled, closed, and inactive claims\u201d <em>(Flynn </em>Order). The WCC explained that our explicit direction in <em>Schmill II </em>was for it to determine the definition of \u201cfinal\u201d and \u201csettled\u201d claims. The WCC stated that it would not define \u201cclosed\u201d and \u201cinactive\u201d claims because the <em>Schmill II </em>directive did not include those terms. The WCC defined a \u201cfinal\u201d claim as a \u201cclaim in which a final judgment has been entered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court only if the claim is not currently pending on appeal.\u201d This definition of \u201cfinal\u201d is not an issue on appeal. In defining a \u201csettled\u201d claim, the WCC reasoned that \u00a7 39-71-107(7)(a), MCA (2005), provided a \u201cclear definition\u201d of the term. Further reasoning that it was not its function \u201cto rewrite what the legislature has already defined,\u201d the WCC concluded that the statute\u2019s definition defining a settled claim as \u201c\u2018a department-approved or court-ordered compromise of benefits between a claimant and an insurer or a claim that was paid in full\u2019 shall be the definition of a \u2018settled claim.\u2019\u201d However, in a recap of its holding at the end of its order, the WCC stated that \u201cA SETTLED CLAIM is a claim in which a department-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>approved settlement or court-ordered compromise of benefits has been made between the claimant and insurer,\u201d omitting the phrase \u201cor a claim that has been paid in full\u201d which it had previously adopted in its analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">\u00b610 Eight days after the <em>Flynn </em>Order was issued we decided <em>Stavenjord v. Mont. State Fund, </em>2006 MT 257, 334 Mont. 117, 146 P.3d 724 <em>(Stavenjord II). </em>There, we overruled a WCC order establishing \u201cpartial\u201d retroactivity of our decision in <em>Stavenjord v. Mont. State Fund, </em>2003 MT 67, 314 Mont. 466, 67 P.3d 229 <em>(Stavenjord I). Stavenjord II, </em>\u00b6 15. We concluded that there is \u201cno legal authority for \u2018partial\u2019 retroactive application\u201d of judicial decisions and stated that judicial decisions apply retroactively to \u201cany and all <em>open </em>claims <em>...\u201d Stavenjord II, </em>\u00b6 15 (emphasis in original). We stated that \u201copen claims\u201d are those which are \u201cstill actionable, in negotiation but not yet settled, now in litigation, or pending on direct appeal.\u201d <em>Stavenjord II, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"APT\">\u00b611 The State Fund appeals from the <em>Flynn </em>Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">\u00b612 We review the WCC\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness. <em>Schmill II, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">\u00b613 1. Did the WCC err by refusing to apply judicial decisions retroactively to only claims in \u201cactive\u201d litigation?</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">\u00b614 State Fund argues that the WCC erred by rejecting its argument that \u201cjudicial decisions can only apply retroactively to those claims that are currently in active litigation.\u201d State Fund contends the WCC incorrectly interpreted our decision in <em>Dempsey, </em>and posits that an inconsistency in language it detects between our opinion in <em>Dempsey </em>and the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Harper v. Va. Dept. of Taxation, </em>509 U.S. 86, 113 S. Ct. 2510 (1993), explained below, was unintended. Accordingly, State Fund urges us to \u201cformally adopt the exact <em>Harper </em>\u2018on direct review\u2019 language\u201d as the boundary of retroactivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">\u00b615 In <em>Dempsey, </em>we established our current rule for the retroactivity of judicial decisions and discussed the history of the issue, focusing on two United States Supreme Court decisions: <em>Harper </em>and <em>Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, </em>404 U.S. 97, 92 S. Ct. 349 (1971). <em>Dempsey, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-23. We explained that the <em>Harper </em>decision effectively replaced <em>Chevron Oil </em>in federal courts, holding that federal law \u201cmust be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review....\u201d <em>Dempsey, </em>\u00b6 23 (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number><em>Harper, </em>590 U.S. at 97, 113 S. Ct. at 2517). However, because each state is permitted to establish its own rules for retroactivity, <em>see Great N. Ry. Co. v. Sunburst Oil &amp; Refining Co., </em>287 U.S. 358, 364-66 (1932), state courts had continued to follow the flexible <em>Chevron Oil </em>approach that required retroactivity unless one of three exceptions was met.</p>\n<p id=\"A0J\">\u00b616 We reached a compromise in <em>Dempsey </em>between the strict <em>Harper </em>rule and the flexible <em>Chevron Oil </em>rule, holding that \u201call civil decisions of this Court apply retroactively to cases pending on direct review or not yet final, unless all three of the <em>Chevron </em>factors are satisfied.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Dempsey, </em>\u00b6 31. We also concluded that, for reasons of finality, the \u201cretroactive effect of a decision does not apply ... to cases that became final or were settled prior to a decision\u2019s issuance.\u201d <em>Dempsey, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"A-G\">\u00b617 State Fund asserts that the difference between <em>Harper\u2019s </em>\u201copen on direct review\u201d and <em>Dempsey\u2019s </em>\u201cpending on direct review or not yet final\u201d was an unintended change for which \u201cthis Court did not provide any reasoning ....\u201d State Fund offers that this Court \u201ccould not have predicted how its minor rephrasing of <em>Harper </em>could take on the significance the WCC gave it in its <em>Flynn </em>Order\u201d and therefore asks us to clarify our <em>Dempsey </em>decision by adopting the exact language employed by the U.S. Supreme Court in <em>Harper.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">\u00b618 However, contrary to State Fund\u2019s perception that we did not consider the impact of \u201crephrasing\u201d the <em>Harper </em>rule, the language we used in <em>Dempsey </em>was not an accident. We explained in <em>Dempsey </em>that the new rule on retroactivity was intended to be a compromise between <em>Harper </em>and <em>Chevron Oil </em>and that, while we agreed with <em>Harper\u2019s </em>balancing of finality and fairness interests, we opted to not follow the exact <em>Harper </em>rule because of \u201cthe compelling need for prospective application in limited circumstances.\u201d <em>Dempsey, </em>\u00b6 27. Accordingly, we decline State Fund\u2019s invitation to revise the statement of retroactivity set forth in <em>Dempsey </em>and to adopt the exact <em>Harper </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>\u00b619 Alternatively, State Fund argues that our decision in <em>Stavenjord II </em>requires modification of the <em>Flynn </em>Order. State Fund contends that \u25a0under <em>Stavenjord II </em>the WCC incorrectly rejected the argument made by State Fund in this case that \u201cjudicial decisions can only apply retroactively to those claims that are currently in active litigation.\u201d State Fund invites us to make \u201cjudicial decisions retroactively applicable only to \u2018open\u2019 workers\u2019 compensation claims\u201d and to define \u201copen\u201d as \u201cin negotiation but not yet settled, now in litigation or pending on direct appeal\u201d-the same language used in <em>Stavenjord II, </em>\u00b6 15. State Fund thus reasons that use of the language in <em>Stavenjord II </em>would render the <em>Flynn </em>Order unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">\u00b620 State Fund\u2019s argument illustrates that there is an apparent conflict between our decisions in <em>Stavenjord II </em>and <em>Schmill II. Schmill II </em>applied <em>Schmill I </em>retroactively to all claims except those that are \u201cfinal\u201d or \u201csettled,\u201d <em>Schmill II, </em>\u00b6 19, whereas <em>Stavenjord II </em>retroactively applied <em>Stavenjord I </em>to all \u201copen\u201d claims. <em>Stavenjord II, </em>\u00b6 15. While these definitions are presumably different sides of the same coin, we can see the need for clarity and consistency in the statement of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\"><em>\u00b621 Schmill II </em>was the first case which addressed the question of retroactivity for purposes of workers\u2019 compensation law and our intention there was to clarify the application of the <em>Dempsey </em>rule in that context. <em>Schmill II, </em>\u00b6 9. <em>Stavenjord II </em>did not purport to expand upon or clarify the law with regard to retroactivity and no authority was cited for its statement that <em>Stavenjord I </em>would apply to \u201copen\u201d claims. <em>Stavenjord II, </em>\u00b6 15. Therefore, it was not our intention in <em>Stavenjord II </em>to alter our retroactivity analysis as previously set forth by <em>Dempsey </em>and <em>Schmill II </em>and, in reality, <em>Stavenjord </em>created no new law, but merely stated our retroactivity rule in an inverse fashion: \u201copen\u201d simply meant \u201cnot final.\u201d We therefore conclude that application of the retroactivity rule as stated in <em>Stavenjord II </em>though stated inversely, conveyed the same meaning, and that the <em>Flynn </em>Order is unaffected by our decision therein. We reaffirm the retroactivity principles set forth in <em>Dempsey </em>and <em>Schmill </em>IZ-applicable to cases not \u201cfinal\u201d or \u201csettled\u201d-for purposes of this and future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj5\">\u00b622 2. Did the WCC err in its final definition of a \u201csettled\u201d claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">\u00b623 State Fund next argues that if we maintain the <em>Dempsey </em>or <em>Schmill</em>//language excluding \u201cfinal\u201d and \u201csettled\u201d claims from judicial retroactivity, then we should also use the statutory definition of \u201csettled\u201d set forth in the analysis section of <em>Flynn </em>Order, rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>as re-stated at the end of the <em>Flynn </em>Order. This would include the statutory language defining settled claims as \u201cpaid in full.\u201d Appellees Robert Flynn and Carl Miller (Flynn/Miller) argue that including \u201cpaid in full\u201d claims as settled is \u201cillogical\u201d because \u00a7 39-71-107(7), MCA, is limited to the \u201cpurposes of [that] section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\u00b624 As previously noted, the <em>Flynn </em>Order set forth inconsistent definitions. The WCC reasoned that \u201c\u00a7 39-71-107(7)(a), MCA, sets forth a clear definition of what constitutes a \u2018settled claim.\u2019\u201d Reasoning that its function was not \u201cto rewrite what the legislature has already defined\u201d, it concluded that \u201cthe language of \u00a7 39-71-107(7)(a), MCA (2005), defining a \u2018settled claim,\u2019 as \u2018a department-approved or court-ordered compromise of benefits between a claimant and an insurer or a claim that was paid in full,\u2019 shall be the definition of \u2018settled claim\u2019 for purposes of this case.\u201d However, in contrast, after discussing other issues, the WCC concluded its order by re-stating all of its holdings, including on this issue: \u201c[T]herefore, this Court orders: A SETTLED CLAIM is a claim in which a department-approved settlement or court-ordered compromise of benefits has been made between the claimant and insurer.\u201d Notably, this statement omits the previously adopted statutory language which stated that \u201ca claim paid in full\u201d is a \u201csettled claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\u00b625 The WCC reasonably relied upon the definition of \u201csettled claim\u201d as provided by the legislature in \u00a7 39-71-107(7)(a), MCA (2005). Flynn/Miller\u2019s argument against the WCC\u2019s adoption of this statutory definition of \u201csettled claim\u201d is unpersuasive. Although the definition includes the phrase \u201cfor purposes of this section,\u201d it is found within the part containing the generally applicable provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the Act), including the list of many definitions applied in the Act. <em>See </em>\u00a7 39-71-116, MCA (2005). Further, \u00a7 39-71-107, MCA, in which the definition of \u201csettled claim\u201d is located, includes provisions which are necessarily applicable to all settled claims. Considering this statutory structure, including the absence of any other statutory definition of the term, we cannot conclude that an \u201cintention plainly appears\u201d to prohibit other uses of this definition within the Act. Section 1-2-107, MCA. Rather, using the definition provided by the legislature furthers the expression of legislative will absent a contrary indication and further provides consistency between the retroactivity of judicial decisions established by our cases and the application of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\u00b626  <em>The Flynn </em>Order offers no rationale for the distinction between the definition adopted in its rationale and the one stated at the end of its order. Given the WCC\u2019s thorough analysis and expressly stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>intent to adopt the legislature\u2019s definition of \u201csettled claim,\u201d we can imagine no reason other than scrivener\u2019s error for the inconsistency. Accordingly, we reverse the <em>Flynn </em>Order to the extent that the definition of \u201csettled claim\u201d at the end of its order holding varies from the statutory definition as stated and adopted by the WCC in its analysis of that issue. To clarify, a \u201csettled\u201d claim is \u201ca department-approved or court-ordered compromise of benefits between a claimant and an insurer or a claim that was paid in full.\u201d Section 39-71-107(7)(a), MCA (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">\u00b627 3. Did the WCC err when it concluded that the terms \u201cclosed\u201d and \u201cinactive\u201d were not included in our <em>Schmill II </em>directive?</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">\u00b628 State Fund next asserts that the WCC erred by not excluding \u201cclosed\u201d and \u201cinactive\u201d claims from the retroactivity of <em>Flynn. </em>State Fund contends that in <em>Schmill II </em>this Court \u201cminimized the potential effect of retroactivity based on [the] understanding that many claims would be \u2018settled, closed or inactive[.]\u2019\u201d Therefore, based on <em>Schmill II, </em>State Fund argues that the WCC should have defined \u201cclosed\u201d and \u201cinactive\u201d claims and held that they are also exempt from the retroactivity of judicial decisions. State Fund asks us to \u201ceither give effect to the terms \u2018closed\u2019 and \u2018inactive,\u2019 create definitions of\u2018settled\u2019 and \u2018final\u2019 that encompass such claims, or revisit the substantial inequity concerns ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\u00b629 Flynn/Miller argues that the WCC appropriately refused to define the terms \u201cclosed\u201d and \u201cinactive.\u201d They assert that the WCC correctly decided that these terms are often defined by insurers and that \u201c[g]iving force to an insurer\u2019s internal policies or unilateral decision that a claim is \u2018inactive\u2019 and should be \u2018closed\u2019 invites untold mischief.\u201d Ultimately, Flynn/Miller contends that the insurers are \u201cdissatisfied\u201d and that \u201cno \u2018fine tuning\u2019 will satisfy\u201d them.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">\u00b630  In its <em>Flynn </em>Order, the WCC considered whether to define the terms \u201cclosed\u201d and \u201cinactive.\u201d The WCC concluded that the mandate from <em>Schmill II </em>was for it to \u201cdetermine which claims, in the context of workers\u2019 compensation law, would be considered \u2018final\u2019 or \u2018settled.\u2019 \u201d This conclusion by the WCC was correct. In <em>Schmill II, </em>we specifically directed the WCC to define the terms \u201cfinal\u201d and \u201csettled.\u201d <em>Schmill II, </em>\u00b6 19. While we referenced \u201cclosed\u201d and \u201cinactive\u201d claims, our directive did not include those terms. <em>Schmill II, </em>\u00b6 19. Accordingly, we affirm the WCC\u2019s decision. Retroactivity for workers\u2019 compensation claims is dependent upon whether a claim is \u201cfinal\u201d or \u201csettled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">\u00b631 4. Did the WCC err by refusing to impose a two-year limit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>on the retroactivity of judicial decisions for workers\u2019 compensation claims?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">\u00b632 State Fund\u2019s final argument is that the WCC erred by refusing to adopt the two-year statute of limitations from \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA (2005), as a limit on the retroactive effect of judicial decisions in workers\u2019 compensation claims. That statute provides that \u201c[a] petition for hearing before the workers\u2019 compensation judge must be filed within 2 years after benefits are denied.\u201d Section 39-71-2905(2), MCA. State Fund contends that there is a \u201cstrong public policy ... against applying judicial decisions retroactively to all workers\u2019 compensation claims.\u201d State Fund reasons that while \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA (2005), \u201cexplicitly applies only to claims where benefits have been denied, ... the existence of this statute indicates the legislature viewed two years as the maximum reasonable period for a workers\u2019 compensation claimant to sit on his or her rights without attempting to vindicate them.\u201d Accordingly, State Fund argues by analogy that a claimant who has accepted a benefit determination should not \u201cenjoy the full retroactive effect of a newly-issued judicial decision\u201d if that decision occurs two years after the benefit was determined. Flynn/Miller responds that a \u201ccreation of statutes of limitation is exclusively within the province of the legislature, as constrained by the constitution\u201d and is therefore not \u201cthe Court\u2019s job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">\u00b633  While we recognize the advantage of finality and the ease of administration that an adoption of a two-year limitation on retroactivity would serve, we refuse to adopt such a limit by analogizing to a statute which the legislature has made applicable only to particular cases. As State Fund concedes, \u201cthere is no specific statutory cutoff point for most workers\u2019 compensation claims.\u201d Accordingly, application of the two year statute of limitation here would require this Court to take liberty with \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA (2005), by extending it beyond the legislature\u2019s clearly intended purpose, as evident by its plain language. As we stated in <em>Dempsey, </em>the interests of fairness and finality are not generally served by drawing \u201can arbitrary distinction between litigants based merely on the timing of their claims.\u201d <em>Dempsey, </em>\u00b6 28. Therefore, we conclude that the WCC correctly refused to impose the two-year statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 39-71-2905, MCA (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">\u00b634 Affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b174-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART, MORRIS, DISTRICT JUDGE MACEK, sitting for JUSTICE COTTER and DISTRICT JUDGE TODD sitting for JUSTICE NELSON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-5\"> The three Chevron factors are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">First, the decision to be applied nonretroactively must establish a new principle of law, either by overruling clear past precedent on which litigant may have relied or by deciding an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed.
