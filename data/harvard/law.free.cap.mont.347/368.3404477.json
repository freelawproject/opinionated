It also declared him a delinquent youth, placed him on juvenile probation with conditions, and entered judgment. J.D.N. now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>appeals the Youth Court\u2019s determination that the offense was a felony. We reverse and remand for a new disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">\u00b62 We restate the issue as whether the Youth Court erred in determining J.D.N. committed the offense of felony criminal mischief as set forth in \u00a7 45-6-101(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">\u00b63 Shortly after midnight on February 7, 2006, Alfred Anderson was driving home from work when he saw what he believed to be three young men trying to break into a vehicle belonging to Matthew Loomer. The young men retreated to another vehicle when they saw Anderson\u2019s car and immediately left the scene. Judging by the short time it took for them to flee, Anderson assumed a driver must have been waiting in the car. Anderson called 911 shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">\u00b64 Sidney Police Officer Steven Reidel was dispatched. During a brief investigation, Reidel determined the vehicle belonged to Matthew Loomer and notified the Loomer family of the damage. Based on conversation with the Loomers, Reidel\u2019s ongoing investigation focused on J.D.N. and three other young men.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">\u00b65 One of the other young men implicated himself, J.D.N., and the others during questioning by the police. He testified at the adjudicatory hearing that the group damaged Loomer\u2019s vehicle because of an ongoing dispute with Matthew\u2019s brother, who was using the car in Matthew\u2019s absence. They noticed the Loomer vehicle parked on the street while driving around town and stopped to damage it.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">\u00b66 Dave Loomer, Matthew\u2019s father, testified he bought the 1988 Ford Thunderbird for his son a number of years earlier for $2,000. He had no estimate of its worth when it was damaged. Matthew Loomer testified the car became his when he paid off the loan, and later sold the car after it was damaged for $500. Jackie Washechek of 1st Choice Collision Center testified that repairing the vehicle would cost over $8,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">\u00b67 At the conclusion of the adjudicatory hearing, the Youth Court found J.D.N. guilty of felony criminal mischief based, in part, on its determination that \u201cthe value of the car at the time it was damaged was at least $1,000.\u201d The court subsequently declared J.D.N. a delinquent youth and placed him on probation, with conditions, until his twenty-first birthday. J.D.N. appeals only from the felony designation made by the Youth Court pursuant to \u00a7 45-6-101(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">\u00b68 As discussed further below, the issue in this case boils down to whether the Youth Court properly interpreted and applied \u00a7 45-6-101(3), MCA. The interpretation and construction of a statute is a matter of law, and we review de novo whether the trial court interpreted and applied a statute correctly. <em>See State v. Triplett, </em>2008 MT 360, \u00b6 13, 346 Mont. 383, \u00b6 13, 195 P.3d 819, \u00b6 13 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\u00b69 <em>Did the Youth Court err in determining that J.D.N. committed the offense of felony criminal mischief pursuant to \u00a7 45-6-101(3), MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AbM\">\u00b610 Before addressing the issue presented on appeal, we clarify certain matters. As indicated above, the present case is a Montana Youth Court Act case as provided in Title 41, Chapter 5, of the Montana Code Annotated. No adjudication by a youth court regarding the status of any youth may be deemed a criminal conviction. <em>See </em>\u00a7 41-5-106, MCA. Rather, if the evidence supports the commission of the offense contained in the petition alleging the youth to be a delinquent youth, a youth court may adjudicate a youth as a delinquent youth. <em>See </em>\u00a7 41-5-1502, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">\u00b611 Here, the Youth Court purportedly \u201cconvicted\u201d J.D.N. of felony criminal mischief. It then declared J.D.N. a delinquent youth, meaning in this case that he was a youth \u201cwho has committed an offense that, if committed by an adult, would constitute a criminal offense.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 41-5-103(11)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">\u00b612 A person commits the offense of criminal mischief if the person knowingly or purposely injures, damages or destroys any property of another without consent. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-6-101(1)(a), MCA. If the person commits the offense of criminal mischief and causes pecuniary loss in excess of $1,000, the offender shall be fined an amount not to exceed $50,000 or be imprisoned in the state prison for a term not to exceed 10 years, or both. Section 45-6-101(3), MCA. In other words, the offense of criminal mischief is a felony if it results in a \u201cpecuniary loss in excess of $1,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">\u00b613 As noted above, the Youth Court found at the close of the adjudicatory hearing that the vehicle\u2019s value was \u201cat least $1,000.\u201d J.D.N. does not contest that finding. His argument is that \u00a7 45-6-101(3), MCA, requires a finding of a loss \u201cin excess of $1,000\u201d to establish a felony criminal mischief offense, and the Youth Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>finding of a loss of \u201cat least $1,000\u201d is insufficient as a matter of law to meet that statutory requirement. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">\u00b614  In construing a statute, our function is \u201csimply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>State v. Farmer, </em>2008 MT 354, \u00b6 13, 346 Mont. 335, \u00b6 13, 195 P.3d 800, \u00b6 13. A criminal mischief offense must cause pecuniary loss \u201cin excess of $1,000\u201d to constitute a felony. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-6-101(3), MCA. The statute does not state the loss must be \u201cequal to or in excess of $1,000.\u201d The Youth Court found that the car\u2019s value immediately before the offense was \u201cat least $1,000.\u201d We conclude this finding is insufficient, as a matter of law, to support the Youth Court\u2019s legal conclusion that J.D.N. committed felony criminal mischief as defined in \u00a7 45-6-101(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">\u00b615 The parties present arguments regarding the restitution awarded during the dispositional hearing. As contemplated in \u00a7 41-5-1511, MCA, the dispositional hearing is separate from, but held as soon as practicable after, the adjudicatory hearing. J.D.N. does not challenge the $1,000 restitution awarded in this case. Nor has either party established that the restitution has any bearing on whether J.D.N. committed a felony or misdemeanor offense. Thus, we decline to address these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">\u00b616 Finally, J.D.N. asserts that, if we conclude-as we have-that the Youth Court erred in determining the offense was a felony rather than a misdemeanor, the appropriate disposition is to remand with instructions to dismiss the petition charging him as a delinquent youth. He does not support his request for dismissal with any developed argument or authority, however, as required by M. R. App. P. 12(1)(f). We are not obligated to conduct legal research or develop legal analysis that might support an appellant\u2019s position. <em>State v. Torgerson, </em>2008 MT 303, \u00b6 36, 345 Mont. 532, \u00b6 36, 192 P.3d 695, \u00b6 36 (citations omitted). Therefore, we decline to address J.D.N.\u2019s unsupported assertion regarding the appropriate disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">\u00b617 Having concluded the Youth Court erred in determining J.D.N. committed the offense of felony criminal mischief, we reverse the Youth Court\u2019s disposition of March 2, 2007, and remand for entry of a disposition upon a finding that J.D.N. committed an act that would be a misdemeanor if he were an adult.</p>\n<judges id=\"b391-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, MORRIS and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
