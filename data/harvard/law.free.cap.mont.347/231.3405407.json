He now appeals the Judgment and Sentence entered against him in the District Court for the First Judicial District, Broadwater County. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\u00b62 Cotterell raised seven issues on appeal which we have consolidated and rephrased as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court erred in denying Cottrell\u2019s Motion to Suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred in denying Cottrell\u2019s Motion to Dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">\u00b65 3. Whether the District Court erred in its interpretation of the provisions of \u00a7 87-1-102(2)(b), MCA (2003), at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">\u00b66 On October 1, 2004, Doug Monger, the State Parks Division Administrator for the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks (DFWP), and Tom Reilly, the assistant administrator, were returning to Helena from a DFWP meeting in Bozeman in Monger\u2019s airplane. They were flying between 200 and 2,500 feet, at a speed of approximately 80 to 100 miles an hour, which was Monger\u2019s typical flight practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">\u00b67 During their flight, Monger and Reilly observed a game feeder and salt-block container in the vicinity of a hunting stand on property adjacent to the Missouri River near Townsend, Montana. Monger circled the area once or twice to take another look at the hunting stand. Upon their return to their office in Helena, Monger and Reilly each independently reported what they had seen to the enforcement division of DFWP.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">\u00b68 On October 7, 2004, DFWP Game Warden Chris Anderson received the report and began an investigation of the property in question. He went to the area described by Monger and Reilly to corroborate the information. Once there, he discovered that the property lies in bottom lands adjacent to the Missouri River. It is situated at the end of a dead-end road, is surrounded by thick brush, and is fenced around its entire perimeter. The property has a gate at the entrance and is posted with no trespassing signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-14\">\u00b69 Anderson observed the area from an adjoining property, from the Missouri River, and from a county road. The adjoining property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>belonged to Ward Scoffield. Although Scoffield had not granted Anderson explicit authority to enter his property on this occasion to surveil the neighboring property, Scoffield had granted Anderson permission to enter his property in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">\u00b610 Anderson\u2019s investigation of the property revealed an elevated hunting stand within 100 yards of a salt tray. Although Anderson was unable to see inside the tray, he speculated that it was placed for baiting of game animals. Anderson subsequently discovered that Cotterell owned the property in question and that he leases a portion of his property to the Hahn Ranch for cattle grazing.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">\u00b611 Anderson returned to surveil Cotterell\u2019s property on October 24, 2004, the opening day of the general hunting season. Because it is a violation of state law to use two-way communication devices to hunt big game animals, Anderson monitored the traffic on a public, family-service radio channel. When Anderson overheard conversations that related to the property he was investigating, he recorded them. Anderson noted that the actions of the people he was watching matched the conversations of the people to whom he was listening. These conversations included discussions of the location of deer as well as hunting plans, strategies and actions. Two hand-held radios later seized during the search of Cotterell\u2019s property were set to this same frequency.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">\u00b612 The following day, Anderson returned to a location near Cotterell\u2019s property. At one point during the day, he watched as Cotterell walked across the river to a dead whitetail buck lying in the water near the far shoreline. This property is owned by Scoffield, not Cotterell. Cotterell then left the deer, returned to his property and came back on an eight-wheeled off-highway vehicle. Anderson photographed Cotterell as Cotterell drove the vehicle through the river and onto Scoffield\u2019s property where Cotterell retrieved the deer and returned to his own property without tagging the deer.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">\u00b613 On October 27, 2004, Anderson applied to the Broadwater County Justice of the Peace for a warrant to search Cotterell\u2019s property. Anderson, along with two other DFWP officers, executed the search warrant on November 6, 2004. Cotterell was not home when the officers arrived, but John Gray, a friend of Cotterell\u2019s who was living there at the time, admitted them. In their search, the officers found deer parts (including parts of two mule deer), photographs, and documents relating to the hunting of game animals.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">\u00b614 Before the wardens left the property, Cotterell arrived and was interviewed by Anderson. During that interview, Cotterell told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Anderson that he had shot a whitetail doe and a whitetail buck that year. He described taking a doe under the circumstances that Anderson had seen him retrieve the buck two weeks before. After Anderson informed Cotterell that he had watched that incident, Cotterell admitted that he shot the buck and later tagged it with a doe tag. Cotterell also admitted that, rather than shooting a doe and a buck, he shot two whitetail bucks and that the buck currently hanging in his garage was killed in violation of the overlimit law. He also said that the remaining parts of the buck he shot while Anderson was watching were at his residence in Bozeman.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">\u00b615 Anderson asked Cotterell about the parts of the two mule deer the officers found during their search. Cotterell stated that they had been shot by his son and grandson on Cotterell\u2019s property. However, Cotterell\u2019s property is entirely within hunting district 391, and the hunting permits held by Cotterell\u2019s son and grandson were for hunting district 380 which is across the Missouri River from Cotterell\u2019s property. Thus, the permits were not valid for hunting mule deer on Cotterell\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\u00b616 Anderson also applied for and executed a search warrant on Cotterell\u2019s residence in Bozeman on November 9, 2004. There Anderson found the head of the whitetail buck that he watched Cotterell retrieve with the off-highway vehicle from Scoffield\u2019s property. The buck was tagged with a doe tag.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">\u00b617 After reviewing all of the evidence (including calendars, journals, statements of witnesses, photographs, marked frozen meat and license information), Anderson learned that in 2003, Cotterell shot three bucks and a doe on his property without the proper licenses or permits and in violation of the law regarding taking an overlimit of animals. And, in 2002, Cotterell shot a mule buck, a whitetail doe and a whitetail buck in violation of the overlimit law. In addition, the mule buck was shot without a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">\u00b618 As a result of Anderson\u2019s investigation, Cotterell was charged by Information with eight counts of hunting violations, including three misdemeanor counts of killing more than the legal limit of game animals in violation of \u00a7 87-3-103, MCA (2003); one misdemeanor count of hunting without a license in violation of \u00a7 87-2-103, MCA (2003); one misdemeanor count of possession of an unlawfully killed game animal in violation of \u00a7 87-3-112, MCA (2003); one misdemeanor count of using two-way communication devices while hunting in violation of \u00a7 87-1-125, MCA (2003); one misdemeanor count ofhunting without landowner permission in violation of \u00a7 87-3-304, MCA (2003); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>and one felony count of possessing unlawfully taken wildlife in violation of \u00a7 87-3-118, MCA (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">\u00b619 Cotterell raised a variety of issues related to the suppression of evidence in three briefs filed October 11, 2005, March 15, 2006, and May 2, 2006. These issues were addressed and denied by the District Court in an order dated June 28, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\u00b620 Cotterell was tried before a jury on the above charges on January 29 and 30, 2007. He was acquitted on the charge of hunting without landowner permission and convicted of the remaining seven charges with the felony count reduced to a misdemeanor based on the value of the animals unlawfully taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\u00b621 The District Court sentenced Cotterell to serve six months in the county jail on each count, with all time suspended. The sentences were to run concurrently. The District Court also imposed various fines and ordered Cotterell to pay restitution for the value of the animals unlawfully killed or taken. In addition, the court suspended Cotterell\u2019s hunting, fishing and trapping privileges for a period of two years from the date of conviction. The court stayed the execution of its judgment pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">\u00b622 <em>Whether the District Court erred in denying Cottrell\u2019s Motion to Suppress.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">\u00b623 We review the denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether the findings of fact supporting a district court\u2019s decision are clearly erroneous, and whether the court\u2019s interpretation and application of the law are correct. <em>State v. Munson, </em>2007 MT 222, \u00b6 18, 339 Mont. 68, \u00b6 18, 169 P.3d 364, \u00b6 18 (citing <em>State v. Copelton, </em>2006 MT 182, \u00b6 8, 333 Mont. 91, \u00b6 8, 140 P.3d 1074, \u00b6 8; <em>State v. Bassett, </em>1999 MT 109, \u00b6 17, 294 Mont. 327, \u00b6 17, 982 P.2d 410, \u00b6 17; <em>State v. Loh, </em>275 Mont. 460, 475, 914 P.2d 592, 601 (1996)). A court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial credible evidence, if that court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record leaves this Court with a definite or firm conviction that the district court has made a mistake. <em>Munson, </em>\u00b6 18 (citing <em>State v. DeWitt, </em>2004 MT 317, \u00b6 21, 324 Mont. 39, \u00b6 21, 101 P.3d 277, \u00b6 21; <em>Loh, </em>275 Mont. at 475, 914 P.2d at 601).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">\u00b624 In this case, Cotterell argued in the trial court that the State\u2019s investigation was fatally flawed from its inception due to the warrantless aerial \u201csearch\u201d of Cotterell\u2019s property. Cotterell also argued that this initial error was compounded by numerous other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>errors by the investigating game warden including monitoring the private conversations Cotterell had with his son over their hand-held radios and executing an overly-broad search warrant without sufficient probable cause to justify the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">\u00b625 The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution safeguards the right of the people to be secure \u201cin their persons, houses, papers, and effects\u201d from unreasonable searches and seizures. Montana\u2019s constitutional provision regarding searches and seizures mirrors the Fourth Amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-5\">Searches and seizures. The people shall be secure in their persons, papers, homes and effects from unreasonable searches and seizures. No warrant to search any place, or seize any person or thing shall issue without describing the place to be searched or the person or thing to be seized, or without probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation reduced to writing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 11. Unlike its federal counterpart, however, the Montana Constitution explicitly guarantees to its citizens the right of individual privacy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">Right of privacy. The right of individual privacy is essential to the well-being of a free society and shall not be infringed without the showing of a compelling state interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 10. Thus, Montana\u2019s Constitution affords citizens broader protection at the hands of the government in search and seizure cases than does the Federal Constitution. <em>State v. Siegal, </em>281 Mont. 250, 263, 934 P.2d 176, 183 (1997), <em>overruled in part and on other grounds by State v. Kuneff, </em>1998 MT 287, \u00b6 19, 291 Mont. 474, \u00b6 19, 970 P.2d 556, \u00b6 19. Consequently, search analysis in Montana is typically conducted under both Article II, Section 10, and Article II, Section 11. <em>Munson, </em>\u00b6 49 (citing <em>Siegal, </em>281 Mont. at 264-65, 934 P.2d at 184; <em>State v. Scheetz, </em>286 Mont. 41, 45, 950 P.2d 722, 724 (1997); <em>State v. Tackitt, </em>2003 MT 81, \u00b6 17, 315 Mont. 59, \u00b6 17, 67 P.3d 295, \u00b6 17).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">\u00b626 This Court has applied the two-prong test from <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 88 S. Ct. 507 (1967), in determining whether a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment was actually conducted and, if so, whether the search was reasonable. <em>Siegal, </em>281 Mont. at 262, 934 P.2d at 183. In <em>Katz, </em>the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-10\">What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection. But what he seeks to preserve as private, even in an area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><em>Katz, </em>389 U.S. at 351, 88 S. Ct. at 511 (internal citations omitted). In concurring with the majority opinion, Justice Harlan summarized the rule that has emerged from <em>Katz </em>and from prior decisions as requiring, \u201cfirst that a person have exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy and, second, that the expectation be one that society is prepared to recognize as \u2018reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Katz, </em>389 U.S. at 361, 88 S. Ct. at 516 (Harlan, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u00b627 Along those same lines, we have determined that, in Montana, a search occurs</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">\u201cwhen the government infringes upon an individual\u2019s expectation of privacy that society considers objectively reasonable.\u201d Where no objectively reasonable expectation of privacy exists, a \u201csearch\u201d does not occur within the contemplation of Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-7\"><em>State v. Goetz, </em>2008 MT 296, \u00b6 25, 345 Mont. 421, \u00b6 25, 191 P.3d 489, \u00b6 25 (citing <em>State v. Hamilton, </em>2003 MT 71, \u00b6 17, 314 Mont. 507, \u00b6 17, 67 P.3d 871, \u00b6 17; <em>Scheetz, </em>286 Mont. at 46, 950 P.2d at 725).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">\u00b628 We apply the foregoing analysis to each of Cotterell\u2019s specifications of error set forth in his Motion to Suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">A. <em>Warrantless aerial \u201csearch\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">\u00b629 Cotterell contends on appeal that all of the State\u2019s evidence should have been suppressed \u201cbecause of the warrantless aerial surveillance conducted by State agents.\u201d Cotterell relies on our decision in <em>Siegal, </em>281 Mont. at 274, 934 P.2d at 190, for the proposition that agents of the State may not search or seize the private effects of Montana\u2019s citizens absent authority to do so by virtue of a search warrant issued by a neutral and detached magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">\u00b630 In <em>Siegal, </em>law enforcement officers used a thermal imaging device to measure heat emissions from the buildings on the defendant\u2019s property to determine whether the distribution of heat energy was consistent with the presence of grow lamps used to cultivate marijuana. Based in part on the results of the thermal imaging scan, the officers obtained a warrant to search the defendant\u2019s property where the officers found a large marijuana growing operation. <em>Siegal, </em>281 Mont. at 254-55, 934 P.2d at 178-79. We held in <em>Siegal </em>that the use of thermal imaging to obtain evidence of criminal activity is a search subject to the warrant requirement of Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution because people have \u201can actual (subjective) expectation of privacy in the heat signatures of activities, intimate or otherwise, which they pursue within the confines of their private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>homes and enclosed structures and which they do not knowingly expose to the public.\u201d <em>Siegal, </em>281 Mont. at 275, 934 P.2d at 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\u00b631 In the case <em>sub judice, </em>unlike the facts in <em>Siegal, </em>Monger and Reilly were not using a thermal imaging device or any other type of equipment to either see inside the buildings on Cotterell\u2019s property or even to observe what was in plain view on Cotterell\u2019s property. Their observations of Cotterell\u2019s property were done simply with the naked eye. In fact, they did not take any photos of what they had seen even though they had a camera with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\u00b632 Cotterell points out that his property is fenced and posted with \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs, the entrance is gated, and the buildings cannot be seen from the road. Thus, he maintains that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his property, home, and buildings, and that this expectation of privacy would be recognized by society as reasonable given this Court\u2019s holdings in <em>State v. Bullock, </em>272 Mont. 361, 901 P.2d 61 (1995), and <em>State v. Romain, </em>1999 MT 161, 295 Mont. 152, 983 P.2d 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u00b633 In <em>Bullock, </em>even though the defendant\u2019s property was posted with \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs on each side of the gate leading to his property, a game warden and another individual entered the property through the gate and drove down the private road leading to the defendant\u2019s cabin pursuant to a tip that defendant had illegally shot a bull elk. They did not have permission to enter the property, nor did they secure a search warrant prior to entering. As they approached the cabin, they observed a large bull elk hanging from a tree in an area a short distance from the cabin. The elk could not be seen from the public road, nor was there evidence that it could be seen from any other public location. <em>Bullock, </em>272 Mont. at 365-66, 901 P.2d at 64.</p>\n<p id=\"A8f\">\u00b634 We stated in <em>Bullock </em>that \u201c[w]hat a person knowingly exposes to the public is not protected, but what an individual seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected.\u201d <em>Bullock, </em>272 Mont. at 375, 901 P.2d at 70 <em>(citing Katz, </em>389 U.S. at 351, 88 S. Ct. at 511). Thus, we held in <em>Bullock </em>that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">in Montana a person may have an expectation of privacy in an area of land that is beyond the curtilage which the society of this State is willing to recognize as reasonable, and that where that expectation is evidenced by fencing, \u201cNo Trespassing,\u201d or similar signs, or \u201cby some other means [which] indicated] unmistakably that entry is not permitted,\u201d entry by law enforcement officers requires permission or a warrant. As in our prior decisions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>however, <em>this requirement does not apply to observations of private land from public </em>property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><em>Bullock, </em>272 Mont. at 384, 901 P.2d at 75-76 (emphasis added and internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">\u00b635 Similarly, in <em>Romain, </em>based on an anonymous tip that the defendant had illegally shot a cow elk, two game wardens entered defendant\u2019s property and drove to his house to speak with him. Defendant\u2019s property was fenced and marked with orange paint to notify others that it is private property to which the public is excluded. Weathered \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs were posted at the gate leading to defendant\u2019s house, but the signs were no longer readable. However, fluorescent orange paint was sprayed on at least one of the gate posts. In addition, the house was obscured from the road by trees and bushes. Upon arriving at the house, the wardens saw a truck with an elk in the back. <em>Romain, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4-7. We held in <em>Romain, </em>that the defendant\u2019s expectation of privacy in his property was reasonable, because it was fenced and properly marked with orange paint. Thus, we held that the wardens\u2019 entry onto the defendant\u2019s property without express permission and without a warrant was unlawful. <em>Romain, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-19.</p>\n<p id=\"A0X\">\u00b636 In the instant case, unlike <em>Bullock </em>and <em>Romain, </em>Monger and Reilly did not physically intrude onto Cotterell\u2019s property. Instead, their observations were made when they flew over the property in Monger\u2019s airplane while returning from a DFWP meeting in Helena. Nevertheless, Cotterell argues that as in <em>Bullock </em>and <em>Romain, </em>all of the evidence seized from his property should be suppressed because it was the fruit of a warrantless aerial search by State agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\u00b637 The question of whether law enforcement officers can actually conduct warrantless aerial surveillance of an individual\u2019s property is not before us in this case. Instead, the aerial observations in this case that led to Anderson\u2019s investigation of Cotterell\u2019s hunting activities, were made accidentally and were not part of any surveillance of the property by law enforcement officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">\u00b638 Monger testified at the hearing on Cotterell\u2019s Motion to Suppress that it was common for him to fly along the river in that area because \u201c[fit\u2019s part of the direct route and also real scenic compared to the Sagebrush Hills on the south side of the river, a lot more wildlife to see there, more interesting.\u201d In addition, Monger and Reilly testified that they were not observing or looking for anything in particular during this trip, nor did they have any law enforcement duties that were being fulfilled on the flight.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">\u00b639  In <em>California v. Ciraolo, </em>476 U.S. 207, 213, 106 S. Ct. 1809, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>1812 (1986), the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-4\">The Fourth Amendment protection of the home has never been extended to require law enforcement officers to shield their eyes when passing by a home on public thoroughfares.

However, the evidence and testimony introduced at the hearing on Cotterell\u2019s suppression motion and at trial indicated that was not the case.

The State argues on the other hand that because the radio traffic listened to and recorded by Anderson was sent over public airways, it in no way involved an expectation of privacy, thus no warrant was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">\u00b647 The State relies, in part, on our holding in <em>State v.

As to the warrantless consensual monitoring of face-to-face conversations by the use of a body wire, we held in <em>Brown </em>that such activity does not violate the right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures nor the privacy section of the Montana Constitution. <em>Brown, </em>232 Mont. at 8, 755 P.2d at 1369. We again cautioned however, that consent for this type of monitoring \u201cmust be clearly obtained from at least one party to the conversation and must be freely made and without compulsion.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>232 Mont. at 8, 755 P.2d at 1369.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u00b649 <em>Goetz </em>also involved the warrantless consensual monitoring of face-to-face conversations by the use of a body wire.

Thus, we overruled <em>Brown </em>and examined the issue anew \u201capplying more current and consistent interpretations of Article II, Sections 10 and 11 of the Montana Constitution.\u201d <em>Goetz, </em>\u00b6 24. We then held in <em>Goetz </em>that the warrantless electronic monitoring and recording of face-to-face conversations, even with the consent of one participant in the conversation, violates the other participant\u2019s rights to privacy and to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures guaranteed by Article II, Sections 10 and 11. <em>Goetz, </em>\u00b6 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\u00b650 We noted in <em>Goetz </em>that our initial inquiry in addressing warrantless electronic monitoring is to determine whether such conduct constitutes a search. <em>Goetz, </em>\u00b6 25 (citing <em>State v.

On the facts of this case, we reject Cotterell\u2019s position. Cotterell and his son engaged in their communications using widely available hand-held radios over a public channel that can be monitored by anyone using similar equipment. Contrary to Cotterell\u2019s assertions, these sorts of conversations cannot be considered \u201cprivate.\u201d \u201cWhere a person has gone to considerable trouble to keep activities and property away from prying eyes, the person evinces a subjective expectation of privacy in those activities and that property.\u201d <em>Goetz, </em>\u00b6 29 (citing <em>State v. 1993 Chevrolet Pickup, </em>2005 MT 180, \u00b6 12, 328 Mont. 10, \u00b6 12, 116 P.3d 800, \u00b6 12). In this case, rather than keeping his \u201cactivities and property away from prying eyes\u201d-or ears, as the case may be-Cotterell actually went to \u201cconsiderable trouble\u201d to announce his activities using a media that is accessible to any member of the public with commonly available technology.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\u00b653 Indeed, Anderson testified at the suppression hearing and at trial that he used a scanner to listen to the radio traffic in the area over the family radio-service channel. He also testified that anyone who uses similar equipment which, as he stated, is easily obtained and readily available, can listen to conversations on this channel since the channel is open to the public at large.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u00b654 On the evidentiary record here, we cannot conclude that Cotterell demonstrated that he had a subjective expectation of privacy in his radio conversations that society would recognize as reasonable. Indeed, if it was Cotterell\u2019s intention to seek privacy in his radio communications with his son, he chose, incongruously, a forum that could not have been more accessible and public. Moreover, knowing that his use of such radio communications in big game hunting is prohibited <em>(see </em>\u00b6 63, <em>infra), </em>it should have come as no surprise to Cotterell that his radio traffic wight well have been overheard or monitored by game wardens on patrol during the hunting season.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>[W]hen persons leave the privacy of their home and expose themselves and their effects to the public and its independent powers of perception, it is clear that they cannot expect to preserve the same degree of privacy for themselves or their affairs as they could expect at home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><em>Goetz, </em>\u00b6 29 (quoting <em>State v.

[Anderson] also observed three hunters hunt from a \u201chunting hut,\u201d near a salt/mineral lick, on the Cotterell property. [Anderson] monitored the radio traffic of those hunters that was used to aid in the hunting of game animals. The radio traffic was matched to the hunters on the Cotterell property by the hunter\u2019s actions, names, and descriptions of locations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">\u2022 The hunters talked about hunting mule deer on the property. [Anderson] checked records and found that none of the hunters have permits to hunt mule deer in hunting district 391, which is the hunting district the Cotterell property is located in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-10\">\u2022 On 10/25/2004, [Anderson] observed a hunter walk across a river channel, from the Cotterell property, towards a neighboring island. The hunter walked to a dead whitetail buck deer that was lying in the river several feet from the islands shoreline. The hunter then walked back to the Cotterell property to a eight-wheeled off-highway vehicle that was parked there. The hunter then drove the vehicle across the river channel onto the island. The hunter loaded the un-gutted deer into the vehicle and then drove the vehicle back across the river channel onto the Cotterell property. [Anderson] never saw the hunter put a tag on the deer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>To [Anderson\u2019s] knowledge, none of the Cotterell\u2019s has permission to hunt on the neighboring island where the deer was killed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-4\">\u2022 In [Anderson\u2019s] experience, hunters will usually take photographs of their hunting activities and their harvested game.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">\u2022 In [Anderson\u2019s] experience, consumers will often have paperwork showing the purchase of, or directions on how to use, products such as game feeders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">\u2022 Game feed and salt/mineral blocks that are not being used are usually stored inside a building out of the weather.

Along with his allegations of error discussed above regarding the aerial \u201csearch\u201d and the electronic monitoring, he argues that tree stands or hunting huts are not an illegal or even a suspicious activity, nor is placing salt blocks and mineral containers for cattle. He also argues that retrieval of a dead buck from the water is not illegal, and that the application makes no statement in support of how the deer was killed, who killed it, or when it was killed. In addition, Cotterell argues that his off-highway vehicle is an amphibious vehicle, designed expressly for the use observed and, that it is licensed as a boat. Hence, Cotterell claims that the law Anderson cites regarding a violation committed with the off-highway vehicle does not apply to amphibious vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">\u00b662 To address whether sufficient probable cause existed in the application to issue a search warrant, we adopted the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test set forth in the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 103 S.

For example, DFWP regulations prohibit the use of two-way communication devices in hunting big game animals, and, under \u00a7 87-1-125, MCA (2003), any person who purposely, knowingly, or negligently violates those regulations is guilty of a misdemeanor. Furthermore, Cotterell is incorrect in arguing that his use of an amphibious vehicle to retrieve a deer from his neighbor\u2019s property was not improper. Section 61-8-371, MCA (2003), provides that \u201ca person may not operate a motor vehicle, as defined in 61-1-102, or an off-highway vehicle, as defined in 23-2-801,... below the ordinary high-water mark of class I waters flowing through private lands, within that portion of the streambed that is covered with water.\u201d Section 23-2-801(1), MCA (2003), defines an \u201coff-highway vehicle\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFh\">a self-propelled vehicle used for recreation or cross-country travel on public lands, trails, easements, lakes, rivers, or streams.

Spilotro, </em>800 F.2d 959, 963 (9th Cir. 1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">\u00b669 We noted in <em>Hauge </em>that the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires that a search warrant particularly describe the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized, and that, while Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution does not use the word \u201cparticularly\u201d in its discussion of search warrants, we have held that the Montana Constitution does impose a particularity requirement identical to that under the Federal Constitution. <em>Hauge, </em>\u00b6 13 (citing <em>State v. Ballew, </em>163 Mont. 257, 261, 516 P.2d 1159, 1161-62 (1973)). We also pointed out in <em>Seader </em>that \u00a7 46-5-221(4), MCA, provides that \u201c[a] judge shall issue a search warrant to a person upon application ... made under oath or affirmation, that... particularly describes who or what is to be seized\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>and that this requirement of particularity \u201cserves to prevent a \u2018general, exploratory rummaging in a person\u2019s belongings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Seader, </em>\u00b6 11 (quoting <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 467, 91 S. Ct. 2022, 2038 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u00b670 The search warrant in <em>Seader </em>allowed for the seizure of several specific items along with \u201cproceeds of drug sales whether in monies, precious metals, property or anything else of value furnished or intended to be furnished in the exchange for the evidence or contraband relating to the use, sale or manufacture of dangerous drugs.\u201d <em>Seader, </em>\u00b6 7. We concluded in <em>Seader </em>that this language was overly broad because Seader was not suspected of committing the offense of criminal distribution of dangerous drugs or criminal possession with intent to distribute, nor did the search warrant application contain any information that Seader was a suspected drug dealer. <em>Seader, </em>\u00b6 15. Thus, we held that because the search warrant \u201cgave the officers unbridled discretion to engage in precisely what the particularity requirement seeks to prevent-a general, exploratory rummaging in Seader\u2019s belongings,\u201d <em>Seader, </em>\u00b6 14, \u201c[t]he phrase \u2018anything else of value\u2019 rendered the warrant facially overbroad and all evidence seized pursuant to it was inadmissible and should have been suppressed,\u201d <em>Seader, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u00b671 Similarly, the search warrant in <em>Hauge </em>authorized law enforcement officers to seize drugs, drug paraphernalia, records of drug transactions, weapons, and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">[p]roceeds of dangerous drug sales to include United States currency, precious metals, jewelry, and financial instruments, including but not limited to stocks and bonds, real property, or <em>anything else of value </em>furnished or intended to be furnished in the exchange of controlled substances in violation of Title 45, chapter 9, MCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-7\"><em>Hauge, </em>\u00b6 7 (emphasis added). Unlike the facts in <em>Seader, </em>however, the law enforcement officers in <em>Hauge </em>did not seize any property related to the catchall clause in the search warrant, nor did any criminal charges result from the presence of that language in the warrant. On that basis we held that \u201cwhen faced with a warrant that is lawfully issued and is otherwise sufficiently particularized, the overbroad catchall clause should be severed and only that evidence seized under that clause need be suppressed.\u201d <em>Hauge, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">\u00b672 In addition, we stated in <em>State v. Loh, </em>275 Mont. 460, 473, 914 P.2d 592, 600 (1996), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-9\">[t]he essential predicate to any valid warrantless seizure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>incriminating evidence is that the officer must be lawfully at the place from which he could plainly view the evidence. In other words, his initial entry onto or intrusion into the place where he views the evidence must not have been in violation of the Fourth Amendment or in violation of Article II, section 11 of Montana\u2019s Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">We further stated in <em>Loh </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-5\">there are two conditions that must be satisfied to justify the warrantless seizure under the plain view doctrine. First, the item must be in plain view and its incriminating character be \u201cimmediately apparent.\u201d Second, not only must the officer be lawfully located in a place from which the object can be plainly seen but he or she must also have a lawful right of access to the object itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-6\"><em>Loh, </em>275 Mont. at 473, 914 P.2d at 600 <em>(citing Horton v. California, </em>496 U.S. 128, 136-37, 110 S. Ct. 2301, 2307-08 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\u00b673 In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we agree with the District Court that the journals and calendars seized from Cotterell\u2019s residence were items which generally would be sought by a game warden in the investigation of hunting violations as they directly relate to the crimes alleged. First, Anderson and the other officers were on Cotterell\u2019s property by virtue of a validly executed search warrant. Second, the officers discovered the journal and calendars in places that they were allowed by the warrant to search-i.e., the hunting shack and cabin. And, third, the journal and calendars were found in the course of looking for items such as photographs, paperwork, and permits, all of which were specifically set out in the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">\u00b674  Accordingly, we hold that even after the phrase \u201cany other evidence of a crime\u201d is excised from the search warrant, the journals and calendars were evidence seized within the scope of the warrant since they related to the activities of hunting and fishing.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">\n<em>F. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">\u00b675  Based on all of the foregoing, we hold that the District Court did not err in denying Cotterell\u2019s Motion to Suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">\u00b676 <em>Whether the District Court erred in denying Cottrell\u2019s Motion to Dismiss.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">\u00b677 Cotterell filed his Brief in Support of Motion to Dismiss on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>January 22, 2007,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> just one week prior to trial. In his brief, Cotterell claimed that he was charged several times for taking or possessing the same game animal in violation of the prohibition against double jeopardy. The District Court denied Cotterell\u2019s motion concluding that it was without merit. The court also noted that the motion was untimely and should have been filed \u201cmonths ago.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u00b678 Title 46, chapter 13, MCA, sets forth certain timing requirements for filing pretrial motions. Most relevant to the facts in the instant case is \u00a7 46-13-101, MCA, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">Pretrial motions and notices. (1) Except for good cause shown, any defense, objection, or request that is capable of determination without trial of the general issue <em>must be raised at or before the omnibus hearing </em>unless otherwise provided by Title 46. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Moreover, \u00a7 46-13-110(3), MCA, provides that at the omnibus hearing, the prosecutor and defendant\u2019s counsel</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">must be prepared to discuss any pretrial matter appropriate to the case, including but not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\">(b) double jeopardy....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">\u00b679 The purpose behind requiring pretrial motions to be brought at or before the omnibus hearing is the \u201c \u2018orderly and fair administration of the criminal justice system itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. VonBergen, </em>2003 MT 265, \u00b6 16, 317 Mont. 445, \u00b6 16, 77 P.3d 537, \u00b6 16 (quoting <em>United States v. Sisca, </em>503 F.2d 1337, 1349 (2d Cir. 1974)). In addition, \u00a7 46-13-110(2), MCA, states that the purpose of the omnibus hearing \u201cis to expedite the procedures leading up to the trial of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">\u00b680 The omnibus hearing in this case was held on September 23, 2005. The only issues raised by Cotterell at the omnibus hearing related to the suppression of evidence. Moreover, he was required to file any additional motions by October 7, 2005. Because the double jeopardy issue Cotterell raised in his Motion to Dismiss (almost 16 months after the omnibus hearing) was \u201ccapable of determination without trial of the general issue,\u201d it should have been raised at or before the omnibus hearing pursuant to \u00a7 46-13-101(1), MCA. Cotterell has not demonstrated good cause why he failed to do so. \u201cFailure of a party to raise defenses or objections or to make requests that must be made prior to trial, at the time set by the court, constitutes a waiver of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>defense, objection, or request.\u201d Section 46-13-101(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">\u00b681 Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in denying Cotterell\u2019s Motion to Dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Issue 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\u00b682 <em>Whether the District Court erred in its interpretation of the provisions of\u00a7 87-1-102(2)(b), MCA (2003), at sentencing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">\u00b683 Along with his convictions for killing more than the legal limit of game animals, hunting without a license, and using two-way communication devices while hunting, Cotterell was convicted of two misdemeanor counts of possessing unlawfully killed game animals. For these two violations, the District Court suspended Cotterell\u2019s hunting, fishing and trapping privileges for a period of two years from the date of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">\u00b684 While Cotterell concedes that the District Court was obligated to impose such a restriction, he contends that the court mistakenly underestimated its authority to suspend the forfeiture with appropriate conditions. However, Cotterell cites no authority in support of his claim that this portion of his sentence may be suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">\u00b685 In <em>State v. Herd, </em>2004 MT 85, 320 Mont. 490, 87 P.3d 1017, we clarified our standard of review for criminal sentences. We held in that case that if the offender is eligible for sentence review, i.e., if the offender is sentenced to one year or more of actual incarceration \u2014 we will review such a sentence for legality only. <em>Herd, </em>\u00b6 22. If, however, the offender is statutorily ineligible for sentence review, then we will utilize the two-tiered approach which we employed prior to the creation of the Sentence Review Division (SRD), i.e., we will review such sentences for both legality and abuse of discretion. <em>Herd, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"AaV\">\u00b686 In the instant case, Cotterell is not eligible for sentence review before the SRD because he was sentenced to concurrent sentences of six months in the county jail on each count, with all time suspended. <em>See State ex rel. Holt v. District Court, </em>2000 MT 142, \u00b6 6, 300 Mont. 35, \u00b6 6, 3 P.3d 608, \u00b6 6 (citing \u00a7 46-18-903, MCA). Thus, we employ the two-tiered standard of review in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">\u00b687 First, we review Cotterell\u2019s sentence to determine whether it falls within the parameters of the sentencing statute. Section 87-1-102, MCA (2003), the penalty statute for violations under this Title, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-11\">(2)(b) Except as provided in subsection (2)(f), a person convicted of unlawfully taking, killing, possessing, or transporting a deer, antelope, elk, or mountain lion or any part of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>animals shall be fined an amount not less than $300 or more than $1,000 or imprisoned in the county detention center for not more than 6 months, or both. In addition, that person, upon conviction or forfeiture of bond or bail, <em>shall forfeit </em>any current hunting, fishing, or trapping license issued by this state and the privilege to hunt, fish, or trap in this state <em>for 24 months </em>from the date of conviction or forfeiture, <em>unless the court imposes a longer forfeiture period. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\u00b688 Clearly, \u00a7 87-1-102(2)(b), MCA, mandates that a person convicted under this statute \u201cshall forfeit\u201d their license for 24 months. There is no provision in the statute allowing the court to suspend all or a part of that forfeiture. In fact, \u00a7 87-1-102(4), MCA (2003), specifically provides that a person whose license privileges are forfeited may not <em>possess </em>a hunting, fishing or trapping license during the period in which the license privileges have been forfeited. To do so would subject the person to additional fines and penalties. Consequently, the District Court\u2019s imposition of license forfeiture for 24 months without any suspension of the forfeiture period is within the parameters of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u00b689  Next, we examine whether the District Court abused its discretion in not suspending all or a portion of the 24-month forfeiture period under the facts of this case. An abuse of discretion occurs when a district court acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason. <em>State v. Ruiz, </em>2005 MT 117, \u00b6 22, 327 Mont. 109, \u00b6 22, 112 P.3d 1001, \u00b6 22 (citing <em>State v. Grindheim, </em>2004 MT 311, \u00b6 16, 323 Mont. 519, \u00b6 16, 101 P.3d 267, \u00b6 16). As already noted, there is no provision in the statute allowing the court to suspend all or a part of the license forfeiture. The only discretion afforded the court by \u00a7 87-1-102(2)(b), MCA, is whether to impose a <em>longer </em>forfeiture period, which the court did not do in this case. Thus, we cannot conclude that the court acted arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason. Furthermore, \u201c[i]n the construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. Based on the foregoing, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in not suspending the forfeiture period.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\u00b690 Cotterell also argues that the District Court erred in refusing to sever Cotterell\u2019s fishing privileges from the forfeiture of his hunting privileges because there is an insufficient nexus between his fishing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>privileges and the convicted offenses. As with his claim that all or part of the 24-month forfeiture period for his license may be suspended, Cotterell cites no authority in support of his claim that the court could sever his fishing privileges from his hunting privileges and only require that he forfeit his hunting privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">\u00b691  Section 87-1-102(2)(b), MCA (2003), provides that \u201ca person convicted of unlawfully taking, killing, possessing, or transporting <em>a deer, antelope, elk, or mountain lion </em>or any part of these animals ... shall forfeit any current hunting, <em>fishing, </em>or trapping license issued by this state (emphasis added).\u201d Thus, under this statute, the forfeiture of fishing privileges is not tied to a violation of any privileges regarding fishing. Instead, the forfeiture of fishing privileges, along with the forfeiture of hunting and trapping privileges, is specifically tied to the offenses for which Cotterell was charged and convicted. As such, the District Court\u2019s imposition of forfeiture of Cotterell\u2019s fishing privileges is within the parameters of the statute. Additionally, \u00a7 87-1-102(2)(b), MCA, does not afford the corut any discretion to sever Cotterell\u2019s fishing privileges from his hunting and trapping privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">\u00b692 Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in its interpretation of the provisions of \u00a7 87-1-102(2)(b), MCA (2003), at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">\u00b693 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b275-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-11\"> Cotterell failed to file the Motion to Dismiss itself until January 25, 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
