He was sentenced to eighty years (with ten suspended) for the deliberate homicide. He also received ten years for each of the remaining counts, including the aggravated assault which was the predicate felony for the felony homicide charge. Russell appeals, arguing his conviction for aggravated assault violates the double jeopardy clause of the Montana Constitution. Russell also challenges the jury instructions given in the case, and claims he was denied effective assistance of counsel. We affirm in part, and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">\u00b63 I. Did the District Court err by denying Russell\u2019s motion to dismiss his conviction for aggravated assault, where his felony homicide conviction was predicated on the same assault?</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">\u00b64 II. Was the performance of Russell\u2019s trial counsel constitutionally deficient?</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">\u00b65 III. Was Russell\u2019s constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict violated?</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">\u00b66 On Monday night, April 25, 2005, Russell and his friend Brandon Spotted Wolf (\u201cSpotted Wolf\u2019) spent the evening drinking their way across Billings. Though they were underage, they convinced two people to buy them a couple bottles of whiskey, which they drank in various back alleys and in a private residence over the course of the evening. Early the next morning, they found themselves outside the Saint Vincent De Paul Thrift Store, where they ran into Henry Rideshorse (\u201cRideshorse\u201d). Rideshorse had a bottle of vodka; the boys had about half a bottle of whiskey left. They decided to share the two bottles amongst the three of them, and moved into the back alley behind the thrift store where they could drink without being seen by police.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>\u00b67 Near the loading docks behind the store, several transients were sleeping. Spotted Wolf approached one of the sleeping men, Dale Wallin. Spotted Wolf demanded money or alcohol from Wallin, but Wallin did not respond. Russell drew a knife and gave it to Spotted Wolf. Spotted Wolf slashed Wallin\u2019s face, gave the knife back to Russell and said, \u201cShow me what you\u2019re made of, man, show me what you can do.\u201d Russell took the knife and stabbed Wallin several times in the back.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\u00b68 Russell turned and walked further back into the alley, still holding the knife. There he saw another transient, John Gewanski, sleeping next to a dumpster. Both Rideshorse and Spotted Wolf testified that they saw Russell approach Gewanski, and heard Gewanski make several grunting noises, as if he were being punched or stabbed. The record contains conflicting evidence as to whether or not Spotted Wolf joined Russell in assaulting Gewanski. Blood from both victims was found on both Russell\u2019s and Spotted Wolfs clothing. Gewanski sustained numerous stab wounds and died in the makeshift shelter where he had been sleeping when he was attacked.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u00b69 Russell and Spotted Wolf turned their attention back to Wallin, and began attacking him again. Rideshorse intervened and tried to protect Wallin. Russell punched Rideshorse, and said to Spotted Wolf, \u201cLet\u2019s do this guy, man.\u201d Spotted Wolf testified that he convinced Russell not to kill Rideshorse, and the two fled the scene. Rideshorse helped Wallin to his feet, ran to the street, and flagged down a police car for help. In the meantime, Wallin stumbled several blocks to the Rescue Mission, where he was taken to the hospital. Wallin survived his multiple stab wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\u00b610 Spotted Wolf was found the next morning, passed out with a blood alcohol level exceeding 0.3, blood on his clothing, and a bloody knife in his pants. He was taken to the hospital and treated for alcohol poisoning, and later arrested. Russell was apprehended by the police the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\u00b611 Spotted Wolf pled guilty to one count of deliberate homicide by accountability, one count of aggravated assault, and one count of robbery. In exchange for his plea and testimony, Spotted Wolf received a reduced sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">\u00b612 Russell was charged with four offenses: the deliberate homicide of Gewanski, the aggravated assault of Wallin, robbery by accountability, and aggravated assault of Gewanski by accountability. The deliberate homicide charge was brought under \u00a7 45-5-102(1)(b), MCA, the felony homicide statute. The information identified the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>aggravated assault of Wallin as the underlying felony for the felony homicide charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\u00b613 Spotted Wolf testified against Russell at his trial. When asked why he and Russell attacked Wallin, Spotted Wolf replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know, because we were drunk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\u00b614 At the close of trial, Russell requested that the court specifically instruct the jury that, if they convicted Russell of deliberate homicide under a felony homicide theory, they must all agree on the particular act or acts he committed. The District Court refused the instruction, but issued a general unanimity instruction instead. The jury found Russell guilty on all four counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">\u00b615 Prior to sentencing, Russell moved to dismiss his conviction for aggravated assault. Russell argued that his conviction resulted in multiple punishments in violation of Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution. The District Court denied Russell\u2019s motion to dismiss, and sentenced Russell to eighty years, with ten suspended, for the felony homicide. Russell also received ten years for each of the remaining counts, to run consecutively with the eighty-year sentence, but concurrently with each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">\u00b616 I. Did the District Court err by denying Russell\u2019s motion to dismiss his conviction for aggravated assault, where his felony homicide conviction was predicated on the same assault?</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">\u00b617 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case <em>de novo. State v. Burkhart, </em>2004 MT 372, \u00b6 39, 325 Mont. 27, \u00b6 39, 103 P.3d 1037, \u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">\u00b618 Russell argues that the District Court erred in refusing to grant his motion to dismiss his conviction for aggravated assault. The felony homicide charge in Count I was predicated on the charge for aggravated assault in Count II. Thus, Russell asserts, the underlying felony in Count II should have been merged with the felony homicide charge in Count I. Russell claims that the District Court\u2019s refusal to dismiss his conviction for aggravated assault placed him in double jeopardy for the same aggravated assault charge-a result prohibited by Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">\u00b619 Although Russell frames the issue as a double jeopardy issue under Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution, \u201cwe have repeatedly recognized that courts should avoid constitutional issues whenever possible.\u201d In <em>re S.H., </em>2003 MT 366, \u00b6 18, 319 Mont. 90, \u00b6 18, 86 P.3d 1027, \u00b6 18. Here, determining whether the District Court erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>in failing to dismiss Count II can be resolved through application of our code of criminal procedure \u00a7\u00a7 46-11-410(2)(a) and 46-1-202(9), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">\u00b620 Section 46-11-410, MCA, states, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">(1) When the same transaction may establish the commission of more than one offense, a person charged with the conduct may be prosecuted for each offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">(2) A defendant may not, however, be convicted of more than one offense if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">(a) one offense is included in the other ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">\u00b621 Section 46-1-202(9), MCA, defines \u201cincluded offense\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Avq\">\u201cIncluded offense\u201d means an offense that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-9\">(a) is established by proof of the same or less than all the facts required to establish the commission of the offense charged ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ar9\">\u00b622 As used in \u00a7 46-1-202(9)(a), MCA, the term \u201cfacts\u201d refers to the statutory elements of the offense, not the individual facts of the case. <em>State v. Beavers, </em>1999 MT 260, \u00b6 30, 296 Mont. 340, \u00b6 30, 987 P.2d 371, \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">\u00b623 Here, Russell was charged with felony homicide under \u00a7 45-5-102(1)(b), MCA. Felony homicide can be accomplished by multiple means under the statute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-11\">A person commits the offense of deliberate homicide if ... the person attempts to commit, commits, or is legally accountable for the attempt or commission of robbery, sexual intercourse without consent, arson, burglary, kidnapping, aggravated kidnapping, felonious escape, assault with a weapon, aggravated assault, or any other forcible felony and in the course of the forcible felony or flight thereafter, the person or any person legally accountable for the crime causes the death of another human being.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">Section 45-5-102(1)(b), MCA. The statute lists a myriad of possible predicate felonies: robbery, sexual intercourse without consent, arson, burglary, kidnapping, and so on. The State charged Russell by information with deliberate homicide under \u00a7 45-5-102(1)(b), MCA, and identified aggravated assault as the predicate felony. The court defined the felony homicide charge to include aggravated assault in its instructions to the jury. Thus the charge, as applied to Russell, included aggravated assault as an element of felony homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">\u00b624 At oral argument, the State conceded that the same evidence was used to prove the stand-alone aggravated assault charge in Count II, and the predicate felony relied upon in the felony homicide charge in Count I. An offense is an included offense if it \u201cis established by proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>of the same or less than all the facts required to establish the commission of the offense charged....\u201d Section 46-1-202(9)(a), MCA. In the unique context of felony homicide, the predicate offense is, of necessity, an included offense, as well as an element of the felony homicide itself. As applied in this case, aggravated assault is both an included offense and an element of felony homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\u00b625 Under \u00a7 46-11-410(1)-(2)(a), MCA, \u201cA defendant may not ... be convicted of more than one offense\u201d arising out of \u201cthe same transaction\u201d if \u201cone offense is included in the otherAssuming that the assault on Wallin and the killing of Gewanski were part of the same transaction,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> then under \u00a7 46-11-410(2)(a), MCA, Russell\u2019s conviction of felony homicide precludes a conviction on the aggravated assault charge in Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\u00b626 In his dissent, Justice Rice relies heavily on our 1981 decision in <em>State v. Close, </em>191 Mont. 229, 623 P.2d 940 (1981). The <em>Close </em>decision is of very limited value in the present case. The basic premise of the <em>Close </em>rationale is false. The <em>Close </em>Court engaged in a <em>Blockburger </em>analysis and held that \u201cit is clear that proof of felony homicide will not necessarily require proof of either robbery or aggravated kidnapping.\u201d <em>Close, </em>191 Mont. at 246, 623 P.2d at 950. One can commit felony homicide without committing robbery, or commit aggravated kidnapping without committing felony homicide. Therefore, <em>Blockburger </em>does not require the conclusion that felony homicide and the underlying felony merge.\u201d <em>Close, </em>191 Mont. at 247, 623 P.2d at 950. Although the Court was correct that, in the abstract, one can commit felony murder without necessarily committing aggravated kidnapping or can commit aggravating kidnapping without committing felony homicide, a defendant cannot commit the offense of felony homicide without committing a predicate felony offense. Thus when the State uses an offense (such as kidnapping or robbery or, as here, assault) as a predicate offense in its charge of felony homicide, the accused cannot be found guilty of felony homicide without having committed the predicate offense of kidnapping, robbery, or assault. When the State chooses to charge the offenses in that fashion, the offenses merge. The predicate offense becomes a lesser included offense of the felony homicide charge. Sections 46-11-410, 46-1-202(9), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>\u00b627 The dissent argues that where there are two victims, the State should be able to hold the defendant separately accountable for each crime. The dissent\u2019s criticism is valid but misdirected. The discretion to charge whom with what lies with the State, not this Court. Here, the State could have charged Russell with felony homicide of Gewanski using robbery as the predicate felony, and then charged Russell separately with felony assault of Wallin, in which case there would have been no merger of the assault and the homicide convictions. Alternatively, the State could have avoided merger altogether by charging Russell with all three crimes separately: first, the deliberate homicide of Gewanski under \u00a7 45-5-102(a), MCA; second, robbery by accountability under \u00a7\u00a7 45-4-40l(l)(a) and 45-2-302(3), MCA; and finally, the aggravated assault of Wallin under \u00a7 45-5-202, MCA. Contrary to the dissent\u2019s characterization, the merger of the homicide and assault convictions in this felony homicide case arises not from a \u201cstupefying leap\u201d by this Court, but from the State\u2019s choice in framing the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">\u00b628 Our decision does not, as the dissent suggests, give Russell a \u201cfree pass\u201d for Wallin\u2019s assault. As we painstakingly outline above, the State had to prove each element of aggravated assault in order to convict Russell for felony homicide in this case. Russell was punished for both the predicate offense, Wallin\u2019s assault, and Gewanski\u2019s homicide, when he was charged and convicted under \u00a7 45-5-102, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\u00b629 Finally, under \u00a7 45-5-102, MCA, felony homicide is punishable by death, by life imprisonment, or by imprisonment for a term of not less than 10 years or more than 100 years. The dissent\u2019s hyperbolic \u201cfree pass\u201d argument ignores the fact that where the felon is sentenced to death or life in prison for felony homicide, any additional punishment for the underlying felony would have no practical effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\u00b630  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court erred in refusing to dismiss Russell\u2019s conviction for aggravated assault under Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"ANV\">\u00b631 II. Was the performance of Russell\u2019s trial counsel constitutionally deficient?</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">\u00b632 Russell argues that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to move to exclude Henry Rideshorse\u2019s testimony constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel presents mixed questions of law and fact which we review <em>de novo. State v. Herman, </em>2008 MT 187, \u00b6 10, 343 Mont. 494, \u00b6 10, 188 P.3d 978, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">\u00b633 To determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient, we apply the two-prong test adopted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Strickland. Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 2064 (1984); <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 10, 343 Mont. 90, \u00b6 10, 183 P.3d 861, \u00b6 10. Before we apply the <em>Strickland </em>test, however, we must first determine whether the ineffective assistance of counsel claim is record-based or not. <em>State v. St. Germain, </em>2007 MT 28, \u00b6 34, 336 Mont. 17, \u00b6 34, 153 P.3d 591, \u00b6 34. Claims involving \u201comissions of trial counsel frequently are ill-suited for direct appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Meyers, </em>2007 MT 230, \u00b6 10, 339 Mont. 160, \u00b6 10, 168 P.3d 645, \u00b6 10. While the failure to object to a witness\u2019s testimony may be record-based and thus appropriate for resolution on direct appeal, commonly the record does not reflect counsel\u2019s reasons for failing to object. <em>St. Germain, </em>\u00b6 35. We have held that \u201c[i]f the record does not fully explain why counsel failed to object to the admission of evidence, the matter is best suited for postconviction proceedings.\u201d <em>St. Germain, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">\u00b634 Here, Russell asserts that his lawyer should have moved to exclude Rideshorse\u2019s testimony. He contends that Rideshorse was not competent to be a witness because he was heavily intoxicated the night of the crime, and potentially suffered from a mental disability. Russell\u2019s counsel did not move to exclude Rideshorse as a witness. At trial, defense counsel cross-examined Rideshorse about his alcohol use and level of intoxication the night of the crime in an attempt to impeach him, but did not broach the subject of Rideshorse\u2019s alleged mental disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\u00b635 In order to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the appellant must show that his counsel\u2019s performance \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness measured under prevailing professional norms and in light of the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 20. Here, the record does not fully explain the surrounding circumstances, including why defense counsel failed to move to exclude Rideshorse\u2019s testimony. Prior to trial, and without the court\u2019s permission or knowledge, defense counsel caused the district court clerk to issue a subpoena duces tecum to several hospitals for Rideshorse\u2019s medical records. Counsel then moved the court for an <em>in-camera </em>review of the records. The court denied the motion, ordered counsel to turn the records over to the court immediately, and prohibited counsel from referencing any information contained within the records at trial. Russell alleges that his counsel\u2019s \u201cbungled attempts\u201d to obtain Rideshorse\u2019s medical records prejudiced his defense by preventing him from moving to exclude Rideshorse\u2019s testimony and from cross-examining Rideshorse as to his alleged disabilities. The record before us does not fully explain why defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>counsel took this particular course of action or why counsel failed to object to Rideshorse\u2019s testimony. This issue is best suited for review in a post-conviction proceeding which will permit further inquiry into the matter. We dismiss this issue without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">\u00b636 III. Was Russell\u2019s constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdiict violated?</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\u00b637 At the close of the trial, Russell offered the following jury instruction, which was refused by the District Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">The defendant is charged with the offence [sic] of Deliberate Homicide/Felony murder. The Defendant may be found guilty if the proof shows beyond a reasonable doubt the Defendant committed any one or more of such acts, but in order to find the Defendant guilty, all the jurors must agree that the Defendant committed the same act or acts. The particular act or acts committed so agreed upon be states [sic] in the verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Instead, the District Court delivered a general unanimity instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3S\">The law requires the jury verdict in this case to be unanimous. Thus, all twelve of you must agree in order to reach a verdict whether the verdict be guilty or not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Russell claims he was entitled to a specific unanimity instruction in this case, and that the District Court erred by refusing to give his proposed instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">\u00b638 We review jury instructions in criminal cases to determine \u201cwhether the instructions, as a whole, fully and fairly instruct the jury on the law applicable to the case.\u201d <em>State v. Swann, </em>2007 MT 126, \u00b6 32, 337 Mont. 326, \u00b6 32, 160 P.3d 511, \u00b6 32. A district court has broad discretion when it instructs a jury; our review of a district court\u2019s decision regarding jury instructions is confined to determining whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Swann, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">\u00b639  A criminal defendant\u2019s right to a unanimous jury verdict is protected by Article II, Section 26 of the Montana Constitution. <em>State v. Vernes, </em>2006 MT 32, \u00b6 21, 331 Mont. 129, \u00b6 21, 130 P.3d 169, \u00b6 21; <em>State v. Weaver, </em>1998 MT 167, \u00b6 26, 290 Mont. 58, \u00b6 26, 964 P.2d 713, \u00b6 26. In <em>Vernes, </em>we explained: \u201cUnanimity means more than an agreement that the defendant has violated the statute in question; it requires substantial agreement as to the principal factual elements underlying a specific offense.\u201d <em>Vernes, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">\u00b640 Russell argues that like the defendant in <em>Weaver, </em>he is entitled to a specific unanimity instruction. In <em>Weaver, </em>the defendant was convicted of two counts of sexual assault for acts which spanned a period of five months for one count, and five years for the other count. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number><em>Weaver, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8, 13. We reversed the convictions, and held that the district court should have specifically instructed the jury that it had to reach \u201ca unanimous verdict as to at least one specific underlying act of sexual assault for each count.\u201d <em>Weaver, </em>\u00b6 40. The instructions in <em>Weaver </em>were faulty because each count alleged more than one unlawful act, <em>Weaver, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17, 38, and so there was a risk that the conviction occurred as a result of \u201cdifferent jurors concluding that the defendant committed different unlawful acts....\u201d <em>Vernes, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">\u00b641 Russell urges us to view the events occurring the evening of April 25, 2005, as consisting of two separate attacks: first, the assault on Wallin, and second, the homicide of Gewanski. Russell implies that the felony homicide charge improperly charges him with two distinct crimes as a continuous course of conduct, and that such a result is prohibited by <em>Weaver. </em>The instant case, however, is distinguishable from <em>Weaver. </em>While Weaver\u2019s sexual attacks spanned the course of several months, Russell\u2019s unlawful acts all took place in one night. Rideshorse testified at trial that Russell assaulted Wallin, moved on to Gewanski, and then resumed his attack on Wallin. The assault and the homicide took place in the same back alley, only feet away from each other. Although a count of felony homicide necessarily involves two or more crimes-homicide and the underlying felony-we reject the implication that a felony homicide charge automatically warrants a specific unanimity instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\u00b642 In the instant case, no specific unanimity instruction was necessary. To convict Russell of the felony homicide of Gewanski, the State had to prove that Russell was guilty of the underlying felony-the aggravated assault of Wallin. The court\u2019s instructions clearly established the elements of felony homicide, and clearly identified the aggravated assault of Wallin as the underlying felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\u00b643  The court\u2019s instructions with respect to the remaining three counts also identified each element of each respective crime, and were equally clear. We conclude that the instructions given by the District Court fully and fairly instructed the jury on the law applicable to the case. As such, we cannot say that the District Court abused its discretion by refusing Russell\u2019s proposed specific unanimity instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">\u00b644 We reverse the District Court\u2019s order denying Russell\u2019s motion to dismiss his conviction for aggravated assault. Aggravated assault was an included element of felony homicide under \u00a7 45-5-102(1)(b), MCA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>as charged and applied in this case. Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution prohibits the State from convicting and punishing Russell again for the same aggravated assault. Accordingly, we vacate Russell\u2019s conviction for aggravated assault under Count II of the information. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Russell\u2019s proposed specific unanimity jury instruction.

In my view, Russell\u2019s conviction of felony homicide (Count I) is invalid. Consequently, I would reverse his conviction under Count I, affirm his conviction and sentence under Count II (aggravated assault), and not reach the double jeopardy and unanimity claims addressed by the Court under Issues I and III, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">\u00b646 It is necessary at the outset to acknowledge the Court\u2019s assertion that this issue was not raised or briefed in this appeal. Opinion, \u00b6 25 n. 1. This is only partly true. Russell does assert in his argument under Issue III that the assault on Wallin and the killing of Gewanski were \u201ctwo separate acts,\u201d not \u201ca continuous course of conduct.\u201d <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 41. He fails, however, to develop this point. As a result, his argument is deficient under this Court\u2019s rules concerning appellate briefs. <em>See </em>M. R. App. P. 12(1)f.; <em>see also State v. Miller, </em>2008 MT 106, \u00b6 15, 342 Mont. 355, \u00b6 15, 181 P.3d 625, \u00b6 15 (Conclusory assertions are \u201ca wholly inadequate presentation of an issue to this Court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">\u00b647 On the other hand, Russell asserted during oral argument that a felony homicide had not occurred in this case. Furthermore, in response to a follow-up question from the Court, Russell explained: \u201cI think the assaults on Mr. Wallin were completed and that, therefore, the assaults on the second individual who was asleep down the alley in a different place were not \u2018in the course of those assaults.\u201d Russell emphasized that this would be his position if he were permitted to argue it. (This Court\u2019s order classifying the case for oral argument limited the parties\u2019 arguments to the double jeopardy issue.)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">\u00b648 But even if Russell committed a procedural misstep in challenging the validity of his felony homicide conviction, this Court has stated that \u201c \u2018a serious error which appears on the face of [the] record is reviewable, although not presented by the parties\u2019 if ignoring the error would cause substantial injustice.\u201d <em>State v.

The same can be said here: Incarceration of Russell pursuant to a <em>conviction </em>that is plainly contrary to the evidence and the law represents a grievous wrong, and a miscarriage of justice that warrants relief even if he is otherwise procedurally barred from raising the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">\u00b649 Indeed, review of Russell\u2019s claim is compelled by this Court\u2019s \u201coverriding obligation to acknowledge and protect the substantial rights of litigants.\u201d <em>State v.

This obligation mandates that we not turn a blind eye to an invalid conviction simply because appellate counsel mounted an underdeveloped or procedurally bungled challenge thereto.

Here, on the record before us, it is plain that Russell\u2019s fundamental right to due process is at issue and that it is necessary, therefore, for this Court to consider the legal validity of the felony homicide conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">\u00b650 In prosecuting Russell for felony homicide, the State\u2019s theory was that the death of Gewanski occurred \u201cin the course of\u2019 the assault on Wallin. Section 45-5-102(1)(b), MCA. More specifically, the prosecutor alleged that Russell committed aggravated assault against Wallin and \u201cthen in the course of the offense of Aggravated Assault or flight thereafter,\u201d he \u201cstabbed, cut or otherwise assaulted [Gewanski], using a knife or other edged weapon, causing his death.\u201d This theory is flawed as a matter of law, as there is no factual or legal basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>whatsoever supporting the proposition that the death of Gewanski was causally related to the assault on Wallin. To the contrary, the evidence suggests, as Russell contends, that these were two entirely distinct events.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">\u00b651 According to the testimony at trial, Spotted Wolf slashed Wallin\u2019s face and Russell stabbed Wallin several times in the back. The two then left Wallin and proceeded east through the alley. As Spotted Wolf explained in response to questioning by the prosecutor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">A. We were pretty much just going to go around to the other side [of the building] and just leave out to the North Side. I said-well, you know, we found out it was blocked off right there (indicating).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">Q. And what happened then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">A. We stopped-well, you know, we stopped by that garbage can or that dumpster thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">Q. Okay. What happened then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-9\">A. Well, you know, we just stopped for, you know, not too long, we just stood there and then, you know, [Russell] went over here, and I don\u2019t know what he was-you know, he was doing, he was hitting another person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">(The other person was Gewanski.) Thereafter, because their easterly route was blocked, Russell and Spotted Wolf proceeded back to where Wallin was. Upon reencountering him, they both started hittingWallin again-apparently for no reason other than that \u201cwe were just drunk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AnS\">\u00b652 It is long-established in Montana that \u201cfor the felony-murder rule to apply a causal connection between the felonious act and the death must be present.\u201d <em>State ex rel.

In <em>Murphy, </em>we noted \u201cwith approval\u201d the following guidelines as to the applicability of the felony-murder rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-11\">\u201cFor the felony-murder rule to apply, it is necessary that the homicide be a natural and probable consequence of the commission or attempt to commit the felony; that the homicide be so closely connected with such other crime as to be within the res gestae thereof; or the natural or necessary result of the unlawful act; or that it be one of the causes. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-12\">\u201cSomething more than a mere coincidence of time and place between the wrongful act and the death is necessary. It must appear that there was such actual legal relation between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>killing and the crime committed or attempted that the killing can be said to have occurred as a part of the perpetration of the crime, or in furtherance of an attempt or purpose to commit it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0O\"><em>Murphy, </em>171 Mont. at 126-27, 556 P.2d at 910 (quoting <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law and Procedure, </em>vol. 1, \u00a7 252, at 543).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">\u00b653 Likewise, in <em>State v. Weinberger, </em>206 Mont. 110, 671 P.2d 567 (1983), we quoted with approval the following statements by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">\u201cThe mere coincidence of homicide and felony is not enough to satisfy the requirements of the felony-murder doctrine. \u2018It is necessary... to show that the conduct causing death was done in furtherance of the design to commit the felony. Death must be a consequence of the felony . . . and not merely coincidence.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AmW\"><em>Weinberger, </em>206 Mont. at 115, 671 P.2d at 569 (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Redline, </em>137 A.2d 472, 476 (Pa. 1958)) (ellipses in <em>Redline).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">\u00b654 Accordingly, we have said that in order to establish felony homicide, the State must prove that the death was \u201can outgrowth of the [predicate] felony itself and related to the [predicate felony] by an unbroken chain of causation.\u201d <em>State v. Sunday, </em>187 Mont. 292, 307, 609 P.2d 1188, 1197 (1980). We have also relied on \u00a7 45-2-201, MCA, in articulating the \u201ccausal relationship\u201d that must be shown in order to prove felony homicide. <em>See e.g. Weinberger, </em>206 Mont. at 114-15, 671 P.2d at 569; <em>State v. Turner, </em>265 Mont. 337, 348, 877 P.2d 978, 984-85 (1994). This statute states, in pertinent part: \u201cConduct is the cause of a result if... without the conduct the result would not have occurred.\u201d Section 45-2-201(1)(a), MCA (paragraph break omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">\u00b655 Given the law as stated above, the charge of felony homicide in this case is not supported by the facts established at trial. As a matter of fact, it is not even supported by the allegations set out under Count I of the Amended Information. Indeed, there is simply no causal connection at all between the aggravated assault on Wallin and the death of Gewanski. Russell and Spotted Wolf completed their assault on Wallin. They then decided \u201cto go around to the other side [of the building] and just leave\u201d; however, their passage through the east end of the alley was blocked. But rather than turn around and leave through the west end of the alley where they had entered, they \u201cjust stopped for, you know, not too long, [they] just stood there.\u201d Obviously, this cannot be construed as \u201cflight\u201d from the assault on Wallin. Section 45-5-102(1)(b), MCA. At that point, Russell attacked and killed Gewanski, who had been sleeping next to a dumpster. Thereafter, he and Spotted Wolf walked back to where Wallin was and ended up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>assaulting him again.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">\u00b656 While these events may constitute \u201cthe same transaction\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 46-11-410(1), MCA, they do not support the proposition that a causal connection existed between the aggravated assault on Wallin and the death of Gewanski. The death of Gewanski was in no way \u201ca natural and probable consequence\u201d or \u201cthe natural or necessary result\u201d of the assault on Wallin. Nor can it be said that \u201cthe conduct causing death was done in furtherance of the design to commit the [aggravated assault]\u201d or that the killing \u201coccurred as a part of the perpetration of the [aggravated assault], or in furtherance of an attempt or purpose to commit it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\u00b657 \u201cThe mere coincidence of [a] homicide and [a forcible] felony is not enough to satisfy the requirements of the felony-murder doctrine.\u201d <em>Weinberger, </em>206 Mont. at 115, 671 P.2d at 569 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cSomething more than a mere coincidence of time and place between the wrongful act and the death is necessary.\u201d <em>Murphy, </em>171 Mont. at 127, 556 P.2d at 910 (internal quotation marks omitted). While it may be debated whether the assault on Wallin and the death of Gewanski were more than mere coincidence, there is absolutely no basis for concluding that they were causally related or connected.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\u00b658 For the foregoing reasons, I conclude that the prosecutor improperly charged felony homicide in this case and that Russell\u2019s conviction is invalid as a matter of law. In reaching this conclusion, it is necessary to acknowledge that \u201cwhen the facts of a case support a possible charge of more than one crime, the crime to be charged is a matter of prosecutorial discretion.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Fletcher v. District Court, </em>260 Mont. 410, 415, 859 P.2d 992, 995 (1993). At the same time, however, whether an offense is properly charged, given the facts, and whether a conviction is legally sustainable, given the evidence, are legal questions which this Court must decide. <em>See e.g. State v. McWilliams, </em>2008 MT 59, \u00b6\u00b6 19-39, 341 Mont. 517, \u00b6\u00b6 19-39, 178 P.3d 121, \u00b6\u00b6 19-39. Here, the facts as alleged by the prosecutor and established at trial cannot, as a matter of law, support the charge of felony homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">\u00b659 Had this case been properly charged-deliberate homicide under \u00a7 45-5-102(1)(a), MCA, for the death of Gewanski and aggravated assault under \u00a7 45-5-202(1), MCA, for the serious bodily injury inflicted on Wallin-then the State would have two convictions for two separate acts. As it is, however, under the Court\u2019s resolution of Issue I, the State has only one conviction for the two acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">\u00b660 In sum, \u00a7\u00a7 46-11-410(2)(a) and 46-1-202(9)(a), MCA, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>preclude Russell\u2019s conviction on the aggravated assault charge if he were lawfully convicted on the felony homicide charge. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 20-25. But because the felony homicide charge is not supported by the facts as alleged by the prosecutor and proved at trial, I conclude that the aggravated assault charge can stand. Thus, I would reverse Russell\u2019s conviction under Count I and affirm his conviction and sentence under Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">\u00b661 I concur and dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b336-5\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"ACM\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\u00b662 The Court\u2019s decision may well come as a surprise to both Russell and the State. Throughout this case, the parties have litigated the issue raised \u2014 whether the double jeopardy clause of the Montana Constitution barred conviction and sentencing for both felony murder and the underlying felony. However, the Court lays aside the subject matter of this litigation and decides the case based upon a premise which has never been mentioned during the course of this case. There was no reference whatsoever of \u00a7 46-11-401, MCA, in the District Court or in the appellate briefs filed with this Court, and neither party discussed it during the oral argument we conducted on the University of Montana campus. However, upon retreat to the ivory tower, the Court has recast the case. The many people who have observed our proceedings and watched this case can now say, \u201cOh, <em>that\u2019s </em>how it works!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">\u00b663 The Court offers the justification that we \u201cavoid constitutional issues whenever possible.\u201d However, this principle of judicial self-restraint does not permit us to avoid constitutional issues by deciding cases on issues <em>not raised. </em>We are not to forage about for issues not argued in order to avert consideration of a constitutional claim the parties have validly raised within the proceeding. Thus, it is not \u201cpossible\u201d to avoid the constitutional issue raised in this case. The Court rejects consideration of an issue addressed by Justice Nelson\u2019s Concurrence and Dissent because \u201cthat issue was not raised or briefed in this appeal.\u201d The old expression about the pot calling the kettle black comes to mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">\u00b664 The Court\u2019s approach is fundamentally unfair to any litigant, here the State, who has defended a case upon the issues raised, prevailed in the District Court, then argued the case again on appeal upon the issues raised, only to lose the case on an issue neither party has ever mentioned during the course of the litigation-and on which it had no opportunity to brief, argue, or defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">\u00b665 Before turning to the issue raised, briefed, and argued, I am <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>compelled to briefly point out the errors in the Court\u2019s analysis. Perhaps as a consequence of addressing an issue which has not been researched and briefed by the parties, the Court, in my opinion, misapplies the statutes and overturns important precedent. The Court attempts to jam \u00a7 45-5-102, MCA, the felony murder statute, into \u00a7 46-1-202(9), MCA, the general definition of lesser included offense, in order to conclude that Russell cannot be convicted for both knifing Wallin and killing Gewanski under \u00a7 46-11-410, MCA, because these crimes are necessarily included within the other. It is clear that the Legislature did not intend such a result-indeed, we have so held. These crimes met the criteria for fulfillment of the special purposes of the felony murder statute without losing their distinctness as separate crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">\u00b666 Section 45-5-102(1), MCA, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-5\">A person commits the offense of deliberate homicide if: (a) the person purposely or knowingly <em>causes the death of another human </em>being; or (b) the person attempts to commit, commits, or is legally accountable for the attempt or commission of robbery, sexual intercourse without consent, arson, burglary, kidnapping, aggravated kidnapping, felonious escape, assault with a weapon, aggravated assault, or any other forcible felony and in the course of the forcible felony or flight thereafter, the person or any person legally accountable for the crime <em>causes the death of another human being.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">(Emphasis added.) Both subparagraphs make it a crime to deliberately cause the death of another person. The only difference between deliberate homicide under (a) and homicide by felony murder rule under (b) is the proof of mental state. As we discussed in <em>Close, </em>we have long recognized, from the days when criminal liability was predominantly governed by the common law, the principle of felony murder whereby malice, required by first degree murder, is \u201cimplied\u201d from commission of the underlying felony. 191 Mont. at 248, 623 P.2d at 950. We noted in <em>Close </em>that this \u201chistory of the common law and the purpose behind laws are both important tools to be used to determine legislative intent.\u201d 191 Mont. at 247, 623 P.2d at 950. We thus traced the history and purpose of felony murder statutes and gave the reason why felony murder involves two distinct crimes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">Given this rationale for the felony murder doctrine, it strains credulity to hold that the underlying felony merges into the felony murder. The statute proscribing the underlying felony-robbery, for example-is designed to protect a wholly different societal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>interest from the felony murder statute, which is intended to protect against homicide. The underlying felony is an essential element of felony murder only because without it the homicide might be second degree murder or manslaughter. Clearly, neither manslaughter nor second degree murder merges with any other felony like robbery or assisting a prisoner to escape.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><em>Close, </em>191 Mont. at 248, 623 P.2d at 950 (citing <em>U.S. v. Greene, </em>489 F.2d 1145, 1168-69, (D.C. Cir. 1973)). We concluded that \u201c[cjlearly, the legislature properly allowed and broadened the law relating to <em>cumulative sentencing </em>in felony murder cases.\u201d <em>Close, </em>191 Mont. at 249, 623 P.2d at 950-51 (emphasis added). We held that the felony murder statute thus contemplates multiple sentences, one for the murder and one for the underlying felony. Then in <em>Burkhart, </em>we used the same legislative intent analysis and reaffirmed our holding in Close, that the predicate offense and the felony murder do not merge, even though the offenses at issue in <em>Burkhart </em>involved the same victim and one charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\u00b667 However, in a stupefying leap unsupported by any authority, and without so much as a thought about whether the statutes might be deemed to conflict and thus require reconciliation, the Court concludes that the Legislature has somehow eliminated multiple punishments in felony murder cases-despite the careful explanation to the contrary in <em>Close </em>and despite hundreds of years of common law to the contrary-by virtue of the enactment of the statutes generally addressing lesser included offenses and multiple prosecutions. I cannot agree. Without saying so, the Court repudiates our holding in <em>Close </em>that the \u201cstatute proscribing the underlying felony ... is designed to protect a wholly different societal interest from the felony murder statute, which is intended to protect against homicide,\u201d and that a merger of the two offenses would ignore the Legislature\u2019s manifest intention to serve these two different interests. <em>Close, </em>191 Mont. at 248, 623 P.2d at 950-51 (citing <em>Greene, </em>489 F.2d at 1168-69).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\u00b668 In my view, and as we have held, the felony murder rule is a specific statute applying to the homicide case involving a predicate felony, and fulfills special societal interests. This legislative intent has not been rejected by the enactment of \u00a7\u00a7 46-1-202(9) and 46-11-410, MCA. The Court\u2019s decision not only rejects legislative intent and our precedent, it defies any common sense-that Russell could stab one victim and kill another but be limited to only one sentence. I could not be more confident that the Legislature did not intend this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">\u00b669 In response to this dissent, the Court fesses up. It admits that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>held to the contrary in <em>Close, </em>but then takes drastic action-overruling Ci\u00f3se \u2014 necessary to support its holding here, concluding that \u201c[t]he basic premise of the <em>Close </em>rationale is false.\u201d Thus, the Court removes the \u201cstupefying leap\u201d from its opinion by overruling precedent to fill the gap. What remains stupefying is that the Court would overrule longstanding precedent without the issue being raised, briefed, or argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">\u00b670 Reasoning that because \u201ca defendant cannot commit the offense of felony homicide without committing a predicate felony offense,\u201d the Court holds, obliquely, that the predicate offense must <em>always </em>merge with the homicide and under no circumstances can a defendant be punished for both crimes. It blames the prosecutor for this predicament, and suggests that Russell should have been charged with aggravated assault as a stand-alone charge, and robbery should have been used as the predicate offense. Of course, under the Court\u2019s approach, Russell could never be punished for the robbery, but more to the point, the prosecution should not be faced with this choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\u00b671 We have explained all of this before, which the Court simply ignores. \u201cThe test for determining what constitutes the same offense <em>differs </em>depending on whether the case involves multiple prosecutions or multiple punishments imposed at a single prosecution ... Two statutory crimes that constitute \u2018the same offense\u2019 for purposes of multiple prosecutions do not necessarily constitute \u2018the same offense\u2019 for purposes of multiple punishments.\u201d <em>Close, </em>191 Mont. at 245, 623 P.2d at 949 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">\u00b672 Close was charged with deliberate homicide, aggravated kidnapping, and robbery in a single prosecution. \u201cThe issue, then, is not one of multiple prosecutions but of multiple punishments. The issue is whether, under Montana\u2019s statutory scheme, a defendant may be punished for both felony homicide and the underlying felony.\u201d <em>Close, </em>191 Mont. at 245-46, 623 P.2d at 949. In determining that multiple punishments were indeed permissible, the Court determined that felony murder was a unique creation-it operated uniquely to avoid merger, serving \u201ca wholly different societal interest.\u201d Today, the Court simply discards the unique interest served by the felony murder rule in favor of theoretical consistency: it demands that felony murder be subjected to general merger rules, necessarily holding that felony murder is no longer a unique mechanism under our law with regard to multiple punishments. The Court offers no explanation for why the unique societal purposes, which we have explained are served by the felony murder statute, must be discarded in favor of generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>applicable merger provisions. It offers nothing which would indicate that such general provisions were intended to obstruct the operation of the felony murder statute, which is grounded in hundreds of years of common law. The loser is justice: \u201cIf a defendant wants to commit a felony, he must pay a price. If a defendant wants to commit murder in addition to the felony or in the course of committing another felony, he must pay a higher price.\u201d <em>Close, </em>191 Mont. at 249, 623 P.2d at 950.</p>\n<p id=\"AJl\">\u00b673 Turning likewise briefly to the issue actually raised, the constitutional prohibition on double jeopardy, Russell argues that we, without saying so, overruled <em>Close </em>and rejected consideration of legislative intent, and likewise endorsed expansive double jeopardy principles which require reversal, in <em>State v. Guillaume, </em>1999 MT 29, 293 Mont. 224, 975 P.2d 312. However, this argument ignores that <em>Close </em>addressed the precise double jeopardy question before us here-whether a defendant can be convicted and punished for both felony murder and the underlying felony-while the concern addressed by the deeply divided Court in <em>Guillaume </em>was a sentencing enhancement statute. We should be careful about quickly discarding <em>Close.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">\u00b674 While I would agree that legislative intent does not constrain the protections of the Constitution, that does not mean that legislative intent is completely irrelevant when applying constitutional protections. Rather, we should look at the purposes the Legislature intended and then determine whether those purposes are permissible under and consistent with constitutional protections. This was the approach we took in <em>Burkhart, </em>decided after <em>Guillaume, </em>and is the appropriate approach here. <em>See Burkhart, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 42-45. In <em>Burkhart, </em>we considered whether due process was violated by the felony murder statute when the underlying felony is integral to the homicide, and concluded that it was not. <em>Burkhart, </em>\u00b6 38. We further concluded, on the basis of legislative intent, that the felony murder rule did not violate due process by relieving the State from proving intent to kill in that case. <em>Burkhart, </em>\u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">\u00b675 It is important to note that, unlike the charges here, Burkhart was not charged separately with the underlying felony of aggravated assault, and we did not consider whether separate charging or separate punishment was permissible pursuant to the double jeopardy clause. Additionally, Burkhart was charged with felony murder on the basis of assault and homicide of the same victim. We did not consider in <em>Burkhart </em>the factual premise presented today where the victim of the predicate felony is different than the victim of the felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>\u00b676 That is a critical point. Irrespective of whether we consider legislative intent and the unique nature of the felony murder statute, to hold that the State violated Russell\u2019s right against double jeopardy would produce a result disconnected from the facts of this case. Simply put, Russell committed two crimes-he killed Gewanski and assaulted Wallin with a weapon. Russell was then charged with and convicted of two crimes-felony murder of Gewanski and aggravated assault of Wallin. If we accept Russell\u2019s argument that Russell cannot be punished for both, the outcome is clear: Russell would receive a free pass for assault with a knife upon Wallin. \u201cDouble jeopardy exemplifies the legal and moral concept that no person should suffer twice for a single act.\u201d <em>Guillaume, </em>\u00b6 17. However, Russell committed two acts and would suffer only once. Such a result is antithetical to the legal and moral concepts behind double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\u00b677 Other jurisdictions have noted this precise distinction-multiple victims. The Supreme Court of Georgia distinguished between felony murder involving a single victim and felony murder involving multiple victims in <em>Walker v. State, </em>327 S.E.2d 475, 479 (Ga. 1985). Where \u201cthe underlying felony charged in one count of the indictment is committed upon one victim and the ... felony murder charged in another count of the indictment is committed upon another person ... the underlying felony does not merge with the felony murder conviction.\u201d <em>Satterfield v. State, </em>285 S.E.2d 3, 5 (Ga. 1981). The State of Washington has concluded that where the predicate offense is perpetrated against one victim and the felony murder against another, the predicate felony does not merge with the felony murder and punishment for both does not violate double jeopardy-even where the predicate offense, as here, is aggravated assault. <em>State v. McJimpson, </em>901 P.2d 354, 356-57 (Wash. App. 1995). This is because offenses involving different victims but arising from the same act or transaction are not the same in law and fact. <em>McJimpson, </em>901 P.2d at 356. Dual victims demand dual punishments and such punishments do not violate double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"AdS\">\u00b678 On this clear authority, I would affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b341-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY joins the dissent of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
