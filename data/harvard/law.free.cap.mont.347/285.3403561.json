We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court properly deny Russette\u2019s motion to suppress evidence of an anonymous tip?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">\u00b64 <em>Did the District Court improperly impose certain conditions as part of Russette\u2019s sentence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">\u00b65 <em>Did the District Court lack the authority to impose a prosecution fee and a victim\u2019s fee as part of Russette\u2019s sentence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">\u00b66 An anonymous tipster contacted the Hill County Sheriffs Office on March 17,2006. The caller alleged that Russette had five pounds of methamphetamine concealed in a black pickup truck owned by Russette. Agent Pete Federspiel, an officer with the Hill County Sheriffs Office and a member of the Tri-Agency Drug Task Force, received the tip. Agent Federspiel verified that Russette commonly drove a black pickup. Agent Federspiel also verified that Russette had an outstanding warrant for a misdemeanor contempt of court out of the Hill County Justice Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">\u00b67 Agent Federspiel and three other agents attempted to find Russette. The agents rode in a single vehicle and drove near the towns of Box Elder and Big Sandy looking for Russette. The agents had turned around in the parking lot of the D&amp;L Bar just outside of Box Elder when they saw Russette pulling into the parking lot in a black pickup. The agents pulled in behind Russette. Russette had gotten out of his truck and had started walking to the bar by the time the agents had parked their vehicle. Russette quickened his pace when he saw the agents pull in behind his truck. Russette looked over his shoulder repeatedly and hurried into the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-13\">\u00b68 Agent Federspiel and Agent Dean Wilkinson followed Russette into the bar. Agent Federspiel entered the bar first and saw Russette standing behind a row of gambling machines. Agent Federspiel could not see Russette\u2019s hands, but he could see Russette\u2019s shoulders and his arms from the elbow up. Agent Federspiel saw Russette\u2019s arm moving \u201cas though he was removing something from his [pants] pocket.\u201d Agent Federspiel came around the machines. Agent Federspiel identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>himself and informed Russette that he had an outstanding warrant for his arrest. Agent Federspiel arrested Russette and placed him in handcuffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">\u00b69 Agent Federspiel directed Agent Wilkinson to check the area where Russette had been standing to see if Russette had removed something from his pocket. Agent Federspiel moved Russette outside of the bar while Agent Wilkinson began searching near the gambling machines. Russette asked Agent Federspiel as they left the bar if Agent Federspiel \u201cthought [you] had the mother lode?\u201d Agent Federspiel replied, \u2018You never know.\u201d Russette said, \u2018You got a dry run.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u00b610 Agent Wilkinson found a small baggie that contained white powder and an empty sandwich bag where Russette had been standing inside the bar. Agent Wilkinson relayed this information to Agent Federspiel, who then informed Russette that he would be charged with drug possession. Russette said to Agent Federspiel, \u201cAnyone could have dropped that.\u201d The agents later confirmed that the baggie contained .35 grams of methamphetamine, worth approximately $50.</p>\n<p id=\"A1q\">\u00b611 The agents obtained a search warrant to search the black pickup that Russette had driven into the parking lot of the bar. The agents discovered several marijuana roaches, a glass pipe with a white residue in its bowl, a box of sandwich bags, and a digital scale in the pickup. The State charged Russette with felony possession of a dangerous drug for the methamphetamine and misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia for the items found in the pickup.</p>\n<p id=\"AC5\">\u00b612 Russette filed a motion in limine on the morning of his trial to preclude the State from presenting any evidence concerning the anonymous tip received by Agent Federspiel. The parties argued the motion before the District Court. The court allowed the State to present evidence that Agent Federspiel had received an anonymous tip that Russette had methamphetamine. The court ordered the State to present no evidence concerning the amount of methamphetamine that Russette possessed as alleged in the anonymous tip.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">\u00b613 The jury convicted Russette on both charges. The pre-sentence report documented Russette\u2019s history of chemical use and revealed that Russette has used a variety of drugs. Russette admitted that he suffers marital problems associated with his use of alcohol and drugs. The PSI noted that Russette previously had received a three year deferred imposition of sentence for a felony conviction for the sale of dangerous drugs. Russette initiated a probation violation report for this offense by absconding supervision and by failing to make payments on restitution, fines, and fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>\u00b614 The District Court sentenced Russette to four years in the Montana State Prison with the entire term suspended and subject to conditions. The conditions prohibited Russette from possessing alcohol or entering places where alcohol constitutes the chief item of sale, from possessing a police scanner, and from entering casinos. The sentence also included a condition requiring Russette to receive permission from his probation officer before obtaining financing for a vehicle, property, or business. Russette\u2019s sentence also included \u201cprosecution\u201d and \u201cvictim\u2019s\u201d fees. Russette did not object to these conditions or fees at sentencing. Russette now appeals his conviction and the sentencing conditions and fees imposed by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">\u00b615 We review a district court\u2019s rulings on the admissibility of evidence for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. </em>Paoni, 2006 MT 26, \u00b6 13, 331 Mont. 86, \u00b6 13, 128 P.3d 1040, \u00b6 13. The determination of the relevancy and admissibility of evidence lies in the sound discretion of the trial judge, and we will not overturn that determination without a showing of an abuse of discretion. <em>Paoni, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ace\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">\u00b616 <em>Did the District Court properly deny Russette\u2019s motion to suppress evidence of an anonymous tip?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">\u00b617 Russette asserts that the District Court improperly admitted the anonymous tip. Russette argues that the tip constituted inadmissible hearsay and that the tip\u2019s admission into evidence violated his right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment as construed in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S. Ct. 1354 (2004). The State argues that Russette waived the constitutional confrontation objection by failing to raise it before the District Court. The State also argues that the tip did not constitute hearsay because the State did not intend to use the tip to prove that Russette possessed drugs. The State contends that the court properly admitted the tip for the purpose of explaining the agents\u2019 pursuit of Russette. The State argues in the alternative that the admission of the tip constituted harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">\u00b618 A defendant generally fails to preserve an objection for appellate review when the defendant fails to make a contemporaneous objection to an alleged error in the trial court. <em>Paoni, </em>\u00b6 16. A party\u2019s assertion of error \u201cmust stand or fall on the ground\u201d asserted before the trial court. <em>Paoni, </em>\u00b6 29 (citation omitted). A defendant preserves an issue for appeal in the absence of an objection at trial when the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>files a motion \u201csufficiently specific to preserve the issue for appeal.\u201d <em>Paoni, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">\u00b619 Russette filed a motion in limine to suppress the admission of the anonymous tip into evidence. The State asserted at the hearing before trial that the tip constituted non-hearsay evidence because the State allegedly sought to introduce the tip merely to explain why Agent Federspiel went looking for Russette. Russette\u2019s counsel stated, \u201cthe evidence I have doesn\u2019t even disclose whether the tip was anonymous or not, so we don\u2019t have any opportunity to question who may have made that tip. There is no disclosure whether the tip was known to them, and I think that kind of hearsay is clearly inadmissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\u00b620 Russette and the State disagree over whether the statement made by Russette\u2019s counsel preserved for appeal Russette\u2019s argument with regard to his constitutional right to confrontation. We note that a passing mention of the right to confrontation fails to preserve the right to raise the issue on appeal. <em>State v. Lawrence, </em>285 Mont. 140, 163, 948 P.2d 186, 200 (1997). We need not resolve this issue, however, or the merits of the State\u2019s argument that the evidence was admissible, as the State presented the jury with sufficient evidence independent of the anonymous tip to support Russette\u2019s conviction and to render the admission of the tip a harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">\u00b621 We adopted the \u201ccumulative evidence\u201d test for harmless error analysis for \u201ctrial\u201d errors in <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, \u00b6\u00b6 40-43, 306 Mont. 215, \u00b6\u00b6 40-43, 32 P.3d 735, \u00b6\u00b6 40-43. We stated in <em>Van Kirk </em>that under this test a demonstration that the fact-finder received admissible evidence that proved the same facts as the tainted evidence renders an error harmless. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 47. We added that the tainted evidence must not have contributed to the conviction when compared \u201cqualitatively\u201d with the admissible evidence. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">\u00b622 Counsel for the State indicated in her opening argument that agents had \u201creceived a report that the defendant was possessing dangerous drugs.\u201d Agent Federspiel testified that he \u201chad received a Crime Stopper tip that Lawrence Russette was in possession of methamphetamine ....\u201d The prosecutor asked Agent Federspiel if \u201cthe reporter [said] where the dangerous drugs were being possessed ....\u201d Agent Federspiel replied \u201cThey were in a black pickup that belonged to Mr. Russette.\u201d These statements represent the entirety of the State\u2019s references to the anonymous report that Russette possessed drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"AIz\">\u00b623 The bulk of the State\u2019s evidence that Russette possessed drugs consisted of testimony from Agent Federspiel and Agent Wilkinson and Russette\u2019s own statements and concessions. Agent Federspiel testified that he and other agents had pulled in behind Russette in the parking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>lot of the D&amp;L Bar. Russette moved rapidly toward the entrance of the bar after seeing the agents and repeatedly looked over his shoulder at the agents. Agent Federspiel entered the bar and saw Russette standing behind a row of gambling machines. Agent Federspiel saw Russette\u2019s arm moving \u201cas though he was removing something from his [pants] pocket.\u201d Agent Federspiel arrested Russette pursuant to the warrant and directed Agent Wilkinson to search the area where Russette had been standing. Agent Wilkinson found a baggie of methamphetamine and another sandwich bag where Russette had been standing. Russette asked Agent Federspiel as the agent moved him out of the bar if Agent Federspiel \u201cthought [you] had the mother lode.\u201d Agent Federspiel responded, \u201cYou never know.\u201d Russette stated, \u201cYou got a dry run.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">\u00b624 Agent Federspiel then informed Russette that the State would charge Russette with drug possession. Russette stated, \u201cAnyone could have dropped that.\u201d A search of the pickup that Russette commonly drove revealed marijuana roaches in the ash tray and a pipe with white residue. The truck also contained sandwich bags and a digital scale. Russette conceded at trial that he \u201chad drug paraphernalia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A9t\">\u00b625  We conclude that the testimony from Agent Federspiel and Agent Wilkinson, Russette\u2019s statements to Agent Federspiel, and Russette\u2019s concessions at trial, constituted sufficient admissible evidence independent of the anonymous tip to support the jury\u2019s conviction of Russette. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 47. We also conclude that the State\u2019s limited references to the allegedly tainted evidence qualitatively did not contribute to Russette\u2019s conviction. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\u00b626 <em>Did the District Court improperly impose certain conditions as part of Russette\u2019s sentence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">\u00b627 Russette argues that the District Court lacked authority to impose on his suspended sentence conditions that forbid his use of alcohol, prohibit him from possessing a police scanner, prohibit him from entering casinos or gambling, and require him to obtain permission from his probation officer before financing a vehicle, property, or engaging in business. Russette contends that the restrictions have no nexus to his convictions for the possession of dangerous drugs and drug paraphernalia. The State first asserts that Russette cannot appeal his sentencing conditions because he failed to object to the conditions before the District Court. The State also argues that the conditions sufficiently relate to Russette and serve to rehabilitate him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>and to protect society.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">\u00b628 Russette argues that this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>State v. Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. 338, 602 P.2d 997 (1979) and <em>State v. Ommundson, </em>1999 MT 16, 293 Mont. 133, 974 P.2d 620, permit him to object to certain conditions of his sentence for the first time on appeal. Our decision in <em>Lenihan </em>confirmed that this Court may review a sentence challenged for the first time on appeal \u201cif it is alleged that such sentence is illegal or exceeds statutory <em>mandates...\u201d Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. at 343, 602 P.2d at 1000. We determined in <em>Ommundson </em>that a district court possesses the statutory authority to impose a condition on a sentence only so far as the condition has some correlation or connection to the underlying offense. <em>Ommundson, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\u00b629  Russette argues that certain conditions of his sentence lack the necessary nexus to his offense under <em>Ommundson, </em>and, therefore, may be challenged for the first time on appeal pursuant to the rule set forth in <em>Lenihan. </em>We clarified recently, however, in <em>State v. Stiles, </em>2008 MT 390, \u00b6 14, 347 Mont. 95, \u00b6 14, 197 P.3d 966, \u00b6 14, that the probation conditions that Russette challenges fall within the District Court\u2019s discretion to impose reasonable conditions as set forth in \u00a7 46-18-201(4)(o), MCA, and \u00a7 46-18-202(1)(f), MCA. The District Court\u2019s imposition of these probation conditions may have been \u201cobjectionable,\u201d but did not constitute an illegal sentence. Russette\u2019s failure to challenge these conditions before the District Court waived the issue for appeal. <em>Stiles, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">\u00b630 <em>Did the District Court lack the authority to impose a prosecution fee and a victim\u2019s fee as part of Russette\u2019s sentence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">\u00b631 Russette argues that the District Court improperly included a prosecution fee and a victim\u2019s fee as conditions on his suspended sentence. The State concedes that the District Court lacked the authority in this case to impose the prosecution fee and the victim\u2019s fee and agrees that the fees should be stricken. We remand to the District Court for the sole purpose of removing the prosecution and victim\u2019s fees from Russette\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">\u00b632 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b311-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
