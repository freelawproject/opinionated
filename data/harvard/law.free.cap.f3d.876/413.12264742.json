Harris, 774 F.3d 803 (2d Cir. 2014), is assumed. This case -involves defamation claims -brought by Appellant Sheldon Adel-son against Appellees National. Jewish Democratic Council,, its Chair, Marc Stanley, and its President and CEO, David Harris. Appellant\u2019s claim of defamation is based on Appellees\u2019 2012 online petition urging then presidential candidate Mitt Romney to reject Appellant\u2019s financial contributions because Appellant\u2019s money came from his Chinese casinos and,was \u201cdirty\u201d and \u201ctainted,\u201d and because Appellant \u201c\u2019personally approved\u2019 of prostitution in his [Chinese] casinos.\u201d J,A. 38 (emphasis omitted). Using a hyperlink, the petition attributed these \u201cfacts\u201d to an Associated Press (\u201cAP\u201d) story. Id,</p> <p id=\"b440-11\" pgmap=\"440\">The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed Appellant\u2019s action under Rule 12(b)(6) and applied the Nevada-anti-SLAPP statute to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs to Appel-lees. See Adelson v. Harris, 973 F.Supp.2d 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). On appeal, we affirmed the district court in part, but certified two questions to the Nevada Supreme Court: \u25a0 '</p> <blockquote id=\"ADj\" pgmap=\"440\">(1) whether a hyperlink to source mate\u25a0rial about, judicial proceedings suffices in an'online petition for purposes of applying Nevada\u2019s common- law fair report privilege; and (2) whether- the -Nevada anti-SLAPP statute, as it existed prior to the amendments in 2013, covered speech that seeks to influence an election but that is not addressed to a government agency.</blockquote> <p id=\"b440-13\" pgmap=\"440\">Adelson, 774 F.3d at 811.</p> <p id=\"b440-14\" pgmap=\"440\">The Nevada Supreme Court accepted the certified questions in 2015, and on September 27, 2017, issued its answers. Adelson v. Harris, 402 P.3d 665 (Nev. 2017). As to the first question, the court held that \u201ca hyperlink to source material about a judicial proceeding may suffice as a report within the common law fair report privilege,\u201d and that \u201cthe online petition, as it existed when [Appellant\u2019s] complaint was filed, fell within the purview of Nevada\u2019s fair report privilege.\u201d Id. at 666, 670.</p> <p id=\"b440-15\" pgmap=\"440(44) 441(38)\">As to the second question, the court directed us to its recently issued opinion Delucchi v. Songer, 396 P.3d 826 (Nev. 2017), and explained that, pursuant to De-lucchi, Nevada\u2019s anti-SLAPP statute covers \u201cCommunication .that is aimed at procuring any governmental or electoral action, result or outcome .., which is truthful or is made without knowledge of its falsehood, even if that communication was not addressed to a government agency.\u201d Id. at 666, 670 (internal' quotation marks and citations omitted).</p> <p id=\"b441-5\" pgmap=\"441\">Following receipt of the Nevada' Supreme Court\u2019s response, we ordered the parties to submit letter briefs addressing the import of that response to the resolution of this appeal. In response, Appellant urged us to revive his defamation claim, arguing (1) that his claim also rests on the non-privileged statement that, he \u201cused funds from prostitution to finance his campaign contributions,\u201d D.I. 177 at 3-6 (emphasis omitted); (2) that the district court erred in .holding, as a matter of law, that Appellees made the statements without knowledge of their falsehood; and (3), that he should have been allowed additional discovery on the anti-SLAPP statute\u2019s scienter requirement.</p> <p id=\"b441-6\" pgmap=\"441\">The district court, applying Nevada law, dismissed Appellant\u2019s claim because Appel-lees\u2019 statements rested in part on opinion and were otherwise protected by the fair report privilege. Adelson, 973 F.Supp.2d at 471. We have already affirmed that ruling as it pertained to statements of opinion. Adelson, 774 F.3d at 807.</p> <p id=\"b441-7\" pgmap=\"441\"> Nevada law grants \u201cabsolute immunity from defamation ... to the news media and the general public to report newsworthy events in judicial proceedings.\u201d Sahara Gaming Corp. v. Culinary Workers Union Local 226, 115 Nev. 212, 215, 984 P.2d 164 (1999). The contested allegations\u2014that Appellant personally, approved of prostitution\u2014came from an AP story, describing a sworn declaration made in a lawsuit by an ex-employee against Appellant\u2019s company. . In our prior opinion, we explained that these statements, \u201cif unprivileged,\u201d may be actionable. Adelson, 774 F.3d at 807. So we asked the Nevada Supreme Court, by certification, whether the hyperlinks used in the petition sufficiently attributed the statements to the AP story to invoke the fair report privilege. See id. at 808. That court\u2019s affirmative response resolves the issue. The fair report privilege applies and the district court\u2019s dismissal of Appellant\u2019s defamation claim was correct.</p> <p id=\"acv-dedup-0\" pgmap=\"441\">The district court also applied Nevada\u2019s anti-SLAPP statute to Appellant\u2019s case. Appellant argues that the district court erred in its conclusion that, as a matter of law, the challenged statements were made \u201cwithout knowledge'of falsehood,\u201d as required by the statute. D.I. 177 at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted). We did not explicitly address this ruling in our prior opinion. But, when we explained that the district court properly exercised its discretion in deciding not to allow discovery on the topic, we implicitly approved' of the district court\u2019s determination that, as a matter of law, Appellees acted in good faith. See Adelson, 774 F.3d at 809 (\u201c[T]he discovery sought was not reasonably calculated to create a material issue of fact ....\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b441-10\" pgmap=\"441\"> In any event,' we agree with the district court: Appellant' failed to allege \u201cknowledge of falsity, much less facts to support such a conclusion.\u201d Adelson, 973 F.Supp.2d at 503. Thus, we affirm both the district court\u2019s denial of Appellant\u2019s request for additional discovery and- the district court\u2019s application of the anti-SLAPP statute to this case. ,</p> <p id=\"b441-11\" pgmap=\"441\">For these reasons, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Appellant\u2019s., case is AFFIRMED.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
