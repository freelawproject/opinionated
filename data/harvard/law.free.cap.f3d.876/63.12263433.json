The Supreme Court has instructed that in an execution proceeding concerning a foreign sovereign\u2019s assets, any defense predicated on foreign sovereign immunity must rise or fall on the text of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (\u201cFSIA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1330, 1602 et seq. See Republic of Argentina v. NML Capital, Ltd., \u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2250, 2256, 189 L.Ed.2d 234 (2014). In the same decision, the Court explicitly abrogated decades .of pre-existing sovereign immunity common law in light of its background understanding that most courts lack jurisdiction to reach extraterritorial assets in any event. See id. at 2257. But that is not so in New York.</p> <p id=\"b95-19\" pgmap=\"95(165) 96(20)\">The plaintiffs-appellants, judgment creditors of Iran and Tran\u2019s Ministry of Intelligence and Security (\u201cMOIS\u201d), obtained federal-court judgments against Iran and MOIS awarding the plaintiffs billions of dollars in compensatory damages. They now seek to enforce their judgments in part by executing on $1.68 billion in bond proceeds allegedly owned by Bank Marka-zi (\u201cMarkazi\u201d), Iran\u2019s central bank. The plaintiffs allege.that those bond proceeds were processed by and through a global chain of banks, specifically by Clearstream Banking, S.A. (\u201cClearstream\u201d) through JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\u201cJPMor-gan\u201d), in the name of Banca UBAE, S.p.A. (\u201cUBAE\u201d), on behalf of Markazi (collectively, \u201cthe defendants\u201d or \u201cthe defendant banks\u201d). The plaintiffs further allege that the bond proceeds are denominated as United States dollars (\u201cUSD\u201d) and held in cash in Clearstream\u2019s account at JPMor-gan in New York City, rendering the assets subject to this Court\u2019s jurisdiction and a turnover order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiffs also asserted several related non-turnover claims against the defendant banks, alleging primarily that the defendants effected -the foregoing transactions by means of fraudulent \u25a0 conveyances in violation of state law.</p> <p id=\"b96-4\" pgmap=\"96\">The defendant banks respond that there is no cash to turn over: The bond proceeds are in fact recorded as book entries made in Clearstream\u2019s Luxembourg offices and reflected as a positive account balance showing a right to payment owed by Clear stream to Markazi through UBAE. The defendants argue that<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> this fact is fatal to the plaintiffs\u2019 turnover claims because federal courts lack jurisdiction to order the turnover of a foreign sovereign\u2019s extraterritorial assets. Lastly, the defendants posit that the plaintiffs released their non-turnover claims in separate settlement agreements reached - between several of the plaintiffs, on the one hand, and ,Clear-, stream or UBAE, on the other.</p> <p id=\"b96-5\" pgmap=\"96\">In a single order, the- district court (Katherine B. Forrest, Judge) granted the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss and for partial summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all claims in dispute. We affirm that decision in part, vacate it in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p> <p id=\"b96-6\" pgmap=\"96\">BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"b96-7\" pgmap=\"96\">The' plaintiffs-appellants are, or represent persons who have been adjudicated in a federal court to be, victims of Iranian-sponsored terrorism. They obtained judgments from- the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against Iran and 'MOIS pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 1605(a)(7) and 1605A of the FSIA, and were awarded a total of approximately $3,8 billion in compensatory damages. Confidential Appendix (\u201cC.A.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) at 679-81: The plaintiffs have since registered their-judgments with the United States District Court\u2018for the Southern-District of New York, which enables them to seek partial enforcement of their judgments by obtaining an order compelling the turnover of approximately $1.68 billion in bond proceeds allegedly owned by Iran\u2019s central bank, and held as cash in New York City. The plaintiffs\u2019 claims target four banks that were allegedly involved in processing those bond proceeds: JPMor-gan, a financial institution organized under the laws of New York, id. at 679; Markazi, Iran\u2019s central bank, id. at 677; UBAE, an Italian bank that engaged in transactions on behalf of Iran, id. at 678;' and Clear-stream, a Luxembourg bank with which Markazi and UBAE opened customer accounts, id.</p> <p id=\"b96-10\" pgmap=\"96\">The plaintiffs contend that through a series of fraudulent transactions, these banks managed to process billions of dollars in bond proceeds ultimately owed to Markazi. According to the plaintiffs, -the fruit of those transactions is a pool of cash traceable to the Markazi-owned bond proceeds and held by Clearstream at JPMor-gan in New York City. Because much of this dispute turns on the, nature and location of the bond proceeds, we review the processing of those assets, and previous attempts to obtain turnover of similar assets, in some detail.</p> <p id=\"b96-11\" pgmap=\"96\">2. Processing Markazi \u215b Bonds</p> <p id=\"b96-12\" pgmap=\"96(30) 97(100)\">Like many large financial institutions, Markazi \"invests- in foreign sovereign bonds. Id. at 701. Many of the bonds purchased by Markazi were issued pursuant to\u2019prospectuses that require the purchaser to receive. interest and redemption payments in New York State. Id. at 555. Mar-kazi has long engaged Clearstream, a Luxembourg bank that specializes in \u201cthe settlement and custody of internationally traded bonds and equities,\u201d id. at 678, to facilitate that process. Clearstream uses correspondent accounts at banks in New York State, including JPMorgan and Citibank, N.A. (\u201cCitibank\u201d), to receive bond proceeds on behalf of its customers, including Markazi. Id. at 690. As Clear-stream receives these cash payments in New York, it credits customer accounts based in Luxembourg with an equivalent positive amount. Id. at 685.</p> <p id=\"b97-5\" pgmap=\"97\">In 1994, Markazi opened a direct account, with Clearstream in Luxembourg. Id. at 117-18. Thereafter, Clearstream received bond payments into its New York-based JPMorgan correspondent account on behalf of Markazi; Clearstream then credited Markazi\u2019s account in Luxembourg with a corresponding right to payment. In 2008, apparently because of increasing scrutiny of Iranian financial transactions, Markazi stopped processing its bond proceeds through Clearstream directly and instead began doing so through an intermediary bank: UBAE. Id. at 699-700. In January 2008, UBAE opened a customer account with Clearstream in Luxembourg\u2014account number 13061. Id. at 118\u2014 19. Shortly thereafter, Markazi arranged for Clearstream to transfer the Markazi account balance at Clearstream in Luxembourg to the UBAE account. Id. at 118, 434.</p> <p id=\"b97-6\" pgmap=\"97\">Clearstream continued to receive bond proceeds in New York on behalf of Marka-zi, but pursuant to the terms of the documentation directing the Markazi account transfer, Clearstream credited UBAE. account number 13061 with a corresponding right to payment. Id. at 701. In June 2008, apparently due to increasing attention, Clearstream notified UBAE that it had blocked UBAE account number, 13061 and transferred the balance of that account to a \u201csundry blocked account\u201d\u2014accqunt number 13675. Id. at 683-84. That account, which remains blocked, is at the center of the present dispute.</p> <p id=\"b97-9\" pgmap=\"97\">2. Peterson I</p> <p id=\"b97-10\" pgmap=\"97\">Clearstream has previously been the focus of an attempt by judgment creditors of Iran to obtain turnover of Markazi-linked assets. See generally Peterson v. Islamic Republic of Iran, No. 10-cv-4518-KBF, 2013 WL 1155576, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40470 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 13, 2013) (\u201cPeterson I\u201d), aff'd, 758 F.3d 185 (2d Cir. 2014). Many, but not all, of the plaintiffs in, the case at bar attempted in an earlier litigation to enforce part of their judgments by executing against approximately $2 billion in Markazi-owned bond proceeds allegedly held by Clearstream at Citibank in New York City. See C.A. at 671. Those plaintiffs successfully obtained a judgment from the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Katherine B. Forrest, Judge) ordering, the turnover of $1.75 billion in cash denominated in USD and held in New York City by Clearstream at Citibank on behalf of Markazi and UBAE. Peterson I, 2013 WL 1155576, at *2, *35, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40470. The district court\u2019s decision in that case did not address the plaintiffs\u2019 related fraudulent-conveyance claims concerning an additional $250 million in bond proceeds allegedly transferred by Markazi and UBAE to UBAE\u2019s customer account at Clearstream in Luxembourg. See id. at *3-4, *28 n.14, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40470, at *46-48, *117 n.15.</p> <p id=\"b97-11\" pgmap=\"97(17) 98(35)\">While Markazi unsuccessfully appealed the district court\u2019s turnover order in Peterson I,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Clearstream and UBAE reached separate settlement agreements with the plaintiffs to resolve not only the Peterson I appeal but also the plaintiffs\u2019 then-pending fraudulent-conveyance claims. C.A. at 900-45 (Clearstream settlement agreement); id. at 1646-62 (UBAE settlement agreement).</p> <p id=\"b98-4\" pgmap=\"98\">Of relevance here, the Clearstream settlement agreement released Clearstream from \u201cany and all past, present or future claims or causes of action ... whether direct or indirect\u201d relating to:</p> <blockquote id=\"AA\" pgmap=\"98\">any account maintained at Clearstream ... by or in the name of or under the control of any Iranian Entity ... or any account maintained at Clearstream or at any Clearstream Affiliate by or in the name of or under the control of UBAE, including, but not limited to, accounts numbered ... 13061 ...

Id. at 1648. The agreement defined \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 Direct Claims\u201d as those brought in Peterson I \u201cfor damages against UBAE with regard to certain assets transferred prior to the initiation of the [t]umover [a]ction and valued at approximately $250,000,000.00 ... including, but not limited to, claims for fraudulent conveyance, tortious interference with the collection of a money judgment, and prima facie tort.\u201d Id. at 1646.</p> <p id=\"b99-5\" pgmap=\"99\">The UBAE settlement agreement also contained a carve-out provision by which the \u201c[plaintiffs agree[d] that any future claim against UBAE for the Remaining Assets shall be limited to turnover only\u201d; the plaintiffs \u201cwaive[d] all other claims against UBAE for any damages regarding the Remaining Assets whether arising in contract, tort, equity, or otherwise.\u201d Id. at 1648. The agreement defined \u201cRemaining Assets\u201d as \u201cassets [that] remain in. an account at Clearstreamf ] [in] a UBAE customer account, that are beneficially owned by Bank Markazi.\u201d Id. at 1647.</p> <p id=\"b99-6\" pgmap=\"99\">3. Procedural History</p> <p id=\"b99-7\" pgmap=\"99\">On December 30, 2013, the plaintiffs filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Clearstream held an additional $2.5 billion in Markazi-owned bond proceeds not at issue in Peterson I. See id. at 3, 28. On April 25, 2014, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint specifically alleging that UBAE\u2019,s \u201cblocked sundry account\u201d at Clearstream reflected a balance of approximately $1.68 billion, and that Clearstream held a corresponding amount of cash at JPMorgan in New York City. Id. at 687. The amended complaint named Iran, Clearstream, JPMorgan, Markazi, and UBAE as defendants, seeking: (1) declaratory relief identifying Mar-kazi as the beneficial owner of the assets at issue, id. at 720-21; (2) rescission of fraudulent conveyances under New York Debtor and Creditor Law (\u201cDCL\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 273-a, 276(a),. against Iran, Markazi, Clear-stream, and UBAE, id. at 721-25; (3) turnover of the $1.68 billion in assets at issue under New York Civil Practice Law and Rules (\u201cC.P.L.R.\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 5225, 5227 and \u00a7 201(a) of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (\u201cTRIA\u201d), against Clearstream, Iran, JPMorgan, Markazi, and UBAE, id. at 725-27; (4) rescission of fraudulent conveyances under DCL \u00a7\u00a7 273-a, 276, 278 and common law, against Clearstream and Markazi, id. at 728-29; and (5) unspecified equitable relief against each defendant, id. at 729.</p> <p id=\"b99-9\" pgmap=\"99\">On April 9, 2014, the district court (Katherine B. Forrest, Judge) granted an ex parte application for an order directing the clerk of the district court to issue a writ of execution with respect to any Mar-kazi-owned property in the possession of JPMorgan. Id. at 104-05. The district court thereafter held a hearing to address the defendants\u2019 argument that the writ was improper because the Clearstream correspondent account at JPMorgan contains \u201cnothing ... except cash, and the cash turns over in billions of dollars every day, so there\u2019s no possibility the cash in the account can be identified to any defendant,\u201d including Markazi. Id. at 792. The district court thereupon vacated the order issuing the writ. Id. at 793, 800.</p> <p id=\"b99-10\" pgmap=\"99(115) 100(13)\">The plaintiffs moved to reinstate the order and the defendants responded with various motions seeking dismissal of the amended complaint. Clearstream moved to dismiss on the ground that the assets were located in Luxembourg, and therefore immune from execution under the FSIA. Clearstream also argued that the plaintiffs released all non-turnover claims against Clearstream under their settlement agreement. Markazi moved to dismiss on similar jurisdictional grounds. JPMorgan moved for partial summary judgment on the plaintiffs\u2019 turnover claims on the ground that it possessed no assets owned by Mar-kazi. Finally, UBAE moved to dismiss for want of subject-matter jurisdiction, and for partial summary judgment on the plaintiffs\u2019 non-turnover claims on the ground that, those claims had been released by the UBAE settlement agreement. . -</p> <p id=\"b100-4\" pgmap=\"100\">The parties\u2019 motions were accompanied by a voluminous record.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Among the documents before the district court was a chart depicting a \u201cRecap of Total Debits [and] Credits\u201d in Clearstream\u2019s correspondent account at JPMorgan for each month over the four-year period that Clearstream processed the bond proceeds at issue. Id. at 1959. The chart indicates that the Clear-stream account at JPMorgan was both debited and credited many hundreds of billions of dollars each month. Moreover, the Clearstream: correspondent account' at JPMorgan frequently posted a negative balance. Id. JPMorgan \u25a0 submitted, inter alia, two declarations prepared by Gauthier Jonckheere, id. at 1862-68, 2533-43, a JPMorgan vice president and \u201crelationship manager[]\u201d for the Clearstream account, id. at 1862. Jonckheere stated that Clear-stream\u2019s correspondent account at JPMor-gan is an \u201coperating account\u201d that processes \u201chundreds of bond-related payments each day.\u201d Id. at 1863. Because this is a general operating account, indeed Clear-stream\u2019s only account at JPMorgan, \u201cthe account\u2019s balance at both the beginning and the end of a given business day would ... be, if not $0, usually very low' .... During the day, the account balance would frequently be negative ....\u201d Id. at 1864. Jonckheere also asserted that \u201cClear-stream\u2019s operating account at [JPMorgan] ... holds no funds that are the property of Markazi\u201d because all bond \u201cproceeds have long since left Clearstream\u2019s operating account and are ' no longer maintained at [JPMorgan].\u201d Id. at 1865. Jonckheere added that Clearstream never segregated Markazi\u2019s bond proceeds from or within its general operating account. Id. at 2537-39.</p> <p id=\"b100-7\" pgmap=\"100\">Clearstream also submitted evidence concerning its JPMorgan correspondent account. For example, it produced a chart documenting its account balance at JPMorgan for each day in October 2012, during which the Clearstream correspondent account balance did not exceed $817,959,813.65, and was frequently negative. Id. at 1957. Clearstream also submitted a declaration executed by Mathias Pa-penfuB, then Head of Operations for Clearstream, id. at 1972, who 'stated: \u201cEach business day Clearstream uses U.S. dollars deposited in the JPMorgan [ale-count to pay its current U.S. .dollar obligations. Each business day, \u00e1pproximately $7-9 billion flows into the JPMorgan [account, and each business day a roughly equivalent sum flows out.\u201d Id. at 1973. PapenfuB explained that \u201c[t]he obligations credited to Clearstream by JPMorgan are booked as assets of Clearstream on Clear-stream\u2019s balance sheet pursuant to applicable' Luxembourg banking law and accounting rules.\u201d Id. \u201cWhen Clearstream receives a payment in the JPMorgan [account on its own security entitlements, Clearstream credits the account of any customers in Luxembourg holding security entitlements against Clearstream relating to a security with the same [identification number].\u201d Id. at 1974. PapenfuB corroborated Jonckheere\u2019s statement that \u201c[n]o transfer of cash [was] made,\u201d\u2018adding that \u201cCl\u00e9arstream does not hold funds in the JPMorgan [a]ccount in relation to specific U.S. dollar obligations to specific customers.\u201d Id. PapenfuB concluded that \u201cClear-stream never issued instructions to JPMorgan to transf\u00e9r any funds received in the JPMorgan [account to the [Clear-stream account iri Luxembourg], and no such transfers occurred.\u201d Id. at 1976.</p> <p id=\"b101-4\" pgmap=\"101\">The plaintiffs proffered the opinions of a putative financial-services expert, Peter U. Vinella, id. at 2385-440, who asserted that \u201cthe customary practice in international banking ... is for a, securities intermediary (such as Clearstream) to segregate its assets from customer assets generally. Thus, the [assets at issue] should , [not be] included as part of Clearstream\u2019s general operating funds and should remain in the USD JPMorgan [a]ccount,\u201d id. at 2389. Vinella also stated that \u201ceven if Clear-stream had failed and continues to fail to properly segregate the funds at issue in this matter in the [Clearstream account at JPMorgan] ..., the Markazi USD [b]alance ... still remains in the USD JPMor-gan [a]ccount.\u201d Id. Vinella attributed evidence that the Clearstream correspondent account often reflected a near-zero or negative end-of-day balance, see, e.g., id. at 1957, 1959, 2568-698, to industry-standard \u201c[s]weeps,\u201d whereby the account\u2019s funds were \u201cinvested [by JPMorgan] in very short-dated USD investments and subsequently redeposited in the ... JPMorgan [a]ccount the next day,\u201d id. at 2422.</p> <p id=\"b101-5\" pgmap=\"101\">On September 19, 2014, the district court heard arguments on the defendants\u2019 motions, focusing in particular on the nature and location of the assets at issue. See Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>) at 83-151. Although the district court appeared to harbor some doubt about the validity of Vinel-la\u2019s expert report, id. at 88, it stopped short of holding a hearing pursuant to Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), see J.A. at 105-06 (considering whether a Daubert hearing would be appropriate). Following oral argument, the district court issued an order declining to hold an evidentiary hearing on the nature and location of the assets at issue. See. id. at 153.</p> <p id=\"b101-8\" pgmap=\"101\">On February 20, 2015, the district court issued \u00e1 single opinion and order granting the defendants\u2019 various motions to dismiss and for partial summary judgment on all claims in dispute. Peterson v. Islamic Republic of Iran, No. 13-CV-9195-KBF, 2015 WL 731221, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20640 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 20, 2015) (\u201cPeterson II\u201d) (construing each motion \u00e1s one \u201cfor dismissal\u201d). The district court first dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 non-turnover claims against Clearstream, UBAE, and Markazi on the grbund that those claims had been released by the Clearstream and UBAE settlement agreements. Id. at *6, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20640, at *18-19 (dismissing the non-turnover claims against Clear-stream); id. at *9, 2015 U.S. Dist.

LEXIS 20640, at *30-31 (dismissing \u25a0 the non-turnover claims against Markazi as a \u201cbeneficiary\u201d of UBAE under the UBAE settlement).</p> <p id=\"b101-9\" pgmap=\"101\">The district court also dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 turnover claims on jurisdictional grounds, having found that the assets at issue are not in the United States:</p> <blockquote id=\"AZM\" pgmap=\"101\">[JPMorgan] received proceeds relating to the [assets], which it credited to a Clearstream. account at [JPMorgan]. Whether it should have or should not have, Clearstream in turn credited amounts attributable to the [assets] to the- UBAE/Bank Markazi account in Luxembourg. The [JPMorgan] records are clear that whatever happened to the proceeds, they are gone.</blockquote> <p id=\"b101-10\" pgmap=\"101(17) 102(108)\">Id. at *6, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20640, at *20. That finding \u25a0 sufficed to require dismissal of JPMorg\u00e1n from the lawsuit because JPMorgan \u201cdoes not have an account for UBAE or Bank Markazi.\u201d Id. at *10 n.17, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20640, at *33 n.17. Turning, to the remaining defendants, the district court concluded that Markazi\u2019s interest in book entries that Clearstream held in Luxembourg was not subject to turnover because the \u201cFSIA does not allow for attachment of property outside of the United States.\u201d Id. at *10, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20640, at *31. Therefore, because Markazi \u201cd[id] not maintain the assets that plaintiffs seek.in the United States,\u201d the district court held that it \u201clack[ed] subject-matter jurisdiction .\u2019\u2019.Id.</p> <p id=\"b102-4\" pgmap=\"102\">The plaintiffs appealed. With respect to the non-turnover claims, they argue that the Clearstream and UBAE settlement agreements: (1) do not apply to many of the plaintiffs, including several who were not party to Peterson I, Pis.\u2019 Br. at 23; and, in any event, (2) did not release the non-turnover claims against Clearstream, UBAE, or Markazi, id. at 24-33. With respect to the turnover claims, the plaintiffs argue that the court has subject-matter jurisdiction because the assets at issue are (1) cash holdings' located in New York, id. at 47-51; and (2) therefore subject to turnover under the TRIA, id. at 35-36, and the FSIA, id. at 61-66. The plaintiffs argue in the alternative that even assets \u201clocated abroad\u201d may be subject to turnover pursuant to the court\u2019s exercise of in personam jurisdiction over the holder of the assets.

The Non-Turnover Claims</p> <p id=\"b103-4\" pgmap=\"103\">The district court concluded that the Clearstream settlement agreement and the UBAE settlement agreement released the plaintiffs\u2019 non-turnover claims, including the fraudulent-conveyance claims, brought against those banks.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Peterson II, 2015 WL 731221, at *6, *9, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20640. The district court also determined that the UBAE settlement agreement released the plaintiffs\u2019 non-turnover claims against Markazi because Markazi was a \u201cbeneficiary\u201d of UBAE and, therefore, the UBAE settlement agreement. Id. at *10, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20640, at *30-31. We agree with respect to Clearstream, but not with respect to UBAE or Markazi.</p> <p id=\"b103-6\" pgmap=\"103(124) 104(65)\">Before turning to the substance of the settlement agreements, however, we address first the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that many of them, including several who were not plaintiffs in Peterson I, did not agree to the Clearstream or UBAE settlement agreements and are therefore not bound by their provisions. See Pls.\u2019 Br. at 23 (arguing with respect to Clearstream); Pis.\u2019 Reply at 13-14 (arguing with respect to UBAE). Noting that this argument was not timely raised, the district court dismissed it on the ground that ninety-three percent of the Peterson I plaintiffs had agreed to the Clearstream settlement agreement and that figure surpassed \u201cthe percentage ... needed ... in order for the [Clearstream] settlement [agreement] to become effective\u201d and binding on all of the plaintiffs. Peterson II, 2015 WL 731221, at *8, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20640.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, the district court noted that none of the Peterson I plaintiffs had declined to sign the agreement. Id. We disagree with the district court\u2019s analysis insofar as we conclude that the Clearstream settlement agreement is binding only with respect to those plaintiffs who were a party to Peterson I.</p> <p id=\"b104-4\" pgmap=\"104\">As an initial matter, the district court correctly observed that the plaintiffs belatedly raised this issue. See id., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20640, at *25-26. Only after argument on the parties\u2019 motions did plaintiffs\u2019 counsel notify the district court by letter that not all of the Peterson, II plaintiffs were parties to Peterson I, or therefore, the resultant Clearstream settlement agreement. J.A. at 154. Moreover, the plaintiffs\u2019 letter noted that many of the Peterson II plaintiffs who were Peterson I plaintiffs had not yet assented to the terms of the Clearstream settlement agreement. Id.</p> <p id=\"b104-5\" pgmap=\"104\"> \u201cAn argument raised for the first time on appeal .is typically forfeited.\u201d Katel Ltd. Liab. Co. v. AT &amp; T Corp., 607 F.3d 60, 68 (2d Cir. 2010). This rule applies even if a party ultimately presents an issue to the district court in an untimely manner, after briefing and argument on the merits is complete. See Corsair Special Situations Funds, L.P. v. Nat\u2019l Res., 595 Fed.Appx. 40, 43 (2d Cir. 2014) (summary order).</p> <p id=\"b104-6\" pgmap=\"104\"> Nonetheless, \u201c[t]he general rule that an appellate court will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal is not an absolute bar.\u201d Corporaci\u00f3n Mexicana de Mantenimiento Integral, S. de R.L. de C.V. v. Pemex-Exploraci\u00f3n y Producci\u00f3n, 832 F.3d 92, 101 n.3 (2d Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, a forfeited argument \u201cmay be reviewed for plain error.\u201d United States v. Gore, 154 F.3d 34, 41 (2d Cir. 1998). \u201cTo establish plain error, the [plaintiffs] must establish (1) error (2) that is plain and (3) affects substantial rights.\u201d United States v. Villafuerte, 502 F.3d 204, 209 (2d Cir. 2007). Then, \u201c[i]f the error meets these initial requirements, we ... must consider whether to exercise our discretion to correct it, which is appropriate only if the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).</p> <p id=\"b104-10\" pgmap=\"104\"> We must first determine whether the plaintiffs in fact forfeited, rather than waived, their argument concerning applicability of the Clearstream settlement agreement. \u201c[Forfeiture is the failure to make a timely assertion of a right]];] waiver is the \u2018intentional, relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct, 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (quoting Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938)). The distinction is meaningful because a waived argument is ordinarily reviewed only \u201cto avoid a manifest injustice,\u201d In re Nortel Networks Corp. Sec. Litig., 539 F.3d 129, 133 (2d Cir. 2008), whereas, as noted, a forfeited argument \u201cmay be reviewed for plain error,\u201d. Gore, 154 F.3d at 41.</p> <p id=\"b104-11\" pgmap=\"104(39) 105(8)\"> We think that the plaintiffs forfeited, not waived, their argument. Nothing in the record or briefing suggests that plaintiffs \u201cintentional[ly] relinquished],\u201d as opposed to mistakenly omitted,- their argument; See Olano, 507 U.S. at 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770. Accordingly, we review for plain error.</p> <p id=\"b105-5\" pgmap=\"105\"> The district court did not plainly err with respect to those plaintiffs who were parties to Peterson /. As noted, the district court found that ninety-three percent of the Peterson I plaintiffs had agreed to the terms of the Clearstream settlement agreement, and that no Peterson I plaintiff had refused to sign. Peterson II, 2015 WL 731221, at *8, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20640. The Clearstream settlement agreement plainly states that it \u201cshall [be] effective\u201d upon the agreement of \u201cat least 80%\u201d of the Peterson I plaintiffs. C.A. at 904-05. The plaintiffs\u2019 sole rebuttal is that the Clearstream settlement agreement \u201cdoes not bind [non-signatory] [plaintiffs.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Reply at 11 (citing C.A. at 902).- We find nothing in the part of the record cited by the plaintiffs to support their assertion. Because the plaintiffs have not advanced any other rebuttals, or pointed us to other parts of the record, we cannot say that the district court committed an error \u201cthat is plain\u201d with respect to this forfeited argument. Villafuerte, 502 F.3d at 209.</p> <p id=\"b105-6\" pgmap=\"105\"> The district court did plainly err, however, with respect to those plaintiffs who were not parties to Peterson I. The plaintiffs argued, albeit belatedly, that several plaintiffs in this case were not parties to Peterson I, or therefore, the resultant Clearstream settlement agreement. J.A. at 154. The part of the district court\u2019s decision concerning the applicability of the Clearstream settlement agreement did not address this issue. See Peterson II, 2015 WL 731221, at *8, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20640 (addressing only non-signatory Peterson I plaintiffs). The application of the Clearstream settlement to these n\u00f3n-party plaintiffs was plainly an error affecting those plaintiffs\u2019 substantial rights. See Villafuerte, 502 F.3d at 209. Moreover, it would \u201cseriously affect[] the fairness\u201d of judicial proceedings, id. (internal quotation marks omitted), were we to sanction an order errantly, and without apparent reason, binding several plaintiffs to a settlement agreement that arose from litigation to which they were not party. Accordingly, we vacate that part of the district court\u2019s order applying the Clearstream settlement agreement to the Peterson II plaintiffs who were not also plaintiffs, in Peterson 1.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b105-10\" pgmap=\"105\"> Our plain-error review does not extend, however, to the plaintiffs\u2019 argument, made for the first time in reply, that many of the plaintiffs, including those who were not party to Peterson I, should be similarly excused from the reach- of the UBAE settlement agreement. See Pis.\u2019 Reply at 13. This argument was never raised before- the district court, even belatedly, see J.A. at 154 (addressing only the Clear-stream settlement agreement), nor was it directly raised in the plaintiffs\u2019 opening appellate brief, see Pis.\u2019 Br. at 23 (same). The preceding analysis aside, \u201c[w]e will not consider an argument raised for the first time- in a reply brief.\u201d United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, 115 (2d Cir. 2003).</p> <p id=\"b105-11\" pgmap=\"105(84) 106(85)\"> Turning to . the substance' of the settlement agreements, New York law governs our review. See C.A. at 908 (providing that the Clearstream settlement agreement shall be governed by New York law); id. at 1650-51 (providing that the UBAE settlement agreement shall be governed by New York law). Settlement agreements are \u201cco\u2019ntract[s] and [their] meaning must be discerned under several cardinal principles of contractual interpretation.\u201d Brad H. v. City of New York, 17 N.Y.3d 180, 185, 951 N.E.2d 743, 746, 928 N.Y.S.2d 221 (2011). \u201cWhere [a] contract is unambiguous, courts must effectuate its plain language.\u201d Seabury, 289 F.3d at 68 (citing Slamow v. Del Col, 79 N.Y.2d 1016, 594 N.E.2d 918, 919, 584 N.Y.S.2d 424 (1992)). \u201cTo determine whether a writing is unambiguous, language should not be read in isolation because the contract must be considered as a whole.\u201d Brad H., 17 N.Y.3d at 185, 928 N.Y.S.2d 221, 951 N.E.2d at 746. We consider the Clear-stream and UBAE settlement agreements in light of those principles.</p> <p id=\"b106-4\" pgmap=\"106\">1. The Clearstream Settlement Agreement</p> <p id=\"b106-5\" pgmap=\"106\"> The Clearstream settlement agreement released \u201call past, present or future claims or causes of action ... arising out of, or relating in any way to\u201d Clearstream \u201caccounts numbered ... 13061 [the UBAE customer account] ... [or] 13675 [the sundry blocked account].\u201d C.A. at 903. The settlement agreement excepted from that release \u201c[g]arnishee [a]ctions\u201d against Clearstream \u201cregarding ... efforts to recover any asset or property of any kind ... that is held by or in the name, or under the control, or for the benefit of, Bank Markazi or Iran ... in an action against ... Clearstream ... solely in its capacity as a garnishee.\u201d Id. at 905 (emphasis omitted). The district court properly concluded that these provisions released the plaintiffs\u2019 non-turnover claims against Clearstream.</p> <p id=\"b106-6\" pgmap=\"106\"> Under New York law, a \u201cgarnishee\u201d action is one for the \u201cturnover\u201d of \u201cassets already within [the garnishee\u2019s] possession.\u201d Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, 21 N.Y.3d 55, 64, 990 N.E.2d 114, 120, 967 N.Y.S.2d 876 (2013). The plaintiffs\u2019 non-turnover claims, by contrast, involve more than obtaining the turnover of assets already within Clearstream\u2019s possession. For example, the plaintiffs\u2019 fraudulent-conveyance claims brought under DCL \u00a7 276 entail a showing of, inter alia, fraudulent intent. See Wall St. Assocs. v. Brodsky, 257 A.D.2d 526, 528-29, 684 N.Y.S.2d 244, 247-48 (1st Dep\u2019t 1999). The non-turnover claims brought against Clearstream therefore fall within the settlement agreement\u2019s broad release of \u201call\u201d claims arising out of or relating to the Clearstream accounts at issue. C.A. at 903. The plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the release should be construed in their favor, Pis.\u2019 Br. at 22-23, 28, yields to an \u201cexplicit, unequivocal statement of a present promise to release [a party] from liability.\u201d Golden Pac. Bancorp v. FDIC, 273 F.3d 509, 515 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Vt. Teddy Bear Co. v. 538 Madison Realty Co., 1 N.Y.3d 470, 475, 807 N.E.2d 876, 879, 775 N.Y.S.2d 765 (2004).</p> <p id=\"AG1X\" pgmap=\"106(149) 107(39)\"> The plaintiffs contend that the Clearstream settlement agreement released only claims relating to those \u201clitigated in Peterson 7\u201d and \u201cdamages claims against Clearstream.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Br. at 29 (emphasis omitted). The plain language of the release provision suggests otherwise. The settlement agreement purported to release all claims \u201cconcerning\u201d several \u201cCovered Subjects,\u201d C.A. at 903 (emphasis omitted), a defined term that includes \u201cany claims alleged against Clearstream by judgment creditors ... in Peterson [/]; or [] any account maintained at Clearstream ... including ... accounts numbered ... 13061 [the UBAE customer account] ... [or] 13675 [the sundry blocked account],\u201d id. (emphasis added). The plaintiffs\u2019 argument rests on the (we think mistaken) suggestion that the release of \u201call\u201d claims applies only to \u201cPeterson Direct Claims,\u201d a defined term that is distinct from \u201cDirect Claims,\u201d also a defined term. Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 suggestion, only the former term is restricted to \u201casserted claims in Peterson [/].\u201d Id. at-901. By contrast, the term \u201cDirect Claims,\u201d -the subject of the release provision, is defined more broadly as \u201call\u201d claims \u201cconcerning\u201d the \u201cCovered Subjects.\u201d Id. at 903 (emphasis omitted).</p> <p id=\"AJa\" pgmap=\"107\">The plaintiffs argue that their fraudulent-conveyance claims against Clear-stream nonetheless qualify as \u201cgarnishee actions\u201d under the settlement agreement\u2019s carve-out provision. The plaintiffs note that \u201cjudgment creditors can obtain turnover 'from garnishees by undoing fraudulent conveyances.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Br. at 30. Be that as it may, the relief that one can obtain from a fraudulent-conveyance action does not convert that -claim into a \u201cgarnishee action,\u201d which, as previously noted, is a cause of action, that seeks the turnover of assets already in the garnishee\u2019s possession. See N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 105(i) (\u201cA \u2018garnishee\u2019 is a person ... other than the judgment debtor who has property in his possession or custody in which a judgment debtor has an interest.\u201d (emphasis added)). Moreover, the Clearstream settlement agreement limits permissible \u201cgarnishee actions\u201d to those in which Clearstream is named \u201csolely in its capacity as a garnishee.\u201d C.A. at 905 (emphasis omitted).</p> <p id=\"b107-6\" pgmap=\"107\">The plaintiffs argue that this final provision encompasses their fraudulent-conveyance claims because it permits \u201can action in which ... Clearstream ... is named solely for the purpose of seeking an order directing that ... Clearstream ... perform an act that will have the effect of reversing a transfer between other parties that is found to have been a fraudulent transfer.\u201d Id. We disagree. The plaintiffs\u2019 fraudulent-conveyance claims against Clearstream allege more than a transfer \u201cbetween other parties,\u2019-\u2019- including, for example, the allegation that Clearstream was an active \u201c[c]onspirator[ ]\u201d in the alleged fraudulent -scheme.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Id. at 707, 721. We therefore affirm that part of the district court\u2019s order granting Clearstr\u00e9am\u2019s motion to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 non-turnover claims brought against Clearstream.</p> <p id=\"b107-10\" pgmap=\"107\">2. The UBAE Settlement Agreement</p> <p id=\"b107-11\" pgmap=\"107\"> We vacate, however, the district court\u2019s order granting UBAE\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 non-turnover claims brought against UBAE.</p> <p id=\"b107-12\" pgmap=\"107(177) 108(37)\">The UBAE settlement agreement \u201crelease[d] UBAE and all of its past, present and future ... beneficiaries ... from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, suits, judgments, costs, ... or other incidental or consequential damages of any kind ... arising out of or related to the [plaintiffs\u2019 Direct Claims against UBAE.\u201d Id. at 1648. \u201cDirect Claims\u201d as defined in the UBAE settlement agreement includes \u201cclaims in Peterson [7] for damages against UBAE with regard to certain.assets transferred ... and valued at approximately $250,000,000.00 ..., including, but not limited to, claims for fraudulent conveyance, tortious interference with the collection of a money judgment, and prima facie tort.\u201d Id. at 1646.

The UBAE settlement agreement also provides that the \u201c[pjlaintiffs agree that any future claim against UBAE for the Remaining Assets shall be limited to turnover only, and [the pjlaintiffs waive all other claims against UBAE for any damages regarding the Remaining Assets.\u201d Id. at 1648. \u201cRemaining Assets\u201d are defined by the UBAE settlement agreement as \u201ccertain assets [that] remain in an account at Clearstream[ ] [in] a UBAE customer account[] that are beneficially owned by Bank Markazi.\u201d Id. at 1647.</p> <p id=\"b108-4\" pgmap=\"108\">As indicated in a summary--order published in tandem with this decision,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we disagree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that these provisions necessarily released the plaintiffs\u2019 non-turnover claims, including their fraudulent-conveyance claims, brought against UBAE.. The UBAE settlement agreement provides that \u201cany future claim against UBAE\u201d for the assets at issue \u201cshall be limited to turnover only.\u201d Id. at 1648. The term \u201cturnover\u201d is not defined. But the agreement, taken \u201cas a whole,\u201d Brad H., 17 N.Y.3d at 185, 928 N.Y.S.2d 221, 951 N.E.2d at 746, suggests that the parties intended the term to encompass the plaintiffs\u2019 fraudulent conveyance claims insofar as the agreement refers to the Peterson I claims, which included both fraudulent-conveyance and turnover-qua-tumover claims, as \u201cthe Turnover Action,\u201d C.A. at 1646.</p> <p id=\"b108-5\" pgmap=\"108\"> UBAE argues that under New York law, a claim seeking \u201cturnover\u201d is an action brought under C.P.L.R.

Garrison Protective Servs., Inc., 819 F.3d 636, 640 (2d Cir. 2016) (emphases omitted). Although UBAE may. be correct about the meaning of \u201cturnover\u201d as used in New York law, we do not think that this resolves what we conclude to be the ambiguity .of that term as used by the parties in the -UBAE- settlement agreement. The question for us on appeal is not whether a turnover proceeding and fraudulent-conveyance claim are one and the same under New. York law. It is, instead, what the parties meant by.use of the word \u201cturnover\u201d as employed in the UBAE settlement agreement. We conclude that when the UBAE settlement agreement is viewed in its entirety, the meaning of the term is ambiguous.</p> <p id=\"b108-9\" pgmap=\"108(141) 109(71)\"> We also note- that, under New York law, a party may-allege a fraudulent-conveyance claim within a turnover action brought under C.P.L.R.

Mitchell v.

But, as we have noted, whether UBAE is correct about New York law does not resolve whether it is . also correct about the meaning of the UBAE settlement agreement.</p> <p id=\"b109-5\" pgmap=\"109\">UBAE might benefit from the plaintiffs\u2019 agreement to \u201crelease UBAE ... from ... causes of action ... related to the Direct Claims against UBAE.\u201d C.A. at 1648. In context, however, the meaning of \u201crelated to\u201d is also ambiguous. It is certainly the case that both the Peterson I claims\u2014i.e., the \u201cDirect Claims\u201d\u2014and those at issue here concern related transactions, specifically) the allegedly fraudulent transfers of bond proceeds linked to Markazi. On the other hand, the plaintiffs in this litigation seek to recover proceeds related to a distinct set of bonds. Accordingly, it is not apparent to us that their fraudulent-conveyance claims here are necessarily \u201crelated to\u201d the Peterson I Direct Claims.</p> <p id=\"b109-6\" pgmap=\"109\"> Thus, although it is clear that the UBAE settlement agreement released UBAE from \u201cany and all ... claims [or] causes of action,\u201d C.A. 1648, \u201cfor damages against UBAE with regard to [the assets at issue in Peterson I],\u201d id. at 1646, the settlement\u2019s applicability beyond such claims is unclear. Because the question on a motion for summary judgment is \u201cwhether the contract is unambiguous with respect to the question disputed by the parties,\u201d Int\u2019l Multifoods Corp. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 309 F.3d 76, 83 (2d Cir. 2002), and \u201c[a]n ambiguity exists where the terms of the contract could suggest more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire ... agreement,\u201d Law Debenture Tr. Co. of N.Y. v. Maverick Tube Corp., 595 F.3d 458, 466 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted), the district court \u00e9rred by granting UBAE\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment with respect to the plain-, tiffs\u2019 non-turnover claims.</p> <p id=\"b109-11\" pgmap=\"109\">UBAE argues that \u201c[t]he definition of \u2018Plaintiffs\u2019 Direct Claims\u2019 in the [UBAE settlement- agreement] specifically includes the Peterson II fraudulent conveyance claims.\u201d UBAE Br. at 21. We. disagree. The UBAE Settlement Agreement defines \u201cDirect Claims\u201d as those \u201cin Peterson [7] for damages against UBAE with regard to certain assets [at issu\u00e9 in Peterson 7] ... and valued at approximately $250,000,000.00 (the \u2018Transferred Assets\u2019), including, but not limited to, claims for fraudulent conveyance.\u201d C.A. at 1646. Although this provision cle\u00e1rly includes the Peterson I fraudulent-conveyance claims among the Peterson I \u201cDirect Claims,\u201d it also plainly requires that those causes of action concern the assets at issue in Peterson I. The fraudulent-conveyance claims -brought against UBAE in this litigation of course do not satisfy that requirement.</p> <p id=\"b109-12\" pgmap=\"109\">For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the district court\u2019s conclusion that the UBAE settlement agreement released the plaintiffs\u2019 non-turnover claims brought against UBAE and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings with respect to those claims.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b110-3\" pgmap=\"110\">3. Application of the UBAE Settlement Agreement to Claims Brought Against Markazi</p> <p id=\"b110-4\" pgmap=\"110\"> The district court also determined that the UBAE settlement agreement also released the plaintiffs\u2019 non-turnover claims against Markazi. Peterson II, 2015 WL 731221, at *10, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20640. We disagree. The UBAE settlement agreement released certain claims brought against UBAE and undefined UBAE \u201cbeneficiaries.\u201d C.A. at 1648. It made clear, however, that this release \u201cdoes not impact the ability of any of the [pjarties to pursue claims against Clearstream, Citibank, Bank Markazi, [or] ' Iran.\u201d Id. at 1649. Whoever and whatever the parties meant to define as UBAE \u201cbeneficiaries,\u201d it seems clear that Markazi was not included.</p> <p id=\"b110-5\" pgmap=\"110\">The district court therefore erred by dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 non-turnover claims, including the fraudulent-conveyance claims, brought against Markazi. Accordingly, we vacate that part of the district court\u2019s order and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 non-turnover claims brought against Markazi.</p> <p id=\"b110-6\" pgmap=\"110\">C. The Turnover Claims</p> <p id=\"b110-7\" pgmap=\"110\">The plaintiffs seek to enforce their underlying judgments against Iran and MOIS by executing on $1.68 billion of Mar-kazi-owned bond proceeds. The plaintiffs\u2019 claims seeking a turnover order to that effect rest, as an initial matter, on the nature and location of the bond proceeds. The plaintiffs contend that they are denominated as USD and held as cash in New York City at Clearstream\u2019s correspondent account at JPMorgan. The defendants argue that there is no cash; at most, Markazi owns, through UBAE, a right to payment from Clearstream in the amount of $1.68 billion as reflected on book entries located in Luxembourg. Whether the plaintiffs can obtain an order compelling one or several of the defendants to turn over the assets at issue depends first on the nature and location of the assets, and second on the court\u2019s jurisdiction for execution of those assets, whatever and wherever they are.</p> <p id=\"b110-10\" pgmap=\"110\">1. The Nature and Location of the Assets</p> <p id=\"b110-11\" pgmap=\"110(113) 111(10)\">The plaintiffs insist that Clearstream holds the bond proceeds in New York City as cash in its correspondent account at JPMorgan. The district court disagreed, finding sufficient record evidence that the bond proceeds are not held as cash in New York City but are recorded as a right to payment in Luxembourg. Peterson II, 2015 WL 731221, at *6, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20640 (\u201c[JPMorgan] received proceeds relating to the [bonds], which it credited to a Clearstream account at [JPMorgan]. Whether it should have or should not have, Clearstream in turn credited amounts attributable to the [bonds] to the UBAE/ Bank Markazi account in Luxembourg. The [JPMorgan] records are clear that whatever happened to the proceeds, they are gone.\u201d)- We agree.</p> <p id=\"b111-5\" pgmap=\"111\"> It is undisputed that Clear-stream\u2019s correspondent account at JPMor-gan was a general \u201coperating account,\u201d C.A. at 1863, used to service transactions on behalf of many customers who are not parties to this litigation, id. at 1973-74, 2541; see also id. at 2834-35. Although Clearstream received bond proceeds into this general account, id. at 686, the account\u2019s USD holdings were not segregated by customer, id. at 2537-39. Moreover, no cash attributable to the Markazi-owned bond proceeds was transferred from Clearstream\u2019s correspondent account at JPMorgan to Markazi or UBAE. Id. at 1976. Clearstream instead used its general pool of cash to meet other obligations. Id. at 1865-66. As a result, approximately seven to nine billion dollars flowed in and out of the Clearstream correspondent account each day. Id. at 1973. Indeed, JPMorgan records show that this account frequently had a near-zero or negative end-of-day balance.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Id. at 1864, 1959.</p> <p id=\"b111-6\" pgmap=\"111\">The plaintiffs\u2019 putative expert, Peter U. Vinella, attributed minuscule or negative end-of-day balances to industry-standard \u201c[sjweeps.\u201d C.A. at 2422. Under this theory, JPMorgan commandeered the Clear-stream correspondent account at the close of business, \u201cinvested [its funds] in very short-dated USD investments],] and subsequently redeposited ... the USD [in the] JPMorgan [a]ccount the next day ..., essentially refilling the bucket.\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Vinella opined that these sweeps \u201care not generally reflected on the customer\u2019s statement\u201d so that \u201cthe funds remain in the bank account from the customer\u2019s perspective.\u201d Id. JPMorgan acknowledged that it indeed \u201cemployed] an investment sweep mechanism during the 2008-2012 period that enabled it to pay overnight interest to Clear-stream.\u201d Id. at 2541.</p> <p id=\"b111-9\" pgmap=\"111\">We nonetheless agree with the district court that \u201cVinella\u2019s argument that the money is somehow still there [does not] really work[].\u201d J.A. at 88 (raising this concern during the September 19, 2014 argument). Even assuming that JPMor-gan\u2019s sweeps used all cash holdings in the Clearstream correspondent account, JPMorgan established through bank records that \u201cthe end-of-day balances in the account that were available for overnight investment were never more than a small fraction of the $1.68 billion that make up the [assets at issue].\u201d C.A. at 2541. In fact, the Clearstream correspondent account rarely had an end-of-day balance greater than $300 million, far short of the $1.68 billion sought by the plaintiffs. See J.A. at 80. JPMorgan may have swept all cash in the Clearstream correspondent account, but the plaintiffs have offered no evidence that those sweeps were performed specifically with Markazi\u2019s cash.'</p> <p id=\"b111-10\" pgmap=\"111(29) 112(86)\">Moreover, Jonckheere, the JPMorgan account manager for Clearstream, offered an undisputed explanation for Clear-stream\u2019s near-zero end-of-day account balances: \u201c[JPMorgan] and Clearstream have an arrangement under which [JPMorgan] will at its discretion advance a very significant amount of intra-day liquidity to Clear-stream to allow Clearstream\u2019s. [correspondent account] to be overdrawn and thereby ensure that the account operates smoothly at all times.\u201d C.A. at 2539. This explanation and Vinella\u2019s sweep theory are not mutually exclusive. And both are consistent with the district court\u2019s finding that $1.68 billion in cash attributable to Marka-zi\u2019s bond proceeds is not sitting in Clear-stream\u2019s correspondent account at JPMor-gan in New York City.</p> <p id=\"b112-4\" pgmap=\"112\">Vinella separately posited -that \u201cClear-stream cannot hold or process USD in Luxembourg in any material amount.\u201d Id. at 2408. Maybe so. But it does not -follow that Clearstream must be holding $1.68 billion in cash in New York' City. Vinella\u2019s observation is entirely consistent with the undisputed . record evidence that Clear-stream received cash payments into a general pool, which was drawn down on a daily basis to service many customers\u2019 demands. Clearstream then caused a corresponding credit to be reflected in the Markazi, and later UBAE, account in Luxembourg as a right to payment equivalent to the bond proceeds that Clear-stream received and processed in New York:</p> <p id=\"b112-5\" pgmap=\"112\"> The location of that right to payment is determined by state law. See Karaha Bodas Co. v. Perusahaan Pertambangan Minyak Dan Gas Bumi Negara, 313 F.3d 70, 83 (2d Cir. 2002); see also EM Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina, 389 Fed.Appx. 38, 44 (2d Cir. 2010) (summary order) (relying on state law to determine the location of property). Under New York law, the situs of an intangible property interest, such as the right to payment relevant here, is \u201cthe location of the party of whom performance -\u00abis required by the terms of the contract.\u201d ABKCO Indus., Inc. v. Apple Films, Inc., 39 N.Y.2d 670, 675, 360 N.E.2d 899, 902, 385 N.Y.S.2d 511 (1976) (noting that where an intangible property interest is represented by a negotiable instrument, the physical location of that instrument determines the location of the property interest); see also Hotel 71 Mezz Lender LLC v. Falor, 14 N.Y.3d 303, 315, 926 N.E.2d 1202, 1210, 900 N.Y.S.2d 698 (2010) (\u201c[W]here a creditor seeks to attach a debt (an intangible form of property) solely for security purpos.es (i.e., the debtor is subject to the court\u2019s personal jurisdiction), the situs of the debt is wherever the debtor is present.\u201d). In this case, the right to payment is reflected as a book entry or account balance, maintained in Luxembourg by .Clearstream, a Luxembourg entity. Thus, the asset the plaintiffs seek\u2014a right to payment\u2014is located in Luxembourg,</p> <p id=\"b112-7\" pgmap=\"112\">The plaintiffs advance several rebuttals, each presuming the validity of their position that Clearstream holds a segregated pool of $1.68 billion in cash traceable to the bond proceeds in New York. For example, the plaintiffs argue that \u201cthe empty act of making book entries to a Luxembourg account without an accompanying transfer did not alter the location of the Markazi-owned assets.\u201d Pis,\u2019 Br. at 49. That is neither controversial nor surprising: There was no accompanying transfer of cash to Markazi or UBAE. For similar reasons, the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that fraudulent conveyances have no legal effect is of no moment. This argument presumes \u201cthat [the] [defendants moved the [b]ond [proceeds to Luxembourg.\u201d Id. at 51. Not so. No bond proceeds were \u201cmoved,\u201d at least not as envisaged by the plaintiffs. Rather, cash flowed into the Clearstream correspondent account at JPMorgan, which was then used to meet other customers\u2019 demands. Markazi was made whole by its interest in the recordation of an equivalent right to payment in Luxembourg.</p> <p id=\"b113-3\" pgmap=\"113\">The plaintiffs argue that under the Uniform Commercial Code (\u201cUCC\u201d), Clear-stream \u201cmust maintain a corresponding financial asset (i.e., USD) sufficient to satisfy ... entitlements [owed to Markazi and UBAE],\u201d and \u201cthose USD[ ] must be segregated from Clearstream\u2019s assets.\u201d Id. at 49. We need not, and therefore do not, comment on the propriety of Clearstream\u2019s banking practices under the UCC,- assuming that it applies.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Even if the bond proceeds should have been segregated and held as cash, they were not; there is not, therefore, property in New York subject to turnover. Contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 suggestion, see Pis.\u2019 Br. at 40, this position is not inconsistent with Peterson I, in which the district court concluded that a separate set of bond proceeds\u2014held at a different bank that is not party to this litigation\u2014 were both located in New York and owned by Markazi for reasons wholly unrelated to the UCC. Peterson I, 2013 WL 1155576, at *30-31, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40470. In any event, the question whether the UCC governs Markazi\u2019s ownership interest in and rights to the bond proceeds is unrelated to the nature and location of those assets.</p> <p id=\"b113-4\" pgmap=\"113\">The nature and location of the asset here\u2014a right to payment located in Luxembourg\u2014distinguishes this case from Peterson I, where it was \u201cundisputed\u201d that Clearstream held a segregated pool of \u201c$1.75 billion in cash proceeds of the bonds ... in an account at Citigroup in New York.\u201d Id. at *2, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40470, at *42. Indeed, in Peterson I the district court specifically found that \u201cnearly $2 billion in bond proceeds [traceable to Markazi] is sitting in an account in New York at Citibank,\u201d which the court determined was far from a \u201cfleeting or ephemeral interest[ ].\u201d Id. at *24, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40470, at *103. Here, by contrast, there never was a traceable or segregated pool of Markazi-owned bond proceeds held as cash in Clearstream\u2019s correspondent account at JPMorgan in New York City.</p> <p id=\"b113-7\" pgmap=\"113\">We conclude that the assets at issue are, therefore, represented by a right to payment in the possession of Clearstream located in Luxembourg. Accordingly, the district court properly . granted \u2022 JPMor-gan\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment because JPMorgan is not in possession of any assets subject to turnover. Similarly, neither Markazi nor UBAE possesses any assets subject to turnover here because the asset at issue is in fact held by Clearstream and represented as a positive account balance in a \u201csundry blocked account\u201d to which neither Markazi nor UBAE has access. C.A. at 684. We therefore turn to whether the principal asset at issue, a right to payment held by Clear-stream and located in Luxembourg, is subject to execution.</p> <p id=\"b113-8\" pgmap=\"113\">2. Jurisdiction for Execution</p> <p id=\"b113-9\" pgmap=\"113\"> The district , court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to order turnover because the principal asset at issue\u2014a right to payment recorded and held in Luxembourg\u2014is located outside the United States and, therefore, absolutely immune from execution under the FSIA. Peterson II, 2015 WL 731221, at *10, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20640. Although the district court\u2019s assumption was reasonable in. light of many judicial decisions suggesting as much, we think it was incorrect.</p> <p id=\"b113-10\" pgmap=\"113(42) 114(80)\">Before the FSIA,' foreign sovereigns were generally afforded broad immunity from the jurisdictional reach of American courts.

Islamic Republic of Iran, 609 F.3d 43, 47 (2d Cir. 2010) (\u201cThe [FSIA] provides the exclusive basis for subject matter jurisdiction over all civil actions against foreign state defendants, and therefore for a court to exercise subject matter jurisdiction over a defendant the action must fall within one of the FSIA\u2019s exceptions to foreign sovereign immunity.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p> <p id=\"b114-7\" pgmap=\"114\">Section 1604 of the FSIA provides in general terms for foreign sovereign immunity: \u201c[A] foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States and of the-States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604.

The district .court concluded that this asset\u2019s location in Luxembourg is fatal to the plaintiffs\u2019 turnover claims. Peterson II, 2015 WL 731221, at *10, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20640 (\u201cThe FSIA does not allow for attachment of property outside of the United States.\u201d). We disagree.</p> <p id=\"b116-10\" pgmap=\"116\">The FSIA does not by its terms provide execution immunity to a foreign sovereign\u2019s extraterritorial assets. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1609 (\u201c[T]he property in the United States of a foreign state shali be immune from attachment arrest and execution ,... \u201d (emphasis added)). In NML Capital, the Supreme Court squarely rejected the argument that any common law execution immunity afforded to \u201ca foreign state\u2019s extraterritorial assets\u201d survived the enactment of the FSIA:</p> <blockquote id=\"b116-11\" pgmap=\"116\">[We identify] no case holding that, before the Act, \u00e1 foreign state\u2019s extraterritorial assets enjoyed absolute execution immunity in United States courts.

There, a- judgment creditor sought to execute against stock certificates owned by a judgment debtor but held in Bermuda by a third-party garnishee. Id. at 80-81. \u201cThe district court concluded that stock certificates in general must be located within the state in order to be attached .Id. at 86. On appeal, however, w\u00e9 found that this raised an important and unsettled question of state law; accordingly, we certified the issue to the New York Court of Appeals. Id. at 87-88.</p> <p id=\"b117-5\" pgmap=\"117\"> The Court of Appeals accepted certification and, closely 'divided, \u201ch[e]ld that a New York court with personal jurisdiction over a defendant may order him to turn over out-of-state property regardless of whether the defendant is a judgment debtor or a garnishee.\u201d Koehler v. Bank of Berm. Ltd., 12 N.Y.3d 533, 541, 911 N.E.2d 825, 831, 883 N.Y.S.2d 763 (2009). The court observed that \u201cCPLR article 52 contains no express territorial limitation barring the entry of a turnover order that requires a garnishee to transfer money or property into New York from another state or country.\u201d Id. at 539, 883 N.Y.S.2d 763, 911 N.E.2d at 829. Turning to recent legislative amendments, the court determined that the New York State \u201c[legislature intended CPLR article 52 to have extraterritorial reach.\u201d Id. The court\u2019s holding turned on the exercise of in per-sonam jurisdiction; a court sitting in New York with personal jurisdiction over a party may order that party \u201cto bring property into the state.\u201d Id. at 540, 883 N.Y.S.2d 763, 911 N.E.2d at 830 (\u201c[T]he key to the reach of the turnover order is personal jurisdiction over a particular defendant.\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b117-7\" pgmap=\"117\">Following NML Capital, 134 S.Ct. at 2256-57, the FSIA appears to be no impediment to an order issued pursuant to Koehler directing Clearstream\u2014should the court have personal jurisdiction Over it\u2014to bring the Markazi-owned asset held in Luxembourg to New York State. Section 1604\u2019s grant of jurisdictional immunity, applies only to.\u201ca foreign state,\u201d which Clear-stream of course is not. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604. Section. 1609\u2019s grant of execution immunity applies only to assets located \u201cin the United States,\u201d which the Luxembourg right to payment is not. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1609. And, as noted, the Supreme Court\u2019s view set forth in NML Capital appears unequivocal: \u201c[A]ny sort of immunity defense made by a foreign. sovereign in an American - court must stand on the Act\u2019s text. Or it must fall.\u201d 134 S.Ct. at 2256.</p> <p id=\"b117-8\" pgmap=\"117(160) 118(42)\">Each of the many cases cited by the defendants for the proposition that a foreign sovereign\u2019s extraterritorial assets are absolutely immune from execution were decided before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in NML Capital, which made clear that such cases 'predating NML Capital are no longer binding on this discrete point. See EM Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina, 695 F.3d 201, 208 (2d Cir. 2012) (\u201cWe recognize that a district court sitting in Manhattan does not have the power to attach Argentinian property in foreign countries.\u201d); Aurelius Capital Partners, LP v. Republic of Argentina, 584 F.3d 120, 130 (2d Cir. 2009) (\u201c[T]he property that is subject to attachment and execution must be property in the United States of a foreign state (internal quotation marks omitted)). Following NML Capital, this body of former case law is of no help to the defendants. As the Supreme Court instructed, \u201ceven if [the defendants] were right about the scope of the common-law execution-immunity rule, then it would be obvious that the terms of \u00a7 1609 execution immunity are narrower, since the text of that provision immunizes only foreign-state property \u2018in the United States.\u2019 \u201d NML Capital, 134 S.Ct. at 2257 (emphasis in original).</p> <p id=\"b118-4\" pgmap=\"118\"> NML Capital and Koehler do not, however, affect our long-standing view that \u201c[t]he FSIA provides the exclusive basis for obtaining subject matter jurisdiction over a foreign state.\u201d Kirschenbaum, 830 F.3d at 122 (emphasis added); see also NML Capital, 134 S.Ct. at 2256-58 (concerning execution jurisdiction). Here, though, the putative exercise of in person-am jurisdiction concerns Clearstream\u2014the party in possession of-the asset at issue\u2014 which is not itself a sovereign and therefore does not possess sovereign immunity.</p> <p id=\"b118-5\" pgmap=\"118\"> Nonetheless, NML Capital and Koehler, when combined, do authorize a court sitting in New York with personal jurisdiction over a non-sovereign third party to recall to New York extraterritorial assets owned by a foreign sovereign. Had Koehler arisen in the context of an exercise of in personam jurisdiction over a foreign sovereign\u2014it did not\u2014the FSIA\u2019s grant of jurisdictional immunity would supersede contrary state law. See Peterson, 627 F.3d at 1130 (applying state law \u201cinsofar as it does not conflict with the FSIA\u201d). As it was decided, however, Koehler does not appear to us to be inconsistent with the FSIA as interpreted by the Supreme \" Court in NML Capital.</p> <p id=\"b118-8\" pgmap=\"118\">At least one of our sister circuits has, without considering the issue in any detail, suggested the contrary conclusion: that even after NML Capital, a foreign sovereign\u2019s extraterritorial assets remain absolutely immune from execution. In Rubin v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 830 F.3d 470 (7th Cir. 2016), the Seventh Circuit remarked that before a foreign sovereign\u2019s assets are \u201ceven potentially subject to attachment and execution,\u201d it must be shown that the assets are \u201cwithin the territorial jurisdiction of the district court.\u201d Id. at 475 (citing NML Capital, 134 S.Ct. at 2257 (\u201cOur courts generally lack authority in the first place to execute against property in other countries .... \u201d)). The Seventh Circuit\u2019s comment is unavailing to the defendants here. As an initial matter, it is not evident that an exercise of in person-am jurisdiction over a non-sovereign pursuant to Koehler is inconsistent with the Seventh Circuits, statement concerning the exercise of \u201cterritorial jurisdiction\u201d in the context of an in rem proceeding. Id.; see also Rubin v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 33 F.Supp.3d 1003, 1006 (N.D. Ill. 2014) (\u201cPlaintiffs now seek to collect on [judgments against Iran] by attaching alleged assets of Iran .... \u201d (emphasis added)), aff'd, 830 F.3d 470 (7th Cir. 2016), cert. granted, \u2014 U.S.-, 137 S.Ct. 2326, 198 L.Ed.2d 754 (2017).</p> <p id=\"b118-11\" pgmap=\"118(36) 119(103)\"> Moreover, we do not understand the Supreme Court\u2019s observation that \u201c[o]ur courts generally lack authority in the first place to execute against property in other countries,\u201d NML Capital, 134 S.Ct. at 2257, to foreclose that possibility.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Indeed, Justice Scalia\u2019s observation was made in the context of noting that no court had ever before held that \u201ca foreign state\u2019s extraterritorial assets enjoyed absolute execution immunity in United States courts.\u201d Id. And as we have noted, even if such a rule had existed at common law, \u201cit would be obvious that the terms of \u00a7 1609 execution immunity are narrower, since the text of that provision immunizes only foreign-state property \u2018in the United States.\u2019 \u201d Id. (emphasis in original). \u201cSo ... \u00a7 1609 execution immunity ... [does] not shield ... a foreign sovereign\u2019s extraterritorial assets.\u201d Id.</p> <p id=\"b119-5\" pgmap=\"119\">We think that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in NML Capital counsels in favor of part of the reasoning suggested by the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in Peterson, 627 F.3d 1117, itself a pre-AML Capital case. There, judgment creditors of Iran sought to execute against \u201cIran\u2019s rights to payment from CMA CGM,\u201d a French shipping company indebted to Iran. Id. at 1121. The Ninth Circuit held that the right to payment was not \u201cproperty in the United States\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1610(a) and was, therefore, \u201cimmune from execution.\u201d Id. at 1130. The court appeared to reach that conclusion based on the FSIA itself, see id. (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1610(a)), which reasoning, as explained, was vitiated by NML Capital.</p> <p id=\"b119-6\" pgmap=\"119\">But the Ninth 'Circuit also turned to state law as directed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 69(a). Id. at 1130-31 (noting that \u201cCalifornia enforcement law authorizes a court to \u2018order the judgment debtor to assign to the judgment creditor ... all or part of a right to payment due or to become due\u2019\u201d (quoting Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7 708.510(a))). In particular, the Ninth Circuit relied on Philippine Export &amp; Foreign Loan Guar. Corp. v. Chuidian, 218 Cal. App. 3d 1058, 267 Cal.Rptr. 457 (6th Dist. 1990), for the proposition that \u201cthe location of a right to payment ... is the location of the debtor,\u201d Peterson, 627 F.3d at 1131 (citing Philippine Export, 218 Cal. App. 3d 1058, 267 Cal.Rptr. 457). The state appellate court\u2019s decision in Philippine Export also held that California\u2019s state execution law does not apply extra-territorially. Philippine Export, 218 Cal. App. 3d at 1099, 267 Cal.Rptr. at 481. Citing that decision, the Ninth Circuit concluded that \u201ca foreign state defendant\u2019s rights to payment from third-party debtors are assignable only if those \u2018debtors [ ] reside in the United States.\u2019\u201d Peterson, 627 F.3d at 1131 (quoting Philippine Export, 218 Cal. App. 3d at 1099, 267 Cal.Rptr. at 481).</p> <p id=\"b119-10\" pgmap=\"119(153) 120(18)\">Although the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision appears to have rested on its pre-AML Capital understanding of the FSIA, its decision and citation to Philippine Export suggest an alternative approach that is in step with our reconciliation of AML Capital and Koehler. Were one to except the part of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion that did not survive AML Capital, the principal difference between the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in Peterson and our disposition of this case might be viewed as one of state law. Compare Philippine Export, 218 Cal. App. 3d at 1099, 267 CalRptr. at 480 (declining to exercise extraterritorial personal jurisdiction because, under California law, \u201cthe limits which generally exist upon the right to execute ... apply in a judgment debtor proceeding such as this\u201d (citing Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7 708.510 cmt. (West 1987) (Legislative Committee Comments, Assembly, 1982 Addition))), with Koehler, 12 N.Y.3d at 539, 883 N.Y.S.2d 763, 911 N.E.2d at 829 (determining that the New York State \u201c[legislature intended CPLR article 62 to have extraterritorial reach\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b120-4\" pgmap=\"120\">On remand, the district court should determine in the first instance whether it has personal jurisdiction over Clear-stream.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> If it answers that question in .the affirmative, then the court should determine if a barrier'exists to an exercise of in personam jurisdiction to recall to New York State the right to payment held by Clearstream in Luxembourg, whether for reasons -of, inter alia, state law,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> federal law, international comity,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> or for any other reason.</p> <p id=\"b120-5\" pgmap=\"120\">Should that asset be recalled, it may, upon being produced in New York, qualify as an asset \u201cin the \u25a0United States of a foreign state\u201d and, if so, it would be afforded execution immunity as such. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1609 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the district court will, likely be required to determine, if and when it reaches that juncture, whether the asset that comes to be \u201cin the United States\u201d .is subject to the execution-immunity exceptions relied on by the plaintiffs, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1610(a)(7), (g)(1); TRIA \u00a7 201(a). The defendants should, of course, be permitted to raise appropriate rebuttals at that time if they so choose.</p> <p id=\"A5i\" pgmap=\"120(141) 121(64)\"> We are cognizant of the conundrum apparently posed by NML Capital and Koehler when read in tandem. The FSIA \u201caimed to facilitate and depoliticize litigation against foreign states and to minimize irritations in foreign relations arising out of such litigation.\u201d Cargill Int\u2019l S.A. -v. M/T Pavel Dybenko, 991 F.2d 1012, 1016 (2d Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). We are not at all sure that NML Capital when read in light of the law established by Koehler furthers that goal. But if we are correct in our analysis, any such problem is one for the Supreme Court or the political branches\u2014not this Court\u2014to resolve.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Here, we attempt only to apply the law as we find it: The authority of courts sitting in New York with personal jurisdiction over a non-sovereign third party to order that third-party garnishee to produce in New York an. extraterritorial asset seems clear enough. Koehler, 12 N.Y.3d at 540, 883 N.Y.S.2d 763, 911 N.E.2d at 830. Whether that extraterritorial asset is owned by a foreign sovereign is of no moment, because the FSIA\u2019s grant of execution immunity does not extend to assets located abroad. NML Capital, 134 S.Ct. at 2257.</p> <p id=\"b121-5\" pgmap=\"121\">Moreover, we think that the two-step process called for by these cases\u2014first recalling the asset at issue, and second, proceeding with a traditional FSIA analysis\u2014is unlikely to open the proverbial floodgates to a wave of turnover claims seeking to execute against heretofore-unreachable extraterritorial assets. Even if those assets are in the possession of a third party over whom or which a court sitting in New York'has personal jurisdiction, those assets still must not be subject to execution immunity upon being recalled to New York State. In that respect, the FSIA contains several limiting principles, such as the requirement that any asset, subject to execution must have been \u201cused for a commercial activity in the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1610(a). Similarly, the TRIA contains its own limiting provisions, including the requirement that any asset subject to turnover be \u201cblocked,\u201d a term of art imbued with precise meaning. TRIA \u00a7 201(a); see also Smith v. Fed. Reserve Bank of N.Y., 346 F.3d 264, 267-69 (2d Cir. 2003) (defining \u201cblocked\u201d in the context of the TRIA). These and other constraints have frequently proven to be barriers to execution on foreign sovereign assets. See, e.g., Calderon-Cardona v. Bank of N.Y. Mellon, 770 F.3d 993, 999 (2d Cir. 2014) (holding that attachment was unavailable under the TRIA because North Korea was not \u201cdesignated as. a state sponsor of terrorism under ... the Export Administration Act of 1979 ... or ... the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961\u201d at the time of judgment (internal quotation marks omitted)); Hausler v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 770 F.3d 207, 212 (2d Cir. 2014) (per curiam) (determining that the- property, at issue .did not qualify as the \u201cblocked asset of\u2019, a foreign sovereign); Aurelius Capital Partners, 584 F.3d at 130-31 (holding that assets were not subject to execution under the FSIA because the. assets at issue were not \u201cused for a commercial activity,\u201d as Required by the Act); Bank of N.Y. v. Rubin, 484 F.3d 149, -150 (2d Cir. 2007) (per curiam) (concluding that the assets at. issue were not \u201cblo.cked assets\u201d subject to . turnover under the TRIA).</p> <p id=\"b121-7\" pgmap=\"121\">Indeed, these or other limitatioiis may ultimately prevent the plaintiffs in this case from obtaining , turnover of the asset at issue, should it be recalled to New York State pursuant to an exercise of the court\u2019s in personam jurisdiction. As but one example, one of the defendants argues on appeal that the asset .at issue does not qualify for the execution-immunity exceptions enumerated in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1610(a) because it was not \u201cused for a commercial activity in the United States.\u201d UBAE Br. at 37-39. Whether that is.so is independent of whether the asset comes to be located \u201cin the United States.\u201d See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1610(a) (\u201cThe property in the United States of a foreign state, .,. used for a commercial activity in the United States, shall not be immune from attachment in aid of execution, or from execution, ... if [additional specified requirements are satisfied].\u201d). While we need not, and therefore do not, consider the applicability of these barriers at this time, we wish to make clear that the plaintiffs are by no means assured success upon remand.</p> <p id=\"b121-8\" pgmap=\"121\">CONCLUSION</p> <p id=\"b121-9\" pgmap=\"121\">To summarize, for the foregoing reasons, we conclude as follows: \u25a0</p> <blockquote id=\"b122-3\" pgmap=\"122\">1. Plain error as to the application of the Clearstream settlement agreement to those plaintiffs who were not parties to Peterson I requires vacatur of the judgment of dismissal and remand with respect to those plaintiffs\u2019 non-turnover claims brought against Clearstream.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b122-4\" pgmap=\"122\">2. Excepting those plaintiffs who were not parties to Peterson I, the Clear-stream settlement agreement released the plaintiffs\u2019 non-turnover claims brought against Clearstream. \u2022The district court therefore properly-dismissed those claims.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b122-5\" pgmap=\"122\">3. Whether the UBAE settlement agreement is applicable to the plaintiffs\u2019 non-turnover claims brought against UBAE is, under the language of the agreement, unclear.

Accordingly, we vacate and remand that part of the district court\u2019s judgment of dismissal.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b122-6\" pgmap=\"122\">4. The UBAE settlement agreement did not release the plaintiffs\u2019 non-turnover claims brought against Markazi. Accordingly, we vacate and remand that part of the district court\u2019s judgment of dismissal.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b122-7\" pgmap=\"122\">5. The district court correctly determined that the asset at issue is a right to payment held by Clear-stream in Luxembourg. It also, therefore, properly dismissed JPMorgan from this action.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b122-8\" pgmap=\"122\">6. The district court prematurely dismissed the amended complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Cf. Republic of Argentina v.

On remand the district court should consider whether it has personal jurisdiction over Clearstream. If the court answers that question in the affirmative, then it should determine whether any provision of state or federal law prevents the court from recalling, or the plaintiffs from receiving, the asset.</blockquote> <p id=\"b122-12\" pgmap=\"122\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment in part, VACATE it in part, and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p> <p id=\"b122-13\" pgmap=\"122\">Appendix</p> <p id=\"b122-14\" pgmap=\"122(185) 123(527) 124(527) 125(536) 126(533) 127(518) 128(534) 129(78)\">The following parties are plaintiffs in this appeal: Deborah D.

The plaintiffs contend that our review should be particularly meticulous because the district court should have \u201cpermitted [p]lain-tiffs to conduct the relevant discovery or at least held an evidentiary hearing\u201d before ruling on the defendants\u2019 motions. Pis.\u2019 Br. at 34. We review the district court\u2019s \"determination not to hold an evidentiary hearing .\u25a0.. for . abuse of discretion.\u201d United States v. Amico, 486 F.3d 764, 779 (2d Cir. 2007). We do not think that the district court abused its discretion in this case, which was marked by a voluminous record that was reviewed by the court and upon which the parties based their arguments. See J.A. at 83-151 (transcript of September 19, 2014 district court proceedings). The plaintiffs principally rely on Sharkey v. Quarantillo, 541 F.3d 75 (2d Cir. 2008), in which we cautioned that \"[a] district court has discretion to hold a hearing to resolve factual disputes that bear on the court's jurisdiction, but where ... the case is at the pleading stage and no evidentiary hearings have been held, in reviewing the grant of a motion to dismiss ... we must accept as true all material facts alleged in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff\u2019s favor.\u201d Id. at 83 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Sharkey is inap-posite because here, unlike in Sharkey, the plaintiffs dispute the district court\u2019s factual findings made pursuant to deciding, inter alia, JPMorgan\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on the plaintiffs\u2019 turnover claims on the ground that there are no assets subject to turnover located in the United States. Peterson II, 2015 WL 731221, at *10, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20640. Moreover, it is within the district court\u2019s discretion to decide disputed jurisdictional facts, even at the motion to dismiss stage, without holding an evidentiary hearing where, as here, the court \u201cconsid-erad] all the submissions of the parties\u201d and it \u201chas not [been] shown that a hearing was necessary because the resolution of factual issues was not readily ascertainable from the declarations of witnesses or turned on questions of credibility.\u201d Filetech S.A. v. Fr. Telecom S.A., 304 F.3d 180, 183 (2d Cir. 2002) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, we have previously stated in the context of an FSIA claim that \u201d[o]n a Rule 12(b)(1) motion challenging the district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction, the court may resolve disputed jurisdictional fact issues by referring to evidence outside of the pleadings, such as affidavits, and if necessary, hold an evidentiary hearing.\u201d Zappia Middle East Constr.

The amended complaint contained several fraudulent-conveyance claims: First, the plaintiffs alleged that Iran, Markazi, Clear-stream, and UBAE \"engaged in a conspiracy to make fraudulent conveyances designed to avoid Iran\u2019s debt to [the] [plaintiffs and other creditors\u201d by transferring the bond proceeds \"from Markazi\u2019s account at Clearstream to the UBAE/Markazi [a]ccount at Clearstream\u201d in violation of DCL \u00a7 276, C.A. at 721, which states that \"[e]very conveyance made ... to hinder, delay, or defraud either present or future creditors\u201d shall be deemed \"fraudulent as to both present and future creditors,\u201d DCL \u00a7 276. Second, the plaintiffs alleged that the same transfer violated DCL \u00a7 273-a, C.A. at 724-25, which provides that \u201d[e]very conveyance made without fair consideration when the person making it is a defendant in an action for money damages or a judgment in such an action has been docketed against him, is fraudulent as to the plaintiff in that action without regard to the actual intent of the defendant if ... the defendant fails to satisfy the judgment,\u201d DCL \u00a7 273-a. Finally, the plaintiffs alleged that if the assets at issue are in fact located abroad, they are so located because of transfers that qualify as fraudulent conveyances under the DCL and common law. C.A. at 728-29. Each of the plaintiffs\u2019 fraudulent-conveyance claims seeks, inter alia, rescission of the allegedly fraudulent transfers.

As noted, whether the plaintiffs\u2019 fraudulent-conveyance claims are \"turnover\u201d claims as that term is iised in the UBAE settlement agreement is ambiguous, The distinction between fraudulent-conveyance and turnover claims.under New York law is also ambiguous. Although a turnover action may be based on and contain a fraudulent-conveyance allegation, a fraudulent-conveyance claim may also be pursued as a plenary action to avoid a transfer. See Bienstock v. Greycroft Partners, L.P., 128 A.D.3d 459, 459, 7 N.Y.S.3d 893, 893 (N.Y. App. Div. 1st Dep\u2019t 2015) (\"The motion court erred in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees since this is a turnover proceeding brought pursuant to [N.Y. C.P.L.R.] 5225(b) as opposed to an action or proceeding to set aside a fraudulent conveyance . (compare [DCL] \u00a7 276-a).\u201d). Thus, while we are sympathetic to UBAE\u2019s interpretation of \u201cturnover,\u201d the meaning of that term is ambiguous both as used in the UBAE Settlement Agreement and under state law.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"13\"> <p id=\"b109-13\" pgmap=\"109(31) 110(140)\">. The UBAE and Clearstream. settlement agreements are distinguishable inasmuch as the latter is unambiguous with respect to its release of certain claims. While the UBAE settlement agreement nebulously limits the plaintiffs to undefined \"turnover\u201d claims, C.A. at 1648, the Clearstream settlement agreement limits the .plaintiffs to defined \"[g]ar-nishee [a]ctions\u201d against \"Clearstream ... solely in its capacity as a garnishee,\u201d id. at 905 (emphasis omitted). Unlike the term \"turnover\u201d as used in the UBAE settlement agreement, the term \"[g]arnishee [ajctions\u201d is defined by the Clearstream settlement agreement and includes such actions only where \"Clearstream ... is named solely for the purpose of seeking an order directing that ... Clearstream ... perform an act that will have the effect of reversing a transfer between other parties that is found to have been a fraudulent transfer,\u201d Id. The plaintiffs\u2019 fraudulent-conveyance claims against Clearstream sought to accomplish more than permitted by the pertinent settlement agreement; the same cannot be said for the fraudulent-conveyance claims brought against UBAE.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"14\"> <p id=\"b111-7\" pgmap=\"111\">. A footnote in the plaintiffs\u2019 brief challenges Jonckheere\u2019s declarations as hearsay. See Pis.\u2019 Br. at 49 n.4. Even ignoring the significant record evidence that is independent and corroborative of Jonckheere\u2019s statements, the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge is meritless. \u2018\u2018[W]e afford district courts wide latitude in determining whether evidence is admissible,\u201d and \"review ... evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion, reversing only if we find manifest error.\u201d United States v.

The plaintiffs brought their state-law turnover claims under C.P.L.R. \u00a7\u00a7 5225, 5227. The former concerns the turnover of \"proper- . ty,\" including ''money or other personal property,\u201d N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 5225; the .latter concerns the turnover of \"debts owed to the judgment debtor,\u201d id. \u00a7 5227. Our analysis turns on \u00a7 5225. \"Although New York law draws a line between a debt owed to a judgment debtor and property owned by the judgment debtor but in the possession of another, that line can at times become too f\u00edne to distinguish.\u201d Alliance Bond Fund, Inc. v. Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S.A., 190 F.3d 16, 21 (2d Cir, 1990) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). We think that Iran\u2019s right to payment, held by Clearstream, falls on the \"property\u201d side of that blurred line. In ABKCO, the Court of Appeals held that a judgment debtor\u2019s right to payment under a licensing \u2018agreement was \u201cproperty\u201d because, like Markazi\u2019s interest in the right to payment held by Clearstream, it was an assignable interest.
