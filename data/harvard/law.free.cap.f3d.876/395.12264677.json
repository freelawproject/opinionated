Washington was convicted in New York of multiple counts of first- and second-degree burglary and first- and second-degree assault, as well as first-degree criminal sexual act and first-degree sexual abuse. He claims that the introduction at his trial, during the testimony of an expert lab analyst, of a case file concerning the DNA testing of Washington\u2019s buccal cheek swab and containing notations made by the expert\u2019s coworkers, \u201canalysts whom the State did not call to the stand,\u201d Pet\u2019r\u2019s Br. 2, violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him, as clearly established by Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 174 L.Ed.2d 314 (2009), and Bullcoming v. Neto Mexico, 564 U.S. 647, 131 S.Ct. 2705, 180 L.Ed.2d 610 (2011). The district court denied the petition, but granted Washington a certificate of appealability. Washington v. Griffin, 142 F.Supp.3d 291, 297 (E.D.N.Y. 2015). We conclude that Washington has not shown, as he must, that the state court either: (1) \u201carrive[d] at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme] Court on a question of law or ... decide[d] a case differently than [the Supreme Court] on a set of materially indistinguishable facts\u201d; or (2) \u201cunreasonably applie[d] [the correct governing legal] principle to the facts\u201d of this case. Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p> <p id=\"b423-5\" pgmap=\"423\">BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"Ada\" pgmap=\"423\">I. Factual Background<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b423-6\" pgmap=\"423\">Washington was charged with multiple felony counts\u2014three counts each of first- and second-degree burglary, two counts each of first- and second-degree assault, first-degree criminal sexual act, and first-degree sexual abuse\u2014in connection with three separate home invasions that took place over the course of eleven months between August 2006 and July 2007 in adjacent neighborhoods in Queens, New York. DNA evidence was recovered from each of the three crime scenes, as recounted below. Washington was charged when, as stipulated at trial, a DNA profile based on the DNA evidence recovered at each crime scene was found to match his profile, contained in the New York State DNA Index.</p> <p id=\"b423-10\" pgmap=\"423\">A. The Crimes</p> <p id=\"b423-11\" pgmap=\"423\">1. The T-Shirt Evidence</p> <p id=\"b423-12\" pgmap=\"423\">The first set of crimes occurred around 2:00 a.m. on August 17, 2006, when an off-duty New York City Police Department (\u201cNYPD\u201d) detective who lived alone, awoke to find an intruder in her bedroom rifling through her jewelry box. The detective described the intruder, who gained access to her home through a kitchen window, as a slender black man with cornrows wearing a white t-shirt, denim shorts, and a black stocking cap with a knot at the top. The cap covered the intruder\u2019s face and he wore socks on his hands.</p> <p id=\"b423-13\" pgmap=\"423(94) 424(155)\">When the NYPD officer attempted to retrieve a firearm from the nightstand beside her bed, the intruder approached and they struggled for the weapon. Calling her a \u201cbitch\u201d and a \u201cstupid fat bitch,\u201d the intruder viciously beat the detective on the head, first with his hands and eventually with the gun, so hard she bled into her eyes and could not see. Trial Tr. 494. The struggle and beating continued into the hallway and then the bathroom. Demanding money, the intruder pushed his victim into the bathtub and asserted that he had been watching her , and knew that she was \u201csome, police type bitch.\u201d Id. at 495. When he left her alone in the bathroom (apparently so that he could search for cash), the detective attempted to get up but slipped on the rim of the bathtub, which, was wet with her blood. The intruder returned to the bathroom and scolded her to stay put, stomping on the woman and dumping the contents of her handbag over her. When the intruder again left her alone, the detective used the cellphone that had fallen from her bag to call 911. By the time help arrived, the intruder had left the scene. Emergency responders took the victim to the hospital, where she was admitted and treated for her wounds. When she eventually returned to her apartment, the detective discovered that the intruder had taken jewelry, her police shield, her gun, and an NYPD-issued MetroCard,</p> <p id=\"b424-4\" pgmap=\"424\">During an early morning search of the area near the victim\u2019s home in the hours after the crime, a police officer observed a white t-shirt and a\u2018white sock, both apparently covered in blood, and a stocking cap. Officers photographed, collected, and documented these items. Eventually, analysts at the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (\u201cOCME\u201d), an accredited lab affiliated with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, tested these items for DNA evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Prom scrapings taken from the neck of the t-shirt, the OCME analysts developed a DNA profile of a then-unknown male individual.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b424-5\" pgmap=\"424\">2. The Glove Evidence</p> <p id=\"Asq\" pgmap=\"424\">The second criminal incident occurred on December 5, 2006, about four months later, and was discovered when a working mother returned home, accompanied by family, to find her house in disarray. Her handbag had been emptied out, and someone had. strewn her earrings .around the living room. Several items\u2014sneakers, multiple \u2022 video gaming systems, and two watches\u2014were gone. A window in the dining room had been forced open.</p> <p id=\"b424-8\" pgmap=\"424\">Two gloves that did not'belong to any of the home\u2019s occupants were recovered at the scene. Police officers collected the gloves and sent them to OCME for DNA testing. OCME analysts determined that, while there was a mixture of DNA present on each glove, both had the same major donor. A male DNA profile was generated from glove scrapings.</p> <p id=\"b424-9\" pgmap=\"424\">8. The Iced-Tea Container Evidence</p> <p id=\"b424-10\" pgmap=\"424\">Finally, on the afternoon of July 15, 2007, the third victim, who was alone at home at the\u2019time of the crime, had just awakened and was watching television in bed when a male intruder appeared in her bedroom. The intruder, a black male with cornrows, wore her long white bathrobe, and had covered his face with a towel or t-shirt. The third victim, like the first, noticed that the intruder wore socks on his hands.</p> <p id=\"b424-11\" pgmap=\"424(50) 425(97)\">The intruder violently assaulted this third victim, placing his hand over her mouth and pushing her face into a pillow to muffle her screams, before pulling her off the bed by her hair and pressing his penis between her buttocks. The victim, who was pregnant at the time, used her hands to shield her stomach during this assault. When she resisted the intruder, he punched the side of her head, causing her to see stars, and tied a t-shirt around her face. The intruder repeatedly called the victim a bitch and also demanded money. At one point during the attack, the intruder dragged the woman into the kitchen, where he removed a container of iced tea from the refrigerator and took several gulps from it\u2014spitting some of the tea onto her leg. The assailant then dragged her back to the bedroom, where he began choking her.</p> <p id=\"b425-5\" pgmap=\"425\">The victim defecated on hers\u00e9lf at this assault, enraging the intruder who called her a \u201cnasty bitch,\u201d dragged her by the hair into the bathroom, threw her in the shower, and told her to clean herself. Id. at 719. The intruder then dragged her back to the bedroom and continued his attack; warning her that if she didn\u2019t stop whimpering he would kill her. When the victim again defecated upon being choked, the intruder hit her on the face, returned her to the bathroom, and left her on the toilet. Once he left the bathroom, the woman locked the door behind him. While he banged on the door, threatening to kill her, she opened the bathroom window, which was eight feet above the ground, and jumped out, landing on her back. Scantily clad and covered in blood and feces, she crawled on her hands and knees across the concrete to the front of the house, and then ran across the street to a neighbor\u2019s home for help.</p> <p id=\"b425-6\" pgmap=\"425\">The neighbor called 911, noting, as she did so, an individual in a white robe scaling the fence behind the victim\u2019s home. An ambulance took the victim to the hospital where medical personnel treated her injuries and monitored her unborn child during the next few days. She never returned to the residence, but when friends eventually retrieved her things, and she was able to go through them, she discovered that her eyeglasses, jewelry, and some money had been - taken. While processing . the crime scene, a police officer collected an iced-tea container from the \"bedroom, which the victim identified at trial. The police sent the iced-tea container to OCME for testing. The OCME DNA lab developed a male DNA profile from amylase taken from the container.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b425-8\" pgmap=\"425\">B. The DNA Evidence</p> <p id=\"b425-9\" pgmap=\"425\">1. The DNA Index Match .</p> <p id=\"b425-10\" pgmap=\"425\">At trial, the parties stipulated that Washington was not an identical twin and that, had witnesses been called from the New York State Police Forensic Biology Laboratory, these witnesses would have offered evidence establishing that \u201cthe male DNA profile developed by [OCMEj\u2019s DNA laboratory from the evideh'ce contained in FB06-14709, scrapings from the neck of white T-shirt, FB07-2443, scrapings from the glove, and FB07-1469, amylase from ice[d-]tea container, was uploaded into [the] New York State DNA Index in Albany.\u201d Joint App\u2019x 23. The profile from the crime-scene evidence was then compared to known individuals in that database. The database included Washington\u2019s DNA profile. The parties stipulated that \u201cthe New York' State DNA Index revealed that the male DNA profile developed from the evidence described above matched the defendant, Kenneth Washington\u2019s, DNA profile contained in the New York State DNA Index.\u201d Id. at 24. DNA Index personnel informed the NYPD of the match.</p> <p id=\"b425-11\" pgmap=\"425(19) 426(29)\">Washington was arrested. After Washington\u2019s arrest, Detective Patrick Curran, who testified at trial, used a buccal swab to take a DNA sample from Washington pursuant to a court order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Detective Curran sent the buccal swab in a sealed envelope to the OCME DNA lab for testing.</p> <p id=\"b426-4\" pgmap=\"426\">2. Yanojfs Analysis of the DNA Evidence</p> <p id=\"b426-5\" pgmap=\"426\">At Washington\u2019s trial, the state relied on the testimony of Natalyn Yanoff, a Level Three Criminalist with OCME, who testified as an expert in the field of DNA analysis, forensic biology, and the statistical significance of DNA profiles, to establish that the DNA profiles developed from the evidence recovered at each crime scene matched the DNA profile of Washington developed from the buccal swab. Yanoff testified that as a Level Three Criminalist, she not only \u201cmanage[s] [her] own cases in which [she] interpret[s] DNA results, writefs] reports, and testifies] in court if needed,\u201d she also supervises others in the use of various DNA techniques, coordinating the lab\u2019s work flow and reviewing test results. Joint App\u2019x 26. She testified generally about DNA and about the process used by her lab to develop DNA profiles.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b426-6\" pgmap=\"426\">Yanoff testified that as to the first crime-scene evidence, she cut or scraped samples from the t-shirt, the sock, and the stocking cap, after receiving these items in sealed condition in the lab. She submitted cuttings of apparent blood stains on the t-shirt and also scraped the collar, \u201can area [in] which we expect,\u201d she testified, \u201cmore cells will be found ... since that area rubs against the neck.\u201d Id. at 52. She testified about her analysis of the t-shirt scrapings, which were determined to contain a mix-toe of cells from the victim and from a then-unknown male. These processes produced sufficient material for the OCME lab to develop a profile of the unknown male, which was placed in a database containing all the DNA profiles generated in her lab.</p> <p id=\"b426-10\" pgmap=\"426\">Yanoff testified that the analysis of the iced-tea container in the third victim\u2019s residence took place some nine months later, and that when the profile from this sample was uploaded into the database, \u201cwe found out that it match[ed] the DNA profile that we found in the previous case.\u201d Id. at 65. The male DNA profile developed from the glove scrapings in the second home invasion similarly \u201cmatched the DNA profile that we saw on [the] ice[d] tea container and ... on the T-shirt.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Joint App\u2019x 75. Yanoff testified that she had calculated how often this specific profile could be expected to appear in the human population, and that this combination of alleles would be expected to be found in approximately \u201cone in greater than [a] trillion individuals.\u201d Id. at 77.</p> <p id=\"b426-11\" pgmap=\"426(28) 427(197)\">Yanoff made clear that as to the' gloves and iced-tea container recovered from the second and third crime scenes, she did not personally prepare the samples for testing. (Regarding the crime-scene evidence generally, Yanoff does not appear to have personally performed the tasks necessary to extract the DNA from the cells or to amplify those portions to be analyzed, nor did she necessarily make the initial assessment as to the alleles to be found at particular loci.) Yanoff explained that her lab works \u201cthe same way as ... [an] assembly line,\u201d with a group of analysts assigned to specific tests each week, but with an interpreting analyst and at least one supervisor, at the end, reviewing all the raw data associated with a given sample and \u201cmakfing] conclusions on the findings.\u201d Id. at 39. Yanoff testified that she was \u201cfamiliar with each and every page, specifically each and every report and analysis\u201d generated in regards to the laboratory testing of both .the crime-scene evidence and the buccal swab. Id. at 45; see also id. at 79. Yanoff indicated that she personally reviewed the raw data resulting from all the DNA sampling, reaching her own conclusions based on that data and comparing the DNA profiles developed from each of the crime scenes and from the swab.</p> <p id=\"b427-5\" pgmap=\"427\">During Yanoff s testimony, the state offered four OCME ease files (corresponding to each of the three crime scenes and to the buccal swab), each containing a report from Yanoff as to her conclusions, as well as lab materials related to the DNA testing associated with each file. Only the case file related to the buccal swab is relevant here.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> With regard to each case file, Yanoff testified that she examined each page in the file, considered the raw data, and reached her own conclusions based on the data in the file. She also testified as to the foundation for the file\u2019s admission as a business record. As relevant here, Washington argued that admission of the buccal swab case file violated his Confrontation Clause rights because Yanoff had not personally tested the swab, but relied on data generated by other analysts. The \u25a0 trial court nonetheless admitted this file along with the files regarding the profiles developed from each crime scene.</p> <p id=\"b427-8\" pgmap=\"427\">The OCME case file regarding the testing of Washington\u2019s buccal swab contains several documents. The first page is a \u201cCertification as a Business Record\u201d indicating the records in the file \u201cwere prepared by [OCME] in the regular course of business within the Department of Forensic Biology.\u201d Id. at 381. The next document is the four-page \u201cLaboratory Report,\u201d signed by Yanoff. This document identifies the suspect (Kenneth Washington) and summarizes Yanoffs conclusion\u2014that the DNA alleles from the buccal swab taken from Washington match the \u201cDNA alleles of the male donor\u201d from each of the three crime scene-derived profiles. Id. at 382.</p> <p id=\"b427-9\" pgmap=\"427\">Several documents follow, including, inter alia: evidence tracking forms bearing chain of .custody notations of various sorts; a \u201cSchedule of Analysis\u201d indicating procedures the sample was to \u25a0 undergo; a \u201cDNA/Serology Submission Tracking &amp; Productivity Form\u201d indicating that one item was examined, toro samples were submitted for DNA extraction, two samples were submitted for quantitation, and two samples were amplified and analyzed at sixteen loci each, two documents each labeled \u201cControl Review Worksheet\u201d stating that. .several tests were passed, and an \u201cExemplar Evidence Packaging and Exam Worksheet\u201d noting that the cheek- swab was packaged in a white paper envelope approximately 9x6 inches in size that was sealed with tape and had various information written on it.</p> <p id=\"b428-3\" pgmap=\"428\">Yanoff affirmed that the case file reflected-the testing of the buccal swab submitted to the lab by Detective Curran as a vouchered piece of evidence and received in a sealed envelope. She made clear that she - was not personally involved in the DNA testing of the buccal swab, noting that items of evidence are examined in a different area from samples of known individuals, and that a \u201cdifferent group of people ... perform[s the] testing of samples of known individuals.\u201d Id. at 62-63. Yanoff described the procedures used for testing known samples, indicating that \u201ctwo separate testing[s] at ... different times would occur.\u201d Id. at 82. She also testified that she personally' had reviewed the raw data connected with the swab\u2019s testing and that after reviewing this data, she had compared the DNA profile generated from the buccal swab to the evidence contained in each of the three crime-scene flies. She affirmed that the DNA profiles from each of the three crime scenes and' from, the buccal swab Were the sanie, and she concluded, t\u00f3 a reasonable degree of scientific certainty; that-Washington-was the source of the DNA on the \u2018t-shirt, the gloves, and the iced-tea container.</p> <p id=\"b428-4\" pgmap=\"428\">II. Procedural History</p> <p id=\"b428-5\" pgmap=\"428\">Washington was convicted on all counts on January 19, 2011, at the conclusion of his jury trial. He-was thereafter sentenced principally to ninety years in prison. Washington appealed,' and on July 3, 2013, the Appellate Division affirmed his conviction. With' respect to Washington\u2019s Confrontation Clause claim, the Appellate Division stated:</p> <blockquote id=\"b428-6\" pgmap=\"428\">The court properly admitted files prepared by the New York City Medical Examiner\u2019s Office containing DNA profiles derived from the testing of evidence recovered from the crime scenes, since the documents containing the DNA profiles, which were prepared prior to the defendant\u2019s arrest, \u201cdid not,. standing alone, link him to the crime.\u201d The testimony of the People\u2019s expert witness established that she conducted the critical analysis at issue by comparing the DNA profiles derived from the crime scene evidence to the defendant\u2019s DNA profile and concluding that all of the profiles matched. Moreover, the DNA profile generated from the swab of the defendant\u2019s cheek, standing alone, shed no light on the issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt in the absence of the expert\u2019s testimony that it matched the profiles derived from the crime scene evidence.</blockquote> <p id=\"b428-8\" pgmap=\"428\">People v. Washington, 108 A.D.3d 576, 968 N.Y.S.2d 184, 186-87 (2d Dep\u2019t 2013) (citations and brackets omitted) (quoting People v. Dail, 69 A.D.3d 873, 894 N.Y.S.2d 78, 80 (2d Dep\u2019t 2010)). Washington sought leave to appeal the Appellate Division\u2019s decision; which the New York -Court of Appeals denied on January 31,2014.</p> <p id=\"b428-9\" pgmap=\"428(153) 429(43)\">In federal court, in his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, Washington argued before Judge Block that the admission at trial of the OCME file regarding the testing of his cheek swab' and, in particular, the DNA profile that this testing produced \u201cviolated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation because he was not afforded the opportunity to cross-examine the lab technicians who generated [the profile].\u201d Washington v. Griffin, 142 F.Supp.3d 291, 292 (E.D.N.Y. 2015). The district court held that in light of the lack-of clarity in the Supreme Court\u2019s case law on the interaction between scientific report evidence and the Confrontation Clause, as well as the factual 'similarities between Washington\u2019s claim and the one rejected in Williams v. Illinois, 567 U.S. 50, 132 S.Ct. 2221, 183 L.Ed.2d 89 (2012), the Appellate Division\u2019s decision, which both cited Williams and, according to the district court, \u201cmirrored [its] disposition,\u201d was not an unreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court precedent. Washington, 142 F.Supp.3d at 297. The district court nonetheless granted Washington a certificate of appealability. Id. Washington timely filed a notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his petition.</p> <p id=\"b429-5\" pgmap=\"429\">DISCUSSION</p> <p id=\"b429-6\" pgmap=\"429\"> We review de novo a district court\u2019s disposition of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Tavarez v. Larkin, 814 F.3d 644, 648 (2d Cir. 2016). When the petitioner presses a claim that was \u201cadjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings,\u201d as here, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 8, 18, 22, 28 and 42 U.S.C.), \u201cobliges federal courts to give deference to state courts\u2019 decisions,\u201d Chrysler v. Guiney, 806 F.3d 104, 117 (2d Cir. 2015), issuing a writ of habeas corpus only when the state-court adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision- that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p> <p id=\"b429-7\" pgmap=\"429\"> A principle is \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d for .\u00a7 2254(d)(1) .purposes \u201conly when it is embodied in a [Supreme Court] holding,\u201d Thaler v. Haynes, 559 U.S. 43, 47, 130 S.Ct. 1171, 175 L.Ed.2d 1003 (2010), framed at the appropriate level of generality, see Nevada v. Jackson, 569 U.S. 505, 133 S.Ct. 1990, 1994, 186 L.Ed.2d 62 (2013) (per curiam) (noting that framing Supreme Court precedent at too high a level of generality risks \u201ctransform[ing] even the most imaginative extension of existing case law into \u2018clearly established Federal law, as determined, by the Supreme Court\u2019 \u201d (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1))). A state court decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d such clearly established law when the, state court \u201ceither has arrived at a conclusion that is the \u2018opposite\u2019 of the conclusion reached by the Supreme Court on a question of law or has \u2018decided a case differently than the Supreme Court has on a set of. materially indistinguishable facts.\u2019\u201d Smith v. Wenderlich, 826 F.3d 641, 649 (2d Cir. 2016) (brackets omitted) (quoting Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 412-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000)). An unreasonable application occurs when \u201cthe state court correctly identifies the governing legal principle ... but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular case,\u201d Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 694, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002), so that \u201cthe state court\u2019s ruling on the claim ... was so lacking in justification that there was an' error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded ; disagreement,\u201d Harrington v.

VI; see Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 403, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965). In Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), the Supreme Court rejected its earlier view that out-of-court statements falling within a firmly rooted hearsay exception satisfy Confrontation Clause concerns, see Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), and \u201cadopted a fundamentally new interpretation of the confrontation right,\u201d Williams v. Illinois, 567 U.S. 50, 132 S.Ct. 2221, 2232, 183 L.Ed.2d 89 (2012) (plurality opinion). The Court held that the Confrontation Clause prohibits admission at trial of out-of-court testimonial statements against a criminal defendant unless the declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him. Crawford, 541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354. The Crawford Court, observing that there are various ways to define \u201ctestimonial,\u201d declined to settle on a precise articulation of the term, id. at 51-52, 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354, resulting in a \u201csteady stream of new cases,\u201d Williams, 132 S.Ct. at 2232. Most recently, the Supreme Court has noted that \u201cunder our precedents, a statement cannot fall within the Confrontation Clause unless its primary purpose was testimonial\u201d\u2014that is, in light of all the relevant circumstances, viewed objectively, the statement was made or procured with a primary purpose of \u201c \u2018creating] an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony.\u2019 \u201d Ohio v. Clark, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2173, 2180, 192 L.Ed.2d 306 (2015) (quoting Michigan v. Bryant, 562 U.S. 344, 358, 131 S.Ct. 1143, 179 L.Ed.2d 93 (2011)). And even then, the Court observed, the Clause does not \u201cbar[ ] every statement that satisfies the \u2018primary purpose\u2019 test,\u201d pointing specifically to out-of-court statements \u201cthat would have been admissible in a criminal case at the time of the founding.\u201d Id.</p> <p id=\"b430-9\" pgmap=\"430\"> To establish his Confrontation Clause claim, Washington relies primarily on the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming, which addressed the meaning of \u201ctestimonial\u201d in the context of laboratory testing of, respectively, purported narcotics and actual blood, for its blood alcohol content. At the start, however, both cases are sufficiently distinguishable from the circumstances here as to draw into question Washington\u2019s contention that the Appellate Division, in rejecting his claim based on these cases, unreasonably applied clearly established Federal law or acted contrary to it. See \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p> <p id=\"b430-10\" pgmap=\"430(110) 431(109)\">Melendez-Diaz was a narcotics case in which the prosecution introduced into evidence multiple bags of purported cocaine that had been in the possession of the defendant and his associates. The Supreme Court held that the sworn, notarized certificates of lab analysts, each reporting on the weight of the bags and affirming that the contents had been examined and determined, in fact, to be cocaine, were testimonial, and could not be admitted at trial absent the defendant\u2019s opportunity to cross-examine the declarants. 557 U.S. at 308, 310-11, 129 S.Ct. 2527. In reaching this conclusion, the Court observed that the analysts\u2019 reports\u2014titled \u201ccertificates of analysis\u201d\u2014were \u201cquite plainly\u201d affidavits, that is, \u201cdeclarations of facts written down and sworn to by the declarants before an officer authorized to administer oaths,\u201d and \u201cfunctionally identical\u201d to \u201clive, in-court testimony.\u201d Id. at 308, 310-11, 129 S.Ct. 2527. Indeed, the \u201csole purpose of the affidavits\u201d under state law, the Court noted, \u201cwas to provide \u2018prima facie evidence of the composition, quality, and the net weight\u2019 of the analyzed substance[s],\u201d and it could be \u201csafely assume[d] that the analysts were aware of the affidavits\u2019 evi-dentiary purpose, since that purpose ... was reprinted on the affidavits themselves.\u201d Id. at 311, 129 S.Ct. 2527 (quoting Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 111, \u00a7 13).</p> <p id=\"b431-5\" pgmap=\"431\">Bullcoming was to similar effect. The Court held there that admission at trial of a lab report containing a testimonial certification that Bullcoming\u2019s blood-alcohol concentration was above the threshold for aggravated DWI was improper. The report in Bullcoming, although not notarized, otherwise closely resembled the \u201ccertificates of analysis\u201d in Melendez-Diaz: law enforcement had provided evidence to a state laboratory for testing, an analyst had tested the evidence and prepared a certificate attesting to the results, and this certificate was \u201cformalized,\u201d as the Bullcoming Court put it, \u201cin a signed document\u201d for the purpose of proving the facts it alleged in the context of a criminal proceeding.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Bullcoming, 564 U.S. at 664-65, 131 S.Ct. 2705. The Bullcoming Court concluded that \u201cthe formalities attending the \u2018report of blood alcohol analysis\u2019 [were] more than adequate to qualify [the analyst\u2019s] assertions as testimonial,\u201d and the report\u2019s admission was error, absent the declarant\u2019s unavailability and a showing of the defendant\u2019s prior opportunity to cross. Id. at 665, 131 S.Ct. 2705. The testimony of another analyst, who was familiar with the device used to test the blood and the lab\u2019s procedures but did not observe the test or have an \u201cindependent opinion,\u201d id. at 662, 131 S.Ct. 2705, concerning the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content, was insufficient to cure the problem. Id. at 662-63, 131 S.Ct. 2705.</p> <p id=\"b431-9\" pgmap=\"431\">The circumstances here are not the same. Washington does not rely on a lab analyst\u2019s affidavit, as in Melendez-Diaz, or on the formal certificate of an analyst attesting to his results, as in Bullcoming, to make out his Confrontation Clause claim. He instead points to a medley of unsworn, uncertified notations by often unspecified lab personnel, working, as Yanoff testified, \u201cthe same way as [an] assembly line.\u201d Joint App\u2019x 39. Such notations, standing alone, are potentially as suggestive of a purpose to record tasks, in order to accomplish the lab\u2019s work, as of any purpose to make an out-of-court statement for admission at trial. But as we stated in United States v. James, 712 F.3d 79 (2d Cir. 2013), Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming together suggest that a laboratory analysis is testimonial only when \u201cthe circumstances under which the analysis was prepared, viewed objectively, establish that the primary purpose of a reasonable analyst in the declarant\u2019s position would have been to create a record for use at a later criminal trial.\u201d Id. at 94.</p> <p id=\"b431-10\" pgmap=\"431\">II</p> <p id=\"b431-11\" pgmap=\"431(47) 432(116)\">The differences between Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming and the present case in themselves cast doubt on Washington\u2019s contention that he has satisfied \u00a7 2254(d)(l)\u2019s demanding standard. This conclusion becomes only clearer in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s more recent decision in Williams v. Illinois, 567 U.S. 50, 132 S.Ct. 2221, 183 L.Ed.2d 89 (2012), which presented facts closest to those here, \u201cWhen reviewing state criminal convictions on collateral review, federal judges,\u201d the Supreme Court has said, \u201care required to afford state courts due respect by overturning their decisions only when there could be no reasonable dispute that they were wrong.\u201d Woods v.

Fairly read, Melendez-Diaz, Bullcoming, and Williams together foreclose any such claim as to the Appellate Division\u2019s decision in Washington\u2019s case.</p> <p id=\"b432-8\" pgmap=\"432\">Williams involved a state DNA expert\u2019s testimony at a rape trial, that a DNA profile developed from the victim\u2019s vaginal swabs by an outside commercial lab matched the defendant\u2019s profile produced at the lab where the expert worked. 132 S.Ct. at 2227 (plurality opinion). During her testimony, the expert \u201cexplained the notations on documents admitted as business records stating that .,, vaginal swabs taken from the victim were sent to and received back from Cellmark,\u201d the outside lab. Id, She also referred to Cell-mark\u2019s DNA profile \u201cas having been produced from semen found on the victim\u2019s vaginal swabs,\u201d even though she had not conducted or observed the lab\u2019s work in developing the profile. Id,) see also id. at 2230. The Court affirmed' the conviction, determining that this testimony did not violate the Confrontation Clause despite the fact that no analyst from Cellmark testified about the lab\u2019s work. Id. at 2244. As we have previously acknowledged, however, in so concluding \u201c[t]he Court came to no clear consensus as to what constituted a testimonial statement in this context,\u201d James, 712 F.3d at 91.</p> <p id=\"b432-9\" pgmap=\"432\">The Williams plurality opinion, written by Justice Alito, offered two alternative bases for concluding the expert\u2019s testimony did not implicate the Confrontation Clause. -First, the plurality determined that to the extent the substance of the Cellmark report (which was not itself introduced into. evidence) was admitted, it was not admitted for its truth but rather as a basis for the expert witness\u2019s opinion that the DNA profile developed by Cell-mark matched the accused\u2019s DNA profile, 132 S.Ct. .at 2239-40. Second, the plurality alternatively concluded that even assuming the contents of the report were admitted for their truth, these contents were not testimonial because \u201cthe primary purpose of the Cellmark report, viewed objectively, was not to accuse [the] petitioner or to create evidence for use at trial.\u201d Id. at 2243. The plurality deemed it significant, inter alia, that when the Illinois State Police lab sent its sample to Cellmark for analysis, \u201cits primary, purpose was to catch a dangerous rapist who was still at large, not to obtain ,evidence for use against [the] petitioner, who was neither in custody nor under suspicion at that time.\u201d Id, More generally, the plurality noted that, as here, when \u201cnumerous technicians work on each DNA profile\u201d\u2014\u201c[w]hen the work of a lab is divided up in such a way\u201d\u2014\u201cit is likely that -the sole purpose of each technician\u201d is not to make statements for admission at trial, but \u201csimply to perform his or her task .in accordance with accepted procedures.\u201d Id. at 2244.</p> <p id=\"b432-10\" pgmap=\"432(57) 433(101)\">As Justice Kagan pointed out in dissent, neither of the plurality\u2019s rationales commanded a majority. Id. at 2277 (Kagan, dissenting). Justice Thomas rejected both of the plurality\u2019s proffered bases for the Court\u2019s holding but nevertheless concurred in the judgment, agreeing that no Confrontation Clause violation had occurred. See id. at 2255, 2256 (Thomas, concurring in the judgment). In Justice Thomas\u2019s view, the Confrontation Clause reaches only formalized testimonial materials. Id. Judged by this standard, the Cellmark report at issue was insufficiently formalized to qualify as testimonial because it \u201clack[ed] the solemnity of an affidavit or deposition, for it [was] neither a sworn nor a certified declaration of fact.\u201d Id. at 2260. Justice Thomas, noting that the report did not even \u201cattest that its statements accurately reflect the DNA testing processes used or the results obtained,\u201d deemed the Cell-mark report distinguishable from the certifications in Melendez-Diaz and Bullcom-ing on this ground. Id.</p> <p id=\"b433-5\" pgmap=\"433\">Against this backdrop, we cannot say, as AEDPA requires, that the Appellate Division ruling that Washington challenges\u2014 namely, that the admission of the OCME case file -about the DNA testing of his buccal swab did not offend the Confrontation Clause\u2014represented such an \u201c\u2018extreme malfunction[-]\u2019 \u201d in the state criminal justice system that \u201cthere , could be no reasonable dispute that [the state court] was wrong.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Donald, 135 S.Ct. at 1376 (quoting Harrington, 562 U.S. at 102, 131 S.Ct. 770 (quoting Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 332 n.5, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (Stevens, concurring in judgment))). Assuming arguendo that the case file here was admitted for its truth, the Supreme Court has never held that the Confrontation Clause requires an opportunity to cross examine each lab analyst involved in the process of generating a DNA profile and comparing it with another, nor has it held that uncertified, un-sworn notations of the sort at issue here are testimonial. As the Williams plurality observed, Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming \u201cheld that the particular forensic reports at issue qualified as testimonial statements, but the Court did not hold that all forensic reports fall into the same catego-ryJ\u2019 132 S.Ct. at 2243. Nor do the various Williams opinions settle the question. As Justice Breyer recognized in his concurrence, none of these opinions \u201cfully deals with the underlying question as to how, after Crawford, Confrontation Clause \u2018testimonial statement\u2019 requirements apply to crime laboratory reports.\u201d Id. at 2248 (Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment).</p> <p id=\"b433-8\" pgmap=\"433\">Ill</p> <p id=\"AJh\" pgmap=\"433\">A state court cannot be faulted for declining to apply a specific legal rule \u201cthat has not been squarely established by [the Supreme] Court,\u201d Harrington, 562 U.S. at 101, 131 S.Ct. 770 (quoting Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U.S. 111, 122, 129 S.Ct. 1411, 173 L.Ed.2d 251 (2009)), nor even for incorrectly applying an established rule where reasonable jurists could disagree as to its application. Id. at 102, 131 S.Ct. 770. Washington makes two main arguments in an effort to avoid the conclusion that these AEDPA principles are determinative of this appeal. Both derive from the proposition that William$ \u201cdid not alter the rule of Bullcoming and Melendez-Diaz\u201d with respect to the circumstances of his case. Pet\u2019r\u2019s Br. 25.</p> <p id=\"b433-11\" pgmap=\"433(23) 434(165)\">Recognizing that the majority decisions in both Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming applied to \u201cformalized out-of-court statements,\u201d id. at 46, and that Justice Thomas joined the majority opinions in both cases on this basis, Washington first asserts that, unlike the Cellmark report in Williams, the OCME case file regarding the testing of his buccal swab is, in fact, analogous to the lab analysts\u2019 affidavits in Melendez-Diaz and the testimonial certification in Bullcoming, even though the individual lab analysts here did not certify their results. This is because a \u201ccertifying agent of OCME signed a \u2018Certification as a Business Record\u2019 cover page to which the file was attached attesting to the fact that the within records had been prepared in the regular course of OCME business.\u201d Pet\u2019r\u2019s Br. 41. This certification, Washington contends, establishes that the out-of-court notations of the lab analysts here were, as in Melendez-Diaz, \u201cformalized testimonial materials,\u201d 557 U.S. at 310, 129 S.Ct. 2527 (quoting Crawford, 541 U.S. at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. 1354), rendering Williams inapplicable and the Appellate Division\u2019s decision to the contrary not merely erroneous but wrong beyond reasonable dispute.</p> <p id=\"b434-4\" pgmap=\"434\">We disagree. Both in the affidavits at issue in Melendez-Diaz and in the testimonial certification in Bullcoming, lab analysts affirmed, in essence, that they had performed particular tests, adhered to precise protocols, and produced specified results. As the Melendez-Diaz Court put it, the analysts\u2019 out-of-court \u201ccertificates\u201d were \u201cfunctionally identical to live, in-court testimony,\u201d id. at 310-311, 129 S.Ct. 2527, and the lab analysts \u201ccreate[d'] [them] for the sole purpose of providing evidence against a defendant,\u201d id. at 323, 129 S.Ct. 2527 (emphasis in original). Here, no lab analyst did any such thing: rather, a custodian attested in a business records certification that the OCME case file produced in court was a true copy of the original case file maintained by the OCME DNA lab, and that the file\u2019s contents were prepared -in the regular course of business.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Joint App\u2019x 381. To be clear, such a certification does not defeat a meritorious Confrontation Clause claim. At the same time, however, this certification\u2014a \u201ctraditionally admissible\u201d means, as Melendez-Diaz recognized, by which \u201c[a] clerk could by affidavit authenticate or provide a copy of an otherwise admissible record,\u201d 557 U.S. at 322-23, 129 S.Ct. 2527\u2014does not transform the underlying notations of the lab analysts into formalized testimonial materials. Nor does it place beyond reasonable dispute whether the lab notations satisfy the primary purpose test: whether, as the Court put it in Clark, they were made with a primary purpose of \u201ccreating] an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony,\u201d 135 S.Ct. at 2180 (internal quotation marks omitted), or instead, as the plurality suggested in Williams, for the purpose of \u201cperforming] \u25a0... task[s] in accordance with accepted procedures,\u201d 132 S.Ct. at 2244.</p> <p id=\"b434-8\" pgmap=\"434(110) 435(48)\">Washington next argues that even if Williams, with its discordant opinions, changed \u201cthe rule of Bullcoming and Melendez-Diaz,\u201d it merely narrowed the definition of \u201ctestimonial\u201d and the evidence in his case falls within that narrowed definition. Pet\u2019r\u2019s Br. 25. He contends that the \u201cclearly established\u201d rule of this precedent is \u201cthat formalized out-of-court statements made by forensic analysts that have the primary purpose of building a case against a targeted individual\u201d are testimonial, and so subject to the Confrontation Clause. Id. at 46. Any confusion emanating from the fractured Williams Court, Washington argues, relates only to \u201chow far beyond the targeted suspect scenario the primary purpose test reaches.\u201d Id. at 35. Moreover, Washington contends that his case falls within the \u201ctargeted suspect scenario\u201d because his buccal swab was tested after the match between his DNA profile in the New York State DNA Index and the crime-scene evidence profiles led to his arrest.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b435-4\" pgmap=\"435\">This argument, too, is. unavailing. The Supreme Court has unequivocally stated that a principle is \u201cclearly established\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 2254(d)(1) \u201conly when it is embodied in a [Supreme. Court] holding.\u201d Haynes, 559 U.S. at 47, 130 S.Ct. 1171 (emphasis added). We have already noted the difficulty in identifying a single holding of principle from the several opinions of the fractured Williams Court, using the analytic approach that the Supreme Court recommends. See James, 712 F.3d at 95 (citing Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977)); see also Williams, 132 S.Ct. at 2277 (Kagan, J., dissenting) (noting that Williams leaves \u201csignificant confusion in [its] wake,\u201d making apparent that Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming \u201cno longer mean all that they say\u201d without clarifying \u201cin what way or to what extent they are altered\u201d). Indeed, the supposedly clear rule that Washington discerns in Williams runs counter to the opinion of a majority of Justices there: thus, both Justice Thomas in his concurrence and Justice Kagan in-her dissent specifically reject the proposition that Confrontation Clause protections should be limited to circumstances in which a suspect has been identified, see 132 S.Ct. at 2262 (Thomas, /., concurring in the judgment) (rejecting the \u201ctargeted individual\u201d theory of Confrontation Clause protections as \u201clacking] any grounding in constitutional text, in history, or in logic\u201d); id. at 2274 (Kagan, J., dissenting) (rejecting the theory as insufficiently addressing reliability concerns), and Justice Thomas alone subscribes to the view that the Clause reaches only formalized materials. It is therefore difficult to see how Washington\u2019s purported rule could be \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p> <p id=\"b435-9\" pgmap=\"435(153) 436(48)\">Moreover, even were we to assume that this is not a problem\u2014that we may in theory take as clearly established a narrowed version of \u201ctestimonial\u201d emanating from the plurality opinion, plus Justice Thomas\u2019s concurrence\u2014Washington fails to show that reasonable jurists would all agree as to the narrowed rule to be drawn from the plurality opinion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Harrington, 562 U.S. at 102, 131 S.Ct. 770 (noting that if AEDP\u00c1\u2019s standard \u201cis difficult to meet, that is because it was meant to be\u201d). The Williams plurality clearly stated that in \u201cidentifying the primary purpose of an out-of-court statement,\u201d courts are to \u201clook for the primary purpose that' a reasonable person would have ascribed to the statement, taking into account all of the surrounding circumstances.\u201d 132 S.Ct. at 2243 (emphasis added). As Washington notes, one circumstance supporting the plurality\u2019s conclusion that the primary purpose of the Cellmark report was not \u201cto create evidence for use at trial\u201d was that the analysts in Williams were testing the sample there in an effort to identify a still-at-large rapist. Id. Significantly, however, the plurality opinion at no point affirms that in the \u201ctargeted suspect scenario,\u201d the Confrontation Clause necessarily applies.</p> <p id=\"b436-4\" pgmap=\"436\">And Washington ignores other aspects of what the plurality opinion does, in fact, say. As to DNA testing in particular, the plurality also deemed' it \u201csignificant\u201d that when the work of a lab is divided up among a number of analysts, the likelihood is that the only purpose of each analyst is \u201cto perform his or her task in accordance with accepted procedures\u201d\u2014at least suggesting that in such circumstances, the primary purpose of out-of-court notations may not be testimonial, regardless whether a suspect has been identified.

(quoting Bryant, 131 S.Ct. at 1167 (Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment)).</p> <p id=\"b436-5\" pgmap=\"436\">In such circumstances, we agree with the district court that \u201cwhether the plurality would hold that the primary purpose of those preparing Washington\u2019s DNA profile implicated the Confrontation Clause, is, at the very least, debatable.\u201d Washington, 142 F.Supp.3d at 296; see also Harrington, 562 U.S. at 98, 131 S.Ct. 770 (noting that for claims adjudicated on the merits in state court, \u201cthe habeas petitioner\u2019s burden .,. must be met by showing there was no reasonable basis for the state court to deny relief\u2019). We also concur in that court\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[cjonsidering the lack of clarity in the Supreme Court\u2019s Confrontation Clause jurisprudence, and in light of the factual similarities between Williams and the present case,\u201d the Appellate Division\u2019s decision here cannot be deemed an, unreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court precedent, Washington, 142 F.Supp.3d at 297; see \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p> <p id=\"b436-7\" pgmap=\"436\">\u2021 \u2021 \u215c</p> <p id=\"b436-8\" pgmap=\"436\">To be clear, our conclusion today is narrow. We note that the New York Court of Appeals recently decided in People v. John, 27 N.Y.3d 294, 33 N.Y.S.3d 88, 52 N.E.3d 1114 (2016), that where the generation of a DNA profile is testimonial\u2014as it concluded the profile there was\u2014\u201cat least one analyst with the requisite personal knowledge must testify.\u201d Id. at 313, 33 N.Y.S.3d 88, 52 N.E.3d 1114. The John Court rejected an \u201call 'analysts\u201d rule and concluded that nothing in the record before it suggested that the analysts involved in the \u201cpreliminary testing stages\u201d of \u201cextraction, quantitation or amplification\u201d were necessary witnesses. Id. Instead, the \u201canalyst who witnessed, performed or supervised the generation of defendant\u2019s DNA profile, or who used his or her independent analysis 'on the raw data\u201d' should testify. Id. at 315, 33 N.Y.S.3d 88, 52 N.E.3d 1114. The State argues here that Yanoff satisfies this criterion because she testified that she consulted the raw data, reached her own conclusions, and personally reviewed and compared the profile from the buccal swab to the profiles generated from the crime-scene evidence.</p> <p id=\"b436-9\" pgmap=\"436(92) 437(129)\">We need not and do not decide whether this case meets the New York State standard. As the New York Court of Appeals noted in John, courts around the country are assessing the scope of Confrontation Clause rights in the context of DNA evidence in the wak\u00e9 of Williams. Id. at 314-15, 33 N.Y.S.3d 88, 52 N.E.3d 1114; see, e.g., State v. Norton, 443 Md. 517, 117 A.3d 1055, 1058 (2015); Commonwealth v. Yohe, 621 Pa. 527, 79 A.3d 520 (2013). Our task here is more circumscribed: to assess whether the Appellate Division\u2019s merits determination, was \u201ccontrary to, .or involved. an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Like the district court, we cannot conclude that Washington has sustained his burden of showing that the Appellate Division applied a rule \u201ccontradict[ing] the governing law set forth in [the Supreme Court\u2019s cases],\u201d or that it \u201cconfronted] a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a . [Supreme Court] decision\u201d and arrived at a different result. Taylor, 529 U.S. at 405-06, 120 S.Ct. 1495. Nor is the Appellate Division\u2019s decision \u201cso lacking in justification\u201d as to constitute an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law \u201cbeyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d Harrington, 562 U.S. at 103, 131 S.Ct. 770.</p> <p id=\"b437-6\" pgmap=\"437\">CONCLUSION</p> <p id=\"b437-7\" pgmap=\"437\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Washington\u2019s petition.</p> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b423-7\" pgmap=\"423\">.

There are several steps to developing a DNA profile, some or all of which may be performed by different analysts, and multiple times. When evidence is submitted for testing, analysts prepare a sample and then extract DNA from the cells in the sample. If there is enough DNA to proceed, analysts then make millions of copies of portions of the DNA, which is called amplification. Next, analysts, focusing on the very small percent of DNA that varies from person to person, examine the DNA to determine what alleles are present at specific locations, called loci. (Alleles are alternative forms of a gene found at a particular locus on the DNA strand.) The resulting DNA profile is a string of numbers representing the particular alleles found at each of the tested locations.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"7\"> <p id=\"b426-13\" pgmap=\"426\">.Yanoff affirmed that the evidentiary items from each crime scene \"were never at the lab at the same time.\u201d Id. at 78.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"8\"> <p id=\"b427-6\" pgmap=\"427\">.

Although Washington has failed to meet AEDPA's exacting standard for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, we note that the Appellate Division erred insofar as it held that DNA profiles, as a categorical matter, are non-testimonial because \"standing alone, [they] shed no light on the issue of the defendant's guilt.\u201d As previously noted, see supra at 402, at least five Justices in Williams (Justice Thomas in' his concurrence and those joining Justice Kagan\u2019s dissent) agreed that the introduction of DNA profiles could, under proper circumstances, run afoul of the Confrontation Clause.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"11\"> <p id=\"b434-5\" pgmap=\"434\">.

In addition, even taking as clearly established Washington's purported rule (that \"for- \u2022 malized out-of-court statements by forensic analysts that have the primary purpose of building a case against a targeted individual are testimonial,\u201d Pet\u2019r\u2019s Br. 25), Washington\u2014as we noted above\u2014does not show that the analysts\u2019 notations were \"formalized\u201d for the purposes of Justice Thomas\u2019s concurrence, much less does he put this issue beyond possibility of \"fairminded disagreement,\u201d see Harrington, 562 U.S. at 103, 131 S.Ct. 770.</p> </footnote> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\"> <author id=\"b437-8\" pgmap=\"437\">KATZMANN, Chief Judge,</author> <p id=\"ASHg\" pgmap=\"437\">concurring:</p> <p id=\"ACIz\" pgmap=\"437\">Mindful of AEDPA\u2019s \u201cintentionally difficult [standard] to meet,\u201d Woods v. Donald, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 1372, 1376, 191 L.Ed.2d 464 (2015) '(internal quotation marks omitted), I concur in full with the Court\u2019s opinion. I write separately to raise a pragmatic suggestion for future prosecutions. Given the Supreme Court\u2019s fractured disposition in Williams and the New York Court of Appeals\u2019 recent holding in People v. John, 27 N.Y.3d 294, 33 N.Y.S.3d 88, 52 N.E.3d 1114 (2016), legal and practical issues related to the testimonial use of DNA test results in criminal trials are sure to remain. Although the John Court settled on the requirement that, in that case, \u201ca single analyst, particularly the one who performed, witnessed or supervised the generation of the critical numerical DNA profile\u201d would suffice for the purposes .of the Confrontation Clause, id. at 314, 52 N.E.3d 1114, serious concerns remain about whether crime labs have properly stored, extracted, and labeled DNA samples, particularly where a single lab contains and tests samples from the victim, the crime scene, and the accused, see, e.g., Williams v. Illinois, 567 U.S. 50, 118-19, 132 S.Ct. 2221, 183 L.Ed.2d 89 (2012) (Kagan, J., dissenting).</p> <p id=\"b437-16\" pgmap=\"437(176) 438(56)\">One approach to addressing these concerns is to spend years litigating every instance a DNA profile is offered at trial in order to -determine whether or not the Confrontation Clause is. implicated. I suggest what. I think is ,an easier and more efficient route. For cases scheduled for trial, the prosecution could order that a defendant\u2019s DNA sample be collected and tested again and supervised by an analyst who is prepared and qualified to testify. This approach mirrors the recommendation of the. National Research Council Committee on DNA Forensic Science, which has, stated that \u201c[t]he ultimate safeguard against error due to sample mixup is to provide an opportunity for retesting,\u201d and that \u201c[i]n most cases, it is possible to retain portions. of the original evidence items and portions of the samples from different stages of the testing.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The National Institute of Justice has likewise found that \u201c[a]ny probative biological sample that has been stored dry or frozen, regardless of age, may be considered for DNA analysis,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the Innocence Project in fact has utilized DNA testing of preserved evidence in every one of its over 350 DNA exonerations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, where law enforcement officers have properly preserved forensic evidence, it would be feasible for the DNA to be retested under the supervision of an analyst who is qualified and prepared to testify at trial.</p> <p id=\"b438-4\" pgmap=\"438\">The supervising analyst need not conduct every step of the process herself. Instead, by supervising the process, she could personally attest to the extraction and correct labeling of the sample, that a proper chain of custody was maintained, and that the DNA profile match was in fact a comparison of the defendant\u2019s DNA to that of the DNA found on the crime scene evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Such testimony would assuage Confrontation Clause concerns, and, because the vast majority of criminal defendants plead guilty, only a small share of the DNA reports would need to be retested.</p> <p id=\"b438-5\" pgmap=\"438\">The State might retort that such testing and testimony would be unduly expensive, requiring additional time and resources to conduct a DNA test anew and provid\u00e9 a testifying analyst at trial. Those costs, it seems to me, are far outweighed not only by the additional assurance provided by the defendant\u2019s opportunity to cross-examine, but also by the exorbitant costs in both time and resources implicated by a defendant\u2019s subsequent appeal challenging the denial' of such an opportunity.</p> <p id=\"b438-6\" pgmap=\"438\">Consider the case history here. Washington appealed his conviction on Confrontation Clause grounds first to the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court, see People v. Washington, 108 A.D.3d 576, 968 N.Y.S.2d 184 (2d Dep\u2019t 2013), and then to the New York Court of Appeals, which declined to hear his case, see People v. Washington, 22 N.Y.3d 1091, 981 N.Y.S.2d 677, 4 N.E.3d 979 (2014). He then filed a habeas petition in federal court, which was first denied by the district court, see Washington v. Griffin, 142 F.Supp.3d 291 (E.D.N.Y. 2015), and has now, nearly two years later, been denied by this Court. This process has involved a half-decade of litigation, countless hours of attorney manpower, and the dedication of four different courts at both the state and federal level. Simply testing a second buccal swab sample would have rendered such litigation wholly unnecessary.</p> <p id=\"b438-12\" pgmap=\"438(118) 439(14)\">To be sure, the analysts conducting the second test might make a mistake. But if DNA testing is so fickle that we cannot reasonably expect a second test to produce accurate results, this is an indictment of DNA evidence as a whole rather than the narrow solution of retesting. Moreover, retesting is likely to produce more reliable results than the first time around. The supervising analyst would be physically present during the most error-prone portions of the analysis, would review the findings of the individual analysts at the end, and could utilize any additional measures adopted by the original crime lab, such as running two tests to confirm the results. The. probability that the second test would have a higher risk of error than the first accordingly seems marginal.</p> <p id=\"b439-5\" pgmap=\"439\">DNA evidence has greatly enhanced the State\u2019s ability to investigate crimes and identify suspects, while also exonerating many wrongly convicted of crimes they did not commit. As with any rapidly developing technology, however, its adoption has sometimes outstripped the law\u2019s capacity to oversee its judicious use. Such failure may not always result in a constitutional violation, but it does warrant careful consideration and pragmatic policy modifications where feasible. I am hopeful that going forward, prosecutors will endeavor where possible to make an analyst available at trial who was involved firsthand in the handling and testing of DNA, even if that may sometimes require the testing, of a second sample from a defendant scheduled to stand trial. It is far better for all involved\u2014the prosecution, the court, and the accused\u2014that the defendant has the opportunity to challenge DNA evidence at trial, rather than years later on appeal.</p> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b437-12\" pgmap=\"437\">.

Ideally, the analysts should not be informed that the testing is for the purpose of providing evidence at trial. Where this is not feasible, cross-examination of the supervising analyst would alleviate any concern that there was intentional mishandling of the sample. Of course, the prospect of cross-examination might incentivize more defendants to go to trial. I find this unlikely, however, because the defendant would not know at the time of plea negotiations whether the Government intended to retest the DNA sample (and would therefore call the additional analyst at trial).</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
