(Mother) complains of the trial court's omnibus \"Order Enforcing Child Support Order with Commitment Suspended\" (enforcement order), which includes contempt findings, a commitment order, community-supervision conditions, arrearage confirmations and judgments, an award of costs and attorney's fees, and a withholding order. In the mandamus proceeding (Cause No. 02-18-415-CV), we: (1) hold the entire commitment order void as well as the contempt findings based on Mother's failure to make student-loan payments and failure to take her child to her primary care physician; (2) modify the enforcement order by striking those provisions; (3) uphold the child-support, medical-support, and unreimbursed-medical-expenses contempt findings; and (4) deny all other mandamus relief. In the appeal (Cause No. 02-18-350-CV), we modify the cumulative judgment on the student-loan arrearage to reflect the amount of $ 4,709.89 instead of $ 5,529.89, and we affirm the modified enforcement order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2018, Appellee/Real Party in Interest M.F. (Father) filed a motion to enforce various liability and child-related provisions of a 2010 agreed divorce decree, a 2015 modification order, and a 2017 temporary order against Mother. Father requested that Mother be held in contempt, confined, and placed on long-term community supervision. He also sought confirmation of arrearages, attorney's fees, costs, judgments thereon, and withholding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In its enforcement order after a hearing, the trial court held Mother in criminal contempt for:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 Failing to pay Father several listed child-support and medical-support payments as ordered;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 \"[E]ach individual violation of each medical reimbursement payment not made in compliance with the Support order\" (but listing no violations);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 Not complying with the temporary order by failing to use the children's primary care physician; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 \"[E]ach individual violation of each [student-loan] payment not made in compliance with the\" divorce decree awarding her the student-loan debt (but listing no violations).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court ordered Mother committed to jail for 180 days for only one alleged\n   violation-\"Violation 147\"-her alleged failure to make one of many student-loan payments. The trial court suspended Mother's jail commitment and placed her on community supervision for 120 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The trial court also found Mother in arrears in the amounts of (1) $ 4,709.89 for student-loan payments Father made and (2) $ 86.50 for the children's unreimbursed medical expenses as of September 11, 2018, and then granted Father a cumulative judgment on each arrearage. Finally, the trial court ordered Mother to pay Father's trial counsel $ 2,100 in reasonable and necessary attorney's fees, taxed Father's court costs against Mother, and ordered \"all support judgments awarded ..., including child support, child support arrearages, child support interest, attorney's fees and costs and the interest on attorney's fees and costs\" to be withheld from Mother's employment income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mother filed a timely notice of appeal. Instead of an appellant's brief, however, she filed a \"Petition for Writ of Mandamus and Alternative Appellant's Brief on Appeal of Order Enforcing Child Support Order with Commitment Suspended.\" This court notified the parties by letter that Mother appeared to be asking for both mandamus relief and appellate relief in her document, not one type or another, because her issues challenged both the contempt provisions and the arrearage provisions of the trial court's enforcement order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cline v. Cline\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657730\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/557/810/#p812\">\n    557 S.W.3d 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 812 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2018, no pet.) (stating \"there is no authority for treating a case as\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     both\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   an original proceeding\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   an appeal\"). This court's letter stated that because Mother filed an appeal and sought relief from the arrearage judgment, her contempt issues would be dismissed for want of jurisdiction absent a response showing this court had jurisdiction over those issues. Mother responded to our letter by filing a second document, entitled \"Petition for Writ of Mandamus,\" raising eight issues challenging the trial court's contempt and commitment provisions in the enforcement order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We therefore refer to the fourteen issues raised in Mother's first-filed document as appellate issues and the eight issues raised in her second-filed document, the mandamus petition, as mandamus issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Mandamus is an Appropriate Vehicle for Relief from Contempt.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Father argues mandamus is not the correct vehicle for Mother's contempt issues because she is restrained (and thus confined) by her terms of community supervision. He consequently argues the only proper remedy for Mother's attack on the contempt provisions of the enforcement order is through a petition for writ of habeas corpus. Mother argues her community-supervision terms do not restrain her because they require her only to make payments as already ordered by the trial court; thus, mandamus is the proper remedy. Mother is correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The enforcement order's community-supervision terms require Mother to timely pay her share of uninsured medical expenses, monthly payments on the non-support judgment, Father's attorney's fees and costs for the enforcement proceeding; and monthly payments on the remaining student-loan debt and to comply with the trial court's valid orders-obligations imposed on her by the trial court independently of community supervision. We therefore hold Mother's community-supervision terms do not restrain her liberty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Depeau\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-14-00693-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204952427\">\n    2014 WL 4952427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (Tex.

The Trial Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion by Finding Mother in Contempt for Nonpayment of Child Support and Medical Support.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In her fourth and fifth mandamus issues, Mother complains the trial court abused its discretion by finding her guilty of contempt for nonpayment of child support (Issue Four) and nonpayment of medical support (Issue Five). As the basis for these issues in her petition, Mother focuses only on the trial court's findings that she was not in arrears for child support and medical support on August 31, 2018 or at the time of the enforcement hearing. The evidence is undisputed that Mother had been behind on child support and medical support but had caught up by making lump-sum payments before the enforcement hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Several years ago, former section 157.162(d) of the Texas Family Code permitted \"a child support obligor to escape a valid finding of contempt if the obligor demonstrate[d] at the enforcement hearing that he or she [was] current in the payment of child support as ordered by the court.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Office of Atty.

That section was repealed, however, effective June 14, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Hall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6938122\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/433/203/#p213\">\n    433 S.W.3d 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 213 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2014, orig. proceeding). Mother's child-support violations and medical-support violations found by the trial court all occurred well after that effective date. Consequently, her ability to become current on child support and medical support by the time of the enforcement hearing had no impact on the trial court's discretion\n   to hold her in contempt for past violations of its orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In her petition's statement of facts and in her reply to Father's response, Mother also raises the bare contention that Father abandoned his claims for contempt on these alleged violations via the following testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Q. Are you asking that the court hold her in contempt for violations 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, and 147 of all the counts that we had requested?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   A. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We note that none of the violations listed in the question concern child support or cash medical support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   However, Mother cites no authority in her petition or reply for the abandonment proposition. Thus, to the extent Mother relies on the statement of facts in her petition to supplement her fourth and fifth mandamus issues, we overrule the argument as inadequately briefed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex.

The report contains the following entries for August 16, 2016:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-66\">$173.00 <em>Taylor Contacts</em> Medical/Dental 08/16/2016 @ Refused (50/50) $86.50 $0.00 $0.00 $86.50 $173.00 <em>Taylor Contacts RETRY</em> Medical/Dental 08/16/2016 @ Refused (50/50) $86.50 $0.00 $0.00 $86.50</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The $ 86.50 in the total expenses column of the \"Refused\" entry, matched with the $ 0 in the owed column, appears to be responsible for the conflict in the report. But the trial court as factfinder could choose to believe all, some, or none of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v.

Thus, the trial court could have chosen to believe Father's testimony that Mother owed him $ 86.50 and to disbelieve the report's indication that Mother owed Father nothing for the \"Refused\" entry. We hold that sufficient evidence supports the trial court's decision. Accordingly, we cannot conclude the trial court abused its discretion by confirming the $ 86.50 arrearage for unreimbursed medical expenses.

On direct examination, Father testified he was asking for a judgment of $ 5,529.89 (1) for nineteen Sallie Mae payments he made on a student-loan debt that Mother was ordered to pay in the divorce decree and (2) for her share of their son's legal expenses. When asked whether he was asking the trial court to order that Mother \"pay the 820 owed on or before October 31st for the legal fees for [their son] as a condition of probation,\" he answered, \"That's correct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Subtracting $ 820 from the combined requested judgment of $ 5,529.89 leaves $ 4,709.89, the amount the trial court found Mother in arrears for the student-loan payments she did not pay but Father did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Father's testimony supports the conclusion that the student-loan debt was imposed on Mother in the divorce decree and that she was responsible for making timely payments but that he should make the payments if she did not and reduce court-ordered spousal support payments accordingly. On direct examination, Father testified Mother was ordered to pay the student-loan debt in the divorce decree. On cross-examination, Father testified that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   \u2022 The divorce decree stated that Mother was to pay the student-loan debt and if she did not, he should make the payment and deduct it from his monthly spousal support payments to her, which he believed he was making \"at the time\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   \u2022 The divorce decree stated that the student loan had been issued to both Mother and Father, but the decree placed the obligation to pay it on Mother.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   We decline to address Mother's additional, conclusory arguments that the trial court abused its discretion by confirming the arrearage because the underlying order was patently ambiguous and unenforceable by contempt as Mother has not supported those arguments with appropriate citations to authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex.

Because we have overruled Mother's fourth and fifth issues complaining of the confirmation of those arrearages, we likewise overrule her sixth appellate issue to the extent it complains of the grounds for the awards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   However, we note that there are two cumulative judgments: one for the unreimbursed-medical-expenses arrearage and one for the student-loan arrearage. The cumulative judgment amount for the student-loan arrearage-$ 4,796.39-exceeds the confirmed student-loan arrearage-$ 4,709.89-by $ 86.50, the amount of the unreimbursed-medical-expenses arrearage and its associated cumulative judgment. No evidence supports this discrepancy, nor do the trial court's findings. We therefore sustain the remainder of Mother's sixth appellate issue and modify the student-loan cumulative judgment to reflect an amount of $ 4,709.89 instead of $ 4,796.39.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex.

She does not contend that the attorney's fees awarded were not reasonable and necessary.
