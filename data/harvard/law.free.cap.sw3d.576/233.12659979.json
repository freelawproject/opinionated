Hess, Presiding Judge\n   <em>\n    Introduction\n   </em>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Nancy Naeter (\"Employee\") filed an original claim for compensation against her employer Buzzi Unicem (\"Employer\") for bilateral hearing loss under the Workers' Compensation Law of the State of Missouri. Employee filed this claim on October 17, 2006 regarding her employment with Employer from June 20, 1984 to September 9, 2005. Employee filed her first amended claim adding Tinnitus and Meniere's disease to her hearing loss claim against the Employer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In her second amended claim, Employee named the Second Injury Fund (\"SIF\") as a party to the workers' compensation proceedings. Prior to a trial, the claim against Employer was settled. The Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") denied the claim against the SIF as time-barred by the statute of limitations under \u00a7 287.430\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   . The Labor and Industrial Relations Commission (\"Commission\") reviewed the case and adopted the decision of the ALJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Employee asserts one point on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Employee claims the Commission erred denying Employee's claim as time-barred because the statute of limitations for filing the SIF claim should be calculated from the date of Employee's second amended claim or the date of the stipulation of compromise settlement between Employee and Employer. The SIF statute of limitations can be calculated from the date of \"a claim\" against an employer. Employee argues the second amended claim is \"a claim\" against Employer because: Employer was a real party in interest, subject to liability arising out of the claim; the Meniere's disease in the second amended claim was both an occupational disease against the Employer and pre-existing disability against the SIF; and the SIF's liability for pre-existing disability and for permanent total disability were added to the claim. Employee also argues settlement stipulations like the one in this case have been used as claims to calculate the SIF limitations period in similar cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We disagree with Employee. The second amended claim is not \"a claim\" against Employer. The second amended claim raised no new issue regarding Employer's liability. The second amended claim only added the issue of the SIF liability. The second amended claim does not relate back to the original claim or the first amended claim so it is not a valid, timely filed claim concerning the Employer. Furthermore,\n   settlement stipulations with an employer are not \"a claim\" for calculating the SIF statute of limitations unless no claim was filed before the settlement stipulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 17, 2006, Employee filed a claim against Employer for occupational hearing loss/injury to ears caused by \"long term exposure to industrial noise beginning June 20, 1984 th[ro]ugh Sept. 9, 2005 while at work for [E]mployer\". On December 3, 2010, Employee filed a first amended claim against Employer to include Tinnitus and Meniere's disease under the \"PART(S) OF BODY INJURED\" section. On December 16, 2011, Employee filed a second amended claim adding the SIF. Employee added permanent total disability regarding pre-existing Meniere's disease to the SIF claim portion of the form. No changes or additions were made to the Employer portion of the claim. On October 23, 2012, Employer and Employee entered into a stipulation for compromise settlement resolving the claim against Employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 10, 2017, the ALJ held a hearing to resolve disputed issues between Employee and the SIF including the \"[s]tatute of limitations regarding the Second Injury Fund\". The ALJ made specific findings of fact deciding the claim against the SIF was time-barred by the statute of limitations under \u00a7 287.430. The ALJ specifically found: The first amended claim supplemented the body parts affected so it was \"a claim\" against Employer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The second amended claim did not supplement or amend the first amended claim so it was not \"a claim\" against Employer. The claim against the SIF was filed on December 16, 2011, more than two years after the date of injury (September 9, 2005) and more than one year after the first amended claim was filed against Employer (December 3, 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 30, 2017, Employee filed an application for review with the Commission claiming the ALJ was \"incorrect in that he misapplied the statute of limitations ...\" On November 17, 2017, the SIF filed an answer and a motion to dismiss the application for review. On January 16, 2018, the Commission declined to dismiss Employee's application for review. On June 15, 2018, the Commission issued its final award denying compensation from the SIF. The award and decision of the ALJ was \"attached and incorporated\" by reference of the Commission without modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On appeal from the Commission's award in a workers' compensation case, we may modify, reverse, remand for rehearing, or set aside the Commission's award only upon any of the following reasons and no other:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (1) That the Commission acted in excess of its powers;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (2) That the award was procured by fraud;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (3) That the facts found by the Commission do not support the award; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (4) That there was not sufficient competent evidence in the record to warrant making the award. \u00a7 287.495.1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In the absence of fraud, the Commission's findings of fact are conclusive and binding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, we review issues of law\n   <em>\n    de\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    novo.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Treas. of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State-Custodian of Second Injury Fund v.

Employee asserts the SIF claim regarding Meniere's disease \"changes\" the claim against the Employer for Meniere's disease claim in the second amended claim. Therefore, Employee asserts, under \"strict construction,\" the second amended claim must be viewed to be \"a claim\" against the Employer. There is no dispute no changes were made to the Employer section for Meniere's disease in the second amended claim. With regard to the Employer, the first and second amended claims are identical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The claim against the SIF in the second amended claim would be timely if it was filed within two years of the injury or within one year of a valid claim against Employer. \u00a7 287.430. Employee suggests we begin running the one year period after \"a claim\" against the Employer, here, from either the date of the second amended claim or the date of the settlement stipulation. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   I. Statutory Construction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In 2005, the legislature amended the Workers' Compensation statutes with the instruction: \"[a]dministrative law judges, ... the labor and industrial relations commission, ... and any reviewing courts shall construe the provisions of [Chapter 287] strictly.\" \u00a7 287.800.1. This amendment took effect prior to the date of injury in this case. Prior to the amendment, the chapter was to be \"liberally construed with a view to the public welfare\". \u00a7 287.800 RSMo (2000). Strict construction does not authorize an ALJ, the Commission, or this court to add words to or subtract words from a statute or ignore the plain meaning of the words chosen by the legislature.\n   <em>\n    Dickemann v.

App. W.D. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In this case, the validity of the first amended claim is not contested. The Commission found the first amended claim to be \"a claim\" under \u00a7 287.430 because it supplemented the body parts affected. Employee added Tinnitus and Meniere's disease to the hearing loss claim against Employer. This amendment was for the same exposure to occupational noise against the employer as the original claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The second amended claim is the crux of this case. Under the Missouri Code of State Regulations, an employer and the SIF are considered two separate parties when an employee makes a claim for workers' compensation. 8 CSR 50-2.010(7)(B). \"[A]n assertion of a claim against one is not an assertion of a claim against the other.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7300462\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/302/792/#p804\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because of this regulation and the distinct statutes of limitations in \u00a7 287.430 for employer and SIF claims, we must treat the second amended claim as two separate claims: one against the Employer and one against the SIF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The second amended claim, as to the Employer, is not a valid claim under \u00a7 287.430. It did not supplement or amend the claim against the Employer so it does not relate back. See\n   <em>\n    Goad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7121414\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/372/1/#p10\">\n    372 S.W.3d at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This claim does not add information related to Employer or the injuries claimed on the original claim beyond those changes already made through the first amended claim. Employee's argument the Meniere's claim against the SIF \"changes\" the Meniere's claim against the Employer\n   conflates a change in the claims with a change in the anticipated evidence which may be presented at a hearing. The claim against the Employer remained unchanged in the second amended claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Therefore, the Commission did not err in concluding the second amended claim was not \"a claim\" against Employer and the statute of limitations ran against the SIF because the second amended claim was filed more than one year after the date of the first amended claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   IV. Stipulations of Compromise Settlement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Employee's last argument regarding the timely filing of the SIF claim is the settlement stipulation between Employee and Employer filed on October 23, 2012. Employee asserts the settlement stipulation should be viewed as \"a claim\" for purposes of calculating the limitations period for the SIF claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Employee cites\n   <em>\n    Grubbs\n   </em>\n   in support of the argument a settlement stipulation with an employer can be used to calculate the SIF statute of limitations.
