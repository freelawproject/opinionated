PALAFOX, Justice\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Genaro Flores sued the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), his former employer, for age discrimination under Chapter 21 of the Texas Labor Code. Following a jury trial, the jury found in favor of Flores and the trial court rendered judgment on the jury's verdict. TxDOT challenges the judgment based on (1) whether the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over this discrimination claim asserted against a governmental employer, and (2) whether the evidence was legally and factually sufficient to support the jury's verdict. We affirm as modified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Flores worked for TxDOT as an assistant supervisor assigned to the Maintenance Section of the El Paso office. In 2013, when he was terminated from his employment, Flores was 46 years old. The maintenance section was supervised by\n   Hector Granados, who in turn, was supervised by Tim Twomey, the West El Paso Area Engineer for the West Area Office. As the District Engineer, Bob Bielek supervised Twomey and generally oversaw the El Paso District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   TxDOT initially hired Flores in 1994 as a \"Tech 1,\" an entry-level position. After years of continuous employment, Flores was promoted to assistant maintenance supervisor in 2004. Flores loved his job and felt proud to be promoted to a position where he supervised more than twenty crew members. In 2011, he was temporarily promoted to maintenance supervisor when the previous supervisor retired, and he performed well. On several occasions, Flores was rated on evaluations as an employee who performed at the exceptional level who frequently exceeded expectations. His record also showed he was never formally disciplined during this period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Circumstances changed, however, after Granados was selected as permanent supervisor of the section and Flores began working under his supervision. Soon after his promotion, Granados initiated disciplinary action against Flores for which Flores eventually received a written reprimand based on his alleged failure to meet performance standards and follow TxDOT procedures. Flores received another written reprimand for allegedly taking a TxDOT work truck into New Mexico to visit a bank ATM, which purportedly violated TxDOT's policies regarding out-of-state use of official vehicles for non-state business purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following issuance of his second written reprimand, Flores received further disciplinary actions. After additional instances of purported malfeasance, Granados recommended to TxDOT's Human Resources Department that Flores be issued another written reprimand. Human Resources, however, recommended probation-a higher level of discipline-and Flores was in fact placed on probation. In April 2013, Granados disciplined Flores again because Flores allegedly took a TxDOT truck to a local store to purchase supplies for his personal business, which purportedly violated TxDOT's policy on the use of state vehicles for personal activities. After this latest allegation, Granados again submitted disciplinary action paperwork to Human Resources. Although Human Resources and Bielek recommended terminating Flores, Granados claimed that he and Twomey persuaded Bielek not to terminate Flores. Flores was given probation and five days' suspension without pay. Granados additionally issued a formal warning describing policies Flores had purportedly violated and warning that future violations could result in termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 25, 2013, a vehicle traveling on a highway struck and killed a TxDOT employee who was working on an exit sign alongside another worker. As a result of this incident, TxDOT held a meeting at which District Engineer Bielek gave a verbal order requiring use of an attenuator\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   whenever TxDOT had \"boots on the ground.\" On July 11, 2013, Flores assigned two teams to pick up litter on highways and ordered another employee to request two attenuators from a contractor, one for each crew. After making these assignments, Flores left the yard to perform his own duties and assumed the two attenuators had been ordered and obtained. Although the contractor only provided one attenuator, Flores was not initially aware. When Flores saw that one of the crews was working without an attenuator, he immediately\n   pulled over and called one of the crew members, Pablo Ramirez, on the radio to ask him about the absence of an attenuator. Up until that time, Flores was not aware that the crew had been working without an attenuator. When Granados overheard Flores calling Ramirez on the radio, Granados called Flores on his cell phone and directed him to return to the office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At a meeting held with crew and Granados, Pablo Ramirez admitted it had been his fault that he worked without an attenuator and accepted responsibility for the incident. Nonetheless, Granados filed a report with Human Resources with a recommendation that Flores receive another written reprimand. Human Resources in Austin, however, recommended that Flores be terminated. District Engineer Bielek testified that he eventually made the decision to terminate Flores for the three previous disciplinary actions and because of the attenuator incident. On July 31, 2013, TxDOT issued termination paperwork to Flores signed by Granados and Twomey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Flores later testified at trial that he had met with Bielek prior to his termination and told Bielek that Granados was treating him and the \"older guys\" in his section unfairly. Bielek responded that Flores needed to follow Granados's instructions, and that perhaps it was time for Flores to get another job. Flores also testified that he told a Human Resources representative, Carmela Magallanez-Aguilar, about Granados treating him and other older employees unfairly but she merely responded that Granados and Twomey were his supervisors. Further, another employee, Javier Castillo, made a formal complaint of age discrimination about Granados, but Granados was unaware of the complaint until the time he was deposed and Magallanez-Aguilar, the TxDOT Human Resources representative, was not questioned about Granados's treatment of employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Following his termination, Flores filed a verified charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC), alleging that Granados terminated him because of his age. After both organizations issued notices of his right to sue, Flores sued TxDOT pursuant to Texas Labor Code, Chapter 21, alleging that he was terminated based on his age. TxDOT filed a plea to the jurisdiction and motion for summary judgment, both of which the trial court denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury rendered a verdict in favor of Flores finding that Flores's age was a motivating factor in TxDOT's decision to terminate his employment. Following a hearing on TxDOT's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and Flores's motion for entry of judgment, the court rendered judgment on the jury's verdict. TxDOT subsequently filed a request for findings of fact and conclusions of law and a motion for a new trial, but the trial court did not grant a new trial or file findings or conclusions. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   TxDOT appeals the trial court's judgment in eight issues, arguing that (1) Flores's case should be dismissed because there is no evidence establishing a prima facie case of age discrimination, and there is no evidence that age was a motivating\n   factor in TxDOT's decision to terminate him; (2) there is insufficient evidence that age was a motivating factor in TxDOT's decision to terminate him; (3) the jury charge contained two erroneous instructions, one of which was an improper \"permissive pretext\" instruction, and both of which constituted an improper comment on the weight of the evidence; (4) the trial court erred by excluding documents pertaining to Flores's disciplinary actions; (5) the trial court erred by finding reinstatement feasible without entering the requested findings of fact and conclusions of law; (6) the trial court erred by granting reinstatement; (7) the evidence is factually and legally insufficient to sustain the compensatory damages award; and (8) the trial court erred in awarding Flores the right to execute. In the interest of efficiency, we address the issues simultaneously where possible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Sufficiency of the Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Applicable Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In its first two issues, TxDOT argues that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the case because the evidence was legally and factually insufficient to support the judgment. Flores sued TxDOT under the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act (TCHRA).\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   TEX. LAB. CODE ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 21.051 -.556.

The parties do not dispute that Flores met the threshold burden of establishing that he was discharged from employment, though qualified for the job, at a time when he met the age requirement of the protected class. At issue, we must determine whether legally sufficient evidence exists to establish that Flores's age was a motivating factor in TxDOT's decision to terminate his employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    El Paso Healthcare Sys., Ltd. v.

In particular, TxDOT argues Flores's testimony that Granados made comments related to age does not serve as competent evidence that age was a motivating factor in his termination because (1) Flores could not recall the last time Granados made a comment about age; (2) no such comments were made leading up to his termination, or on the day he was terminated; and (3) nobody at TxDOT told him that he was being terminated because of his age and no witness testified to that effect. To the extent that Flores presented evidence of derogatory comments about age, TxDOT contends these comments were \"stray remarks\" which cannot serve as evidence of discrimination because they were not made close in time to Flores's termination or related to the employment decision at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    AutoZone, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8215659\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/272/588/#p592\">\n    272 S.W.3d at 592-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Flores responds that evidence in the record supported the jury's finding that his age was a motivating factor in TxDOT's decision to discharge him. Flores testified that Granados made comments\n   during meetings and in response to specific incidents that Flores and other older employees were \"just old guys.\" Moreover, Granados told these workers, \"You know, you're almost out of here.\" Flores described Granados as stating, \"well, you're almost retirement. You [are] just going to leave here in [a] little bit. You know, I'll get you there. It's coming around.\" He further testified that Granados remarked that older workers were \"forgetting things.\" Additional to testimony about Granados, Flores points to his testimony that he personally witnessed Bielek \"target[ed] the older guys ... many times,\" by cutting them off in conversation. Flores argues that while these comments are not direct evidence of discrimination, they nonetheless constitute circumstantial evidence that TxDOT intended to discriminate against older employees including himself. Flores also points to Bielek's testimony that he participated in discussions during TxDOT meetings about how to prepare employees to replace older employees who were nearing retirement. Finally, Flores argues that his and other employees' reports to Bielek and Magallanez-Aguilar that the older employees were being discriminated against went unheeded and did not result in further investigation, which likewise suggested that TxDOT engaged in discriminatory treatment of this protected class. In sum, Flores argues that the jury could have reasonably inferred that TxDOT intended to discriminate because \"TxDOT threatened older workers, criticized older workers, planned to terminate older workers, and tolerated age discrimination when reported[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   After construing all conflicts and inferences from the evidence in favor of the jury's verdict, including credibility determinations, we find legally sufficient evidence supporting the jury's finding that Flores's age was a motivating factor in his termination from employment at TxDOT. In support of this notion, Flores testified that Bielek was constantly \"targeting the older guys [in the Maintenance Section].... many times.\" Flores also stated that Granados made these comments both in group meetings and in response to specific events. Likewise, Flores testified that Granados stated that the older employees were \"forgetting things\" and that they were \"almost out of here\" and were \"almost retirement.\" Although the record does not indicate with particularity when these comments were made in relation to Flores's termination, nevertheless the evidence qualifies as competent, circumstantial evidence when considered with other evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goudeau v. Nat'l Oilwell Varco, L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278209\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/470/#p475\">\n    793 F.3d 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 475 (5th Cir. 2015). Likewise, the record suggests that Bielek attended meetings at TxDOT during which he had discussions regarding \"succession planning\" to encourage the replacement of older workers at TxDOT. Further, the evidence suggested that there were a large number of retirees under Granados's supervision. Flores also testified that when he approached Bielek with complaints about Granados's discrimination against himself and other workers, Bielek replied that it was time for Flores to get another job; when Flores approached Magallanez-Aguilar with complaints about his treatment at work, she simply reminded him that he worked under Granados's and Twomey's supervision. Likewise, TxDOT did not investigate Flores's EEOC charge of discrimination by questioning Bielek, Granados, or Magallanez-Aguilar, nor did it question Castillo's formal complaint of age discrimination against Granados. Finally, Flores's employment record suggests that he was an excellent employee for many years up to the time Granados became his supervisor, and it was only afterward that disciplinary issues began to surface. Based on the foregoing, the jury could have reasonably\n   found that age was a motivating factor in TxDOT's decision to terminate Flores.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Further, we hold that there is legally sufficient evidence supporting the jury's finding that TxDOT's stated reasons for terminating Flores were pretextual and not credible. If an employer gives a non-discriminatory reason for the employee's termination, the employee may show that the stated reason was false by revealing weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, or contradictions that a fact finder could find unworthy of credence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    EEOC v. Horizon/CMS Healthcare Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11214146\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/220/1184/#p1198\">\n    220 F.3d 1184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1198 (10th Cir. 2000). As such, a jury may infer that discrimination was the real reason for the employer's decision from evidence that the termination was pretextual.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11214146\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/220/1184/#p1198\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, TxDOT argues that Flores was terminated because he failed to follow TxDOT policy including the policy that required use of an attenuator when road crews worked on highways. Yet, as Flores points out, there was no written TxDOT policy to that effect. In any event, the record also shows that Flores directed Soto to obtain an attenuator on the morning leading up to his termination. And once he discovered the absence of an attenuator, he radioed the workers to inquire about them working without one. Granados then called in Flores and the work crew to meet in his office. Ramirez openly admitted he was responsible for the incident not Flores. Flores testified that Granados had pre-judged him as being \"guilty,\" and that he was determined to punish him for the incident. Further, Karen Garza testified that Flores did not violate TxDOT policy during the attenuator incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Giving deference to the jury's determination of the witnesses' credibility, the jury could have reasonably inferred from the evidence that Flores attempted to comply with TxDOT's oral instruction regarding the use of attenuators, and that TxDOT's reliance on this reason for terminating him was false. Likewise, the jury could have reasonably inferred that Flores's performance, which was satisfactory for many years and suddenly declined when Granados became his supervisor, is indicative of Granados's poor treatment of the older employees, especially when considered in conjunction with derogatory statements he made to older workers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The evidence also suggested that the other disciplinary actions taken against Flores were false or exaggerated, and thus supporting the jury's finding that they were a pretext for age discrimination against Flores.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Laxton v. Gap, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9110919\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/572/#p580\">\n    333 F.3d 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 580-83 (5th Cir. 2003). For example, TxDOT claimed that Flores was terminated in part because of his use of a TxDOT vehicle to travel into New Mexico and to stop at a local plumbing supply store to purchase supplies for his personal business. Nevertheless, TxDOT's policy allowed employees to use TxDOT vehicles for personal use if it was done in conjunction with business operations, and it was likewise permitted for TxDOT employees to take work vehicles across state lines to go to lunch. Again, when viewed in context with the other evidence, this evidence tends to support the jury's finding that TxDOT's stated reasons for Flores's termination were pretextual for age discrimination against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Bearing in mind that we do not sit as a \"thirteenth juror\" and we may not substitute our view of the evidence for that of the jury's, we hold that the jury could have reasonably found that Flores's age was a motivating factor in TxDOT's decision to terminate him and that TxDOT's stated reasons for terminating Flores were pretextual.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Keller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8943104\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/168/802/#p827\">\n    168 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   820-22 ;\n   <em>\n    Parsons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316944\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/353/215/#p225\">\n    353 S.W.3d at 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We therefore conclude that legally sufficient evidence supports the jury's verdict in favor\n   of Flores.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Keller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8943104\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/168/802/#p827\">\n    168 S.W.3d at 820-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, the jury's finding cannot be said to be so against the great weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong or unjust, and we hold that TxDOT's challenge to the factual sufficiency of the evidence must also fail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parsons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316944\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/353/215/#p225\">\n    353 S.W.3d at 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In particular, TxDOT contends that the first instruction was a \"permissive pretext\" instruction which confused the jury about the ultimate issue Flores had the burden of proving, and further constituted an impermissible comment on the weight of the evidence. TxDOT likewise argues that a second jury instruction constituted an impermissible comment on the weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Preservation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As a preliminary matter, we address Flores's contention that TxDOT has not preserved this issue for our review. \"A party objecting to a charge must point out distinctly the objectionable matter and the grounds of the objection. Any complaint as to a question, definition, or instruction, on account of any defect, omission, or fault in pleading, is waived unless specifically included in the objections.\" TEX. R. CIV. P. 274. As such, an objection does not satisfy Rule 274 's requirements unless \"the defect relied upon by the objecting party and the grounds of the objection are stated specifically enough to support the conclusion that [the] trial court was fully cognizant of the ground of complaint and deliberately chose to overrule it.\"\n   <em>\n    Cont'l Cas.

Like the other instruction complained of, TxDOT also contends that this instruction \"nudged\" the jury to find that age was a motivating factor. We disagree. It is well settled in Texas that it is not error to give an instruction on circumstantial evidence.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Larson v.

Flores objected to the admission of these records on the basis that they constituted hearsay and because these records contained out-of-court statements constituting hearsay-within-hearsay. TxDOT responded that these documents were not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, but were instead offered for some other purpose. In particular, TxDOT argued that (1) Defendant's Exhibits 3 and 18 were offered to prove that it was a formal disciplinary action against Flores, and that Defendant's Exhibit 13\n   was offered as a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason of showing formal discipline. TxDOT did not argue that Defendant's Exhibit 24 was offered for any purpose other than the truth of the matter asserted. TxDOT did not provide an argument at trial regarding Flores's hearsay-within-hearsay objections to the admission of the exhibits. The trial court sustained Flores's objections and excluded these documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   TxDOT also offered two exhibits containing TxDOT policies: Defendant's Exhibit 2, which was a section of the TxDOT Human Resources Manual describing disciplinary action, and Defendant's Exhibit 12, which was the TxDOT Use of Department Property Statement signed by Flores. Flores again objected to these documents on the basis of hearsay and hearsay-within-hearsay, and TxDOT did not argue that the documents were offered for some purpose other than the truth of the matter asserted. The trial court sustained the objections and excluded the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   On appeal, TxDOT argues that the trial court erred by excluding the disciplinary records on the basis that they contained hearsay because they were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but rather \"to show the formal disciplinary actions that had been taken leading up to and culminating in Flores's termination.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. EVID. 801(d). Yet, as Flores points out, TxDOT did not provide a basis at trial for overcoming Flores's hearsay-within-hearsay trial objections, and does not do so on appeal; as such, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the documents on this basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. EVID. 801(d), 805. TxDOT further argues on appeal that the disciplinary records were admissible under the hearsay exception for public records pursuant to TEX. R. EVID. 803(8) ; however, this argument was never made at trial and does not comport with TxDOT's complaint on appeal, and it is therefore waived.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. APP.

R. APP. P. 44.1(a)(1). Granados, Magallanez-Aguilar, Bielek, and Flores all testified at length about the disciplinary actions taken against Flores that were recounted in the excluded documents while using the documents to refresh their recollections, and thus, we find the documents themselves were cumulative of properly admitted evidence. Likewise, TxDOT was able to examine witnesses about the excluded TxDOT policies, again using the documents to refresh recollections when needed. As such, we hold that even if the trial court erred by excluding the proffered evidence, these actions were nonetheless harmless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. APP.

TxDOT further argues that reinstatement is not feasible because (1) Flores had found employment elsewhere between the time he was terminated and the trial; (2) animosity between TxDOT and Flores exists, as shown by the \"mutual dislike and distrust between himself and local TxDOT leadership\" and Flores's deposition testimony that he would not like to work for his former supervisors at TxDOT; and (3) no comparable positions at TxDOT exist, and Flores's reinstatement would require TxDOT to displace the employee who TxDOT hired to replace Flores.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Flores responds that\n   <em>\n    Hansard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536687\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/865/1461/#p1469\">\n    865 F.2d at 1469-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , does not stand for the proposition that submitting an issue to the jury waives reinstatement, but rather that a federal court should not have submitted the issue of front pay to the jury without first finding reinstatement infeasible, and that submitting one remedy to the jury results in waiver of another remedy is unfounded. Citing TEX. R. CIV. P. 279, Flores also argues that TxDOT waived its defense to reinstatement because the burden is on the party seeking to avoid reinstatement to prove that it is infeasible, and that TxDOT waived its argument by failing to request a jury finding on the issue. Finally, Flores argues that TxDOT did not prove that reinstatement was infeasible because (1) notwithstanding Flores's employment at another job, he is not required to remain unemployed to obtain reinstatement; (2) the evidence shows that Flores attempted to get his job back before filing the lawsuit, and TxDOT's references to \"instances of animosity\" refer to Flores's reaction to the trial testimony of TxDOT employees, an invalid litigation-related basis to deny reinstatement; and (3) that the fact that TxDOT hired another person to fill Flores's position does not provide a basis to deny reinstatement because reinstatement would be precluded in virtually every case \"by hiring an innocent third party after the retaliatory purpose was achieved.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   We first address Flores's waiver argument.

TxDOT argues that the only evidence supporting the jury's award of compensatory damages was Flores's trial testimony that his termination was \"devastating\" to him, that he had lost his \"pride\" and \"dignity,\" and that the termination had \"affected [him] so much where, your [sic] know, it's not [him] no more. It's just not the same, you know, and it's not something that I can take, and okay, let's come back. No, sir. It's gone. It's-you're reminded of it every day.\" He also testified that the \"damage [was] done\" and \"could not be undone,\" that what had been done to him was \"unfair, unjust, and [that he did not] wish that upon nobody.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   TxDOT contends that this evidence is too conclusory to support the compensatory damages awarded. We do not agree. Under the TCHRA, compensatory damages that are recoverable include emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and other nonpecuniary losses. TEX. LAB. CODE ANN. \u00a7 21.2585. The jury was instructed on the statute's provision. On review, the record supports the jury's award as Flores testified he was dedicated to his job and proud of his performance ratings and reviews. For over twenty years, Flores dedicated himself to his work with TxDOT and took pride in what he was doing. He testified that he felt his twenty years of service had been thrown down the drain when he learned of his termination. Flores testified he not only lost his pride and dignity, but the loss of his job also affected his self-image. He explained that his termination had \"broken\" him. This evidence allowed a reasonable jury to conclude that Flores experienced emotional pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, inconvenience, and mental anguish. Accordingly, we conclude that the record supports the jury's award of compensatory damages. TxDOT's seventh issue is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    Right to Execute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Finally, we consider TxDOT's eighth issue in which it argues that the trial court erred by including language in the judgment which allowed Flores to pursue \"such writs and processes as may be necessary to the enforcement and collection of this Judgment, for all of which let execution issue.\" Flores responds that this issue is not preserved for our review because TxDOT first raised this argument in its post-judgment motion to modify the judgment, and because TxDOT did not request or obtain a hearing on the motion. TxDOT responds in turn that its issue is not waived because it was raised in a timely motion to modify judgment that was overruled by operation of law. We agree with TxDOT's position on preservation and will address the issue on the merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. CIV.

That section of the Texas Constitution only prohibits the property of counties, cities, and towns from being exempt from forced sale and taxation.
