Stone appeals this conviction, arguing that the trial court erred in excluding testimony that D.S., the victim, had a boyfriend, and in refusing to grant his motions for judgment of acquittal at the close of the State's evidence and at the close of all evidence. Finding no error, we affirm. Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
