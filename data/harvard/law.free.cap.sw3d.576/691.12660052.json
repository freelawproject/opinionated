Clement Jr., P.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   A 62-year-old former employee of the Macon County School System sued the Board of Education on the grounds of age discrimination and retaliation under the Tennessee Human Rights Act. She alleged that her supervisor, the school principal, made age-related discriminatory remarks and demoted her after she complained about a co-worker's repeated, sexually explicit comments. In its answer, the Board of Education contended that the re-assignment was a lateral transfer and was justified by nondiscriminatory reasons. The trial court summarily dismissed the complaint finding,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that Plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination or retaliation, and that the Board produced undisputed evidence of legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for transferring Plaintiff. We respectfully disagree, having concluded that Plaintiff identified and produced evidence to establish a prima facie case for both claims and to create a genuine issue of fact concerning whether the Board's stated reasons are pretexts for discriminatory or retaliatory animus. For these reasons, the Board was not entitled to summary judgment. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   From 1987 until 2014, Susan R. Templeton (\"Plaintiff\") was employed by the Macon County Board of Education (\"Defendant\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After serving as a substitute teacher, Plaintiff was employed full time as an office clerk. For the past several years, Plaintiff served as the bookkeeper for Central Elementary School. Plaintiff worked in the school's front office, immediately next to the principal's office. Plaintiff shared the front office with the school's receptionist, Jackie Shockley, and the school nurse. Plaintiff's main duties as bookkeeper were to provide general bookkeeping services and pay bills. Plaintiff also was responsible for assisting Ms. Shockley by answering the phone and interacting with visitors, parents, and teachers while Ms. Shockley was busy or out of the office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The record before us reveals no write-ups or disciplinary actions concerning Plaintiff. Nor does it reveal any reports of unsatisfactory job performance or evidence of general dissatisfaction with Plaintiff until after Daniel Cook became the principal at Central Elementary School in 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In April 2013, Plaintiff met with Principal Cook to convey to him, for the first time, several concerns. Plaintiff's concerns included the fact that Ms. Shockley had repeatedly made sexual, lewd, and otherwise inappropriate comments in the small office they shared. One year later, in April 2014, Plaintiff again met with Principal Cook to express her discomfort regarding Ms. Shockley's \"dirty talk.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff also complained that she had a hard time keeping up with her bookkeeping responsibilities because Ms. Shockley regularly left work early. Principal Cook responded to Plaintiff by stating that he was satisfied with Ms. Shockley's job performance but he would look into the inappropriate remarks. Near the conclusion of the April 2014 meeting, Principal Cook told Plaintiff that \"things\" were \"not going in the right direction for [the] office\" and asked if she had ever considered \"retiring.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ten days after the April 2014 meeting, Principal Cook informed Plaintiff he had decided to \"move\" her to a teacher-assistant position. Principal Cook finished the conversation by telling her \"it would be in [her] best interests to just go ahead and retire.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff, then 62 years of age, refused to accept the position and immediately took a leave of absence. During the summer break, she officially retired. Plaintiff was replaced as the bookkeeper by a person 17 years younger than she, whom Plaintiff had trained for the job.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In March 2015, Plaintiff commenced this action by filing a complaint for age discrimination and retaliation under the Tennessee Human Rights Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%204-210-101\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 4-210-101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to -1004 (\"THRA\"). Plaintiff alleged that Defendant demoted her because of her age and because of her complaint to Principal Cook about \"sexually offensive, hostile activity.\" Defendant filed an answer denying the allegations and discovery ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In July 2017, Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment along with a statement of undisputed facts. Plaintiff filed a response in opposition to the motion accompanied by a response to Defendant's statement of undisputed facts, in which she admitted some facts and denied others. Plaintiff also filed a separate statement of undisputed facts, to which Defendant responded by admitting some facts and denying others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Following a hearing, and after asking for additional briefing, the trial court granted Defendant's motion for summary judgment by order entered in December 2017. Regarding Plaintiff's age-discrimination claim, the final order reads in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court finds that the plaintiff has failed to carry her burden to establish all of the elements of her prima facie age discrimination case. In particular, the plaintiff's transfer from the bookkeeping position to a teacher's aide position was a lateral transfer without any reduction in salary or benefits. There is no proof in the record that the plaintiff's transfer to the teacher's aide position was a demotion or that the plaintiff was unable to perform the duties of that position or that she suffered a change in benefits or in work hours by the lateral transfer. Additionally, upon being informed that she would be reassigned at the start of the next school year, the plaintiff immediately took a voluntary leave of absence through the end of the school year. She then voluntarily retired from the defendant's employment prior to the start of the next school year. Accordingly, the Court finds the plaintiff was not actually or constructively discharged and suffered no adverse employment action. Inasmuch as the plaintiff has failed to establish all the necessary elements of a violation of the Tennessee Human Rights Act, the defendant is entitled to summary judgment on this claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Assuming arguendo, that the plaintiff had established the aforementioned elements the defendant may go forward and assert neutral reasons or more accurately one or more legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons existed for the challenged employment action. See,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%204-21-311\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 4-21-311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). The Court finds that there is ample evidence in the record to support such neutral reasons for the challenged employment action. The plaintiff was unwilling or unable to consistently answer the office telephone which was one of the required duties of the school bookkeeper. Even though plaintiff's cafeteria and bookkeeping duties had largely been transferred to the Central Office, she nonetheless complained to the school's Principal that she had too much work to do and was overloaded. Her unwillingness to consistently fulfill her telephone duties caused the school nurse to have to answer the office telephone, which was not part of the nurse's job responsibilities. In her bookkeeping position the plaintiff was required to interact with teachers, yet several teachers complained to the Principal that the plaintiff was unapproachable. The plaintiff complained to the principal on multiple occasions that the school secretary was not performing her duties, and was leaving early with the Principal's approval requiring the plaintiff\n   to have to work more. The Principal investigated her complaints and determined these were unfounded. The front office staff, including the plaintiff and the Principal as well as the school secretary and school nurse worked in a small area. It is important that personnel in close quarters need to work well together. The Principal perceived the plaintiff's complaints and second guessing of his decisions to be in conflict with the office staff and with himself, and to reflect an unwillingness or inability to perform her job. From the record the plaintiff complained about her inability to do the multi-tasking aspects of her bookkeeper's job such as having to answer the telephones, about teachers not doing as she asked, and about the Principal's decisions with other workers. The Court finds the plaintiff was not satisfying the Principal's reasonable expectations of the front office bookkeeping position. The Court further finds that the plaintiff was replaced in the bookkeeping position by Karen Burrow, a female who was 45 years of age at the time. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the plaintiff's replacement in the bookkeeping position was not a replacement by an individual outside the protective class and did not occur under circumstances giving rise to any inference of age discrimination. For all of these reasons and the entire record, the Court finds that the plaintiff has not established a prima facie case of age discrimination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Even if the plaintiff had established a prima facie case of age discrimination, the above reasons articulated legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for lateral transferring of the plaintiff to the teacher's aide position, and the plaintiff has not carried her burden of persuasion to establish pretext under the THRA \u00a7 4-21-311 (e). The Court finds that the reasons stated by the defendant for the plaintiff's lateral job assignment have a basis in fact and the plaintiff has not set forth sufficient evidence to create a disputed fact that the defendant's reasons are unworthy of belief or did not actually motivate her re-assignment to the teacher's aide position. The plaintiff made a choice to retire from the defendant's employ and the work force in general rather than to accept her lateral transfer to the teacher's aide position. The Court finds that the plaintiff has not carried her burden of showing pretext.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Regarding Plaintiff's retaliation claim, the final order reads in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [T]he plaintiff has also alleged retaliation for reporting improper sexual comments and conduct in the workplace. There are four (4) elements required to prove retaliation: (1) she engaged in activity protected by the THRA; (2) the defendant knew about the protected activity; (3) the defendant subsequently took a materially adverse employment action against the plaintiff; and (4) a causal connection exists between the plaintiff's protected activity and the resulting adverse action. The Court does not find that the plaintiff's report of occasional improper workplace comments as occurred here, made months after occurring, are protected conduct. From the proof it appears that the Principal promptly addressed her concerns. As set out above in more detail, the court finds that no materially adverse employment action was taken against the plaintiff. Finally, the plaintiff has failed to prove that but for her complaining of a \"sexually offensive hostile work environment,\" she would not have been laterally transferred to the teacher's aide position, and all proof is to the contrary. Plaintiff relies on the timing between her complaint and a statement by the Principal inquiring about her retirement. However, timing alone and as\n   applies in the specific facts of this case is insufficient proof of a causal connection between the plaintiff's reporting of what she saw as offensive conduct and the decision to reassign to prove a prima facie case on this claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Even had the plaintiff established a prima facie case of retaliation for reporting a \"sexually offensive hostile work environment,\" the defendant has stated legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions as set forth above, and the plaintiff has not carried her burden to establish pretext, as this Court discussed above.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court finds that there is no direct or circumstantial evidence of discriminatory intent by the defendant, that there are no material issues of disputed fact and so summary judgment is appropriate as to all claims asserted in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff raises two issues that we paraphrase as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (1) Did the trial court err by finding that Plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination and unlawful retaliation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (2) Did the trial court err in holding that Defendant's stated reasons for its employment action were undisputed and not pretext for unlawful discriminatory and retaliatory animus despite evidence of disparate treatment of a younger employee, discriminatory and retaliatory remarks, and the temporal proximity between Plaintiff's protected activity and her demotion?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This court reviews a trial court's decision on a motion for summary judgment de novo without a presumption of correctness.\n   <em>\n    Rye v.

The burden on the defendant is one of production and not persuasion. If the defendant produces such evidence, the presumption of discrimination or retaliation raised by the plaintiff's prima facie case is rebutted, and the burden shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the reason given by the defendant was not the true reason for the challenged employment action and that the stated reason was a pretext for illegal discrimination or retaliation. The foregoing allocations of burdens of proof shall apply at all stages of the proceedings, including motions for summary judgment.

Contrary to Defendant's insistence that Plaintiff failed to produce any evidence that the transfer would have resulted in a meaningful change to the terms, conditions, or privileges of her employment, Plaintiff identified and produced evidence that the teacher-assistant\n   position to which she was transferred paid $ 3.00 less per hour and was less prestigious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiff testified that the teacher-assistant position paid approximately $ 11 per hour and that she was being paid approximately $ 14 per hour as the school's bookkeeper. Principal Cook testified that he knew \"the bookkeeping position and the [front office] positions ... pay more than teacher assistant positions do.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The only evidence in the record that disputes this fact is the testimony of former Director of Schools, Margaret Oldham, who testified that the transfer \"should not\" have resulted in a change in salary because of \"a policy\" of keeping employees at the same level of pay when they were \"transferred to a lower position.\" In the following colloquy, Ms. Oldham explains her \"policy\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Q. And did you know [the] transfer would result in a reduction in pay of around $ 3 an hour?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   A. Transferred from one position to another should not have been a reduction in pay, since she had been there. If you transfer someone from one position to a lower position, the salary should be the same. The salary should not have changed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   [W]e would have taken care of that in the bookkeeper's office. Because the bookkeeper would have come to me and asked me would the salary be the same or would the salary be at a teacher-assistant level.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   But that's something that you-when you've had a person working, you know, in a position for years and something comes up and arises that they be transferred to another position, the salary has to stay the same.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Q. Where is that? Is that written down somewhere?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   A. That's just a policy that we've always-that I'd always upheld in Trousdale County, as well as Macon County.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   As the foregoing reveals, the \"stay the same\" policy is Ms. Oldham's policy-not a written policy of the Macon County School District. Furthermore, Ms. Oldham would not have been in a position to assure that Plaintiff's salary for the 2014-15 school year would \"stay the same\" because Ms. Oldham retired at the end of the 2013-14 school year. Based on Principal Cook and Plaintiff's testimony that the new position would pay less per hour, and the uncertainty regarding the \"stay the same\" policy, we conclude that a reasonable jury could resolve this issue in Plaintiff's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   On the other hand, whether the transfer would have resulted in a decrease in status and a significant reduction in material responsibilities is not well developed in the record. Nonetheless, Ms. Oldham referred to the teacher-assistant position as a \"lower position.\" Therefore, viewing this modest evidence in a light most favorable to Plaintiff, we find a reasonable jury could resolve this issue in Plaintiff's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Plaintiff produced evidence to establish the second essential element of her prima facie case of age discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   C. Qualified for the Position\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The third essential element is whether Plaintiff was qualified for the bookkeeper position.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court\n   made no finding concerning this element in its prima facie case analysis. The inquiry as to whether a plaintiff was qualified \"should focus on criteria such as the plaintiff's education, experience in the relevant industry, and demonstrated possession of the required general skills.\"\n   <em>\n    Wexler v.

Although Defendant contends that Plaintiff failed to produce evidence to establish she was qualified, we find Plaintiff identified and produced evidence that, if believed by a trier of fact, establishes that she possessed the required skills to perform the job's essential functions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   It is undisputed that Plaintiff served as the bookkeeper for approximately 15 years without a write-up, disciplinary action, or any expression of dissatisfaction other than Principal Cook's assertions that she was difficult to work with and had a bad attitude. This is significant because the fact that an employee held her or his position for an extended period without incident shows the employee's \"ability to perform the essential functions of the job to the satisfaction of his superiors.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bundy v.

We find this contention disingenuous because it is contradicted by testimony in the record as well as an admission of Defendant in response to Plaintiff's statement of additional undisputed facts. Plaintiff testified that, when Principal Cook told her she was being transferred, he said to her, \"You do a fine job with your bookkeeping.\" More significantly, in its response to Plaintiff's statement of additional undisputed facts, Defendant did not dispute \"that [Ms. Templeton's] bookkeeping duties were satisfactory[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    At the prima facie stage, a court should focus on a plaintiff's objective qualifications to determine whether he or she is qualified for the relevant job.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Wexler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9339923\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/317/564/#p576\">\n    317 F.3d at 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MacDonald v.

LEGITIMATE , NONDISCRIMINATORY REASON\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Because Plaintiff established prima facie cases of age discrimination and retaliation, the burden shifted to Defendant to produce evidence that \"if believed by the trier of fact, would support a finding that unlawful discrimination was not the cause of the employment action.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9121622\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/104/39/#p49\">\n    104 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   50 (citing\n   <em>\n    Bauer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11768478\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/169/962/#p966\">\n    169 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   966 ). The trial court found that Defendant met its burden by producing evidence that Plaintiff was unable or unwilling to perform several of her job responsibilities. Specifically, the court found that Plaintiff's job required her to interact with teachers, answer the school telephone when needed, and work well in close quarters with other office staff. The court concluded that Plaintiff was not meeting Principal Cook's performance expectations because (1) she was unwilling or unable to answer the telephone when needed; (2) she complained to Principal Cook about having too much work to do and being overloaded; (3) she blamed Ms. Shockley and the school teachers for making her job more difficult; and (4) she second-guessed Principal Cook's management decisions. The gravamen of Defendant's proffered reasons for transferring Plaintiff is that Plaintiff was not adequately performing her office-related responsibilities and was not getting along with her co-workers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In its brief, Defendant failed to cite to the record to support these conclusory allegations. Nonetheless, by searching through the record, we have determined that Defendant produced evidence that, if believed by a jury, would support a finding that unlawful discrimination was not the cause of the transfer. Principal Cook's deposition and sworn declaration alleged that Plaintiff had not been answering the phone promptly and that her attitude precluded the establishment of a productive relationship between her and the schoolteachers. Defendant's reasons for transferring Plaintiff are supported, to a much lesser degree, by Ms. Shockley and Ms. Burrow's deposition testimony. Both testified that some schoolteachers found Plaintiff unapproachable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \"[A]n employer may make a subjective judgment to [take an adverse employment action] for any reason that is not discriminatory.\"\n   <em>\n    Grady v.

Further, Ms. Oldham testified that she approved the transfer based on,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Principal Cook's report that there were \"ill feelings\" between Plaintiff and Ms. Shockley. Because Ms. Shockley denied this fact under oath, Plaintiff demonstrated that this reason may not have been the true reason for the challenged employment action and that it may be a pretext for illegal discrimination or retaliation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%204-21-311\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 4-21-311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Defendant also contends that Principal Cook's decision was based on Plaintiff's relationship with \"the schoolteachers\" and Principal Cook, rather than with Ms. Shockley and Ms. Thompson. We find Defendant's assertion illogical because the transfer to a teacher-assistant position necessitated that Plaintiff work directly with the schoolteachers. Defendant's explanation is also contradicted by Principal Cook's notes from his meeting with Plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Principal Cook wrote that he transferred Plaintiff to a teacher-assistant position to \"limit her interaction with many personnel whom she had issues with.\" Furthermore, the significance of Principal Cook's testimony that schoolteachers told him they could not approach Plaintiff is offset by his testimony that these complaints were not \"that big of a deal to [him]\" because \"[c]ommunication is going to be a problem at times\" when \"[y]ou've got 55 people working with you.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   As for Plaintiff's work performance, the only evidence that Plaintiff was not fulfilling her responsibilities comes from Principal Cook. In his deposition, Principal Cook testified that he made occasional comments to Plaintiff that he expected her to answer the phone when it was ringing and to answer the door when someone was\n   there. But he also testified that these conversations were not \"sit-down conferences\" and were \"just passing by as I give instructions to all the employees at Central.\" Like Principal Cook's admission that he did not find the schoolteacher's complaint's \"that big of a deal,\" Principal Cook's testimony that he did not find Plaintiff's job performance worthy of a sit-down conversation undermines this explanation's credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Principal Cook also criticizes Plaintiff's job performance in his sworn declaration, stating that Plaintiff \"rarely helped office staff with matters such as attendance and answering the telephone.\" However, Ms. Shockley contradicts Principal Cook by testifying that Plaintiff did her job and was helpful in the office. Moreover, Principal Cook's meeting notes-which he purportedly wrote immediately after informing Plaintiff of the transfer-do not mention Plaintiff's job performance as a reason for the transfer. That Principal Cook's initial recordation of their conversation conspicuously omits any reference to her work performance is enough for a reasonable jury to discount Defendant's reasoning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gaglioti v.
