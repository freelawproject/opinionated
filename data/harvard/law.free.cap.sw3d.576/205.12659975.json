He brings five points on appeal. In Points I-III, he contends the circuit court erred in admitting evidence from his cell phone because the search of the phone was invalid under the Fourth Amendment and the compulsion of his phone's passcode violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. In Point IV, Johnson argues that the court erred in denying his motion for improper joinder and severance of the charges. In Point V, he asserts that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for attempted first-degree sexual abuse. For reasons explained herein, we affirm.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On the night of August 21, 2015, C.N., a college student, went with her roommates to The FieldHouse bar in Columbia. C.N. got separated from her friends. The next memory she had was of smoking \"dabs,\" which are a condensed form of THC more potent than leaf marijuana, in the kitchen of Johnson's apartment. C.N. remembered feeling sick to her stomach afterwards and holding onto the toilet in Johnson's bathroom. Her head was spinning, and she thought she was going to vomit. Johnson came into the bathroom, grabbed C.N.'s arm, told her she was fine, and tried to get her out of the bathroom. She repeatedly told him that she did not feel well and wanted to be left alone, but he continued to grab her. Johnson took C.N. into the bedroom. C.N.'s next memory was of waking up, face down, on the bed the next morning. Johnson was behind her, and she was unsure of what was happening. After this, C.N. occasionally saw Johnson out at The FieldHouse and Roxy's, another Columbia bar. She did not confront Johnson or report the incident to the police because she was unsure whether Johnson had done anything to her that night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A few weeks later, on September 13, 2015, K.B., then nineteen years old, went to Willie's bar in Columbia with her friends, S.C. and J.L. K.B. and S.C. met Johnson while sitting at the bar, and they drank shots with him. They decided to accompany Johnson and his friend back to Johnson's apartment so they could buy some Xanax and continue drinking. At the apartment, Johnson offered K.B. and S.C. cocaine. After the two women each snorted a line, they went to the bathroom together and questioned whether the substance Johnson had given them was actually cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Johnson, K.B., and S.C. went to another apartment to buy the Xanax. On the way to the apartment, S.C. started experiencing \"really weird visuals.\" S.C. saw a rainbow grid, her vision became blurry, and she felt groggy. After buying the Xanax, Johnson gave K.B. and S.C. each a pill. K.B. took her pill, but S.C. did not take hers. The three went back to Johnson's apartment, where S.C. retrieved K.B.'s shoes and purse. When K.B. and S.C. announced their intention to leave at that time, Johnson insisted on accompanying them to the entrance of the apartment building. As they walked down the hallway, K.B. started \"freaking out.\" She began crying, screaming, and crawling back down the hallway toward Johnson's apartment. Johnson took K.B. into his apartment, while S.C. went downstairs to try to find their friend J.L., who was attempting to call her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   By the time S.C. arrived in the lobby of Johnson's apartment building, her memory was getting fuzzy, and she felt like she was losing control of her muscles. She tried to\n   go back upstairs to Johnson's apartment to find K.B., but she could not find the door to the stairwell. S.C. began rehearsing facts like her name and birthday and K.B.'s name and birthday. Finally, S.C. decided to sit in the lobby, where a couple found her. She gave her phone to the couple and asked them to call J.L. and direct him to the building. The couple did so and also called the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When J.L. arrived, he went upstairs and began knocking on apartment doors before he was eventually directed to Johnson's apartment. J.L. knocked loudly and \"assertively\" on Johnson's door for ten to fifteen minutes. Johnson did not answer the door, even though J.L. could hear music or a television inside the apartment. J.L. explained who he was and said that he was looking for his friend, K.B. Johnson still did not answer the door. J.L. went downstairs and gave the police Johnson's apartment number. When the police went to Johnson's apartment, the police had to knock on his door for \"a very long time\" before Johnson finally came to the door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When the police entered the apartment, Johnson unlocked the door to his bedroom. K.B. was lying on Johnson's bed. Because K.B. did not respond to the officers and appeared \"heavily intoxicated\" and \"high on something,\" they called for an ambulance. K.B. was wearing camo pants and a baggy white T-shirt. The T-shirt was not on her properly, as only one arm was through a sleeve. The other arm was draped over the shirt, which caused K.B.'s armpit and the underside of her breast to be exposed when she tried to sit up. K.B.'s clothes were piled in a corner and appeared to have been peeled off of her, because her underwear was still inside of her pants. Johnson told the officer that he had removed K.B.'s clothes because she had vomited \"everywhere\" on them, but the officer did not see any vomit on her clothes. The officers found a jar of Vaseline on the table next to the bed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The officers recovered a baggie from Johnson's living room that was labeled \"4-ACO-DMT fumarate,\" which is a substance associated with hallucinogenic mushrooms. The baggie was also marked, \"Not for human consumption.\" Residue from white powder was nearby and appeared to have been lined up with a credit card. The officers collected the powder, but the powder blew away when it was taken outside for testing. Due to an officer's mistakenly coding his report of the incident as a non-criminal matter, the police did not follow up or investigate the incident as a criminal matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A couple of months later, on November 19, 2015, T.T., then twenty-one years old, went to Roxy's bar and saw Johnson there. T.T. had first met Johnson in late 2014 or early 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   When T.T. encountered Johnson again at Roxy's on the evening of November 19, 2015, Johnson went to the bar multiple times and bought a shot and mixed drinks for her. T.T. was not with Johnson when he got the drinks and could not see if he put anything in them. Johnson invited T.T. and her friends to a party at his place after the bar closed. After having three drinks, T.T. went outside the bar to smoke a cigarette. T.T.'s next memory was tripping while walking with Johnson near a parking garage. Johnson held on to T.T. and told her, \"Come on.\" The next thing T.T. remembered was waking up at around 6:30 or 7:00 a.m. in Johnson's bed. She was lying on her stomach and wearing nothing but her bra and underwear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   T.T. had no memory of taking off her clothes. T.T. asked Johnson if there had been a party, and he said no one but her had come to the apartment. T.T. felt \"very weird, weird and groggy,\" but she did not feel hungover. Although she had consumed alcohol in the past, she had never before blacked out from drinking. Her body was sore, and her neck felt as though someone had choked her. T.T. found a bruise on the back of her thigh that looked like the imprint of three fingers. T.T. did not report the incident to the police because she was not sure what had happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Two and a half months later, in the early morning hours of February 4, 2016, M.V., then seventeen years old, met Johnson outside of The FieldHouse. M.V. and her friend, H.J., had been drinking at the bar using fake IDs. M.V. had also snorted cocaine while inside the bar. Outside the bar, Johnson offered to provide M.V. and H.J. some dabs at his apartment. They agreed to go and went with him and two other women to Johnson's apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Once inside the apartment, M.V. and H.J. smoked the dabs that Johnson gave them. Johnson also mixed drinks for M.V. The two other women eventually left, and M.V. and H. J. fell asleep on Johnson's couch. M.V. got up during the night and tried to find something to eat. She ate three chocolate peanut butter balls from a bag that she found in Johnson's refrigerator. M.V.'s next memory was of waking up and feeling hazy. She thought someone had spiked her drink, and she tried to get H.J. to wake up but was unsuccessful. M.V. passed out again. When she woke up, she felt lethargic and totally out of it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At that point, Johnson came out of his bedroom. M.V. told him that she wanted to go to the doctor. She repeatedly told him that someone had put something in her drink. Johnson told her she was fine, grabbed her by her waist, and walked her into his bedroom. M.V. knew that Johnson was going to take advantage of her because she was not in control of her body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Johnson laid M.V. down on his bed and removed her spandex shorts. He then climbed on top of her and had vaginal intercourse with her. M.V. had no ability to resist him because she felt so weak and could not do anything other than make unhappy grunting noises. Johnson appeared to be turned on by those noises and went faster. According to M.V., the effects that she was feeling were worse than she had experienced when she had taken acid on prior occasions. She seized, twitched, and hit herself, and she also kept passing out and regaining consciousness. M.V. passed out after Johnson had finished raping her the first time. When she woke up, Johnson grabbed her, put her face down on the bed, and had intercourse with her again. This time, M.V. was able to tell him to stop and was crying. Johnson seemed to enjoy her crying and went faster. M.V. continued to seize, twitch, and pass in and out of consciousness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   M.V. and H.J. left Johnson's apartment sometime after 7:00 a.m. M.V. told H.J. that she thought Johnson had raped her. As H.J. drove her home, M.V. felt lethargic and was still seizing, twitching, and hitting herself. H.J. called M.V.'s father and told him that someone had raped M.V. M.V.'s father took her to a hospital as soon as she got home. At the hospital, M.V. was disoriented, had trouble concentrating during the examination, and frequently lost her train of thought mid-sentence. She was groggy and swaying back and forth, her speech was slurred, and she fell asleep in the middle of a conversation with a sheriff's deputy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Johnson's DNA was found in semen recovered from M.V.'s cervix and anus. Testing of M.V.'s blood showed the presence of\n   alcohol, THC, cocaine, and Psilocin, which is a substance commonly found in hallucinogenic mushrooms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The court issued a search warrant for Johnson's apartment on February 19, 2016. The warrant was executed on February 22, 2016, and an iPhone was then seized from the apartment. The iPhone could not be searched at that time because it was locked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Meanwhile, the State charged Johnson with one count of first-degree rape for knowingly having sexual intercourse with M.V., a person who was incapable of consent. The State also charged him with two counts of felony possession of a controlled substance, specifically, more than five grams of marijuana and hallucinogenic candies or dabs, with the intent to distribute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   While the charges against Johnson for the incident involving M.V. were pending, the police were able to search Johnson's iPhone on October 28, 2016. On Johnson's phone, the police found three videos showing him having anal intercourse with C.N. and two videos showing Johnson having oral sex and vaginal intercourse with T.T. Neither C.N. nor T.T. made any sounds during the videotaped sexual encounters. The police showed C.N. and T.T. the videos, and the two women said that they did not consent to any sexual contact with Johnson on those occasions. Johnson's phone also contained texts that Johnson sent to friends during and after the incident with M.V. and H.J. In one of the texts, which Johnson sent when he first arrived at his apartment with M.V. and H.J., Johnson stated that he was \"about to finally get some pussy.\" In another text that Johnson sent a few hours after M.V. left his apartment, Johnson said that he \"[m]ade a porno.\" Additionally, Johnson's phone contained a brief video of M.V. and H.J. sleeping in his apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The State subsequently filed a five-count amended indictment against Johnson. Count I alleged that Johnson committed first-degree sodomy on August 22, 2015, by knowingly having deviate sexual intercourse with C.N. Count II alleged that Johnson committed attempted first-degree sexual abuse on September 14, 2015, by removing K.B.'s clothing, which was a substantial step toward the commission of the crime of first-degree sexual abuse and was done for the purpose of committing such abuse. Count III alleged that Johnson committed first-degree sodomy on November 20, 2015, by knowingly having deviate sexual intercourse with T.T. Count IV alleged that Johnson committed first-degree rape on November 20, 2015, by knowingly having sexual intercourse with T.T. Lastly, Count V alleged that Johnson committed first-degree rape on February 4, 2016, by knowingly having sexual intercourse with M.V. Counts I, III, IV, and V alleged that the victims were incapable of consent because they were in a drug-induced state and were known by Johnson to be unable to make a reasonable judgment as to the nature or harmfulness of the sexual acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Trial was held in April 2017. Johnson testified in his defense that C.N., T.T., and M.V. were conscious during the sexual acts and that all of the sexual encounters were consensual. Johnson admitted that, in addition to videotaping himself having sex with C.N. and T.T., he videotaped himself having sex with M.V. He did not save the video of M.V. to his phone, however, but instead sent it to a friend via Snapchat. Johnson admitted that none of the women were aware he was videotaping them. Johnson denied attempting to sexually abuse K.B. He first testified on direct examination that he helped K.B. take off her clothes and put on his clothes because she had urinated on herself. On cross-examination, however, he acknowledged that he\n   told the police that he had taken off K.B.'s clothing by himself because she had vomited on them. Johnson also testified that he was \"very knowledgeable\" about the different forms of hallucinogenic mushrooms and their effects. He admitted that he had mixed cocaine with the 4-ACO-DMT fumarate in the plastic bag that police found in his apartment on the night of the incident with K.B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The jury found Johnson guilty on all charges. The court sentenced him as a persistent misdemeanor offender to four years in prison for attempted sexual abuse and twenty-five years in prison for each of the two rape and two sodomy counts. The sentences on the rape and sodomy counts were ordered to run consecutively to each other and concurrently to the attempted sexual abuse sentence, for a total of 100 years. Johnson appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Fourth and Fifth Amendment Challenges to Cell Phone Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Johnson's first three points on appeal concern the circuit court's denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained from his seized cell phone. In Point I, he contends the search warrant was invalid under the Fourth Amendment because it was not supported by probable cause, was not sufficiently particular, was overbroad, and was stale when the search of the phone was executed. In Point II, he asserts he did not consent to the search of his phone. In Point III, Johnson argues the court violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination when it compelled him to enter his passcode to unlock the phone so that the State could examine it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Our review of the circuit court's ruling on a motion to suppress is limited to determining whether there is substantial evidence to support the court's decision.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Facts Surrounding Search of Cell Phone\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The police seized Johnson's cell phone from his apartment under a search warrant issued on February 19, 2016. The warrant authorized police to search and seize:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Illegal controlled substances, and drug paraphernalia. All bedding materials (i.e. sheets, mattress pads, comforters, blankets, pillow cases etc). All cell phones, electronic tablets, computers, digital media storage devices (hard drives, USB devices), (and to conduct an off-premises examination/search of said devices for all data/software as defined by RSMO 556.063 ) pertaining to the offense [of] Distribution Deliver and Manufacture of a Controlled Substance RSMO 195.211, and Rape in the First Degree RSMO 566.030.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The warrant further provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   This Court grants permission to use whatever data analysis techniques appear necessary to locate and retrieve the evidence described herein, including conducting an off-site examination. This Court further grants permission to continue the forensic examination beyond the time at which the return of the search warrant is made to this court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In the warrant, the court stated that, \"from the sworn allegations of said complaint and from the supporting written affidavits filed therewith [this court] has found that there is probable cause to believe the allegations of the complaint to be true and probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant herein.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The affidavit accompanying and incorporated into the warrant was completed by Detective Patrick Corcoran of the Columbia Police Department. In the affidavit, Corcoran described in detail the alleged incidents involving K.B. and M.V. He also described an alleged incident involving another woman, M.S. Approximately two months before the incident with K.B., M.S. filed a complaint alleging that she had gone to Johnson's apartment to buy marijuana and Xanax from him. M.S. told the police that she used the substances while at his apartment and that, afterwards, Johnson took advantage of her sexually. According to M.S., this happened to her multiple times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   After describing the alleged incidents involving K.B., M.V., and M.S., Corcoran then averred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   It is likely, based on this ongoing criminal history, Johnson has illegal controlled substances, paraphernalia, and the bedding used during the rape of M.V. stored at this address. It is also likely Johnson has[ ] cellular phones, digital media storage devices, computers, electronic tablets, which may be used in the procurement and distribution of controlled substances stored at this address.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   From my training and experience, I know suspects use cellular phones, computers, and electronic tablets[ ] to store illegal content and carry out illegal activity, such as Felony Drug Possession RSMO 195.202, Distribution Deliver and Manufacture of a Controlled Substance RSMO 195.211. Based on M.V.'s description Johnson also used his phone to look up her condition during the sexual attack.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   From my training and experience, I know that cellular phones, and electronic tablets, contain a multitude of electronic capabilities very similar to a computer. Some of the above listed devices have the ability to search the internet, obtain and send e mails, take photos, and access social media applications. They also have the ability to retain memory of captured items even after they are deleted. The information stored within these devices is perishable and can be unrecoverable as new items write over the deleted items. Much of this information, including the deleted data, is available only through a forensic examination of the phone. From my training and experience I know that suspects often use cellular phones and other electronic devices to conduct illegal activities. These devices often store that information so that it can be accessed at a later time even when it has been deleted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Police executed the warrant on February 22, 2016, and seized Johnson's phone. The phone could not be searched at that time because it was locked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In March 2016, Johnson filed a motion to preserve electronic evidence and to allow the defense's expert to examine Johnson's phone before the State examined it. In the motion, Johnson asserted that his phone \"might contain exculpatory information\" and that, \"[i]f a minimally trained person attempts to extract data from the cell phone, any exculpatory evidence could be destroyed.\" He requested that the court enter an order prohibiting the State from testing the phone until after he had a chance to extract and examine the data on the phone. The court granted Johnson's motion. The parties agreed that both Johnson's\n   and the State's examination of the cell phone would \"all be done at once.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   At the start of a pretrial conference on October 24, 2016, the parties again discussed the cell phone examination, which had not yet occurred. The State informed the court that its expert was planning to go to St. Louis that day to observe the defense expert's examination of the phone. The State said that its expert believed that, based upon the type of cell phone and the type of analysis that the defense's expert was planning to perform, there was an \"extreme likelihood\" that the contents of the phone would be \"wiped clean,\" meaning erased, by the defense expert's examination. The State advised that it was planning to proceed to trial \"with nothing from the phone,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   but it wanted to inform the court and the parties of the possibility that Johnson's phone could be erased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   After discussing other matters during the same pretrial conference, the court and the parties returned to discussing the cell phone examination. Defense counsel explained that the reason there was a chance that the phone might be erased was because law enforcement had attempted to enter several passcodes but was unsuccessful in unlocking the phone, and any more attempts might cause the phone to reset. Defense counsel stated that she had just spoken to her expert, Greg Chatten, who told her that law enforcement was threatening to charge him with destruction of evidence if he did the extraction that day and the phone reset. Both the court and the State reassured defense counsel that Chatten would not be charged with spoliation or destruction of evidence and that everyone understood that the there was a possibility that Chatten's examination of the phone might cause it to reset.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Chatten's examination did not take place that day, however, because defense counsel was concerned about the possible destruction of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Instead, defense counsel requested that the State make the phone available at the Boone County Jail so that Johnson could use his thumbprint to unlock the phone for Chatten's examination. The State agreed, so long as Johnson agreed to use his thumbprint so the State's expert could perform his examination. Defense counsel stated that she had not talked to Johnson about using his thumbprint to unlock the phone but that he had previously indicated that he would consent to doing that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Consequently, four days later, on October 28, 2016, Johnson, defense counsel, Chatten, Corcoran, and Jeff Adams, who was a mobile forensic examiner for the Columbia Police Department, met at the Boone County Jail to conduct the examinations of Johnson's cell phone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Adams understood that Johnson had agreed to unlock the phone so that Chatten could examine the contents of the phone and then Adams could examine the contents of the\n   phone. Adams initially asked Johnson to use his thumbprint to unlock the phone. Johnson's attempt to unlock the phone using his thumbprint failed, so he entered his passcode. Adams watched as Johnson entered his passcode, and Adams wrote down Johnson's passcode. Chatten then downloaded the phone's contents. Chatten's download took approximately ten minutes. During Chatten's examination, the phone automatically locked, but it did not prevent the defense's download from being completed. After Chatten's examination was concluded, Adams asked Johnson to reenter the passcode to unlock the phone so that he could perform the State's examination. When Johnson refused to reenter his passcode, Corcoran told him that the State had a right to the evidence and that the State might seize Chatten's computer with the downloaded contents of Johnson's phone. At that point, the parties agreed to call the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   During the phone conference with the court, the State asked the court for a motion to compel Johnson to enter his passcode into the phone. In response, defense counsel acknowledged that she and the State had agreed that, after Chatten's examination of the phone, the State would be able to do its examination. Nevertheless, defense counsel argued that she made that agreement without knowing that the phone would lock again and that Johnson would have to reenter his passcode for Adams to perform his examination. When the court asked defense counsel why, in light of the fact that defense counsel had already agreed to allow the State to perform its examination after Chatten's examination, it would matter that Johnson would have to reenter his passcode to allow the State to do so, defense counsel did not provide a reason. Finding that counsel for the State and the defense had previously agreed that the State could examine the phone following Chatten's examination, the court granted the motion to compel Johnson to enter his passcode to unlock the phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Johnson reentered his passcode, and Adams examined the phone. From the examination, the State police found the three videos showing Johnson having anal intercourse with C.N., the two videos showing Johnson having oral sex and vaginal intercourse with T.T., the texts that Johnson sent to friends during and after the incident with M.V., and the video of M.V. and H.J. sleeping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Prior to trial, Johnson filed a motion to suppress physical evidence, including the cell phone seized from his apartment. The court held a hearing on the motion. Adams testified for the State. In addition to describing the October 28, 2016 examinations of Johnson's cell phone, Adams also testified about a recorded phone call Johnson had with an acquaintance on November 15, 2016, while he was in jail. During the call, which was played for the court, Johnson acknowledged that his counsel had made a \"deal\" with the State concerning the examination of his cell phone and that the court ordered him to reenter his passcode based upon this deal. Although Johnson represented that he did not know about the deal his counsel made allowing the State to examine his phone, he said he said he went along with it because he thought it was going to help him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Following the hearing, the court entered its order denying Johnson's motion to suppress. In its order, the court found that the search warrant was supported by probable cause and properly permitted a search of the contents of the cell phone. The court also found law enforcement acted in good faith reliance on the warrant in executing it. The court rejected Johnson's argument that the warrant was stale by the time the phone was examined. Moreover,\n   the court found that, even if the warrant were invalid or stale, Johnson consented, through his counsel, to a search and examination of his phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The court further found that the \"foregone conclusion\" exception negated Johnson's argument that the compelled use of his passcode was testimonial and violated his Fifth Amendment rights. Specifically, the court found that the State knew a passcode existed, knew that Johnson possessed the passcode, and knew the passcode was authentic because the State saw Johnson use it to unlock his phone. Likewise, the State was aware, with reasonable particularity, that Johnson's phone contained relevant evidence, a fact that was bolstered by Johnson's desire to have his own expert examine the phone for exculpatory evidence and the discussions over several months between defense counsel and the State regarding the logistics of the cell phone examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   At trial, the court granted Johnson a continuing objection with respect to his cell phone and the contents of the phone. Johnson included his claims of error regarding the admission of the cell phone evidence in his motion for new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Validity of Warrant under Fourth Amendment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In Point I, Johnson contends the court clearly erred in denying his motion to suppress and admitting the cell phone evidence because the search warrant was not supported by probable cause, was not sufficiently particular, was overbroad, and was stale when it was executed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \"The Fourth Amendment protects the 'right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.' \"\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Corcoran described, in detail, the incidents reported by M.S., K.B., and M.V. In each incident, Johnson provided the victim with one or more controlled substances, including marijuana, Xanax, cocaine, and psychedelics, that rendered the victim either high or incapacitated. Johnson then either took advantage of the victim sexually (M.S.), undressed the victim before being interrupted by the police (K.B.), or had sexual intercourse with the victim multiple times (M.V.). Corcoran averred that, based upon this ongoing criminal history, it was likely that Johnson had a cell phone that \"may be used in the procurement and distribution of controlled substances stored at this address.\" He stated that, based upon his training and experience, he knows that suspects use cell phones to store illegal content and carry out illegal activity such as felony drug possession and distribution, delivery, and manufacture of a controlled substance. Also, Corcoran explained that he knows that cell phones contain a multitude of electronic capabilities very similar to a computer, including the ability to search the internet, obtain and send e-mails, take photos, and access social media applications. Additionally, Corcoran averred that M.V. told police that Johnson also used his phone to look up her condition during the rape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Under the totality of the circumstances, including Johnson's providing controlled substances to the victims during the incidents, Corcoran's knowledge from his training and experience that suspects use cell phones to procure and distribute such controlled substances, and Johnson's accessing his cell phone during the rape of M.V., there was a substantial basis for concluding that there was a fair probability that the search of Johnson's cell phone would uncover evidence of the alleged drug offenses and the rape. The warrant to search Johnson's phone was supported by probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.

Adams's testimony indicates that, while the phone was in police custody, the device was turned off and was turned on only when he attempted to search the phone and found that it was locked. According to Adams, turning off the phone prevented it from being remotely erased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Johnson makes much of the fact that the State offered evidence and argument that, while he was in jail, he asked one of his friends and his mother to either remotely lock the phone or erase evidence from it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   He argues that the State's raising this issue shows that the State had \"concerns of the mutability and destructibility of evidence\" while the phone was in police custody, prior to the data extraction. We disagree. The record shows that the State raised the issue of Johnson's attempting to have the phone remotely locked or erased in two contexts. First, the State elicited evidence on this issue in conjunction with evidence regarding the defense's examination of the phone. Specifically, after offering evidence that Johnson attempted to have the phone remotely locked or erased, the State offered evidence that, during the defense's examination of the phone, Chatten turned on the phone and neglected to put it in airplane mode, thereby leaving it vulnerable to being remotely erased. While this may indicate that the State had concerns about the phone being remotely erased\n   <em>\n    during the defense's examination of the phone\n   </em>\n   , it does not indicate that the State had concerns about the mutability and destructibility of evidence on the phone during the eight months it was in police custody before the examination. Second, the State used the evidence of Johnson's attempting to have the phone remotely locked or erased to demonstrate his consciousness of guilt, arguing that he knew he had \"some incriminating stuff\" on it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Because the record clearly shows that Johnson's phone was in police custody and remained unalterable during the eight months between the time it was seized and the search warrant was executed, the search warrant was not stale. The search of Johnson's cell phone complied with the Fourth Amendment. Point I is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Consent to Search\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In Point II, Johnson contends the court clearly erred in denying his motion to suppress and admitting the cell phone evidence because he did not consent to the search of his cell phone. Having found that the search of Johnson's cell phone complied with the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement, we need not determine whether Johnson consented to the search. Point II is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Compulsion of Passcode and Fifth Amendment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In Point III, Johnson contends the circuit court clearly erred in denying his motion to suppress and admitting the evidence\n   from his cell phone because the court's order compelling him to use his passcode to unlock the phone so the State could examine it violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Specifically, Johnson argues that entering his passcode into the phone constituted a testimonial act that was protected under the Fifth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Fifth Amendment protects a person from being compelled in a criminal case to be a witness against himself.

Johnson, who admitted to being \"very knowledgeable\" about the different forms of hallucinogenic mushrooms and their effects, admitted that he had actually given K.B. a mixture of cocaine and a substance associated with hallucinogenic mushrooms that was not for human consumption. After K.B. began showing the effects of the drugs by crying, screaming, and crawling down the hallway, Johnson took her into his apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Johnson did not open the door when J.L., who explained who he was and said that he was looking for K.B., knocked on Johnson's door for ten to fifteen minutes. When the police then knocked on Johnson's door looking for K.B., they had to knock for \"a very long time\" before Johnson finally answered the door. After Johnson allowed the police inside, they found K.B. inside Johnson's bedroom, which he had locked from the outside. She was not responsive and appeared heavily intoxicated. A jar of Vaseline was on the table next to the bed. K.B.'s clothes, including her underwear, had been removed and piled in a corner. K.B. was dressed in clothes that were not hers and that appeared to have been hastily put on her. Although Johnson told one of the officers that he had removed K.B.'s clothes for her because she had vomited \"everywhere\" on them, the officer did not see\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   vomit on her clothes. Moreover, at trial, Johnson gave a different explanation for removing K.B.'s clothes, as he testified that he had \"helped\" her take off her clothes because she had urinated on herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   From this evidence, the jury could reasonably infer that Johnson had removed K.B.'s clothes for the purpose of engaging in sexual contact with her and that he would have committed the act had the police not intervened.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

After ten failed passcode attempts, however, the phone would be erased and reset.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Adams is trained and certified in using Cellebrite, a software and hardware tool that is used to obtain a forensic image, or copy, of the exact contents of a cell phone or mobile device. Cellebrite recovers all of the device's \"logical data,\" including all text messages, phone calls, photographs, and videos. Adams could not examine the contents of Johnson's phone when it was initially seized because, at that time, Cellebrite was unable to bypass the passcode on that particular model of iPhone.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    All statutory references are to the Revised Statutes of Missouri 2000, as updated by the 2013 Cumulative Supplement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    While Johnson's phone was locked, there is no evidence that it had been remotely locked. Rather, Adams explained that, when a thumbprint has not been entered to unlock that type of iPhone for eight hours, the phone locks and requires a passcode to unlock it. Also, the phone locks and requires a passcode to unlock it when the phone has been turned off.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    Indeed, Johnson's counsel conceded during oral arguments on appeal that if, after observing Johnson enter his passcode the first time for his expert's examination, law enforcement had simply entered the passcode on its own instead of seeking the order compelling Johnson to do it, the Fifth Amendment would not be implicated.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    In his brief, Johnson also alleges that he was substantially prejudiced because the joinder of the offenses constrained the circuit court to impose consecutive, rather than concurrent, sentences on four of the counts. We decline to consider the merits of this allegation, as Johnson did not include this allegation in his required written motion for severance and is attempting to enlarge his particularized showing of substantial prejudice beyond what he presented to the court below. Because the circuit court never had the opportunity to address this allegation of prejudice, we cannot say that the court abused its discretion in denying Johnson's motion to sever on this basis.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
