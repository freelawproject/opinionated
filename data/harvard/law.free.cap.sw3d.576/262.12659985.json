The School District alleged that Count I of B.Z.'s petition failed to state a claim because political subdivisions are not \"persons\" who can be liable for public accommodation discrimination pursuant to section 213.065. The School District's motion also alleged that its sovereign immunity for the common law torts alleged in Counts II and III of the petition was not waived by the acquisition of liability insurance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Though it is uncontroverted that the School District was insured by Missouri Public Entity Risk Management Fund (\"MOPERM\") when the acts and omissions giving rise to B.Z.'s petition are alleged to have occurred,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   the parties dispute whether that\n   policy afforded the School District coverage for the claims alleged against it in Counts II and III of the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Respondent denied the School District's motion for summary judgment on October 12, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   On November 1, 2017, the School District filed a petition for writ of prohibition alleging that section 213.065 of the MHRA does not authorize a cause of action for discrimination in public accommodation against political subdivisions of the state, and that sovereign immunity was not waived for the common law tort claims alleged in Counts II and III of the petition by the acquisition of insurance. After requesting suggestions from the Respondent, this court issued a preliminary writ of prohibition directing that Respondent take no further action as to the School District in the Underlying Lawsuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   We later quashed the preliminary writ of prohibition with respect to the claim against the School District pursuant to section 213.065, but made permanent the writ of prohibition with respect to the common law claims asserted against School District.

Counts II and III of B.Z.'s petition are not claims on causes of action \"other than those established by Missouri law.\" Consistent with this fact, Respondent does not rely on the bold and italicized text in Section I, subparagraph A.2 to contend that the School District waived sovereign immunity by acquiring insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Instead, Respondent relies solely on the underlined text in Section I, subparagraph A.2 to argue that the School District acquired insurance which waived sovereign immunity. The underlined text in Section I, subparagraph A.2 provides coverage \"for public officials and employees.\" Unlike the coverage afforded the School District by subparagraph A.2, the coverage afforded to public officials and employees by subparagraph A.2 is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   limited to particular claims.

The argument disregards that \"[r]espondeat superior is not a cause of action but rather a theory under which an employer is held responsible for the misconduct of a [sic] employee where that employee is acting within the course of scope of his employment.\"\n   <em>\n    Dibrill v.

App. E.D. 2012). Because political subdivisions act through their employees, recovery against a political subdivision in tort is almost universally pursuant to the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior. See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Southers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8360265\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/263/603/\">\n    263 S.W.3d at 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding the same for actions to recover damages pursuant to the motor vehicle sovereign immunity waiver found in section 537.600.1(1)). By its very essence, therefore, sovereign immunity protects the state and its political subdivisions from liability, including\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     unless\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   sovereign immunity for the political subdivision is expressly waived. The MOPERM policy's express extension of coverage to public officials and employees for their\n   <em>\n    personal\n   </em>\n   liability does not constitute an express extension of coverage for the School District's\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability. \"It is often possible to sue a public official or an employee on a claim against which the public agency is protected by sovereign immunity, and one can well understand why [a political subdivision] might want to protect its functionaries against individual liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Moses\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10015838,10015750\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/910/735/\">\n    910 S.W.2d at 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, \"[t]his provision [in a policy] does not [operate to] waive the [political subdivision's sovereign] immunity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10015838,10015750\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/910/735/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Thus, the MOPERM policy does not provide the School District with coverage for\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability as to all common law tort claims merely because it provides coverage to public officials and employees for such claims. As such, the School District has not waived sovereign immunity for the common law torts asserted in Counts II and III of B.Z.'s petition. Were we to conclude to the contrary, then the provisions in Section I, subparagraphs A.1 and A.2 expressly limiting the coverage afforded the School District would be rendered superfluous. \"[W]e aim to give a reasonable meaning to every provision [of an insurance policy] and to avoid an interpretation that renders some provisions trivial or superfluous.\"\n   <em>\n    Nooter Corp. v.
