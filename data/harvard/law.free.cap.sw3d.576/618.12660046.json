In his sole point on appeal, Miller claims the judgment of convictions for burglary in the first degree and violation of an order of protection put him in jeopardy twice for the same crime. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum has been provided to the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
