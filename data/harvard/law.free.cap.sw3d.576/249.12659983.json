The Petition sought a declaration that the Martins were proper parties to bring a wrongful death claim as the equitable adoptive parents of Carl Lee DeBrodie (\"DeBrodie\"). The Petition was originally brought against a number of defendants but, following voluntary dismissals in the circuit court, the Respondents before this Court are Carolyn Summers (who is the biological mother of DeBrodie) (\"Summers\") and Carol Samson, (who is the personal representative of the Estate of Carl Lee DeBrodie and Next Friend to Summers) (\"Samson\") (collectively, \"Defendants\") and Second Chance Homes of Fulton, LLC (\"Second Chance Homes\"). Following the filing of this appeal and briefing of the issues, the Martins moved to dismiss the appeal as to Second Chance Homes, leaving only the Defendants as Respondent's in this action. The Martins bring seven allegations of error on appeal. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The relevant and somewhat tortured legal history of this case began in 1999. In September 1999, the Cole County Circuit Court appointed Mary Martin to be the legal guardian of DeBrodie, who was then thirteen years old and considered a special needs child. In the guardianship judgment, that court found that DeBrodie's biological mother, Summers, was \"severely intellectually, psychologically, socially, and occupationally impaired\" and that both she and DeBrodie's biological father\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   were unable or unfit to assume the duties of guardianship. The court found that grounds existed to terminate the parental rights of DeBrodie's mother as to DeBrodie and his younger sister, but found that termination would not be in the children's best interest. Mary Martin continued to serve as DeBrodie's legal guardian until 2004 when he turned eighteen and he lived with the Martin's in their home. At some point after DeBrodie turned 18, the Callaway County Circuit Court adjudged DeBrodie to be an incapacitated and disabled adult. DeBrodie became a ward of the Public Administrator of Callaway County and a new legal guardian was appointed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2011, the Martins sought to legally adopt DeBrodie as an incapacitated and disabled adult.\n   <em>\n    In re DeBrodie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7094193\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/400/881/#p883\">\n    400 S.W.3d 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 883 (Mo.

This Court reversed and remanded that judgment finding, under the circumstances, DeBrodie's consent was not statutorily required.\n   <em>\n    In re DeBrodie I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7094193\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/400/881/#p883\">\n    400 S.W.3d at 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On remand, the circuit court heard additional evidence and, thereafter, denied the Martins' petition for adoption on the grounds that they failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence the fitness or propriety of the adoption, or that the welfare of DeBrodie demanded that the adoption be granted. This Court affirmed the judgment, in part based on a consideration of the familial ties between DeBrodie and his mother that would be severed by such an adoption.\n   <em>\n    In re DeBrodie II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6890316\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/452/644/\">\n    452 S.W.3d at 648-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Second Chance Homes reported DeBrodie missing on April 17, 2017. On April 24, 2017, DeBrodie's body was found encased in concrete inside a locked storage unit in Fulton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Martins filed their Petition on April 9, 2018. The Petition named as defendants Summers and Samson as well as Second Chance Homes, and the unknown parties responsible for DeBrodie's death. The Petition sought a declaration that the Martins were entitled to sue for wrongful death pursuant to section 537.080\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   as the equitable adoptive parents of DeBrodie. The Petition also sought declarations that the Martins were entitled to recover from all defendants--other than Summers and Sampson--compensatory and aggravated damages in the amount of twenty-one million dollars for the negligent death of DeBrodie and twenty-one million dollars for the intentional torts which caused the wrongful death of DeBrodie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 21, 2018, Summers and Samson filed a joint Motion to Dismiss (\"Motion to Dismiss\") alleging the Martins lacked the legal capacity to sue, citing to Rule 55.27(a)(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second Chance Homes filed a separate Motion to Dismiss or in the Alternative Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings on June 22, 2018. The circuit court held a hearing on both motions and entered judgment dismissing the Petition on July 17, 2018\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"Judgment\"). The Court dismissed the Petition for four stated reasons: (1) the Martins lacked standing to bring a wrongful death claim pursuant to section 537.080 because they were not the natural or adoptive parents of DeBrodie; (2) the Martins' claims are barred by res judicata, in that their attempt at equitable adoption has already been adjudicated and rejected in other proceedings (referencing the Martins' previous adoption proceedings); (3) Missouri does not recognize a right for \"equitable parents\" to recover on behalf of a deceased child; and (4) only one action may be brought under section 537.080 for the death of DeBrodie and there is an existing previously filed lawsuit that bars the current action. The Judgment dismissed all claims and all defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the conclusion of the briefing in this matter, the Martins filed a Motion to Dismiss this appeal as to Second Chance Homes. The Martins alleged in that motion that on December 5, 2018, a judgment was entered under seal in a wrongful death case regarding the death of DeBrodie brought by the Defendants in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri (\"Federal Judgment\"). According to the Martins, the Federal\n   Judgment releases Second Chance Homes from all further liability for the death of DeBrodie and as such, renders this appeal moot as to Second Chance Homes. Second Chance Homes filed Suggestions in Opposition which did not dispute that the Federal Judgment renders this appeal moot as to Second Chance Homes but contends that the appeal is now moot in its entirety. The Defendants filed no response to that motion. The Martins argue that the appeal, as to the Defendants, still presents a live controversy because it seeks a declaration that the Martins are equitable parents of DeBrodie who have standing to bring a wrongful death claim against other tortfeasors in later actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A copy of the Federal Judgment was not filed with this Court. We have no ability to determine what affect the Federal Judgment might have on the rights and liabilities of the Defendants. It does not appear based solely on the Motion to Dismiss and Suggestions in Opposition that the question of whether the Martins may bring a claim for wrongful death based on their position as alleged equitable parents of DeBrodie was addressed by the federal court. Because the Martins and Second Chance Homes are in mutual agreement that the appeal is moot as to Second Chance Homes we may dismiss that portion of this appeal without the benefit of knowing the terms of the Federal Judgment. The Martins, however, still allege that there exists a live controversy as to their claims against the Defendants and we cannot determine otherwise without reviewing the Federal Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Martins' Motion to Dismiss Second Chance Homes is granted and Second Chance Homes is dismissed from this appeal. We proceed with the appeal only as to the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"The standard of review for a trial court's grant of a motion to dismiss is\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Lynch v.

As we find their fourth point on appeal dispositive we begin there. The Martins allege that the circuit court erred in granting Defendant's Motion to Dismiss for lack of standing to sue for the wrongful death of DeBrodie because the Legislature intended equitable parents to have standing as first class beneficiaries under section 537.080.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Martins' Petition sought a declaration from the circuit court recognizing \"their rights and interests as persons entitled to sue for wrongful death of Carl Lee DeBrodie under Missouri statutes and law, specifically including [the Martins'] standing and status as persons, parents of Carl Lee DeBrodie, entitled to sue for the death of Carl Lee DeBrodie under \u00a7 [537.080] RSMo....\" The Martins did not seek a declaration of equitable adoption beyond the scope of granting them standing to bring a wrongful death action. They are further not requesting that Summers' parental rights be terminated or a declaration that Summers is not a proper party to bring a wrongful death action on DeBrodie's behalf. In fact, the Martins only seek to share in any wrongful death recovery with Summers as additional First Class plaintiffs under section 537.080 in any wrongful death action. Because of the dismissal of the other defendants, this request for declaration of equitable adoption\n   remains as the only live controversy in the Petition. Thus, if such a declaration of equitable adoption is made and the Martins still lack standing to bring a claim under section 537.080 then the circuit court did not err in finding that their Petition failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. This Court then need not answer the question of whether the Martins should be declared as equitable adoptive parents of DeBrodie, or even if such a declaration could be made given this Court's prior holdings in\n   <em>\n    In re DeBrodie I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    In re DeBrodie II\n   </em>\n   . We must therefore first address the question of whether equitably adopted parents have standing as first class litigants under Section 537.080.1(1) to bring a cause of action for wrongful death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"Standing is a question of law that we review de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    Borges v.

The Missouri legislature created three classes of parties who may bring suit for wrongful death. Section 537.080.1. As relevant to this case, parents of a decedent are included in the first class. Section 537.080.1(1). The first class includes \"the spouse or children or the surviving lineal descendants of any deceased children, natural or adopted, legitimate or illegitimate, or by the father or mother of the deceased, natural or adoptive.\" Section 537.080.1(1). If there is no person listed in the first class then the statute directs that one looks to the second class. Section 537.080.1(2). Siblings and descendants of siblings are in the second class. Section 537.080.1(2). Then, only if there are no persons provided for in class one or two, the court is allowed to appoint a\n   <em>\n    plaintiff ad litem\n   </em>\n   to bring the claim under the third class. Section 537.080.1(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Martins allege that they are the \"equitable\" adoptive parents of DeBrodie and seek a declaration that \"equitable\" adoptive parents are first-class litigants under section 537.080.1(1) the same as legally adoptive parents. In support of this contention they first argue that the terms \"natural\" and \"adoptive\" in section 537.080 are ambiguous and leave open the question of whether equitably adoptive parents may have standing to bring an action and to recover damages as first class beneficiaries. For further support the Martins cite to\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

The Martins ask that we overrule\n   <em>\n    Halterman\n   </em>\n   or, in the alternative, distinguish the holding of\n   <em>\n    Halterman\n   </em>\n   from the present case. The Martins argue that public policy dictates that we should liberally construe section 537.080 in favor of a greater number of grieving persons being granted standing. In seeking such an outcome, the Martins analogize the present case to cases of child custody disputes in which Missouri courts have found that a recognition of non-familial relationships may be in the best interests of a child.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bowers v. Bowers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656101\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/543/608/\">\n    543 S.W.3d 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. banc 2018) ;\n   <em>\n    Cotton v.

These cases are inapposite. As with\n   <em>\n    Coon\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Holt\n   </em>\n   , these cases recognize non-familial relationships for the benefit of a child. We find no basis for extending the holdings of these cases to create a legal benefit for the alleged parent to proceed with a cause of action for damages. As noted by this Court in\n   <em>\n    Halterman\n   </em>\n   , courts will not punish a child for an adult's failure to timely and properly formalize an adoption. The same justification does not operate in reverse to benefit an adult who controls whether or not a legal relationship with a child is formalized.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Halterman\n   </em>\n   was and remains sound. The doctrine of equitable adoption is for the benefit of a child not so that the \"adoptive\" parent may recover damages for the wrongful death of a child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   To the extent that the Martins are correct that the language of section 537.080 might allow for the doctrine of equitable adoption, the courts have made clear that the statute only allows for recovery of damages by an equitably adopted child and not by equitably adopted parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We recognize that the Martins shared a close familial like relationship with DeBrodie and viewed their role as his\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parents. They took him into their home and raised him through most of his formative years and clearly cared deeply for him. We also do not doubt that the Martins sincerely grieve the loss of DeBrodie. Missouri's wrongful death statute does not, however, encompass all parties who grieve the loss of an individual. The statute only confers on certain parties the authority to bring and recover damages from a wrongful death suit and sound precedent holds that equitable adoptive parents are\n   not parties given the authority to sue for damages under section 537.080.1(1).\n   <em>\n    Halterman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10009067\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/867/559/\">\n    867 S.W.2d at 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
