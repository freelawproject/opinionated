The suit arises from personal injuries sustained by Mr. Magri when a Harrah's employee abruptly moved a stool on which Mr. Magri was resting his foot while sitting at a black jack table.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Harrah's challenges the trial court's findings on three of the five legal elements of negligence. For the reasons that follow, we find that Harrah's owed a duty of reasonable care to Mr. Magri, Harrah's breached that duty, and the particular harm sustained by Mr. Magri fell within the scope of Harrah's duty to exercise reasonable care. We also find that the trial court was not clearly wrong in apportioning 70% of fault to Harrah's, and 30% to Mr. Magri. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the evening of January 18, 2012, Mr. Magri went to Harrah's to celebrate his birthday. Mr. Magri was seated on a high stool at the blackjack table to the left of the dealer, with an empty stool situated to Mr. Magri's immediate left. Because Mr. Magri recently had undergone a left knee replacement, he rested his left leg and ankle on the bottom of the empty stool, and faced the dealer. While Mr. Magri was playing blackjack, the pit boss called for an employee to empty a trash can in the area. When the employee, Nakeisha McCormick, attempted to empty the trash can, she moved the stool upon which Mr. Magri's left foot was resting. Mr. Magri claims that she yanked the stool, twisting his left foot and ankle. After the incident, Harrah's employees applied ice and wrapping to Mr. Magri's left foot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 15, 2013, Mr. Magri filed suit against Harrah's and others alleging various theories of negligence, including failure to exercise reasonable care, failure to warn of an unsafe condition, and failure to properly train employees. On September 17 and 18, 2018, a bench trial was held. On October 17, 2018, the trial court rendered a judgment in favor of Mr. Magri and against Harrah's in the amount of $601,689.31, after reducing the amount of the original judgment by 30%, based on Mr. Magri's comparative fault. Harrah's timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Harrah's raises four assignments of error: (1) Harrah's owed no duty to protect or warn Mr. Magri because the risk that the empty stool could be moved was open and obvious to everyone who encountered it; (2) The trial court erred in finding that Harrah's breached its legal duty because a reasonably prudent person observing an empty stool would not have inspected underneath the stool before moving it; (3) The trial court erred in finding legal causation because the risk that a patron sitting on one stool would put his foot on an adjacent stool, and that his foot would be injured when the stool was moved, is not within the scope of a Harrah's duty to exercise reasonable care; and (4) The trial court erred in allocating only 30% of the fault to Mr. Magri since he placed his foot on an empty stool knowing that the stool could be moved at any time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Mr. Magri's Trial Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mr. Magri testified that he had been to Harrah's four to ten times before the incident, and during these prior visits he saw \"more people than he could count\" sitting with their feet on adjacent stools. At the time of the accident, he was sitting at a blackjack table to the left of the dealer, with his left foot on the bottom rung of the empty stool next to him. Mr. Magri described his left foot as \"intertwined\" in the stool, with his foot inserted over the rung and then underneath it. He stated that he was facing the dealer with the majority of his body facing forward, while his left leg was on the rung of the adjacent stool. According to Mr. Magri, because he had a left knee replacement surgery on August 2, 2011, he was stretching his left leg out on the rung of the adjacent stool to relieve stiffness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Magri testified that while he was playing blackjack, the pit boss called for environmental services to empty a trash can. Mr. Magri said that when a female employee arrived, she and the pit boss got involved in a heated argument that lasted thirty seconds or less. Mr. Magri said that after the argument, the employee \"yanked\" the stool two or three times, and after each time she yanked the stool, he yelled for her to stop. He said that when the employee pulled the empty stool out, his foot and ankle were tangled in it. Mr. Magri stated that after the third pull, the employee stopped yanking the stool.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He stated that he felt a sharp pain in his surgically repaired left knee and ankle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. Magri testified that before the accident, he did not ask any casino personnel if he could put his foot on the adjacent stool. He said that he was aware as a matter of \"common sense\" that another casino patron or employee could move the empty stool at any time, and he acknowledged that he did not need a sign to tell him that. He stated that he saw Ms. McCormick put her hands on the stool, but did not warn her that his foot was entwined in the stool.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the accident, Mr. Magri completed a Guest Accident Report stating that the Harrah's employee \"pulled the chair next to me (behind me) completely out with (unfortunately) my left foot attached causing\n   me to almost fall.\" Mr. Magri also completed a handwritten form on February 8, 2012, stating that the Harrah's employee \"basically yanked the high stool away from me with my left ankle and leg entangled in same.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Ms. McCormick's Trial Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ms. McCormick testified that she has worked as a cleaning specialist at Harrah's for ten years. She said that on the night of the accident, she was assigned to work in the Smuggler's restroom, which is near the blackjack table. According to Ms. McCormick, she received a call on the radio stating that a trash can in Pit 3 needed to be emptied, but the employee who normally emptied the trash can did not respond, so Ms. McCormick volunteered to pick up the trash. Ms. McCormick testified that she was not upset about picking up the trash, as it was part of her job. She denied that she had an argument with the pit boss that night. Ms. McCormick stated that because the blackjack tables are located next to one another, she had to go between two tables to empty the trash can. She described the space between the blackjack tables as \"narrow.\" She said that as she approached Pit 3 to empty the trash can, an empty stool at the blackjack table blocked her path. When she saw Mr. Magri, he was seated to the right of the empty stool, and was facing the dealer. She said that in order to get past the empty stool, she pushed it toward the blackjack table one time. She stated that she did not see Mr. Magri's feet and did not realize that his left foot was on the footrest of the empty stool before she pushed. She stated that she had no reason to believe that Mr. Magri's foot would be on the empty stool. According to Ms. McCormick, when she pushed the stool, Mr. Magri screamed \"my foot, my leg.\" She stated that she did not move the stool again after Mr. Magri yelled. She said that she asked Mr. Magri if he was okay, and he responded that he was fine. Ms. McCormick stated that she retrieved the trash can, emptied it, and then departed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Duty/Risk Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The duty/risk analysis is the standard negligence analysis employed in determining whether to impose liability under La.

The trial court found that Mr. Magri should have expected that someone would attempt to move or utilize the adjacent empty chair. The trial court also considered that Mr. Magri did not ask permission to prop his foot on the chair, and did not inform anyone at the blackjack table that he was resting his foot on the high stool.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We find that a reasonable interpretation of the facts supports the trial court's finding that Harrah's, through Ms. McCormick, bears 70% of the fault. Accordingly, the trial court's assessment of 30% fault to Mr. Magri and 70% fault to Harrah's was not manifestly erroneous, and should be upheld.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Based on the foregoing we affirm the trial court's October 17, 2018 judgment, in favor of Mr. Magri and against Harrah's, in the amount of $601,689.31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    In an answer to an interrogatory, the incident was described as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n    [The Harrah's employee] began pulling with a great deal of vigor and strength on the high stool directly next to plaintiff where plaintiff had his left ankle resting on it. Plaintiff immediately yelled to the lady to stop because she was hurting his foot and leg, all to no available [sic]. This employ [sic] continued to pull the stool with his left ankle still entwined on the rail of the high stool. Basically, and to the best of plaintiff's knowledge and belief, it took three or four times that she pulled vigorously before she ceased her actions.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    At trial, Mr. Magri was shown a grainy, blurred black and white surveillance video and was asked to identify the images. Mr. Magri stated, \"I cannot see ... I see vague images, but I cannot make out anybody either coming or going, quite frankly. I am sorry, but I just cannot make this video out.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
