Prior to the above suit, Santillo had filed suit against Stephen Santillo, Jacques Rodrigue and Andre Rodrigue, the owners and members of Blue Collar Enterprises, which owns the Blue Dog Caf\u00e9 in Lafayette, alleging breaches of fiduciary duties and misappropriation of intellectual property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Santillo answered the suit filed by GRR and filed an exception of no cause of action, contending GRR could not have a viable detrimental reliance claim in the absence of a signed, written settlement agreement. Santillo also filed reconventional and third-party demands alleging the filing of the detrimental reliance lawsuit by GRR was an abuse of process and a violation of Louisiana's Unfair Trade Practices Act (LUPTA), La.R.S. 51:1401, et seq. GRR was made defendant in reconvention. Jacques Rodrigue, Scott L. Sternberg, and Sternberg, Nacarri &amp; White, LLC (hereafter \"Sternberg,\" which represented Rodrigue in the litigation) were made third-party defendants. After the third-party demand was filed, Sternberg withdrew from representing Rodrigue and another attorney was hired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Sternberg filed an exception of no cause of action with regard to the third-party demand. GRR filed an exception of no cause of action with regard to the reconventional demand. Rodrigue did not file any exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Those exceptions, including Santillo's earlier filed exception of no cause of action, were heard on June 25, 2018. The trial court denied Santillo's exception of no cause of action as to GRR's detrimental reliance claim. The trial court granted both GRR's exception of no cause of action with regard to the reconventional demand and Sternberg's exception of no cause of action to the third-party demand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A judgment was signed on July 3, 2018, granting the exceptions of no cause of action filed by GRR and Sternberg. Santillo filed a petition for appeal as to this judgment. The trial court, on its own motion, issued a rule to Santillo to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed as having been taken from a partial judgment that had not been designated as immediately appealable, with respect to the dismissal of Santillo's reconventional demand, and from being taken from a judgment that lacked proper decretal language with respect to the dismissal of Santillo's third-party claims. On December 6, 2018, this court issued an opinion recalling the rule, in part, with respect to the dismissal of Santillo's reconventional demand against GRR, finding that portion of the judgment fell under La.Code Civ.P. art. 1915(A) and did not require a designation of finality. Thus, the appeal was suspended, and the matter remanded to the trial court with instructions to sign a judgment containing proper decretal language specifying that Santillo's third-party demands were dismissed only as to Sternberg, as the other third-party defendant did not file an exception.\n   <em>\n    GR Rest., LLC v. Suzanne Savoy Santillo, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18-702%20%28La.App.%203%20Cir.%2012/6/18%29\">\n    18-702 (La.App. 3 Cir. 12/6/18)\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206432967\">\n    2018 WL 6432967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (unpublished opinion). The trial court complied with our order to sign a judgment with proper decretal language and the appeal is now before this court again for a ruling on the merits of Santillo's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A judgment was also signed on July 6, 2018, denying the exception of no cause of action filed by Santillo with respect to the petition for detrimental reliance filed by GRR. Santillo timely filed a writ application to this court, docket number 18-637, seeking a review of the denial of the no cause of action exception. GRR filed an\n   opposition to the writ application. The disposition of the writ application was held in abeyance until the procedural issues in the appeal of the July 3, 2018 judgment was resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After the issuance of the rule in docket number 18-702, Santillo filed an ex parte motion to enroll Stephen Carleton as co-counsel of record. That order was signed by this court on October 1, 2018. GRR and Sternberg filed separate motions to disqualify Carleton, contending he was a fact witness and could not act as counsel of record pursuant to La.Rules Prof.Conduct, Rule 3.7(a), which provides an attorney cannot be both an advocate and a necessary witness at trial unless the testimony is related to an uncontested issue, is related to the nature and value of legal services rendered in the case, or the disqualification would be a substantial hardship to the client.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Carleton represented Santillo in the lawsuit filed against Stephen Santillo, Jacques Rodrigue and Andre Rodrigue. Carleton attested he was counsel of record for Santillo in that action and stated the allegations contained in the answer. In the opposition to the motion to disqualify, Santillo asserted Carleton was enrolled as co-counsel solely for the purposes of the appeal, as her main counsel was on extended vacation at the time (October of 2018). Santillo maintained Carleton would not serve as counsel at trial should her appeal be successful. However, Santillo did not address the fact that only Santillo's reconventional demands and third-party demands had been dismissed. Santillo's exception of no cause of action was denied, and the main demand brought by GRR is to proceed to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 28, 2018, this court granted the writ application filed by Santillo for the limited purpose of ordering the consolidation of the writ application, docket number 18-637, with the appeal, docket number 18-702. We held as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    WRIT GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n   In the above captioned writ application, Relators, Suzanne Savoy Santillo, LLC and Suzanne Savoy Santillo, seek review of the trial court's July 6, 2018 judgment, which denied Relators' exception of no cause of action. Relators have also filed an appeal from the trial court's July 3, 2018 judgment (which is identical to the July 6, 2018 judgment), granting the exception of no cause of action filed by GR Restaurants, LLC, with respect to Relators' reconventional demand and from the December 7, 2018 judgment granting the exceptions of no cause of action filed on behalf of Scott L. Sternberg and Sternberg, Naccari &amp; White, LLC, with respect to Relators' third-party demand.

The following pleadings were set forth in GRR's petition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   4.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   On or about November 23, 2017, MS.

SANTILLO's promise was with the full knowledge and information that the November 23, 2017 agreement included as a term the confection of a settlement of her 2016 lawsuit alleging breach of fiduciary duties against Blue Collar Enterprises (hereinafter, \"Blue Collar\"), which owns the Blue Dog Caf\u00e9 in Lafayette, and would immediately induce GRR to expend substantial funds on the Restaurants to save both of them from immediate insolvency, and would begin the process of growing the Restaurants profitability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   21.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   On November 23, 2017, via e-mail, counsel for MS. SANTILLO agreed to accept a 6% profits interest in exchange for settling the Santillo Action, and encompassing the form and terms of the November 14, 2017 letter (the \"Agreement\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The above paragraphs sufficiently meet element one of detrimental reliance, a \"representation by conduct or word.\"\n   <em>\n    Suire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8931358\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/907/37/#p59\">\n    907 So.2d at 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Those allegations set forth the email where Ms. Santillo allegedly represented she would settle the Santillo Action and exchange an interest in an entity called \"Blue Collar\" for an interest in a new entity as part of an overall structure. The petition sets forth that Santillo was proposed those terms and represented through her counsel her agreement to accept. This amounts to a \"representation by word or conduct\" sufficient to establish a cause of action for detrimental reliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The second element in detrimental reliance is \"justifiable reliance.\" A review of the petition establishes in Paragraphs 22 through 27 that GRR would be \"immediately infus[ing] [money] into the Restaurants, relying on MS. SANTILLO's Agreement and representation that she would cooperate and exchange her ownership interest in Blue Collar for a profits interest\" in the new entity. The petition further alleged \"MS. SANTILLO knew, or had been appropriately informed, that when agreeing to the proposal on November 23, 2017 that the Restaurants were sure to fail and be insolvent immediately unless someone advanced funds for the insolvent restaurants.\" In Paragraph 26 of the petition GRR alleged \"[i]n reliance on MS. SANTILLO's Agreement, GRR infused nearly $ 200,000 into the Restaurants in order for them to remain solvent, and continues infusing money to date.\" Accordingly, we find the trial court did not err in finding GRR pled sufficient factual allegations to establish the second element, \"justifiable reliance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The third element to be proven to support a detrimental reliance claim is \"a change in position to one's detriment because of the reliance.\" GRR's petition sets forth that it invested significant funds into the Restaurants in question as a result of Santillo's representations. Paragraph 31 of GRR's petition stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   GRR, justifiably relying on MS. SANTILLO's good faith promise to settle the Santillo Action and exchange her operating interest in a failing entity for a profits interest in well-capitalized one, has advanced significant capital, hired\n   an independent consultant at the cost of $ 150,000 to reevaluate the offerings and streamline the business for both Restaurants, and hired a culinary director to revamp the menu of the Restaurants, expending significant funds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Paragraph 33 specifically alleged the \"significant infusion of capital made by GRR... would not have occurred without MS. SANTILLO's promise.\" A review of the petition establishes GRR pled factual allegations supporting the third element required for a detrimental reliance claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Accordingly, as the factual allegations pled in GRR's petition support all three elements of its detrimental reliance claim, we find the trial court correctly denied Santillo's exception of no cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We also note Santillo argued that a detrimental reliance claim must be based on a binding, written settlement agreement.

Santillo alleged GRR's and Sternberg's ulterior motive was to \"coerce and intimidate, and/or punish ... and to attempt to force them to change their positions on settlement.\" As GRR notes, Santillo argues primarily that the detrimental reliance lawsuit has no legal merit. However, that argument alone is not a valid basis for an abuse of process claim. If so, a simple denial of liability could always give rise to a cause of action for abuse of process. Moreover, we affirmed the trial court's ruling that GRR's petition stated a valid cause of action for detrimental reliance, which refutes Santillo's claim that the lawsuit has no merit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Santillo also did not plead any factual allegations alleging GRR and Sternberg committed an \"improper use of process\" in the filing of the detrimental reliance lawsuit. Improper use of process \"refers to a failure to comply with the proper procedures or rules set out by law for conducting official actions.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7489860\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/617/1198/#p1205\">\n    617 So.2d 1198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1205-06 (La.App. 3 Cir. 1993),\n   <em>\n    writ denied\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7483641,7483683,7483601\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/620/875/\">\n    620 So.2d 875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La.1993).

However, when he seeks by the use of such process to \"attain some collateral objective, outside the scope of the operation of the process employed,\" a tort arises.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   As GRR and Sternberg note, there was no allegation made that any judicial rules or procedures were violated. Santillo's argument is based on its contention that the detrimental reliance lawsuit has no legal merit.
