This case involves three consolidated interlocutory appeals. Each appeal arises from litigation filed by Franklin Collection Service, Inc. (Franklin), against BancorpSouth Bank (BancorpSouth).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62. Franklin and BancorpSouth had been in litigation for approximately forty months. After Franklin determined that BancorpSouth had failed to file a responsive pleading to the second amended complaint, Franklin applied for and obtained an entry of default by the clerk. Franklin also filed a motion to deem admitted the allegations of the second amended complaint. BancorpSouth then filed a motion to set aside the entry of default and a motion for leave to file a responsive pleading to the second amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63. The trial court heard each motion and decided to deny Franklin's motion to deem admitted the allegations of the second\n   amended complaint; to grant BancorpSouth's motion for leave to file a responsive pleading to the second amended complaint; and to deny BancorpSouth's motion to set aside the entry of default. We affirm in part, we reverse in part, and we remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64. Franklin is a debt-collection company located in Tupelo. As part of its operations, Franklin maintained a number of bank accounts, including its general operating account, at BancorpSouth. Each business day, a large number of checks passed through Franklin's operating account. Because of the nature of its collection business, Franklin deposited into its operating account many checks from debtors that bounced. Instead of returning checks that Franklin wrote against insufficient funds, BancorpSouth routinely paid the checks into overdraft. These payments resulted in service charges to the operating account. From March 28, 2006, to December 31, 2008, Franklin incurred total overdraft charges in excess of $ 600,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65. Franklin demanded reimbursement of the overdraft fees, but BancorpSouth refused. As a result, Franklin filed its first amended complaint against BancorpSouth in March 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its first amended complaint, Franklin alleged that \"from 2006 through 2008, BancorpSouth[ ] charged Franklin excessive amounts of overdraft fees through practices which were neither fair to Franklin nor adequately disclosed to Franklin in [a]ccount documents.\" Franklin further alleged that BancorpSouth \"imposed excessive and wrongful overdraft fees against Franklin by the artificial manipulation of the order in which checks presented for payment on Franklin's [operating] [a]ccount were paid.\" Franklin asserted various causes of action against BancorpSouth, including breach of contract and negligence. BancorpSouth timely responded to the first amended complaint and asserted forty-three affirmative defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66. In November 2012, Franklin filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. Franklin sought to remove the claim for negligent hiring, retention, and supervision, and to assert a new claim for breach of fiduciary duty. On June 6, 2013, the motion was granted, and Franklin's second amended complaint was filed. It is undisputed that BancorpSouth did not timely file an answer to the second amended complaint. Nevertheless, the parties continued to actively litigate the case for more than three years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67. On September 1, 2016, BancorpSouth filed a motion for summary judgment based on thirteen of the defenses asserted in its answer to the first amended complaint. Franklin filed its response to the motion for summary judgment on October 14, 2016. That same day, Franklin filed a motion to deem admitted the allegations of the second amended complaint and an application for an entry of default by the court. The application was hand delivered to the circuit clerk's office. Default was entered by the clerk on October 14, 2016. Franklin then moved for default judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68. In response, on October 21, 2016, BancorpSouth filed a motion to set aside the entry of default. Thereafter, on November 15, 2016, BancorpSouth filed a motion\n   for leave to file a responsive pleading to the second amended complaint and attached to the motion its proposed answer and defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69. Following a hearing on the various motions, the trial court denied Franklin's motion for default judgment, denied Franklin's motion to deem admitted the allegations of the second amended complaint, granted BancorpSouth's motion for leave to file an answer to the second amended complaint, and denied BancorpSouth's motion to set aside the entry of default. Separate orders were subsequently entered. On April 13, 2017, BancorpSouth filed its answer and defenses to Franklin's second amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610. Franklin filed two separate petitions for interlocutory appeal: one from the trial court's denial of the motion to deem admitted the allegations of the second amended complaint, No. 2017-IA-00895-SCT, and one from the trial court's grant of BancorpSouth's motion to file a responsive pleading to the second amended complaint, No. 2017-IA-00900-SCT. BancorpSouth filed a petition for interlocutory appeal from the denial of its motion to set aside the entry of default, No. 2017-IA-00905-SCT. This Court granted all three petitions and consolidated the appeals. BancorpSouth's appeal was designated a cross-appeal. We first address BancorpSouth's cross-appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    I. Whether the trial court's denial of BancorpSouth's motion to set aside the entry of default was error.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611. BancorpSouth argues that the trial court erred in denying its motion to set aside the entry of default. We review a trial court's grant or denial of a motion to set aside an entry of default for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Tucker v.

The trial court found that default \"was properly entered by the clerk.\" In an effort to clarify, the court stated, \"I'm not setting the clerk's entry of default aside, I'm just not granting a default judgment based on that entry of default.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613.

BancorpSouth asserts its counsel has \"no record of having received the order granting leave to file the second amended complaint.\" Yet BancorpSouth admittedly received the second amended complaint and referenced the second amended complaint in its motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b616. Franklin asserts, \"the reason for [BancorpSouth's] default can only be characterized as inadvertence of counsel,\" which is insufficient to establish good cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stanford v.

Franklin also alleges BancorpSouth \"should have taken further steps to notify [its president and chief\n   executive officer,] Dan [Franklin,] who would have stopped the overdrafts from continuing to occur.\" Franklin claims that in failing to do so, BancorpSouth \"breached its duty to Franklin, thereby proximately causing monetary damages to Franklin.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b621. In response, BancorpSouth relies on various notices it provided to Franklin at Franklin's official mailing address. BancorpSouth asserts it provided written notice to Franklin on each banking day that Franklin's operating account was overdrawn. The record shows that beginning in March 2006, daily written notices were provided to Franklin and advised as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   NOTICE OF CHARGE FOR OVERDRAWN ACCOUNT\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   THE ITEMS LISTED BELOW WERE PRESENTED FOR PAYMENT.

Additionally, BancorpSouth provided monthly bank statements to Franklin that detailed the overdraft charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b623. During his deposition, Mr. Franklin did not dispute Franklin's receipt of the daily notices and monthly bank statements. Mr. Franklin acknowledged that these documents would have been received by Boyd and ultimately placed in binders in Boyd's office. Mr. Franklin testified that it was Boyd's responsibility as CFO to \"adjust [Franklin's] checkbook and deposit funds to cover these items.\" Mr. Franklin admitted that he did not monitor Boyd but, instead, relied on him and trusted his judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b624.

Here, the daily notices and monthly bank statements reflecting the overdraft charges were mailed to Franklin beginning in March 2006. Thus, this Court finds that BancorpSouth has presented a reasonable, colorable defense on the merits regarding Franklin's notice of the overdraft charges and whether \"a significant portion\" of Franklin's claims are now time-barred by the applicable three-year statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    c. BancorpSouth's Banking Practices\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b630. Franklin asserts that the posting order used by BancorpSouth caused it to pay excessive and wrongful overdraft fees. Specifically, Franklin asserts BancorpSouth \"rearranged the order of payment of Franklin checks to cause the checks to be paid in descending order, from largest to smallest.\" Yet, as noted by BancorpSouth, the Uniform Commercial Code provides banks with the authority to determine the order in which a bank will post transactions to customer accounts. \"[I]tems may be accepted, paid, certified, or charged to the indicated account of [the Bank's] customer in any order.\" U.C.C. \u00a7 4-303(b) (Am.

Accordingly, this Court finds BancorpSouth has presented a reasonable, colorable defense on the merits regarding its banking practices and whether those practices breached the deposit agreement and/or violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b631. While this Court does not decide the ultimate efficiency of BancorpSouth's defenses, the defenses are nevertheless colorable at this time. Therefore, the colorable-defense factor favors BancorpSouth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    3. The Extent of Prejudice to Franklin if the Default is Set Aside\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b632. The extent of prejudice to the opposing party is a relevant consideration when ruling on a motion to set aside an entry of default.\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6773109\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/198/299/#p309\">\n    198 So.3d at 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Franklin asserts it would suffer prejudice were the default set aside because one of its expert witnesses, Dr. William Staats, has become too ill to testify live at trial. However, the record shows that any prejudice to Franklin as a result of Dr. Staats's unavailability is due to Franklin's inaction, not BancorpSouth's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b633. Franklin designated Dr. Staats as its expert witness on June 1, 2012. On March 12, 2013, BancorpSouth took Dr. Staats's deposition. Franklin attended the deposition and had the opportunity to examine Dr. Staats but declined. Following the designation in 2012, Franklin did not depose Dr. Staats. More than four years later, in October 2016, Franklin learned\n   that Dr. Staats had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2014 and would be unable to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b634. The record reflects that Franklin had the opportunity to depose Dr. Staats. Yet Franklin chose not to examine Dr. Staats during the deposition conducted by BancorpSouth and did not separately depose Dr. Staats. Thus, even if BancorpSouth had timely filed its answer to the second amended complaint in 2013, Franklin would still be in the same position with regard to its trial expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b635. Franklin further asserts it would suffer prejudice if the default was set aside due to the \"passage of time.\" But, as the trial court noted, Franklin \"waited several years\" to seek an entry of default and a default judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record reflects that both parties continued to litigate for more than three years under the assumption that an answer to the second amended complaint had been filed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Not until October 2016, after BancorpSouth moved for summary judgment, did Franklin apply for an entry of default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b636. Additionally, at Franklin's request, the scheduling order was amended five times beginning in October 2012 through May 2016. Thus, as the trial court properly found, \"[a] lot of the delay [was] caused by [Franklin].\" Accordingly, this factor favors BancorpSouth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b637. Two of the three factors, colorable defenses and prejudice, weigh in favor of BancorpSouth and, therefore, in favor of setting aside the entry of default. Any \"[d]oubts should be resolved in favor of 'opening the judgment and hearing the case on its merits.' \"\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6773109\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/198/299/#p309\">\n    198 So.3d at 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Rogillio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7058293\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/10/463/#p469\">\n    10 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   467 ). Considering the liberal standard applicable to a motion to set aside an entry of default, BancorpSouth's presentation of colorable defenses, and the limited prejudice that Franklin would suffer were the entry of default set aside, this Court finds that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to set aside the entry of default. As a result, we reverse the trial court's interlocutory order at issue in BancorpSouth's cross-appeal and remand the case, No. 2017-IA-00905-SCT, for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    II. Franklin's Interlocutory Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b638. Franklin asserts two issues on interlocutory appeal: (1) whether the trial court erred in denying its motion to deem admitted the allegations of the second amended complaint and (2) whether the trial court erred in granting BancorpSouth's motion to file an answer and defenses to the second amended complaint. We separately address each issue, but the standard of review is the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b639. \"[T]he filing of various pleadings and motions in civil cases [is] governed ... by our rules of civil procedure, uniform rules, statutes, and trial court orders ....\"\n   <em>\n    City of Jackson v.

Whether the trial court erred in denying Franklin's motion to deem admitted the allegations of the second amended complaint.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b640. Franklin first argues the trial court erred in denying its motion to deem admitted the allegations of the second amended complaint. Franklin relies on Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure 8(d) and 55(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    1. Rule 8(d)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b641. Under Rule 8(d), \"[a]verments in a pleading to which a responsive pleading is required, other than those as to the amount of damages, are admitted when not denied in the responsive pleading.\" M.R.C.P. 8(d). Franklin asserts that because BancorpSouth failed to answer the second amended complaint, it failed to deny any of its averments. As a result, Franklin argues that \"every averment of Franklin's [s]econd [a]mended [c]omplaint, except those as to damages, [was] admitted on June 18, 2013, by automatic operation of Rule 8(d).\" Franklin relies on\n   <em>\n    Universal Computer Services, Inc. v. Lyall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7608367\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/464/69/\">\n    464 So.2d 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 1985). But\n   <em>\n    Lyall\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the instant case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b642. In\n   <em>\n    Lyall\n   </em>\n   , this Court found under Rule 8(d) that the defendant's position regarding ownership of a vehicle could not be maintained because the defendant failed to deny ownership.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7608367\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/464/69/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7608367\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/464/69/\">\n    at 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, the Court applied Rule 8(d) because the defendant failed to deny the\n   <em>\n    single\n   </em>\n   allegation of ownership. Here, Franklin does not seek to admit certain allegations of the second amended complaint. Instead, Franklin seeks to utilize Rule 8(d) to admit\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   allegations of the second amended complaint as a result of BancorpSouth's failure to answer. According to Franklin, Rule 8(d) mandates that all allegations of the second amended complaint stand forever admitted from the moment the response deadline passes, leaving a hearing on damages as the trial court's only remaining task. This Court disagrees and finds Franklin's interpretation and application of Rule 8(d) to be misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b643. Franklin reads Rule 8(d) in isolation, without considering other procedural rules, including Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 55. Rule 55, which governs default, applies specifically to situations in which the defendant fails to answer. M.R.C.P. 55(a). Unlike Rule 8(d), Rule 55 affords relief to a party for its failure to answer. M.R.C.P. 55(c). Under Rule 55(c), the trial court has the discretion to set aside an entry of default. M.R.C.P. 55(c). If we read Rule 8(d) in the manner suggested by Franklin, Rule 55 would be meaningless. Based on Franklin's isolated read, even were an entry of default set aside under Rule 55(c), such action would serve no purpose, because, under Rule 8(d), the allegations of the second amended complaint would stand admitted. While this Court has not specifically addressed Franklin's position, other jurisdictions have and have determined that a party's failure to timely answer is best addressed by Rule 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b644.

Notably, this is not a case in which the defendant failed to appear or failed outright to respond. Instead, the record clearly shows BancorpSouth appeared and timely answered the first amended complaint, participated in litigation, and filed a motion for summary judgment based on previously asserted defenses. While, on one hand, default and default judgments are entered regularly in cases in which a duly served defendant fails to appear and to respond to a complaint, on the other hand, when a defaulting litigant appears to desire to defend, the entry of default judgment is not preferred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Presley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8454873\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/942/777/#p781\">\n    942 So.2d at 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[The defendant] clearly evidenced every intention of defending the suit.

Franklin's interpretation and application of Rule 8(d) contradicts this Court's preference of a trial on the merits and further contradicts the purpose of the procedural rules-\"to promote the ends of justice.\" M.R.C.P. 1 advisory committee note. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying Franklin's motion to deem admitted the allegations of the second amended complaint under Rule 8(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    2. Rule 55(a)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b653. Franklin next argues the trial court's denial of its motion \"allow[ed] BancorpSouth to escape the separate, mandated consequences of a circuit clerk's entry of default pursuant to Rule 55(a) ....\" Franklin claims that upon the clerk's entry of default, \"every allegation of [its] [s]econd [a]mended [c]omplaint (except those as to the amount of damages) was admitted\" and BancorpSouth \"lost standing to counter or attack those admissions.\" However, once again, Franklin reads Rule 55(a) in isolation from the rest of the procedural rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b654. \"After entry of default by the clerk, [a] defendant has no further standing to contest the actual factual allegations of the plaintiff's claim for relief.\" M.R.C.P. 55 advisory committee note. \"If a defendant wishes an opportunity to challenge plaintiff's right to recover, a defendant's only\n   recourse is to show good cause for setting aside the default under Rule 55(c).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7479059\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/626/127/#p132\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b655. The record reflects that BancorpSouth moved to set aside the entry of default. For reasons previously discussed, the record supports setting aside the entry of default under Rule 55(c). Thus, despite Franklin's assertion, BancorpSouth has standing to contest the allegations of Franklin's claims for relief. Accordingly, the trial court properly denied Franklin's motion to deem admitted the allegations of the second amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    B. Whether the trial court erred in allowing BancorpSouth to file an answer to the second\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    amended complaint.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b656. Franklin asserts the trial court's \"order which allowed BancorpSouth to answer nearly four years late is fundamentally incompatible with BancorpSouth's failure to deny the allegations in Franklin's [s]econd [a]mended [c]omplaint and with the [c]ircuit [c]lerk's entry of default.\" As a result, Franklin argues \"the trial court's interlocutory order which allowed BancorpSouth to answer [the] second amended complaint should be reversed.\" This Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b657. The Court has reviewed the applicable pleadings and notes that the first amended complaint and the second amended complaint are essentially the same, with the exception of a new cause of action alleging breach of fiduciary duty. However, the new claim for breach of fiduciary duty is based on the same underlying facts regarding BancorpSouth's management of Franklin's account. BancorpSouth's answer and defenses to the second amended complaint virtually mirrors its answer and defenses to the first amended complaint. Although BancorpSouth failed to timely respond to the second amended complaint, it continued to defend the allegations of the second amended complaint, including the new claim for breach of fiduciary duty. In fact, the record reflects that, despite an almost four-year delay in BancorpSouth's response, both parties actively and continuously litigated the case under the assumption that an answer had been filed. As a result, Franklin can show no prejudice in the filing of BancorpSouth's answer and defenses to the second amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b658. In light of the colorable defenses presented by BancorpSouth and the lack of prejudice to Franklin, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing BancorpSouth to file an answer to Franklin's second amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b659. Franklin further asserts BancorpSouth waived its right to assert affirmative defenses. Thus, Franklin argues that even if \"the trial court had the discretion to allow BancorpSouth to answer Franklin's second amended complaint nearly four years later, ... it [did not] have discretion to allow BancorpSouth to assert affirmative defenses.\" Yet the record shows Franklin's waiver argument is not properly before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b660. At the hearing on the various motions, the trial court specifically noted that it was \"not ruling on the waiver of the affirmative defenses arguments\" but, instead, would \"consider that at another time.\" Because the trial court deferred ruling on the waiver issue to another time, it is not properly before this Court and will not be considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b661. Having considered the issues raised in Franklin's appeal, the trial court's interlocutory orders should be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b662.
