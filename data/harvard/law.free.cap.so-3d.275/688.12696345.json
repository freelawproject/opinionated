We affirm as to entitlement to fees, as the Insurer's proposal for settlement complied with section 768.79, Florida Statutes (2018), and the Florida Supreme Court's holdings in\n   <em>\n    Kuhajda v. Borden Dairy Co. of Alabama, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12180082\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/202/391/#p395\">\n    202 So. 3d 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 395-96 (Fla. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We reject the Insured's argument that her separate count for declaratory relief (voluntarily dismissed on the first day of trial) was a claim for purely equitable relief that invalidated the Insurer's proposal for settlement. The trial court correctly determined that the \"real issue\" in the case was a claim for breach of contract and money damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tower Hill Signature Ins. Co. v. Javellana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12663468\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/238/372/#p376\">\n    238 So. 3d 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 376-77 (Fla. 3d DCA 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Based on the Insurer's limited and proper concession of error, we reverse and remand that portion of the final judgment fixing the amount of attorney's fees to be awarded to the Insurer. On remand, the Insurer shall only recover those attorney's fees incurred and actually paid or payable to its attorneys by the Insurer, from service of the 2016 proposal for settlement through the date of the order granting entitlement to fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 768.79(1), Fla. Stat. (2018) ;\n   <em>\n    Reliance Mut. Life Ins. Co. of Ill. v. Booher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9833389\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/166/222/#p224\">\n    166 So. 2d 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 224 (Fla. 2d DCA 1964) (applying dictionary definition of \"incurred\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The final judgment is affirmed as to the Insurer's entitlement to attorney's fees, and (pursuant to the Insurer's limited concession of error) reversed and remanded as to the amount of such fees to be awarded to the Insurer.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
