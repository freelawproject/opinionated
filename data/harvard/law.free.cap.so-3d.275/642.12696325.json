We reverse because the voluntary dismissal rendered the homeowner the prevailing party for purposes of attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   HSBC Bank filed a foreclosure complaint against the homeowner, alleging it was the owner and holder of the note and mortgage. HSBC further alleged it was entitled to attorney's fees under the contract. A copy of the note attached to the complaint listed DB Home Lending LLC as the lender and the homeowner as the borrower. The note contained a specific endorsement by DB Home Lending to HSBC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The homeowner filed an answer and affirmative defenses. In his affirmative defenses, the homeowner stated that the bank lacked standing, the bank did not\n   have legal rights to enforce the note and mortgage, and the endorsement on the note was not valid and authentic. The homeowner also requested attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A year after filing the complaint, HSBC voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice. The homeowner moved for prevailing party attorney's fees under the contract. Specifically, the homeowner alleged in the motion for attorney's fees that \"[t]he Mortgage that was the subject matter of this lawsuit provided for costs and expenses if the Note holder was to enforce the Note\" and that section 57.105(7), Florida Statutes, made this provision applicable to the homeowner. HSBC opposed the motion, arguing that the homeowner's lack of standing defense precluded him from recovering fees. After a hearing, the trial court denied the homeowner's motion, finding that he failed to prove that he and HSBC were parties to the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A trial court's determination of whether a party is entitled to attorney's fees based on a fee provision in the mortgage is reviewed de novo.\n   <em>\n    Bank of N.Y.

In part, this is because appellate courts have frequently failed to articulate with precision the distinction in law between who is a \"prevailing party\" in litigation and who is a \"party\" to a contract. Moreover, standing, in the context of foreclosures, can be confusing because there are two phases of standing (at the time suit is filed and at the time of trial), which can be pertinent to determining who prevails on a legal issue. Additionally, the case law frequently fails to emphasize that promissory notes are a special specie of contracts, involving a special set of legal principles. For example, a person who does not properly obtain ownership of a blank indorsed note can enforce it because he or she is in possession of it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 673.3011, Fla. Stat. (2018). Presumably, enforcement of the note with an attorney fee provision allows such possessor to also receive attorney's fees. At first blush, it seems implausible to say a person who is not in the chain of ownership can be considered in privity with the maker of the note, however, simple possession of contract (the blank indorsed note) provides the privity, even though there is no meeting of the minds. I also submit that much of the confusion stems from a failure to properly analyze and apply legal principles regarding judicial estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Our case law regarding entitlement to attorney's fees after a voluntary dismissal has properly discerned that in terms of analysis, there is a difference between cases where the trial court has made evidentiary determinations regarding standing and cases where such evidentiary determinations have not been made.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12692061\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/270/367/\">\n    270 So.3d at 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206528491\">\n    2018 WL 6528491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *1 ;\n   <em>\n    Elkind\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12679112\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/254/1153/#p1154\">\n    254 So.3d at 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, trial judges are frequently led down the wrong path by attorneys who fail to recognize the difference between who is the prevailing party in litigation and who has the burden of proof for entitlement to fees. More importantly, if a party to a suit seeks attorney's fees pursuant to a contract clause, but is not in a contractual relationship with the opposing party in the suit from whom fees are sought, it is improper to award attorney's fees based on the contract provision.\n   <em>\n    Novastar Mortg., Inc. v.

After making the observation, the opinion goes on to explain:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Ada Rios does not appear to contest this proposition.

Strassburger\n   </em>\n   ] by arguing that, in\n   <em>\n    Novastar\n   </em>\n   and other similar cases, the trial court actually adjudicated that the party seeking fees was not a party to the contract. Ada Rios points out that, in this case, the Bank voluntarily dismissed its lawsuit before such an adjudication occurred. Ada Rios argues that, as the prevailing party (by virtue of the Bank's dismissal), she\n   should be the beneficiary of the fact that her status as a mortgagor specifically was not adjudicated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Not surprisingly, the Bank takes the contrary position in the form of this syllogism: because Ada Rios's principal defense was that she was not a party to the mortgage, and because Ada prevailed, therefore, for the purposes of section 57.105(7), Ada Rios was not a party to the mortgage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Regarding whether Ada Rios was a party to the mortgage, we note that both the Bank and Ada Rios take positions opposite to the positions they took before the Bank's voluntary dismissal of Ada Rios from the lawsuit. While both the Bank and Ada Rios suggest that the other party should be estopped from making its respective argument about whether Ada was a party to the mortgage, we view the case not from the parties' estoppel perspectives, but from the perspective of burden:\n   <em>\n    which party had the threshold burden of establishing whether Ada Rios was a party to the mortgage\n   </em>\n   ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   In our view, in order to avail herself of section 57.105(7)'s reciprocity, Ada Rios, as the prevailing party and\n   <em>\n    movant seeking fees under the mortgage's fee provision\n   </em>\n   , had the threshold burden to plead and establish that she was a party to the mortgage containing the fee provision.

The trial court granted fees to the homeowner, after initially determining that\n   <em>\n    Red Road Residential\n   </em>\n   was factually distinguishable from this case. HSBC moved for rehearing contending the trial court erred in its interpretation and application of\n   <em>\n    Red Road Residential\n   </em>\n   . After entertaining argument on the motion for rehearing, the trial court granted rehearing and specifically set a new evidentiary hearing on the fee motion. At the conclusion of the new hearing on the fee motion, the trial court found that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   the Defendant [ (the homeowner) ] failed to prove that the Plaintiff [ (HSBC) ] and Defendant were parties to the note and mortgage. The Defendant's Answer denied paragraphs 3, 4, &amp; 5 of Plaintiff's Complaint and Defendant's Affirmative Defense asserted the Defendant [sic] did not have standing to file the Complaint. These assertions have not been overcome by evidence to show the Plaintiff and Defendants were parties to the Contract.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   My review of the transcript of the hearing confirms that the homeowner presented no evidence that he was in a contractual\n   relationship with HSBC. Thus, it appears the trial court's finding was correct that there was no competent substantial evidence to support a determination that the homeowner and HSBC were parties to a contract which contained a provision of a fee award. Therefore, I contend that we have no legal basis to reverse the trial court. I disagree with the majority's conclusion that the copy of the note attached to the complaint provided \"sufficient record evidence to demonstrate HSBC and the homeowner were parties to the underlying contract so as to justify attorney's fees pursuant to section 57.105(7).\" When the issue of entitlement is uncontested, it is not uncommon for stipulations, admissions in pleadings, and affidavits to be used. When entitlement is contested, evidentiary hearings are required, with proof by testimony, exhibits, or both, unless summary judgment proceedings are properly invoked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In addition to arguing the homeowner was not entitled to attorney's fees for failure to carry his burden and provide evidence of a contractual relationship, HSBC made arguments below and on appeal asserting the homeowner could not make a factual showing of entitlement based on principles of judicial estoppel. Such arguments were incorrect and distracting. Trial advocates are to be reminded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   In judicial proceedings, a party simply is not estopped from asserting a later inconsistent position (if that it can be called), unless the party's initial position was successfully maintained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Leitman v. Boone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7625647\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/439/318/#p322\">\n    439 So.2d 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 322 (Fla. 3d DCA 1983).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   I emphasize that judicial estoppel arguments in these fee cases are distracting, when the argument is inappropriate, for a reason. I said above that\n   <em>\n    Elkind\n   </em>\n   was inapposite for the disposition of this case. I was one of the panel members deciding\n   <em>\n    Elkind\n   </em>\n   . In going back and reviewing our analysis and the briefs submitted in that case, I now realize that a somewhat similar argument about the burden of proof in fee cases was made in\n   <em>\n    Elkind\n   </em>\n   , but the clarity of the argument was lost by infusing it with arguments about judicial estoppel and not as a stand-alone argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For the reasons I have discussed, I would affirm the trial court.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
