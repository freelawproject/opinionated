Appellees move to dismiss on the basis that, because there is no transcript of the trial below, Albear cannot meet his burden to show error. We agree and affirm because the 15-page final judgment contains numerous factual findings and there is no record of the trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Applegate v.

Without a record of the trial proceedings, the appellate court can not properly resolve the underlying factual issues so as to conclude that the trial court's judgment is not supported by the evidence or by an alternative theory. Without knowing the factual context, neither can an appellate court reasonably conclude that the trial judge so misconceived the law as to require reversal.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cudeiro v.
