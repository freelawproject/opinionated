Our opinion contained an order to show cause why Sanders should not be prohibited from filing with this Court any further\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   appeals, petitions, motions or other proceedings related to his criminal sentence in circuit court case number F95-6485.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Sanders responded to the order to show cause on April 15, 2019. Sanders's response raises no new information or argument for our consideration. Accordingly, we conclude that Sanders has not shown good cause to justify further\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   filings of appeals, petitions, motions, or other proceedings with this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   It is hereby ordered that the Clerk of the Court of the Third District Court of Appeal shall refuse further filings related to case number F95-6485; provided, however, that filings related to case number F95-6485 may be accepted by the Clerk if such filings have been reviewed and signed by an attorney who is a licensed member of the Florida Bar in good standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Any further and unauthorized\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   filings by Sanders will subject him to sanctions, including the issuance of written findings forwarded to the Florida Department of Corrections for consideration by it for disciplinary action, pursuant to section 944.279(1) of the Florida Statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Order issued.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
