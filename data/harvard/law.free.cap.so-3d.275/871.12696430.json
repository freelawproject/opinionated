Accordingly, I urge the court and counsel to take extreme care in developing a clear record, and that the State and the defense make contemporaneous objections as appropriate. Moreover, I note the paramount importance of the trial judge articulating well-considered rulings such that a record is perfected for possible appellate review. <em>See</em> <em>State v. Jones</em> , 16-088 (La. 3/4/16), <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6822763\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/185/746/\">185 So.3d 746</extracted-citation> (writ denied) (Crichton, J., additionally concurring, emphasizing the \"importance of perfecting a record when seeking to invoke exceptions to Constitutional rights and guarantees\"; and <em>State v.

A well-developed record will greatly aid in the important function of appellate review, should it become necessary, and the administration of justice.</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"
