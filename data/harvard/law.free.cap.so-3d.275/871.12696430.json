Accordingly, I urge the court and counsel to take extreme care in developing a clear record, and that the State and the defense make contemporaneous objections as appropriate. Moreover, I note the paramount importance of the trial judge articulating well-considered rulings such that a record is perfected for possible appellate review.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       State v.
