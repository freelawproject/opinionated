In 1995, in lower tribunal case number F95-6485, a jury convicted Sanders of (i) burglary with an assault, (ii) robbery, and (iii) grand theft. The trial court sentenced Sanders as an habitual violent felony offender, pursuant to section 775.084(b) of the Florida Statutes (1995).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court affirmed his conviction\n   in\n   <em>\n    Sanders v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=697%20So.%202d%20856\">\n    697 So.2d 856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 3d DCA 1997) (table).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 1995, the trial court based Sanders's habitual violent felony offender status on his conviction in lower tribunal case number F91-45810, in which Sanders pled no contest to three counts of armed robbery and was sentenced to five years in prison. In the instant appeal, Sanders argues that, in 1995, the trial court had inaccurate pre-sentencing information upon which to determine Sanders's habitual violent felony offender status. This argument is a variation of an argument Sanders made in an earlier and unsuccessful rule 3.800 motion. In his 2009 motion, Sanders maintained that his enhanced sentence was improperly based on a 1992 crime in which he also pled guilty (lower tribunal case number F92-17107). The trial court determined and we affirmed that Sanders's habitual violent felony offender sentence enhancement was based on the 1991 crimes of armed robbery.\n   <em>\n    Sanders v.
