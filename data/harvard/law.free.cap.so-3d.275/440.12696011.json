Defendant is accused of testifying falsely at the August 17, 2016 grand jury investigation of Lafayette City Marshall Brian Pope. On September 25, 2018, the defense filed a motion to disqualify DA Stutes and ADA Haney, wherein he argued that the prosecutors should be recused from his case because they were witnesses to the alleged crime as they were present at the grand jury investigation wherein the alleged perjury occurred on August 17, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 5, 2018, the defense submitted a letter to the clerk of court requesting subpoenas for both DA Stutes and ADA Haney to testify at the hearing on the defense's motion to recuse. On October 26, 2018, the State filed a \"Motion to Quash Defendant's Subpoena and Subpoena Duces Tecum for District Attorney Keith Stutes and Assistant District Attorney Alan Haney\" with the trial court. The prosecution alleged the motion for subpoenas did not comport with La.Code Evid. art. 507. On November 2, 2018, the defense filed a formal motion for subpoenas together with a memorandum in support of the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the hearing on the motion for subpoenas held on December 14, 2018, the trial court denied Defendant's request in open court. Following the ruling, the defense timely gave notice of its intent to seek supervisory review and subsequently timely sought an extended return date. The trial court set the first return date for January 12, 2019, and then extended the return date for February 11, 2019. On February 12, 2019 (postmarked February 11, 2019), Defendant, through counsel, timely filed a writ application with this court seeking supervisory review of the trial court's December 14, 2018 ruling denying the defense's request to subpoena both DA Stutes and ADA Haney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION OF THE RECORD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the December 14, 2018 hearing on the motion for subpoenas, the defense submitted the entire record into evidence as support for the motion, including the bill of indictment, the motion to suppress, and the motions to disqualify. The defense urged that the subpoenas for DA Stutes and ADA Haney, along with the documents requested therewith, were needed as they were essential to the defense, and pursuant to La.Code Evid. art. 507, the trial court was required to order the subpoenas and the production of the evidence unless it was protected by a privilege. Defense counsel affirmed that the request was not for the purpose of harassment, that the request was listed with particularity, that the request was reasonably limited in subject matter, that there were no\n   practical alternative means to obtaining the information, and that prosecutors were subject to the article. See La.Code Evid. art. 507.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defense counsel urged that, under\n   <em>\n    State v. Ward\n   </em>\n   , 11-438 (La. 4/25/11),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7026321\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/62/55/\">\n    62 So.3d 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , criminal defendants may call prosecutors to testify at trial if the testimony is relevant, material to the theory of the defense, and not repetitious or cumulative of other evidence. Further, as it was Defendant's burden to show that the evidence was essential to the defense, the defense pointed out that both prosecutors were present and witnesses to the charged perjury, which make the prosecutors eye witnesses. Defendant argued that since intent is at issue, the prosecutors' testimony about Defendant's demeanor, such as whether Defendant was cooperative or evasive, and the circumstances surrounding Defendant's testimony would be relevant at his trial for perjury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defense counsel further contended that another issue at trial is whether the alleged perjury was material to Brian Pope's culpability, the criminal defendant about whose case Defendant was called to testify in the grand jury investigation. The defense claimed the prosecutors would be best qualified to testify as to the materiality of the alleged perjury. The defense then introduced into evidence the testimony of Defendant at the grand jury hearing in the Brian Pope case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The prosecution pointed out that the Defendant had waived a jury trial, so his demeanor while testifying before the grand jury would be something best determined by the trial judge. Moreover, the prosecution urged that it is the State's burden of proof at Defendant's trial that the alleged perjury was material to the Brian Pope case. Further, the prosecution intended to call other witnesses who were involved in the Brian Pope case and, thus, able to testify as to the materiality of any false statements. The prosecution pointed out that there is an actual voice recording of the grand jury proceedings such that any evasiveness can be perceived from the recording of Defendant's testimony itself, that the court reporter was an eye witness to the proceeding, that there was a transcript of the grand jury proceeding, and, further, that any questions the defense would ask DA Stutes and ADA Haney about Defendant's demeanor would be speculative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the conclusion of the argument, the trial court denied the request for subpoenas for ADA Haney and DA Stutes. The State noted that it had an open file policy and agreed to provide any documents related to the Brian Pope case. The parties then recorded Defendant's waiver of his right to trial by jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant asserts that \"[t]he trial court erred in denying the defendant's request to subpoena the prosecuting attorneys to appear at a motion to disqualify.\" Defendant contends that \"as witnesses in the perjury case, their testimony is necessary to support [Defendant's] motion to disqualify them from also acting as prosecutors on [Defendant's perjury] charge. Their testimony is essential to the theory of the defense for Charles Middleton.\" Thus, the question posed to this court is actually twofold. One: are the subpoenas necessary for the hearing on the motion to disqualify DA Stutes and ADA Haney? Two: is the testimony of DA Stutes and ADA Haney necessary for Defendant to present a defense in his trial for perjury? The answer to the second question necessarily disposes of the first. An appellate court uses the abuse of discretion standard in reviewing a trial court's decision to deny a motion to subpoena a prosecuting attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    State v. Tucker\n   </em>\n   , 49,950 (La. App. 2 Cir. 7/8/15),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6860652\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/170/394/\">\n    170 So.3d 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defense contends the testimonies of DA Stutes and ADA Haney, as witnesses to the accused offense, are necessary for a just hearing on Defendant's motion to recuse the prosecutors as they are eye witnesses to his alleged perjury offense. Defendant contends that both DA Stutes and ADA Haney were present throughout the grand jury proceedings, participated in investigating Brian Pope and Defendant, and engaged in questioning Defendant at the grand jury hearing. Defendant claims that as both prosecutors were involved in the gathering of evidence and the planning of the questions to ask Defendant, only they can testify to the events leading up to Defendant's alleged crime; thus, forming the basis for the request to disqualify them as prosecutors in the instant case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant frames the basis of the underlying perjury charge against him is as follows: Defendant denied knowing a \"Mr. Redmond\" during the grand jury investigation of Brian Pope; however, the investigation showed Defendant had exchanged emails and had one phone call with Jason Redmond on two separate days occurring ten months before the grand jury testimony, but Defendant had never met Mr. Redmond in person, and the two-day communication was the extent of their relationship. Though there is some evidence Defendant, in his capacity as legal counsel for the City Marshall's Office, prepared a motion to obtain sealed records on Mr. Redmond's behalf at the request of Brian Pope, the defense claims that this was prepared as a \"ghost motion\" in the name of \"Troyce Thorla,\" that Defendant simply dropped off the pleading with a receptionist, that Defendant never made contact with the actual recipient, and that Defendant both billed and received payment from the City Marshall's Office for drafting the motion and referred to the drafted pleading in the billing as the \"Redmond motion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant explained that his motion for subpoenas included the testimony of ADA Haney and DA Stutes, as well as all related or relevant documents in the possession of the district attorney's office at the time of Brian Pope's grand jury hearing, including all documents connected with Defendant and Jason Redmond, emails between the two, invoices for legal services between Defendant and Brian Pope or the City Marshall's Office, and correspondence between Defendant and Brian Pope or the Marshall's Office regarding Redmond or the Redmond motion. Defendant contends perjury cannot be proven unless Defendant actually made a false statement to the grand jury and additionally asserts that a false statement is not perjury unless it relates to the material issue or question in controversy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The defense urges it has shown it has a compelling need for the prosecutors' testimonies and it has exhausted all other sources of the information it seeks from the prosecutors' testimonies. Defendant asserts that he intends to ask the prosecutors about refreshing a witness's memory and whether any such methods were used to refresh Defendant's memory. Defendant asserts that his statement, without having his memory refreshed, could have been made as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory, such that perjury may not exist in the instant case. The defense adds that it intends to ask the prosecutors to testify as to the materiality of Defendant's grand jury statement to the prosecution of Brian Pope. Defense counsel claims that the information cannot be obtained elsewhere as DA Stutes and ADA Haney are the only witnesses with information pertaining to the investigation of Mr. Pope. Because Defendant cannot subpoena the grand jurors, the defense asserts the two\n   prosecutors are the only ones who can explain how Defendant's familiarity with Mr. Redmond affected the grand jury's decision to indict Mr. Pope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Pursuant to La.Code Evid. art. 507, prosecutors can only be subpoenaed to testify under specific circumstances:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A. General rule. Neither a subpoena nor a court order shall be issued to a lawyer or his representative to appear or testify in any criminal investigation or proceeding where the purpose of the subpoena or order is to ask the lawyer or his representative to reveal information about a client or former client obtained in the course of representing the client unless the court after a contradictory hearing has determined that the information sought is not protected from disclosure by any applicable privilege or work product rule; and all of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (1) The information sought is essential to the successful completion of an ongoing investigation, prosecution, or defense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (2) The purpose of seeking the information is not to harass the attorney or his client.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (3) With respect to a subpoena, the subpoena lists the information sought with particularity, is reasonably limited as to subject matter and period of time, and gives timely notice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (4) There is no practicable alternative means of obtaining the information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   B.

Failure to object timely to non-compliance with the terms of this Article constitutes a waiver of the procedural protections of this Article, but does not constitute a waiver of any privilege.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   C. Binding effect of determination; notice to client. The determination that a lawyer-client privilege is not applicable to the testimony shall not bind the client or former client unless the client or former client was given notice of the time, place, and substance of the hearing and had an opportunity fully to participate in that hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   D. Exceptions. This Article shall not apply in habitual offender proceedings when a lawyer is called as a witness for purposes of identification of his client or former client, or in post-conviction proceedings when a lawyer is called as a witness on the issue of ineffective assistance of the lawyer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   E. The procedural provisions and protections afforded by Paragraph A of this Article shall extend to lawyers serving as prosecutors in state, parish, or municipal courts, whether those functions are exercised in the name of the state of Louisiana or any parish or municipality, and whether the lawyer is the attorney general or assistant attorney general, a district attorney or assistant district attorney, or a parish or municipal prosecutor, and shall extend to lawyers employed by either house of the Louisiana Legislature.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v. Tuesno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9585443\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/408/1269/#p1272\">\n    408 So.2d 1269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1272-73 (La. 1982) (citations omitted), the Louisiana Supreme Court reviewed a district court's refusal to subpoena a prosecuting attorney to testify at a criminal trial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   A trial judge's discretion in determining issues of relevancy and competency and in maintaining an orderly presentation of evidence certainly must yield to the constitutional right of the defendant to call witnesses and produce evidence in defense to a criminal charge. In our adversary system, however, the legal counsel for either party is not generally considered as an ordinary witness because\n   of the very special professional position of counsel in the system.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendant argues that his \"purpose\" in calling the assistant prosecutor was to verify that defendant does have a look-alike brother who was being prosecuted for three counts of armed robbery in another section of the court and that the location of these robberies occurred in the same area and on the same weekend. While the defendant did not state this exact purpose to the trial court, the trial court correctly noted that defendant had other means to prove the occurrence of the robberies by the brother and to prove the identity of the brother. The ruling proved eminently correct, when at the trial, the defendant stated that he was not accusing his brother of committing the armed robbery for which defendant was being tried.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   In essence, the defendant is contending, not that the robbery of Phillips was committed by his brother, but that Phillips' identification of defendant is patently fabricated and mistaken because the statements by Phillips to the police about the robber and about what Phillips \"learned\" from persons in the neighborhood more closely fitted defendant's brother than the defendant himself. This overlooks the important in-court identification of defendant when he was side by side with his brother and the street identification before and when defendant was arrested. This identification was not made by the police from Phillips' first description, but from Phillips' identifying defendant at the liquor store location where he was when the police arrested him. Phillips was extensively cross-examined as to his identification of defendant and it was within the jury's province to believe Phillips' identification.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Under the circumstances of this case, we find no error in the trial court's determination that the testimony defendant sought to elicit from the assistant prosecutor was irrelevant. It was also hearsay. The fact that defendant had a look-alike brother who was being prosecuted for other armed robberies in another section of the same court, could have been, and was, established by witnesses other than the assistant prosecutor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In another case wherein the trial court allowed subpoenas of prosecutors for a hearing on whether the district attorney should be recused, the first circuit in\n   <em>\n    State v. Gates\n   </em>\n   , 08-6, pp. 9-11 (La.App. 1 Cir. 5/15/09),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7050899\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/17/41/#p47\">\n    17 So.3d 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 47-48,\n   <em>\n    writ denied,\n   </em>\n   09-1342 (La. 10/9/09),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7065329,7065321,7065325\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/18/1283/\">\n    18 So.3d 1283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , affirmed the decision of the trial court and held as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [T]he narrow issue presented in this writ is whether article 507 or article 508 of the Louisiana Code of Evidence, if either, is applicable to the subpoena requests and, if so, whether the requirements of the appropriate article have been met.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   The wording of articles 507 and 508 is similar, and the articles generally provide that a subpoena shall not be issued to a lawyer to appear or testify in any criminal, civil, or juvenile proceeding where the purpose is to ask the lawyer to reveal information about a client or former client obtained in the course of representing the client. However, the subpoena may be issued if, after a contradictory hearing, the trial court determines that the information sought is not protected by any applicable privilege or work product rule and the purpose of seeking the information is not to harass the attorney or his client, the subpoena lists the information sought with particularity, is reasonably limited as to subject\n   matter and period of time, gives timely notice, and there is no practicable alternative means of obtaining the information. The court must also determine whether, in a criminal proceeding, the information sought is essential to the successful completion of an ongoing investigation, prosecution, or defense, or in a civil or juvenile proceeding, or in an administrative investigation or hearing, the information sought is essential to the successful completion of an ongoing investigation, is essential to the case of the party seeking the information, and is not merely peripheral, cumulative, or speculative.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   We acknowledge that defendant's request to issue witness subpoenas was made pursuant to article 507, which is only applicable to criminal proceedings. The trial court, however, issued the subpoenas to the assistant district attorneys pursuant to article 508, applicable to civil proceedings. After a review of articles 507 and 508 and the particular matter presented herein, we conclude that article 507 applies in this particular case. Accordingly, defendant's request for subpoenas must be analyzed under the requirements of article 507.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Herein, defendant seeks to subpoena the assistant district attorneys to testify about what they did and said during their conversations with the sheriff's attorney and defense counsel. There is no indication, and relator does not argue, that the subpoenas are requested for the purpose to ask the assistant district attorneys to reveal information from conversations with the district attorney, or other assistant district attorneys, which is protected from disclosure by any applicable privilege or work product rule.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Second, in the context of the facts presented, the purpose does not appear to be to harass the district attorney or assistant district attorneys. While relator has argued that defendant created the alleged basis for his motion to recuse by filing the federal civil rights lawsuit, relator does not argue that the subpoenas were requested to cause harassment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Third, the request for the subpoenas (and the other documents and arguments presented by defendant) specifically lists the information sought with particularity, is reasonably limited as to subject matter and period of time, and gives timely notice. A review of the request further shows that defendant has narrowly limited the request to information about conversations between the assistant district attorneys, the attorney for the sheriff, and defense counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Fourth, other than the testimony by other attorneys, there is no other practicable means for defendant to obtain the information he seeks. Defendant may want the testimony of the assistant district attorneys to corroborate the testimony of other witnesses. Moreover, defendant may wish to present the testimony of the assistants to avoid any evidentiary objections and issues presented if other witnesses who were not actually present during the conversations testify.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Fifth, the information sought is essential to defendant's presentation of evidence and the completion of the motion to recuse proceedings. Since the testimony directly relates to the basis of the motion to recuse, the information sought is not merely peripheral. Nor is there is any indication that the information is speculative. We note that defendant is obviously arguing prosecutorial misconduct to the charges of resisting an officer and the information sought appears related to the defense of those charges.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7026321\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/62/55/\">\n    62 So.3d at 55-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the supreme court again discussed the appropriateness of a criminal defendant subpoenaing the prosecutor as a witness at trial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Although the defendant in a criminal trial has the right to prove his defense, including the calling of a prosecutor who is otherwise a competent witness, the prosecutor's testimony must be relevant and material to the theory of the defense, and it must not be privileged, repetitious, or cumulative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State's purpose for issuing the subpoenas was not to harass either the client or the attorney but to resolve a question ordered to be resolved by this court. The subpoenas listed the specific information sought and gave timely notice. Finally, there was no alternative means of obtaining the information.

The defendants claim[ ] that Lamondre's defense against the charge of jury tampering was that he was merely trying to instruct Ms. Griffin about voir dire and not trying to tell her how she should vote. The prosecutor's testimony would show, he reasons, that his communications with Griffin were intended to achieve the same purpose as the intention of the prosecutors during their voir dire examinations of potential jurors, and thus, the jury could conclude that[,] if the prosecutors were not jury tampering, he was not guilty of jury tampering.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   An opportunity to be heard, an essential component of procedural fairness, would be an empty one if the state were permitted to exclude competent reliable evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The prosecutor's testimony regarding their intent during voir dire would have little relevance, if any, toward showing Lamondre's intent in contacting Latisha Griffin. We also agree with the trial court's conclusion that it would tend to confuse the jury regarding the elements of the offense. Even if the information were relevant to Lamondre's intended defense, questioning the district attorney's intent and purpose in questioning potential jurors during voir dire is clearly privileged and covered under the attorney work product privilege. The trial court is afforded great discretion in the admission of evidence and the defendant has made no showing that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding the testimony of the prosecutors and defense counsel in this case.

Nevertheless, the State's burden is not to show that no other witness can testify as to what Ms. Murphy observed, but instead to show that what she witnessed is necessary to prove the State's case. Given the number of witnesses and the audio and video recordings of the alleged incident, Ms. Murphy's testimony is not essential to the State's prosecution. For the same reason, there are practicable alternative means of obtaining the information to which she would testify. Therefore, the State has not met the requirements of subsections (A)(1) and (A)(4).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In the instant case, Defendant asserts the need for the testimonies of DA Stutes and ADA Haney for various reasons, including that they were present during the grand jury hearing and, thus, witnessed the alleged crime. However, we note that there is significant evidence of the events otherwise within the proceedings in the form of an audio recording thereof, a transcript thereof, and a verifying witness in the court reporter who transcribed the proceeding, making the evidence to be elicited from the testimony of DA Stutes and ADA Haney merely repetitious and cumulative. While Defendant further argues that the testimony of the two prosecutors is needed concerning Defendant's demeanor while testifying at the\n   grand jury investigation, such as whether Defendant was cooperative or evasive, the best evidence of such lies in the actual recording and transcript, where voice inflections and responsiveness can be heard and seen directly by the trial judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Defendant claims that the testimony of DA Stutes and ADA Haney is needed to determine the circumstances surrounding his testimony (i.e., the investigation into the Brian Pope case) and that they would be the individuals best able to testify about the materiality of Defendant's statements to the culpability of Brian Pope. Defendant further maintains the information cannot be obtained elsewhere because ADA Haney and DA Stutes are the only witnesses with information pertaining to the investigation of Mr. Pope, because Defendant cannot subpoena the grand jurors, and because they are the only ones who can explain how Defendant's familiarity with Mr. Redmond affected the grand jury's decision to indict Mr. Pope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   We note, however, that there has been no mention of any intent to qualify the prosecutors as expert witnesses and, further, any such opinion given by the prosecutors that the alleged false testimony of Defendant as to Mr. Redmond is or is not material to the Pope trial and investigation is objectionable as \"[s]uch testimony invades the province of the [trier of fact] and usurps its function.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Further, although maintaining that the information it seeks to introduce at trial by the testimony of the two witnesses cannot be obtained elsewhere, Defendant does not explain why the testimony of the investigators and law enforcement personnel directly involved in the Brian Pope matter would be unable to provide the information regarding the materiality of Defendant's statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   At the hearing on the subpoena motion, the prosecution asserted that both the relevant transcripts and voice recordings are readily available to be introduced into evidence at trial; that there were other witnesses, such as the court reporter, to Defendant's statement during the Brian Pope grand jury proceeding; that there were other people involved in the prosecution of Brian Pope who could be called to testify about the materiality of any false statements by Defendant; and that any testimony by the prosecutors regarding Defendant's evasiveness or sincerity would be speculative. Moreover, the defense does not explain how any testimony by the prosecutors about the investigation of Brian Pope and their part in the development of the case, as work product, would not be confidential and subject to attorney-client privilege under La.Code Evid. art. 506. Additionally, while Defendant asserts that it needs to call the prosecutors as witnesses to give testimony on the materiality of Defendant's grand jury testimony to Brian Pope's culpability, we note that the materiality of false testimony is a matter of law for determination by the trial court judge, not a factual question such as to require witness testimony.\n   <em>\n    State v.

It is the burden of the State to prove the Defendant's guilt and all of the elements of perjury beyond a reasonable doubt at trial. While Defendant argues that his defense hinges on the prosecutors' focus of precise questions in the grand jury proceeding and Defendant's demeanor while answering the questions, we find that the best evidence of such is the audio recording of the grand jury proceeding and the accompanying transcript. Thus, Defendant has failed to establish that the evidence necessary for his defense is not available by other means.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Defendant cites multiple cases in an attempt to establish that the prosecutors here are necessary to his defense, including\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, all of these cases relate to the nature of, proof of, and sufficiency of evidence necessary to convict one of perjury, not mitigation or exoneration evidence in defense thereof, and are inapplicable to whether the subpoenas of the prosecutors in this case should issue. Defendant essentially is attempting to dictate how the State should conduct its prosecution of the case. Certainly, the State could, as Defendant would prefer, recuse itself and allow the Attorney General to take over the prosecution. The DA and ADA may then wish to offer the Attorney General the use of their testimony. Defendant, however, does not have the right to dictate this alternative. Rather, \"the district attorney has entire charge and control of every criminal prosecution instituted or pending in his district, and determines whom, when, and how he shall prosecute.\" La.Code Crim.P. art. 61. As such, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Defendant's request for the subpoenas of the prosecutors in this particular case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   As this is a bench trial, the trial judge will be fully able to weigh the evidence, listen to and read Defendant's grand jury testimony, assess credibility, and determine whether the State has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt based on all the evidence admitted. We further note that the trial court has the discretion in the interest of justice to revisit the issue of either prosecutor's potential testimony as a constitutional safeguard to preserve Defendant's right to present a defense should the same be shown to be essential during trial. Accordingly, the trial court's decision to quash the subpoenas of District Attorney Keith Stutes and Assistant District Attorney Alan Haney to testify at the hearing on the motion was within its discretion on the showing made at this stage of the proceedings. Defendant's writ application is thus denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     WRIT DENIED\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
