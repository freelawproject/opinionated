Considering our order in\n   <em>\n    Crosstex Energy Services, LP v. Texas Brine Co., LLC\n   </em>\n   , 2018-1128 (La. 10/29/18),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12680531,12680532\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/255/587/\">\n    255 So. 3d 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the judgment of the court of appeal is vacated insofar as it finds the district court is divested of jurisdiction to consider Texas Brine's fraud-based claims in the\n   <em>\n    Crosstex\n   </em>\n   matter. We hereby grant a limited remand of the\n   <em>\n    Crosstex\n   </em>\n   appeal in order to permit the district court to conduct the trial, as scheduled, of Texas Brine's fraud-based claims in the\n   <em>\n    Crosstex\n   </em>\n   matter only. In all other respects, the writs are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Justices Weimer, Guidry, and Clark, would deny all applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Justice Hughes would grant all applications.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
