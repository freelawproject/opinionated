The Mississippi Commission on Judicial Performance (the \"Commission\") recommends that the Court publicly reprimand and assess a $500 fine against Judge Frank Sutton, a justice court judge for Post Three in Hinds County. The Commission made this recommendation after finding by clear and convincing evidence that Judge Sutton's conduct constituted misconduct in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct as well as Section 177A of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62. We agree with the Commission that Judge Sutton's conduct constituted misconduct. We disagree with the Commission's imposition of sanctions. Instead, we order a public reprimand, fine Judge Sutton $500 and suspend Judge Sutton for thirty days without pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63. Based on complaints against Judge Sutton, the Commission initiated an inquiry into his role in two matters. This investigation led to the Commission's filing a formal complaint. Judge Sutton did not file an answer to the complaint; instead, he and the Commission stipulated to agreed facts. The Commission then unanimously adopted those facts in its findings of fact and recommendation. The Commission recommended that Judge Sutton be publicly reprimanded and fined $500.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Count One\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64. On January 31, 2018, Investigator Nick Brown with the Hinds County Sheriff's Department arrested and charged Amanda Howard with prostitution. Howard's hearing was scheduled for February 22, 2018. The day after Howard's arrest, Michael Liddell approached Judge Sutton in court and asked Judge Sutton if he could help Liddell with the charges pending against Howard. That afternoon, Judge Sutton called Investigator Brown and asked him if he could \"help him out\" on the prostitution charge against Howard because he knew her family. Investigator Brown told Judge Sutton that he would not \"help him out\" with the prostitution\n   charge. That same day-February 1, 2018, Judge Sutton,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   and without a hearing, remanded Howard's prostitution charge to the file, subject to recall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Count Two\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65. On June 26, 2018, Investigator Keith Burnett, with the Hinds County Sheriff's Department, arrested Barry Jones and charged him with possession of marijuana. Jones's mother, who is a parishioner at Fairfield Missionary Baptist Church where Judge Sutton serves as pastor, approached Judge Sutton and asked if he could help Jones. Judge Sutton called Investigator Burnett and inquired about Jones's arrest and pending charges. Judge Sutton asked about the weight of the marijuana collected from Jones and whether the charge was a misdemeanor or felony. Investigator Burnett informed Judge Sutton that 35.2 grams of marijuana had been collected from Jones's apartment and that he was charging Jones with \"Possession of a Controlled Substance Felony.\" The record is silent as to what Judge Sutton did with this information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66. Section 177A of the Mississippi Constitution provides, in part,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   On recommendation of the commission on judicial performance, the Supreme Court may remove from office, suspend, fine or publicly censure or reprimand any justice or judge of this state for: (a) actual conviction of a felony in a court other than a court of the State of Mississippi; (b) willful misconduct in office; (c) willful and persistent failure to perform his duties; (d) habitual intemperance in the use of alcohol or other drugs; or (e) conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice which brings the judicial office into disrepute ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Miss.

Willful misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b68. The Commission and Judge Sutton agreed that he violated Canons 1, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B(1), 3B(2), 3B(8), 3B(11), 3C(1), 3E(1) and 4A of the Code of Judicial Conduct. We agree, but we add that Judge Sutton violated Canon 3B(7) as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b69. The Court has discussed willful misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Willful misconduct in office is the improper or wrongful use of power of his office by a judge acting intentionally, or\n   with gross unconcern for his conduct and generally in bad faith. It involves more than an error of judgment or a mere lack of diligence. Necessarily, the term would encompass conduct involving moral turpitude, dishonesty, or corruption, and also any knowing misuse of the office, whatever the motive. However, these elements are not necessary to a finding of bad faith. A specific intent to use the powers of the judicial office to accomplish a purpose which the judge knew or should have known was beyond the legitimate exercise of his authority constitutes bad faith ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Willful misconduct in office of necessity is conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute. However, a judge may also, through negligence or ignorance not amounting to bad faith, behave in a manner so as to bring the judicial office into disrepute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Miss. Comm'n on Judicial Performance v. Boykin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11251086\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/763/872/#p874\">\n    763 So. 2d 872\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 874-75 (Miss. 2000) (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Quick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7532421\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/553/522/#p524\">\n    553 So. 2d 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 524-25 (Miss. 1989) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b610. Canon 1 of the Code of Judicial Conduct provides,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   An independent and honorable judiciary is indispensable to justice in our society. A judge should participate in establishing, maintaining, and enforcing high standards of conduct, and shall personally observe those standards so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary will be preserved. The provisions of this Code should be construed and applied to further that objective.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Judge Sutton's contacting the investigators, his\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   actions on behalf of Howard and his conversation with Jones's mother violated the \"high standards of conduct\" required by Canon 1. Further, his actions did not preserve the integrity and independence of the judiciary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b611. Canon 2A states that \"[a] judge shall respect and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.\" Also, Canon 2B, in part, provides,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Judges shall not allow their family, social, or other relationships to influence the judges' judicial conduct or judgment. Judges shall not lend the prestige of their offices to advance the private interests of the judges or others; nor shall judges convey or permit others to convey the impression that they are in a special position to influence the judges.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Judge Sutton did not promote public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. His actions were also influenced by social relationships and conveyed the impression that those acquaintances were in a position to influence his actions as a judge. As to Count One, Liddell approached Judge Sutton in court to request his assistance with Howard's charges. Judge Sutton should have immediately declined to assist Howard and informed Liddell that his request was improper because Judge Sutton was bound by his oath to be impartial. Also, while the telephone communication in Count Two was less public, Jones's mother was left with the impression that Judge Sutton would help her son.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b612. Under Canon 3A, \"judicial duties of judges take precedence over all their other activities.\" Canon 3B(1) declares that a judge should not hear and decide cases in which disqualification is required. Further, Canon 3B(2) requires a judge to \"be faithful to the law and maintain professional competence in it\" and \"not [to] be swayed by partisan interests, public clamor, or fear of criticism.\" In part, Canon 3B(7) provides,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   A judge shall accord to all who are legally interested in a proceeding, or\n   their lawyers, the right to be heard according to law. A judge shall not initiate, permit, or consider ex parte communications, or consider other communications made to the judge outside the presence of the parties concerning a pending or impending proceeding ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Also, Canon 3B(8) requires a judge to \"dispose of all judicial matters promptly, efficiently and fairly.\" Canon 3B(11) provides that \"[a] judge shall not disclose or use, for any purpose unrelated to judicial duties, nonpublic information acquired in a judicial capacity.\" Canon 3C(1) requires a judge to cooperate with other judges and court officials in the administration of justice. Canon 3E(1) describes when judges should disqualify themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b613. None of Judge Sutton's actions were in accordance with Canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct. In Howard's case, Judge Sutton improperly contacted Investigator Brown, and-after Investigator Brown said he would not \"help him out\"-Judge Sutton remanded Howard's prostitution charge to the files,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte.\n   </em>\n   In Jones's case, Judge Sutton improperly contacted Investigator Burnett. Once Judge Sutton agreed to contact the investigators, he had a duty to disqualify himself from both cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b614. Also, the discussion of each case with a nonparty, the contact with the investigators in each case and Judge Sutton's action on behalf of Howard violated Canon 3B(7)'s prohibition against\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   communications. Notably, the Commission's findings of fact and recommendation did not find that Judge Sutton violated Canon 3B(7). Thus, it did not consider Judge Sutton's\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b615. Last, Canon 4A provides,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   A judge shall conduct all of the judge's extra-judicial activities so that they do not:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (1) cast reasonable doubt on the judge's capacity to act impartially as a judge;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (2) demean the judicial office; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (3) interfere with the proper performance of judicial duties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Judge Sutton's intermingling of his role as pastor and justice court judge did not comport with Canon 4A when he agreed to contact Investigator Burnett about the charges against Jones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b616. After a review of the Commission's findings of fact and recommendation, it is evident that Judge Sutton committed willful misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute. We now determine what sanctions against Judge Sutton are appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Sanctions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b617. \"The sanctions in judicial-misconduct cases should be proportionate to the judge's offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Miss.

To determine the appropriateness of sanctions, the Court weighs six factors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \"(1) the length and character of the judge's public service; (2) whether there is any prior caselaw on point; (3) the magnitude of the offense and the harm suffered; (4) whether the misconduct is an isolated incident or evidences a pattern of conduct;\" (5) whether the conduct was willful, intended to deprive the public of assets, or if it exploited the\n   judge's position; and \"(6) the presence or absence of mitigating or aggravating factors.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Miss.

Judge Sutton has served as a justice court judge for fourteen years.

Judge Sutton remanded Howard's criminal charge to the files. Also, as discussed below, Judge Sutton has committed multiple instances of misconduct-including misconduct related to\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   communications. In general, Judge Sutton's conduct is not as severe as the conduct described in\n   <em>\n    Vess\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cowart\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Chinn\n   </em>\n   .

The magnitude of Judge Sutton's offenses is significant. In Count One, Judge Sutton was approached in court and asked to help a defendant charged with a criminal offense. While the agreed facts before the Court do not include Judge Sutton's in-court response to the request, it is clear that he agreed to help in some manner, given his subsequent\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   communication with Investigator Brown. As to both Counts One and Two, the primary harm suffered from Judge Sutton's actions is to the public, which was left with the impression that members of the judiciary might be partial to certain litigants. Judge Sutton's actions also lent the prestige of his office to advance the private interest of others. \"This Court has stated, '[o]fficial integrity of our Justice Court Judges is vitally important, for it is on that level that many citizens have their only experience with the judiciary.' \"\n   <em>\n    Vess\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7058424\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/10/486/\">\n    10 So. 3d at 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Inquiry Concerning Garner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7623593\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/466/884/#p887\">\n    466 So. 2d 884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 887 (Miss. 1985),\n   <em>\n    overruled on other grounds by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miss.

Judge Sutton's conduct in both Counts was willful and exploited his position as a justice court judge. As to Count One, Judge Sutton willingly contacted Investigator Brown and asked if Investigator Brown would \"help him out.\" Once Investigator Brown declined, Judge Sutton-the same day-willfully remanded Howard's charge to the file despite Howard's hearing already having been scheduled. As to Count Two, Judge Sutton willfully contacted Investigator Burnett concerning the charge against Jones. Judge Sutton did not, however, deprive the public of any assets.

Of those nine complaints, the Commission resolved five of them by informal action resulting in letters of caution to Judge Sutton, two of them by formal complaints resulting in private admonishment and two of them by formal complaint, which were consolidated and submitted to this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miss.

The aggravating factors most relevant to Judge Sutton's current misconduct are, of course, his past\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   communications. These communications, though, occurred more than ten years ago. Still, given the number of violations that Judge Sutton has had in the interim and the fact that he has been publically and privately reprimanded, as well as sanctioned for improper\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   communication, his past conduct should factor into the Court's decision. As the Commission did not find that Judge Sutton violated Canon 3B(7)-the Canon pertaining to\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   communication-there is no indication that the Commission placed any special emphasis on Judge Sutton's past\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b639.

Judge Sutton remanded a criminal charge to the files, engaged in multiple\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   communications and left the public and the law-enforcement community with the impression\n   that he was biased and was willing to act partially on behalf of certain litigants. Judge Sutton's misconduct merits a thirty-day, unpaid suspension, a $500 fine and a public reprimand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b640. Judge Sutton committed misconduct in violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct and section 177A of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890. We impose the Commission's proposed sanctions, but we add a thirty-day suspension without pay. These sanctions are proportionate to Judge Sutton's offense and are warranted by his misconduct.
