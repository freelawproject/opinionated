Code 1975. The circuit court sentenced Murphy to 99 years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On February 1, 2016, Murphy choked his mother, Janice Murphy, until she was unconscious and then put a gun to his head and threatened to kill himself. On February 2, 2016, Murphy threatened to mutilate his father, Vincent Murphy, and to kill himself. On February 3, 2016, Vincent filed a petition to have Murphy involuntarily committed to a mental-health facility. After conducting a hearing, the probate court found probable cause to order Murphy to be confined at a mental-health hospital for diagnosis and treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Later, Deputy Randall McCrary, Sergeant Kent Sims, and Sergeant Tim Ray went to the Murphy residence to effectuate the commitment order. When Murphy saw the officers approach the house, he said, \"Oh, hell no. I'm not going,\" ran into the house, and locked himself in a bedroom. (R. 194.) The officers entered the house and talked to Murphy through the door. Despite the officers' requests for Murphy to open the bedroom door, he refused and insisted that the officers were there to kill him. The officers repeatedly assured Murphy that they were there only to help him. Murphy, however, still refused to open the door and claimed that he would only \"come out in a body bag.\" (R. 198.) At that point, officers decided to force their way through the bedroom door. As soon as the officers opened the bedroom door, Murphy fired at the officers and Deputy McCrary returned fire. In the exchange, Deputy McCrary and Murphy were both shot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In accordance with the commitment order issued by the probate court, Dr. David Anakwenze, a psychiatrist at Eliza Coffee Memorial Hospital, evaluated Murphy's mental condition. After evaluating Murphy, Dr. Anakwenze sent a letter to the probate court, recommending that Murphy\n   remain at the hospital for further treatment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"Timothy Murphy was admitted to Renaissance Center for Emotional Health at ECM Hospital on 0/02/2016 [sic] under a court petition filed by his father.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Timothy Murphy is mentally ill.

Mr. Murphy is unable to make rational and informed decisions as to whether or not treatment for mental illness would be desirable, as he continues to evidence paranoia, delusions, and thought blocking and appears to still be responding to external stimuli. The patient will, if not treated, continue to suffer mental distress and will continue to experience deterioration in the ability to function independently. As a result of his mental illness, Mr. Murphy poses a real and present threat of substantial harm to himself and/or others. I recommend Probable Cause be found and that Mr. Murphy remain at ECM for further stabilization and treatment.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (C. 28.) On April 11, 2016, the probate court issued an order for further commitment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the meantime, Murphy was charged with attempted murder,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 13A-4-2 ; 13A-6-2, Ala. Code 1975, for shooting Deputy McCrary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Murphy pleaded not guilty and not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. Murphy also moved the court for a mental evaluation to determine his competency to stand trial. The circuit court granted Murphy's motion, and Dr. Glenn King, a forensic psychologist, evaluated Murphy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During his evaluation, Dr. King found Murphy to be competent to stand trial and sane at the time of the offense. The circuit court then held a hearing on Murphy's competency to stand trial and determined that Murphy was competent. Murphy disputed Dr. King's findings and moved the court for funds for an independent mental-health evaluation. The circuit court held a hearing on Murphy's motion for funds for an independent mental evaluation. At the hearing, the State argued that Murphy had been evaluated by Dr. King and that he was not entitled to another evaluation. The circuit court agreed with the State and denied Murphy's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At trial, Dr. King testified for the State regarding his finding that Murphy was not suffering from any mental disease or defect at the time of the offense. Murphy attempted to rebut Dr. King's testimony and establish that he was not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect by presenting testimony from Will Motlow, the probate judge who had ordered his commitment; Dr. Anakwenze; and his mother. Although each of Murphy's witnesses had reason to believe that he suffered from mental defects, none had evaluated him for sanity at the time of the offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (R. 601) (Dr. Anakwenze stating that he had not evaluated Murphy to determine whether Murphy knew right from wrong). After hearing all the evidence and being instructed by the circuit court, the jury found Murphy guilty of attempted murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The circuit court adjudicated Murphy guilty and sentenced him to 99 years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Thereafter, Murphy filed a motion for a new trial. In his motion, Murphy argued, among other things:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"The Court erred by denying [Murphy]'s Motion for Funds for independent mental health evaluation. Said denial was extremely detrimental as [Murphy] was/is indigent and could not afford independent evaluation, thus denying the constitutional rights of due process .... Evidence produced both at motion hearing and trial was that [Murphy] has a history of mental illness and had an involuntary mental commitment pending at the time of the events made the basis of this cause.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (C. 140.) The circuit court denied Murphy's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On appeal, Murphy argues that the circuit court erred by denying his request for funds for an independent mental-health evaluation.

The Court began its analysis by stating, 'This Court has long recognized that when a State brings its judicial power to bear on an indigent defendant in a criminal proceeding, it must take steps to assure that the defendant has a fair opportunity to present his defense.'\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298833\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/68/#p83\">\n    470 U.S. at 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298833\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/68/#p83\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court observed as to the first factor, 'The private interest in the accuracy of a criminal proceeding that places an individual's life or liberty at risk is almost uniquely compelling.' 4[70] U.S. at 78,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9136631\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/67/\">\n    92 S.

The Court stated that the individual's interest in the State's attempt to convict him weighed heavily in the analysis. As to the second factor, the Court could identify only the State's financial interest weighing against the provision of a psychiatrist, and it found that interest to be insubstantial. The Court found that the State could 'not legitimately assert an interest in the maintenance of a strategic advantage over the defense, if the result of that advantage is to cast a pall on the accuracy of the verdict obtained.'\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298833\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/68/#p83\">\n    470 U.S. at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298833\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/68/#p83\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As to the third factor, the Court noted, initially, that psychiatric assistance had come to play a pivotal role in criminal\n   proceedings. It noted that a majority of states and the federal government had decided that, in certain circumstances, an indigent defendant was entitled to psychiatric assistance to secure an adequate defense. The Court recognized the extensive tasks that psychiatrists had come to complete at criminal trials:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \" '[W]hen the State has made the defendant's mental condition relevant to his criminal culpability and to the punishment he might suffer, the assistance of a psychiatrist may well be crucial to the defendant's ability to marshal his defense. In this role, psychiatrists gather facts, through professional examination, interviews, and elsewhere, that they will share with the judge or jury; they analyze the information gathered and from it draw plausible conclusions about the defendant's mental condition, and about the effects of any disorder on behavior; and they offer opinions about how the defendant's mental condition might have affected his behavior at the time in question. They know the probative questions to ask of the opposing party's psychiatrists and how to interpret their answers. Unlike lay witnesses, who can merely describe symptoms they believe might be relevant to the defendant's mental state, psychiatrists can identify the \"elusive and often deceptive\" symptoms of insanity,\n   <em>\n    Solesbee v.

Further, where permitted by evidentiary rules, psychiatrists can translate a medical diagnosis into language that will assist the trier of fact, and therefore offer evidence in a form that has meaning for the task at hand. Through this process of investigation, interpretation, and testimony, psychiatrists ideally assist lay jurors, who generally have no training in psychiatric matters, to make a sensible and educated determination about the mental condition of the defendant at the time of the offense.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298833\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/68/#p83\">\n    470 U.S. at 80-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298833\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/68/#p83\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"Additionally, the Court noted:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \" 'By organizing a defendant's mental history, examination results and behavior, and other information, interpreting it in light of their expertise, and then laying out their investigative and analytic process to the jury, the psychiatrists for each party enable the jury to make its most accurate determination of the truth on the issue before them.

Dr. King determined that Murphy did not suffer from a mental disease or defect. Murphy contested Dr. King's findings and sought funds for an independent mental-health expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Murphy made \"a preliminary showing that his mental condition at the time of the offense is likely to be a significant factor at trial[; thus] due process require[d] that, at a minimum, a state provide access to a competent psychiatrist who [would] evaluate [him] 'and assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense' at the guilt phase and at sentencing.\"\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   , 956 So.2d at 444.

At trial, Murphy pursued a defense of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. To overcome that defense, the State presented as a witness Dr. King, who informed the jury that, in his opinion, Murphy did not suffer from any mental disease or defect. Murphy lacked a mental-health expert to aid in cross-examining Dr. King. Additionally, and more importantly, the need for a competent, mental-health expert was central to Murphy's ability to present his defense. He was not, however, afforded a mental-health expert to help him present his defense and, thus, was forced to attempt to establish his defense through his mother, a probate judge, and a psychiatrist who had not evaluated him to determine his sanity at the time of the offense. Based on these facts, this Court cannot say that the circuit court's decision to deny Murphy funds for a mental-health expert was harmless. As such, this Court must reverse Murphy's conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Murphy's attempted-murder conviction and his sentence to 99 years in prison are reversed, and the cause is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Welch, Kellum, Burke, and Joiner, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    According to the State, \"Murphy was charged by separate indictment with the offense of domestic violence by strangulation in Lauderdale CC-16-226,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , (C. 38, 91), but the trial court later granted the State's motion to nol-pross the charge.\" (State's brief, at 1.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
