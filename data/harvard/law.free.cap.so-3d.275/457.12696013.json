Atkins\n   Defendants, the City of New Orleans, the City Council of New Orleans, and the Councilmembers appeal a judgment granting a writ of mandamus and ordering the Councilmembers to adopt and ratify the City Council's May 24, 2018 motion to approve an ordinance authorizing a conditional use permit for Plaintiffs, Reginald Commodore and Managing Change, LLC, to operate a neighborhood commercial establishment for a specialty restaurant. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs, Reginald Commodore and Managing Change, LLC (\"Plaintiffs\"), applied to the City Planning Commission (\"CPC\") for a conditional use permit for property located at 938-940 Louisiana Avenue and 3406 Constance Street to establish an ice cream parlor in a Historic Urban Two-Family Residential District (HU-RD2). The matter was assigned Zoning Docket No. 043/18 and was initiated by City Council Motion No. 18-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In March of 2018, the CPC Staff Report recommended approval of Plaintiffs' request under Zoning Docket No. 43/18 \"subject to seven (7) provisos.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The report provided that the proposed conditional use was \"consistent with the general purpose and intent of the applicable zoning district regulations, would reestablish a very low-intensity commercial use on site, and would bring a vacant property back into commerce while limiting the potential impact on surrounding residences\" and was consistent with the \"Plan for 21\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   Century.\" However, the CPC vote resulted in a recommendation of no legal majority to the City Council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 24, 2018, the Councilmembers adopted Motion M-18-204 to allow the conditional use request by a vote of six to one. The motion was forwarded to the City Attorney's Office for preparation of a proposed ordinance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 12, 2018, the ordinance was assigned Calendar No. 32,321 and introduced\n   and included the seven provisos recommended by the CPC. On August 9, 2018, the ordinance was placed on the agenda but was unanimously denied by the Councilmembers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Thereafter, on September 10, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a petition against the City, the City Council, and the Councilmembers (collectively, \"the City\") requesting a writ of mandamus be issued compelling the members of the City Council to adopt the final ordinance ratifying its May 24, 2018 decision to grant a conditional use permit for the ice cream parlor. Plaintiffs amended their petition on September 13, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 17, 2018, the trial court issued an alternative writ and ordered the City to show cause on October 4, 2018, why a peremptory writ should not issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, the City filed exceptions of prematurity and no cause of action for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The exceptions and mandamus came for hearing before the trial court on October 4, 2018. After arguments, the trial court denied the City's exceptions. The trial court took the mandamus under advisement and on November 2, 2018, the trial court granted the petition for writ of mandamus. Thereafter, the City filed requests for written reasons from the trial court's decision to grant the writ of mandamus.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court issued written reasons on December 4, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court signed the judgment on the mandamus on December 14, 2018 and\n   the judgment on the exceptions on December 28, 2018. The judgment on the mandamus ordered and compelled the Councilmembers to \"perform their ministerial duty\" and affirmatively vote on an ordinance introduced \"on July 12, 2018 consistent with the council's discretionary May 24, 2018\" motion of approval vote and adopt the final ordinance \"ratifying the City Council's May 24, 2018, decision that authorized the conditional use permit\" for Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 19, 2018, the City filed a motion for suspensive appeal from the December 14, 2018 judgment. The trial court granted the motion on December 21, 2018. This timely appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Prior to addressing the merits of the appeal, appellate courts have the duty to determine\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   whether our appellate court jurisdiction has been properly invoked by a valid final judgment.\n   <em>\n    Bayer v.

Additionally, while the judgment does not explicitly state the writ of mandamus is granted, it does specify the relief as it orders the Councilmembers to act on the ordinance.

The City also claims that the trial court erred in denying its exception of no cause of action because the petition for writ of mandamus failed to state a cause of action upon which relief may be granted. The City further argues that the trial court erred in denying its exception of prematurity because Plaintiffs failed to timely file an appeal of the City Council's August 9, 2018 decision, which denied their conditional use request. Lastly, the City requests that Plaintiffs be taxed with the court costs it incurred in defending the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Mandamus\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A writ of mandamus may be \"directed to a public officer to compel the performance of a ministerial duty required by law.\" La.

It argues that the motion simply directed the drafting of the proposed ordinance. The City claims that the proposed ordinance does not have the effect of law until it is adopted by a vote of majority of all members of the City Council pursuant to Sec. 3-112(10) of the Home Rule Charter. The City argues that the May 24, 2018 motion does not have the effect of law and merely allows more time for consideration. The City states that the vote to approve motion under CZO Sec. 4.3.D.4(c) does not obligate the vote for approval of an ordinance because such a legislative act is an exercise of discretion.

A vote to approve the May 24, 2018 motion does not legally bind the City Council to then affirmatively adopt an ordinance as final. Although the last sentence provides the City Council shall adopt the ordinance ratifying the decision within ninety days from the date it acted on the motion, the previous sentence provides the City Council\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n    adopt it after a minimum of twenty-one days from when the City Council approved the motion. Reading the sentences together and in reference to each other, as the rules of interpretation provide, we conclude that the last statement of the CZO Sec. 4.3.D.4(c), sets forth a time period for which the City Council must vote on a proposed ordinance and does not obligate that the City Council to accept it. Otherwise, the second sentence of CZO Sec. 4.3.D.4(c) giving the City Council discretion in which it may or may not adopt an ordinance would be superfluous. A vote to adopt or deny a proposed ordinance thus is within the City Council's discretion, contrary to Plaintiff's assertions, and thus is not a ministerial duty in which a mandamus could be issued.

Sec. 3-112(10) also states that no proposed ordinance shall be adopted except by the affirmative vote of a majority of all members of the City Council. These provisions further demonstrate the City Council's authority to accept or deny a proposed ordinance. The Home Rule Charter does not mandate the City Council affirmatively vote in favor of an ordinance.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Pursuant to the Home Rule Charter and the CZO, a vote of the City Council is discretionary and cannot be compelled by a writ of mandamus.

R.S. 13:4521(A)(1).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Here, there is no judgment taxing the City's court costs to Plaintiffs. Moreover, in\n    <em>\n     State, Dep't of Transp. &amp; Dev. v.

Additionally, under the provisions of the statute, an opposing party, such as Plaintiffs, is not necessarily required to pay the City's temporarily deferred costs absent a judgment dismissing the claims and taxing the costs of the state agency or political subdivision against it. Further, La. R.S. 13:4521(A)(1), references La. C.C.P. art. 1920, the article providing for the trial court assessment of costs.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n    Thus, it is within the discretion of the trial court to assess costs against the parties.

The City Council has the discretion to adopt and enact a proposed ordinance in zoning matters and thus it is not a ministerial act which can be compelled by writ of mandamus. The December 14, 2018 judgment of the trial court is therefore reversed. Further, the City's request for court costs is to be determined by the trial court. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's ruling and remand the case for assessment of court costs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    <strong>\n     REVERSED AND REMANDED\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"9\">\n    <p id=\"p-90\">\n     CZO Sec. 4.3.A provides the purpose of conditional use and states:\n    </p>\n    <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n     Within each zoning district, the use of land and structures are substantially uniform. However there are certain uses that, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified in certain districts without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the particular use at the particular location. These uses are allowed as conditional uses within the zoning districts. This section sets forth the standards used to evaluate proposed conditional uses and the procedures for approving conditional uses. The designation of a use in a zoning district as a conditional use does not constitute an authorization or assurance that such use will be approved.\n     <em>\n      No conditional use may be established\n     </em>\n     and no building permit may be issued for any use designated as a conditional use within a zoning district\n     <em>\n      until a conditional use ordinance is adopted by the City Council\n     </em>\n     and final drawings are submitted to and approved by the Executive Director of the City Planning Commission.

The failure to resolve a finding of incomplete or inaccurate information may be grounds for recommending denial. If the City Planning Commission fails to act by a vote of the majority of the Commission members, the application will be forwarded to the City Council without recommendation of no legal majority.
