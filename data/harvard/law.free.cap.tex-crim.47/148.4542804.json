The allegation is, that appellant \u201chas been convicted in this cause of unlawfully carrying a pistol.\u201d This is not sufficient. In order to charge an offense for violating the pistol law, it is necessary to allege one of the grounds that constitutes it's illegality, as carrying it on his person, about his person, etc. Unlawfully \u201ccarrying a pistol\u201d is not an offense against the laws of the state. It must be unlawfully carried on or about his person, etc. Because the recognizance does not recite that appellant was convicted of a misdemeanor, the motion is sustained. The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-12\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
