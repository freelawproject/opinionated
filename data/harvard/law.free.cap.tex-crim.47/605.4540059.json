The instrument alleged to be forged is in the following language: \u201cMr. Vaunghs that is all right i <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>have nothing to do with Jim port of his crope C. J. Cavno.\u201d It is alleged that this purports to be the act of T. J. Cavender. The following allegations are also found in the indictment: \u201cThe said Jim Williams was then and there a tenant of and working the farm and land of T. J. Cavender, and the said false instrument, meaning by \u2018Mr. Vaunghs\u2019 to be directed and addressed to Mr. Vaughn, and meaning by \u2018that is all right I have nothing to do with Jim part of his crop\u2019 that the said T. G. Cavender released his landlord\u2019s lien to the crop then and there planted and cultivated by the said Jim Williams upon the said land aforesaid and meaning by \u2018C. J. Cavno\u2019 to be T. G. Cavender, the said owner of the land as aforesaid.\u201d Motion was made to quash this indictment on several grounds, which, in our opinion, are well taken. It is.alleged this purports to be the. act of T. G. Cavender. It is alleged that appellant was working.the land of T. J. Cavender; and it was then and there intended that T. G. Cavender released his landlord\u2019s lien to the crop_ planted upon the land by appellant, and meaning by C. J. Cavno, to be T. G. Cavender. The innuendo and explanatory averments in this indictment it will be observed from the above are not sufficient. The names C. J. Cavno and T. G. Cavender are not sufficiently connected. Nor is any property rights alleged to be involved in such manner as to make this instrument the subject of forgery. The instrument itself purports to state to Mr. Vaughn that Cavno or Cavender, as the case may be, has nothing to do with \u2022 appellant\u2019s part of the crop. This does not necessarily affect the landlord\u2019s lien. The landlord\u2019s lien on the crop does not necessarily carry with it the furnishing of supplies or the relinquishment to Vaughn of any right the landlord may have had for advances. Nor is there anything in this indictment indicating such to be the case. The instrument does not purport to affect Cavender\u2019s interest in the rent; nor does it allege that there was any lien on this crop for advances, supplies or things of that sort. In other words, as we understand this indictment, it comes within the cases of Cagle v. State, 39 Texas Crim. Rep., 109; and Crawford v. State, 40 Texas Crim. Rep., 344. Without going into an elucidation of these cases, we are of opinion that, under the authorities cited, this indictment is not\" sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">A question of variance is also raised in regard to the instrument declared upon, and that introduced in evidence. It is not necessary here to repeat the instrument set out in the indictment above. That offered in evidence is in the following language: \u201cMr Vaungh tha is allright I have nothing to do with Jim par of his crope C. J. Cavno.\u201d A comparison between the instrument declared upon and that introduced in evidence will show the word \u201cthat\u201d following the name Vaungh has the letter \u201ct\u201d omitted from it; and the word \u201cpart\u201d following the name \u201cJim\u201d also omits the letter \u2018t.\u201d There are no innuendo or explanatory averments in the indictment, explaining these discrepancies. We are of opinion that there is a variance, and that the objection to the introduction of the original instrument is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Because the indictment does not sufficiently charge the offense, the judgment is reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
