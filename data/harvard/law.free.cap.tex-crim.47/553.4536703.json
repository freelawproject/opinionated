Appellant excepts to the following portion of the court\u2019s charge: \u201cThe defendant in a criminal case is presumed to be innocent until his guily established by legal evidence beyond a reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt you will acquit him and say by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>your verdict \u2018not guilty/\u201d The first part of the charge is rendered quite intelligible when we substitute the letter \u201ct\u201d for \u201cy\u201d in the word \u201cguilty.\u201d The latter clause of the charge is more favorable to appellant than the statute the judge was attempting to give the jury. Therefore, we hold there- was no such error as calculated to injure defendant\u2019s rights. The other questions raised by appellant are thoroughly discussed in Len Cantwell v. State, decided at present term. The facts are sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Davidson, Presiding Judge, absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
