Kees v. State, 7 Texas Ct. Rep., 67. In that case the recitation contained in the recognizance, was an aggravated assault, and we held that as that was an offense eo nomine, the recitation was sufficient instead of using the word \u201cconvicted of a misdemeanor\u201d as provided by statute. Here an attempt is made to set out the offense as shown above. It is described in the body of the recognizance \u201cviolating the local option law.\u201d There are several local option laws, and what particular one is not stated. The words used in this recognizance constitute neither an offense eo nomine under the statute, nor describe an offense. Therefore, the motion of the State must be sustained. Mitchell v. State, 7 Texas Ct. Rep., 71; Hannon v. State, 7 Texas Ct. Rep., 969; Horton v. State, 4 Texas Ct. Rep., 895; Leach v. State, 35 Texas Crim. Rep., 449. The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
