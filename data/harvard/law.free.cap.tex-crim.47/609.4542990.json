Appellant insists that the evidence is not sufficient to support the information, charging the \u201cunlawful playing of a game with cards\u201d not at a private residence. The only witness introduced on the trial testified, \u201cWe all met around and decided to have some fun and rounded up at the schoolhouse, and had a little game of poker.\u201d Poker is defined to be a game with cards\u2014see Webster Dictionary.
