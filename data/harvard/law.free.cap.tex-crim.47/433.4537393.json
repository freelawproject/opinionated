That he went to the place of Joe Brooks that night and met him and also defendant who first attempted to hide. That Brooks claimed to have bought the hog from defendant. The defendant\u2014after witness had told him, he might just- as well come out, that he was going to see who he was\u2014came to where Brooks and witness were, and witness had a conversation with him, and asked him why he had killed his hog, and defendant said he did not intend to kill him, but intended to kill Jackson\u2019s hog. Witness then went into the house of Brooks and found the head of the hog which had his mark, the balance of the hog was in a pot cooking. Afterwards, on the same night, Joe Brooks, Nathan Jackson and defendant came to witness\u2019 house for a compromise, and defendant came into witness\u2019 room and said that if witness would not \u201cpull\u201d him, he would pay him until he was satisfied, and admitted that he had gotten witness\u2019 hog. Joe Brooks testified that defendant sold him the hog and said he got him from his mother.

A. Bulloch &amp; B. B. </em>Beaired, for appellant, on motion for rehearing.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvT\">My contention is that this charge is so framed that the jury are not allowed to pass upon the commission of the offense, and that it tells the jury the quantum of proof necessary upon the facts, and does not only attempt to define the word corroborate, but goes further and gives them a criterion by which they must measure the amount of evidence that would be sufficient to convict the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-5\">The court will note that the crucial test in this case was whether or not appellant at the instance of one Brooks had stolen this hog, without the knowledge that the hog did not belong to Brooks, or whether he did it in conjunction with Brooks; and the overwhelming testimony of all the witnesses for the defendant'contradicting the State\u2019s witnesses in nearly every material matter, it is doubly essential that after the jury had returned to the court, not being able to agree, for further instructions, that the court should have been extremely careful about the language used in the charge.

By \u2018corroborate,\u2019 as so used, is meant that the corroborating evidence, to be sufficient, must of itself and without the aid of the accomplice testimony, tend in some degree to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense for which he is on- trial; but it need not be sufficient of itself to establish his guilt. It must tend directly and immediately to connect the defendant with the commission of the offense, and be as to a material matter.\u201d This charge is correct. Jones v. State, 4 Texas Crim. App., 529; Roach v. State, 8 Texas Crim. App., 478; Chambers v. State, 44 S. W. Rep., 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">Appellant also insists the court erred in refusing his special charge, as follows: \u201cIf you should believe that at the time defendant shot and killed the hog in question, he had a legal and lawful right to kill said hog, or honestly then and there had an honest belief in his mind that he had such legal and lawful right, and did not intend to steal said hog; or if you have a reasonable doubt whether he intended to steal said hog or not, then in that case you should acquit defendant.\u201d So far as applicable this charge was covered by the main charge of the court.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b455-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>[Motion for rehearing overruled without a written opinion.\u2014Reporter.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b455-2\">Appellant -insists in his motion for new trial that his rights were greatly prejudiced before the jury by the fact that one of the State\u2019s witnesses was called before the court, in the presence and hearing of the jury who tried defendant, and fined by the court in such manner and at such time, as in view of the fact that said witness finally testified in favor of defendant, j^et with a discredit upon him as having disobeyed the process of the court, to the injury of the rights of defendant. In this there was no error. The court has the right to fine witnesses, whether for the defense or the State, for disobedience of process. However, there is no bill presenting this matter, nor is it otherwise verified.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-3\">Appellant insists the evidence does not support the verdict of the jury. We hold the evidence is ample, and the corroboration of the accomplice, concede him to be an accomplice, is complete. No error appearing, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
