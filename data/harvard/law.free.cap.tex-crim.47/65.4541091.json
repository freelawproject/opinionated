The recognizance reads * * * \u201cconditioned that the said John Allen, who has been counseled in the County Court of Tarrant County, Texas, this case of a misdemeanor, and his punishment assessed,\u201d etc. The word \u201ccounseled\u201d should be \u201cconvicted\u201d as prescribed by the form in article 887, Code of Criminal Procedure. So as the recognizance does not make it appear that appellant had been convicted, in our opinion the motion is well taken. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
