Kid Kinney, said cause then and there legally pending by informations, the said Kid Kinney was then and there legally convicted of the same offense and an offense of the same nature as the one hereinbefore charged against him, on to wit: the 5th day of September, A. D., 1903, contrary to the form of the statute,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-14\">This is a companion case to that of Kinney v. State, 79 S. W. Rep., 570, where it was held that the second count above was defective. While there is no statement of facts in this record, yet we are bound to conclude, from the punishment assessed by the jury, that the trial court charged the jury article 1014, Penal Code, authorizing cumulative punishment, and the conviction was had under this count. Before this could be done a valid indictment in this particular should have been filed as held in Kinney v. State, supra. The first count in this indictment is good. The judgment is accordingly reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-15\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
