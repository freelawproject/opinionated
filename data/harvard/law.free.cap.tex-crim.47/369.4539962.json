Such a remark, as that attributed to the county attorney, may have been directed to defendant\u2019s counsel, may have been very properly addressed to him in argument, and the challenge to him to furnish from the record some explanation of appellant\u2019s innocence. In the absence of some showing in the bill that State\u2019s counsel referred to appellant in said remark, we do not feel authorized to presume that he referred to him or to his failure to testify in the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\">In the motion for new trial, appellant assigns as error the failure of the court to limit the testimony with regard to the Sayers\u2019 horse. There was some testimony from the witness Bob Miller with regard to the fact that Sayers came to the city pound and identified one of the horses that Bob Miller had carried there from the Arizona saloon. There is no testimony, so far as we are advised, that this horse, claimed by Sayers, was stolen from him; while the court is required to limit contemporaneous theft, yet there must be some testimony showing such contemporaneous theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">It is also objected in motion for new trial, that witness Sayers was permitted to testify to the theft and recovery of his horse, as shown in bill of exceptions number 1. There is no such bill in the record, and there is nothing showing that Sayers testified to the thefb of that horse.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Appellant complains of the refusal of the court to give in charge to the jury his special requested charge number 1. This charge, as appears from the record, relates to the statement made by the county attorney in his closing argument as before referred to; and under the view heretofore expressed with reference to said argument, it was not necessary for the court to charge on that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Mor do we think the court was required to charge with reference to any explanation. The fact that appellant may have told witness Gorman, that some other person would have to make a bill of sale of the horse did not require a charge on that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">The court\u2019s charge on the failure of defendant to testify is also complained of. While the court might have gone farther and instructed the jury that no reference or allusion could be made to the same, yet it is not shown that any such reference was made to his failure to testify. So, the charge, though not as full as the statute, does not suggest reversible error. There being no error in the record, the judgment is affirmed. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
