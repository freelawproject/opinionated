Appellant was charged of an aggravated assault, alleged to have been committed on his wife. The State introduced his wife as a witness. She testified that appellant did not assault her. The State then introduced Mrs. Gale, a neighbor, who testified that prosecutrix (appellant\u2019s wife), came to her house on the morning of the alleged assault, and told her that appellant had struck her with a piece of stove wood, and showed her the wound on her person. That she said her husband inflicted it. Whether this testimony was res gestse of the transaction the statement of facts does not disclose. Appellant testified in his own behalf. He denied in toto the assault, and testified in substance as did his wife.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AX1\">There are two questions presented. First, appellant objected to the testimony of Mrs. Gale, because it was hearsay; but he did not reserve a bill of exceptions. The statement of facts shows, however, that he did except to this testimony on this ground. Appellant obtained an order allowing him twenty days in which to file statement of facts and bills of exceptions. The question is, under the statute of the last Legislature, premitting bills of exception to be filed twenty days after adjournment of the court, does it authorize the reserving of exception to the admission of testimony, when noted in the statement of facts filed after adjournment, but within the twenty days allowed by law. This question has not been decided by this court; and the State here asks the court to pass upon this statute in this regard.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b195-11\">HENDEESON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AFs\">Appellant was convicted of a misdemeanor. During the progress of the trial appellant reserved the following bill of exceptions, which appears in the statement of facts, and is a part thereof. When the witness Mrs. Talbot Gill was on the stand, she was asked about a conversation which occurred between Mrs. Walter Martin, wife of appellant (and who was charged with having made the assault on her, which occurred on that morning and at the home of witness, about a mile from where said assault occurred), what Mrs. Martin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>should have told her on said occasion, about appellant assaulting her. To which the witness replied, \u201cShe told me that Walter (meaning defendant) hit her with a piece of stove wood that morning. She took her dress off her shoulder and showed me the wound. The wound was about five inches long and two inches wide. It was right fresh. The skin was broken, and it was bleeding. \u2022 Blood had run through her dress. She said that Walter wanted a clean shirt that morning; that she had washed the shirt the evening before, and it was not dry that morning, and he got mad and hit her with a piece of stove wood.\u201d This was objected to by defendant on the ground that it was hearsay. The State suggests, in reply to the appellant\u2019s contention, that this bill of exceptions was filed after term time, although within twenty days allowed for filing bills of exception authorized by the 28th Legislature; (see acts 28th Leg. p. 32) yet the same is a part of the statement of facts and not a separate bill of exceptions, and the statute contemplates a separate bill. We do not agree to this contention. Before the passage of the law above referred to, it was competent to take a bill of exceptions in connection with the statement of facts. It seems to us, that the same rule would apply, when the time for filing bills of exceptions was enlarged. The language of the statute is broad enough to apply to this view. It is also suggested that this evidence might be res gestas, as the witness stated appellant\u2019s wife was excited and she was crying and the wound was fresh. The particular time when the alleged assault is said to have occurred is not shown in the bill of exceptions, but the bill of exceptions shows, that appellant\u2019s wife had evidently walked about a mile from appellant\u2019s home, where the testimony shows the offense occurred. We think enough is disclosed to indicate, that it was too remote to constitute the testimony a part of the res gestee. Besides, it appears to have been introduced as 'original testimony, without regard to its being a part of the res gestee. We do not think that the evidence was admissible. This is the only testimony in the case that inculpates appellant in the alleged assault on his wife. They both denied that any assault was committed. Because there is no legal testimony supporting the verdict, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Davidson, Presiding Judge, absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
