The conviction was for rape, the punishment being assessed at five years confinement in the penitentiary. The State\u2019s case is made out by the testimony of the prosecutrix and Mary Jones. The prosecutrix (step-daughter of appellant) testified to the sexual intercourse; and Mary Jones testified that she saw them commit the act. The first bill of exceptions is reserved to the introduction of the testimony of the witness Underwood, who stated that he asked prosecutrix, If Mack Humphrey was guilty. She replied, \u201cyes.\u201d When defendant heard this answer he made no reply, but bowed his head. This bill was refused by the court, and there the matter ended. While the same witness was testifying, he was permitted to state that when he went to the house of appellant his wife was crying. This was shortly after the transaction. This bill is explained as follows: \u201cJim Underwood had testified that defendant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>his wife, together with the assaulted party and other people, were in the room when he got there, and defendant was sitting in the door with his head bowed, and his wife was crying.\u201d Objection was urged that no act or statement of the wife of defendant could be used in evidence against appellant. As this bill is presented, we believe thiif exception is well taken. The fact that the wife was crying was an indication on her part, if it meant anything, that it was her opinion that appellant was guilty. This called for no response from appellant. It was the act of his wife indicating her feelings in regard to the matter, and was a circumstance which conveyed to the jury the idea that she believed in her husband\u2019s guilt. This is a different proposition from that which might be predicated upon a statement of the wife to the husband in the presence of third parties of a criminating nat\u00fare, for that would call for a reply from him, and it would not have been the wife being forced to testifj7, but it would be another witness testifying to acts or conversations occurring between the parties. The act of crying called for no response or reply from the defendant and none was made. We believe the introduction of this testimony was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-3\">While the same witness was testifying, he was permitted to state as follows: \u201cI said, \u2018What is the matter?\u2019 Angelina Wooten said, in answer to my question, \u2018Hack has ravished Eunice.\u2019 \u201d This bill is explained by the court, as follows: \u201cThere had been no testimony introduced showing or tending to show that defendant was under arrest when the question was asked and Angelina Wooten said, \u2018Hack has ravished Eunice.\u2019 Testimony of Tim Underwood further showed that defendant was present when the statement was made, and he made no denial of the charge but bowed his head.\u201d We believe this testimony was admissible. The same may be said of the testimony of the same witness as contained in bill number four.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
