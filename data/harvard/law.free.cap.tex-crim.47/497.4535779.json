Tried below before Hon. G. P.

He testified that Heath and others would call for cider, but the liquor handed them over the bar by appellant was whisky and not cider. That he paid for the same. The other witnesses contradict him, but it was the jury\u2019s province to pass upon the credibility of the witnesses. They evidently believed Heath and disbelieved the other witnesses. The jury having settled this issue of fact, this court will not disturb their finding.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b517-17\">BROOKS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ASl\">Appellant was convicted of violating the local option law, and his punishment assessed at a fine of $50 and twenty-five days confinement in the county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-18\">Bill of exceptions number 1 complains of the action of the court requiring appellant to answer on cross-examination, over his objections, that at the time of the alleged sale, he had United States Internal Bevenue liquor and malt license. The objection being that it was compelling defendant to testify against himself; and that it was proving the contents of the Internal Bevenue license by secondary evidence, when no effort had been made to procure the license. When a defendant takes the stand, he waives his constitutional right, and can be forced to testify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>against himself about any matter germane to that he \"testified on direct examination. Nor do we think it a valid objection to defendant answering the question, that it is not the best evidence. He certainly knew whether or not he had the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Bill number 2 shows that defendant propounded to witness, James Cordial, on direct examination, the following question: \u201cWhether or not you know defendant did or did not sell John Heath, at the time you speak of being in defendant\u2019s place of business, any intoxicating liquor.\u201d To which interrogatory, witness would have answered, \u201cI know he did not. ' The State objected on the ground that it was the opinion of the witness, and was leading. This bill is qualified in this manner, \u201cthat when the objection was sustained, defendant\u2019s counsel was directed by the court to so interrogate the witness to get him to state what\" was said and done by and between defendant and the witness, John Heath, at the time.\u201d This was proper. There was no error in the ruling of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Bill number 3 shows that defendant propounded on direct examination to the witness James Cordial, this question: \u201cState whether or not during the time you speak of, John Heath being in defendant\u2019s place of business, there was any conversation between John Heath, yourself, and defendant in regard to defendant selling John Heath any whisky, and if so state all such conversation, what each said.\u201d The State objected on the ground that the question was immaterial, too general, irrelevant, self-serving, and called for the opinion of witness, and was leading. The witness would have answered, \u201cJohn Heath asked myself and Vance to take a drink with him, and asked the defendant if he had anything stronger than 'teetotal,\u2019 to which defendant said he had no whisky, and if he had would not sell it to you nor give it to you (witness Heath).\u201d The court sustained the objection. This bill is approved with the qualification, \u201cThat defendant was permitted to show by witness James Cordial, what was said and done by and between witness John Heath and defendant, while said Heath was in defendant\u2019s place of business on the occasion referred to in this bill.\u201d This qualification eliminates appellant\u2019s objections, and renders harmless the supposed erroneous ruling of the court. No error appearing in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
