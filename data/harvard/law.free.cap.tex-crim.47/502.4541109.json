There is no bill of exceptions nor statement of facts in the record. The only question presented is, does the information sufficiently charge an offense. It alleges that appellant \u201cdid then and there unlawfully, in the presence and hearing of B. E. Daughertjq curse and swear, and abuse said Daugherty <em>in a manner </em>reasonably calculated to provoke a breach of the peace.\u201d The language of the statute is, <em>\u201cunder circumstances </em>reasonably calculated,\u201d etc., instead of <em>\u201cin a manner\u201d. </em>The contention is that \u201cin a manner\u201d is not equivalent to the statutory requirement. While we do not believe it' is equivalent, that is, the terms are not exactly synonymous, still, \u201cin a manner calculated to provoke a breach of the peace,\u201d is tantamount to the allegation of \u201cunder circumstances,\u201d and in our opinion is the statement or allegation of the circumstance which the State would be required to prove, and could prove no other circumstance than the one in which the abusive language was used; that is, the State would be confined to that allegation. In our opinion the information is sufficient. There being no error in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
