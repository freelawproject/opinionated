Relator was convicted and appealed to the county court, and was again convicted in said court and copies pro fine issued upon said judgment of the county court, by which process he was held when he sued out a writ of habeas corpus before the district court; contending that the judgment of the county court is void because the justice court alone has exclusive jurisdiction to try all misdemeanors, where the fine imposed does not exceed $200; and the corporation court had no jurisdiction to try relator, and the appeal conferred no jurisdiction on the county court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-3\">Relator contends that the law under which he was prosecuted is unconstitutional.

The only question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>involved in this application is the constitutionality of the corporation court act. Among other things it is seriously contended that said act is unconstitutional because it is an infringement of the Constitution in taking some of the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace court. The question here presented was thoroughly discused in Ex parte Wilbarger, 41 Texas Crim. Rep., 514; and it was there held that the corporation court act was constitutional. In accordance therewith the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-3\">\n<em>Affirmed-.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">Brooks, Judge, absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
