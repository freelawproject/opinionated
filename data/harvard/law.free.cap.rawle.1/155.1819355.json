He then settled with the tenants for the rent in arrear, and received the rents from that time until his death in 1819.

The sale was illegal and void, 1.'

By the <em>Venditioni Exponas, </em>he was commanded to sell the rent charge; instead of which he advertised and sold the ground out of which it issued, for which alone the deed was made. It was never supposed by the purchasers that the ground rent passed by this deed. They always considered themselves as having purchased the lot. If they acquired no title to the land, either in consequence of irregularity in the proceedings or because it had been sold to <em>Peale, </em>before <em>Brownjohn\u2019s </em>judgment was obtained, it was their misfortune. Like all other purchasers at sheriff\u2019s sale, they come within the operation of the rul\u00e9 of <em>caveat emptor. Freedly </em>v. <em>Sheets, </em>9 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>156. There is nothing in the deed -descriptive of the rent charge, and consequently it did not pass. If there be error in the description of the thing intended to be granted, nothing will pass. 1 <em>Com. Big. Fait. </em>286, <em>note. </em>In a sheriff\u2019s deed nothing passes und\u00e9r the general clause. 13 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>537, 551. It is void.for uncertainty. <em>Id. </em>'97. Under .the general grant, therefore, of all the rights, liberties, &amp;c., the rent did not pass. It would not, under such a description, in any' deed; and still less in a .sheriff\u2019s deed, under which the purchaser takes nothing, but what is fully and accui\u2019ately described.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-10\">The plaintiff\u2019s claifn is founded upon a covenant supposed to run with the land. An assignee is undoubtedly bound by a covenant which runs with the land; but for this purpose, there must be privity of estate between the parties. 1 <em>H. Bl. Rep. </em>562. 3 <em>Salk. </em>4. In this case there was no privity of estate. The plaintiff\u2019s testator was never seized Of the rent. He never even claimed it until the year 1812, although the sheriff\u2019s deed bor\u00e9 date in 1799. If it be said that the defendant below recognized his title by .paying him the rent, the answer is, that he was misled by Mr. <em>Fisher\u2019s </em>declara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>tion that he was the assignee of <em>Charles Hurst, </em>and'that his title had been confirmed by the court. The payments were made under a misapprehension of the facts, and therefore cannot affect him.. <em>Phill. Ev. </em>479, 480. Payment of rent is evidence' of seizin, only where the party receiving it has a right of entry. 4 <em>Davis\u2019s Abt., </em>29. Privity of interest, and not the payment of rent, is the true test of who is .the landlord. <em>Coleman\u2019s Cases, </em>50.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-5\">The defendants in. error have an ejectment pending for the lot itself, and, therefore, cannot support this action of covenant for the rent charged upon the lot. The parties to both these suits- are the same; for although in the ejectment the executors of <em>Miers Fisher </em>are plaintiffs, they are by his will the trustees,of the devisees; A man cannot have two writs for the same cause of action at the same time. 1 <em>Bac.

Sergeant, </em>(with whom was <em>Price,) </em>for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Af5\">In the decision of this case, two questions are involved. 1st. Can a purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale, to whom a ground rent has been conveyed by the sheriff\u2019s deed, maintain an action of covenant against the assignee of the land out of which- the rent issues?</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-7\">2d. Was <em>Miers Fisher </em>such a purchaser; or, in other words, did he acquire a title to. the ground rent in question by virtue of the levy, <em>Venditioni Exponas, </em>sale, and sheriff\u2019s deed?</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-8\">1st, The deed from <em>Hurst </em>to <em>Peale </em>contains a covenant between the grantor, his heirs and assigns, and the grantee, his heirs and assigns,-for the payment of the rent by the latter to the former. A purchaser at sheriff\u2019s, sal\u00e9 is an assignee in law, and becomes a party to the covenant By the law of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>such a' purchaser becomes invested with all the legal rights of the defendant in the' execution, discharged of all secret trusts. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Painter, </em>5 <em>Serg. &amp; 5 Rawle, </em>223. If the debt be paid before execution, the purchaser\u2019s title is not affected by that circumstance. <em>Samms v. Alexander, </em>3 <em>Yeates, </em>268. An assignee by act of law has the benefit of all covenants express or implied; which run with' the land, though such assignee be not named; and a covenant to pay rent runs with the land. <em>Shep. Touch. Ch. </em>7, <em>p. </em>572, 574. 5 <em>Coke. </em>17. <em>Appowel </em>v. <em>Monnoux, Moore\u2019s Rep. case </em>241, <em>p. </em>97. <em>Hurst </em>v. <em>Lithgrow, </em>2 <em>Yeates, </em>25.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-10\">2d. In determining whether <em>Fisher </em>was an assignee of the rent, his character is to be regarded, first at law, and secondly in equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-11\">1. At law. The first step in his title was a <em>Fieri Facias, </em>levied upon the ground rent in question. The second, a <em>Venditioni Ex-ponas </em>for the sale! of the same ground rent. The third, an <em>Mias Venditioni Exponas, </em>having the same object; and the fourth, a <em>Pluries Venditioni Exponas, </em>commanding .the sheriff to sell the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>rent; under which he sold the lot by the same description as was contained in .the levy. That his official intention was\u2019 to sell the\u2019 rent charge, is deducibl\u00e9 from the authority under which he acted. He recites .the levy and all the proceedings in relation to the rent, and declares that he sold in pursuance of them; and though the deed describes the lot, yet it must be taken' in connexion with the proceedings upon which it was founded, and be. considered as. a conveyance, of the thing intended to be sold. The whole of the proceedings constitute one conveyance. But the instrument itself contains enough to pass the rent. It conveys lot No. 20, with all the rents, &amp;c. The conveyance of the land, embraces all minor interests in' it. The settled rules relative to the construction of deeds, will serve as guides to a decision of this case. A deed, and particularly a deed poll, must be construed most strongly'against the grantor; and if it canr not operate in the manner intended by the parties, it will be construed so that it shall operate in some other'manner. Spencer, C. J., in <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Blodget, </em>16 <em>Johns. </em>178. <em>Shep. Touch. </em>82, 83. <em>Co. Litt. </em>302. A deed shall be so interpreted, that it shall, if possible, take effect, <em>ut res magis valeat quampereat. Co. Litt. </em>183, 186. 2 <em>Saund. </em>96, <em>b. note </em>1. A deed is never void, if by any construction it can be made good. Thus a grant' at common law, or a bargain and sale, may operate as a covenant to stand seized. A feoffment will operate in the same manner. Where the words of a deed may be applied to any intent, it shall not be void. <em>Shep. Touch. Ch. 5, sec. 2. Exposition of Deeds. Plowd. </em>160. Another rule is, that where a man grants more than he has, all that he has shall pass. Shep, <em>Touch. Ch. </em>3, <em>sec. </em>2, <em>rule </em>58. If these rules be applied to the facts of the case, the sale will be found good. Where there is enough in a deed to designate what is meant to be conveyed, the addition of circumstances, false or mistaken, will not vitiate it. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>7 <em>Johns. 217, </em>224. The case of <em>Jackson </em>v. Loomis, 18 <em>Johns. </em>81, in which the words <em>\u201c </em>Lot No. 51,\u201d were rejected as surplusage, closely resembles this, in which the mistake was, the omission to insert the words \u201c ground rent issuing out of,\u201d the lot which was properly described. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-5\">The words of the instrument in themselves pass the rent., If A. grants all his lands, qnd tenements in D.,' and has nothing there but a rent charge, that will pass. 2 <em>Roll. Ab. </em>57. <em>Grant: T. 6. A </em>devises to B. all his larids in D. and has nothing there but tithes; the tithes pass. .1 <em>Boll. Jib. </em>164. <em>Devise, N. 4. </em>It is settled in Pennsylvania, that the term <em>\u201cland\u201d </em>includes every secondary and derivative interest connected with'it, such as a.rent charge. <em>Shaupe v. Shaupe, </em>12 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>12. If a sheriff\u2019s deed purport to convey a fee, and the defendant had only an estate for life, that passes. 1 <em>Cowen\u2019s Rep. </em>470. So if it purport to convey a share of a join-tenant greater than he had, what he had will pass. 14 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>404. 4 <em>Yeates. </em>111.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-6\">2. As to equity. The levy and writs were the power under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>which the sheriff acted. The deed was the formal execution of that power; which having been defectively performed, equity will aid it <em>Madd. Ch. </em>47. <em>Sugden on Vend. </em>523. The purchasers having paid a valuable consideration, a court of equity would correct the mistake in the conveyance; for the consideration is the substance of the conveyance, and all the rest mere form. <em>Vowel on Powers., </em>161, 163, 165. The debtor has received all the benefit of the sale; has assented to the transfer of his interest; the purchase money has gone to pay his debts; he has never moved to set aside the sale, and it cannot now be disturbed. A sheriff\u2019s sale of land on a judgment against an executor <em>de son tort, </em>is void, yet those who stand by and encourage it, are bound by it. <em>Nass </em>v. <em>Vanswearingen, </em>10 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle, </em>144. So if property be not included in a levy, if the debtor represent it as included, the purchaser will hold it. <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>13 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle, </em>304, 306. \u00edf a party having title stand by and see the property sold as another\u2019s, he cannot after-wards set up his own title. <em>Covert </em>v. <em>Irwin, </em>3 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle, </em>283. <em>Hurst, </em>therefore, and all those who claim under him, are conclusively estopped to deny the\u2019 plaintiffs\u2019 title. Even if the mistake could have been corrected before the acknowledgment of the sheriff\u2019s deed, it is too late now, after the lapse of 20 years, which cures all irregularities in judicial proceedings. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Skinner, </em>7 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>556.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-5\">As to the objection founded upon the pendency of the ejectment for the lot itself, it is answered by saying, that it.is not between the parties to this suit. The executors of <em>Miers Fisher, </em>and not his deyisees, are the plaintiffs. If, too, there be any thing in the objection, it should have been pleaded in abatement. 1 <em>Chitty Pl. </em>443. <em>Percival </em>v. <em>Hicky, </em>18 <em>Johns. </em>257. Besides, it is only one of three concurrent remedies, distress, covenant, and re-entry. <em>Bantleon </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>2 <em>Binn. </em>146, 153. <em>Chipman </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>13 <em>Johns. </em>244,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-6\"><em>P. Jl. Browne, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ap_\">A stranger cannot sue on a covenant in a deed. To support an action, the plaintiff must be a party to the instrument, unless he be an assignee suing upon a covenant running with the land. But he must, in that case, be an assignee in the legal acceptation of the term. Even where a party comes in by act of law, he is not necessarily such an assignee. 2 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>75, <em>Covt. E. </em>The rules of construction relied upon in the opposite argument do not apply to a case like this. They refer entirely to sales-between parties, and do not apply to judicial sales. The reason of the rule that deeds are to be taken most sti\u2019ongly against the gi\u2019antor, does not ex-' ist as to the deed of a sheriff. He has no interest in the property, and ixo motive to look into those matters which concern other grantors. Is it to be consti-ued most strongly against the debtor? The policy of <em>Pennsylvania </em>has been to protect the debtor; hence the extension of the property, if the rents, issues, and profits, will pay in seven years; hence personal property must be taken into execution before real, and the mansion house sold last. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>The rule that if a deed cannot operate in one way it shall in another,,is likewise confined to deeds'between parties. A Sheriff\u2019s deed cannot operate as a release or confirmat'i\u00f3rt. He can sell only in' the manner prescribed by law;,-and his deed can operate only as a grant) because the law only give\u00a7\u2019 him-power to grant. The cases .cited against us are not in point. In that in 18 <em>Johns. </em>81, there was a mistake in calling the property.No.' 51, instead of No 50; but the description was so perfect without the number, that there could be no uacertainty about it. No one was or could be taken by surprise',. The\" ease, in 14 <em>Mass. R. </em>404, vyas decided on the principle, that no one could be injured by sustaining the sale. Besides; the description was full arid correct, and though the deed could not operate to pass the whole estate it purported to pass, yet it was held to operate to the extent of the estate the party had.- \u25a0 .</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-5\">The pendency of the ejectment is a fatal obstacle .to the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery. A party cannot claim in inconsistent rights. He -cannot elaim both the rent apd the land. It is not the c\u00e1se of concurrent remedies for the-same thing; but,of inconsistent and contradictory claims, which cannot subsist togelher. It was not necessary to take advantage of this objection by a pica in abatement. It may be pleaded either in bar or in abatement. 5 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>439. <em>Pleas and Pleadi</em>ng.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b161-6\">Huston, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AJ9\">(after stating the facts,) delivered th,e opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Several objections taken to, the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery were very properly passed over by their concluding counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">The statute 32 <em>Hen. </em>8- is reported by the judges to extend to this state, and, in fact, has been always in use here. Soon after its passage, a construction was put on it which has got beep .varied. Collateral covenants, such as do not relate to or depend on the land demised, are not within it; but covenants, which touch or relate to the land demised, run with the land, and bind the assignee, and the assignee of an assignee, the assignee of an executor, or heir or devisee, or whoever is terretenant of the land under the demise, whether coming in by assignment or act of law; and the lessor, and all claiming under or through him) are equally bound, and equally entitled with the lessee, and those claiming under or through him. He to whom a lease for years' is sold, is within it. 5 <em>Co. </em>162, (the whole of that case.) <em>Shep. Touch. Ch. </em>7, 176, 179. And the only difference in the liabilities of the original parties, and those coming after them,, is, that covenant lies generally against the original party after his interest is parted with; assignees are generally answerable for breaches within their own time; and when the books say, no stranger can take advantage of a covenant, if by covenant is meant a covenant real respecting land, or leases, it is to\" be understood that whoever is privy in contract or in tenure, is not a stranger. A stranggr is one wno claims under another title, adverse or paramount.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Another objection is-made, on account of the difference between the levy and the deed. This difference is as to the interest of <em>C. Hurst </em>in the lot; not as to the description of the lot, in which that interest is. The lot is well described; but the levy is on \u00e1 rent charge, though the deed conveys the. land itself, \u00f3r purports to convey it.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">. What passes by a deed from -the grantor to a grantee has .been, often discussed, and, it would seem, ought to be considered settled'. Courts will- not, if.it can be avoided, suffer a deed to be inoperative, when fairly made,-and on good and legal consideration; and, if the form used will not operate as the parties-intended, it shall have effect in some other way, if possible. Thus a deed intended as a release, may taire effect as a grant of a reversion; an attornment, or a surrender <em>ef converso. Shepherd\u2019s Chap, of Exposition of Deeds, </em>and 2. <em>Saunders, </em>94. Indeed, it has been very properly conceded, that if <em>Charles Hurs f </em>after selling to <em>Peale, </em>reserving this rent, charge and a right of entry to enforce it,-had afterwards sold a second time, all that <em>Hirst </em>could sell, viz. the rent charge and right of entry, would have passed. But it is contended, that such is not the effect of.a judicial sale, on execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">A rent charge, or any other legal or equitable interest in lands,, may in this state be sold on execution. 1 <em>Yeates, 429, Shaupe </em>v. <em>Shaupe, 12 Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>12.. Generally, the levy will control all the subsequent proceedings: it is the foundation on which all is built. There may be difficulty, where the 'sale is more extensive than the levy,1 if the' objection is by the purchaser, and in proper time; for he may be affected. So there may be an objection by the .defendant in the execution, if the advertisement does not conform to the levy; but, if the plaintiff and defendant-in the execution, and all judgment creditors acquiesce, if the purchaser does not object, on what principle can a third person be' heard at the end of thirty years, or why does he complain of an irregularity, which does not, and cannot affect him? The rent charge is due.' The heirs of <em>Hurst </em>do not, and could not now claim'it. But on principle, and on authority, tlie sale-was good from the time the deed was made and accepted. Before, or, under -some circumstances, shortly after, the defendant or the purchaser might have objected. After payment of the money, and acquiescence, neither could.. Where the sale purports to convey the whole interest of the defendant in the execution, any and every interest he has will pass; at least, where, it is not greater th.an described ;!and even if greater, and the defendant knew, of the sale and did not take exception, and have his interest properly described. So in other states. 1 <em>Conn. Rep. 470. </em>14 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>404.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The whole interest of <em>Charles Hurst </em>passed by this sale and deed, and the plaintiffs below are in law assignees of <em>Charles Hurst, </em>and can support this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">There is nothing in the objection of another suit pending. It is hot by the same parties; nor, so far as we see, for the same object!</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
