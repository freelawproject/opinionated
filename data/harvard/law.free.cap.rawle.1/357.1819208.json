The plaintiff objected to the plea being received, but the court overruled the objection. To this plea the plaintiff replied, that there was no release which released the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action in this suit; and further, that the'supposed release was obtained by fraud, misrepresentation, and undue influence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-12\">. On the trial, the plaintiff offered to prove.what articles of personal. property, belonging to the intestate, had come into the hands of Mrs. <em>M\u2018Lenachan. </em>The defendants objected to the evid\u00e9nce, and in support of their objection, produced the administration account of <em>John Good </em>and <em>Ann Bucher, </em>(now <em>Jtnn.M\u2018Lenachan,) </em>administrators of <em>Martin Bucher, </em>deceased, passed in the Orphans\u2019 Court on the 31st of May,-1819. <em>\u25a0 </em>But the court admitted .the evidence offered by the plaintiff, and, at the request of the. defendants\u2019 counsel., sealed a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>The plaintiff having given the evidence stated above, the defendants gave in evidence a release, bearing date the 19th of <em>September, </em>1825, from <em>Martin Bucher </em>(the-plaintiff,) and others, <em>to John Good, </em>.in-which they acknowledged to have respectively received from him, as .acting administrator of the estate of' <em>Martin Bucher, </em>deceased, the several sums of money therein specified, in full of their several and respective shares of the estate of the intestate, \u201cAgreeably to the supplementary account of the said <em>John Good, </em>as aeting administrator of the said intestate\u2019s estate, this day filed of record in the office of the register of wills, &amp;c., in and for the said county of <em>Lancaster, </em>and advertised for presentation to the Orphans\u2019 Court of the said county, on the third .Monday in <em>December </em>next, and all claims and demands, of what nature or kind soever, the same may be by us, or either of us, against him, the said <em>John Good, </em>for, or on account of the estate,.real and personal, or the proceeds of the estate, real \u00e1nd personal, of the said' <em>Martin Bucher, </em>deceased, or any part thereof, <em>save, and excepting, and always reserving our several and respective parts, shares, and proportions of the amount of rents due by James MiLenachan, and Ann, his wife, late, Ann Bucher, widow and relict of the said Martin' Bucher, deceased, for a certain farm in Dunmore township aforesaid, late part of the real estate of the said intestate, and purchased by him at public sale from the administrators of the said decedent\u2019s </em>estate, <em>Also, excepting and reserving our respective shares in the amount of a distillery, purchased by. the said James MlLenachan, and Ann, his wife, or one of them, or, kept by her at the appraised value, the amount of which is credited in the. former account settled on the said decedent's estate: and also, excepting and reserving our distributive shares in the balance of the purchase money of said farm', purchased by the said James MiLenachan, which claims are not hereby released; </em>and, therefore, we do hereby acquit, exonerate, release, and for ever discharge the said <em>John Good, </em>his heirs, executors and administrators of, and' from all actions, suits, claims, and demands whatsoever, for, or on account of the estate of the said <em>Martin Bucher, </em>deceased, or any part thereof; and hereby agree to make no objections to the passing of said supplementary .account before the Orphans\u2019 Court of, said county, being fully satisfied and. content therewith.\u201d The defendants also gave in evidence the administration accodnt of <em>John Good </em>and <em>Ann Bucher, </em>passed in the Orphans\u2019 Court on the 31st of <em>May, </em>1819, and the supplemental account referred to in the' release.

In answer to the <em>first </em>point of the plaintiff, and the <em>second </em>point of .the defendants, the court say, that the releases given in evidence in these cases, if fairly\" obtained, are a release and discharge in law,' of the defendants from all demands on the part of the plaintiffs for any part of the personal estate, except the articles called in the appraisement, and in the release, the distillery; which are expressly exempted out of the operation of the release. It is the opinion of the court, that the exceptions contained in the releases, are exceptions Out of the releasing covenants, and that, they do not discharge the defendants from any suit for any^matter contained in the said saving and excepting clause. In answer to the plaintiff\u2019s <em>second </em>point, the court say, that the inventory filed by the defendant and her co-administrator, <em>John Good, </em>is very high and satisfactory evidence, that all the goods mentioned therein, came to the hands of the administrators, and that the valuation set upon them is a fair and just one. But the court will not say, that ; the inventory is absolute, conclusive, and incontestable evidence of the value of the property.. If the jury believe the evidence, and are o\"f opinion that the defendant has not already accounted for the value of the articles mentioned, called the distillery, she is bound to answer for it now to the several.plaintiffs.in these causes, according to their several distributive shares thereof;\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-8\">To this charge the -counsel for .the. defendants excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ANK\"><em>ChampneyS, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9Z\">cited, 3 <em>Stark. </em>1751. <em>Dasher </em>v.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEN\"><em>In M'Fadden </em>v. <em>Geddis, </em>decided at the last term at this place, if was determined, against' the current of the former decisions, that the confirmation-of an'administration account is conclusive on the parties in an'action at law; and although I felt my<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>self bound by the authorities to dissent, I should be.sorry to see the decision disturbed .now, even if it were wrong on principle, which I do not admit. I take it, therefore, to be settled; that the confirmation of an administration -account, like any other decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court, cannot be re-examined but by way of review. But may not the parties so modify the balance as to' render it necessary to unravel the account, to give effect to their agreement? Here the persons beneficially entitled, had executed to on\u00e9 administrator, a release of every thing but certain.items, or constituent parts'of the estate, which were in the hands of the other administrator, and these were specially ex.cepted. Now, such a release is valid for the . same reason that a release of part of a verdict or judgment is valid. If then, it be competent to those who have released their interest in part of an estate, to reserve the benefit of what may be decreed to them in respect of the rest, it must also be competent to them to show, by extrinsic evidence, what those parts we.re. Here it was not proposed to open the decree, or vary the balance,, but to show -what part of the balance had-not been released; and this was in no respect inconsistent with the conclusiveness of the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The release, in general terms, exonerated the defendants\u2019 co-administrator from \u201call actions, claims, and demands whatever, for, or on account of the estate of the said <em>Martin Bucher, or any part </em>thereofand hericej it. is contended, that the administrators being jointly and severally bound, the bond is discharged as to both. At law, the release of one joint and several obligor, undoubtedly discharges all; but equity restrains all general and sweeping expressions which are inconsistent' with the actual intention. Of this, <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>6 <em>Johns. Ch. </em>242, is a remarkable instance, which, in its circumstances, bear some resemblance to the case at bar. There it was held, that the release of one of three guardians, reserving the responsibility of a surety in the guardianship bond, did not discharge the surety as to. the others. Now w.hat was the intention here? Clearly, as regards particular parts of the estate, to reserve the liability of the releasee himself. Why insert an express reservation of the defendants\u2019 liability in a deed to which he is not a party,'and the operative words of which, do not extend to him ? \u2022The instrument was evidently drawn by a layman; and had the parties known of the rule by which the release of one obligor discharges the other, they would also have known .that no reservation of theirs could frustrate it. -The intention undoubtedly was, notwithstanding the sweeping words in conclusion, .to reserve the excepted parts of the estate entirely'from the, release; \u00e1nd that being clear, neither the defendant nor- the other administrator, was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
