Stewart, </em>10 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, 224. </em>By adopting the legal form, no injustice will be the result, and but littl\u00e9 inconvenience, as the court will take care to protect the interest of the equitable owner. The object of the plaintiff would seem to be, to raise the question, whether the wife -w\u00e1s a trustee for the creditors, or takes the avails of the judgment in her own right, and this could have been as well attained <em>by </em>a suit in the \u00f1ame of the wife, .for the use of the administrators, who represent the creditors. , In relation to the merits, we take the rule to bo this; when a husband takes a joint obligation to himself and wife,, for a debt due to himself alone, it is \u00e1 gift to the wife, who' takes as a joint purchaser, and by survivorship, and in her Own right, unless the proceeds should be wanted on a deficiency of assets, for the payment of creditors or perhaps legatees. <em>Christ\u2019s Hospital </em>v. <em>Budgin and Wife, 2 Vernon, </em>683. The remedy is in chancery, which grants relief, because otherwise, the husband, by joining his wife in the security, might defraud his creditors. But when the wife is the meritorious cause of action, as in the case of a bond to her <em>dam sola </em>or .a lega-, cy, and the husband joins her in the security or suit, she' takes .by survivorship, and for her own use, although there may not be assets without this money, for the payment of debts or legacies. And the reason of the distinction is, that in the latter, although not in the former case, she has not only the legal title, but a superior equity, and the invariable principle, of a Court of Chancery,-is not to relieve against a leg\u00e1l title where the respondent lias an equal, or superior equity. The Chancellor simply refuses to interfere, and leaves the parties to their .legal rights. This always supposes, that the husband has not reduced the <em>chose in atition </em>into possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Waiving the want of proper parties, we will next consider this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>case on the demurrer. We -will in the first' place premise, that the demurrer admits only wh\u00e1t has been properly pleaded. The'plaintiff omits to aver in his declaration the insolvency of' Beale, and this we have seen is the only ground of relief, for equity interposes only in favour of creditors or perhaps legatees, 2 <em>vern. </em>683; and <em>non constat, </em>that the assets may not be abundantly sufficient to answer all legal demands of creditors-and legatees. The pleader seems to have been aware of this, for we find him endeavouring to remedy the defect in his declaration, by an averment in the joinder to the defendant\u2019s demurrer. This, to say the least of it, is a novel procedure, and was intended to make the defendant admit by the demurrer, what he never had an opportunity of traversing. The plaintiff, instead of concluding with a verification, which he is bound to do when he avers a new fact, closes th\u00e9 pleading-by praying judgment of the court, &amp;c. Having discovered the slip in the pleading, .the. course of the plaintiff was perfectly plain, by motion to the court for leave to amend his declaration; which; if they had thought proper to grant, they would at the same tim\u00e9 have permitted the defendant to withdraw or insist on his demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The plaintiff further avers an agreement between the defendant and. <em>Thomas Beale, </em>in his lifetime, that, as <em>Thomas Beale </em>was indebted to <em>David Gibson, </em>the defendant, one of the administrators of <em>Thomas Gibson, </em>in a\u2019sum greater than the amount of the debt and costs in the suit, <em>-David </em>would allow a credit to <em>Thomas\u2019 Beale, </em>for th.e sum of one hundred and thirty dollars arid ninety-one and a half cents., in part- payment of said debt. This allegation is made for the purpose of showing that <em>Thomas Beale, </em>.in his lifetime, reduced the judgment into possession. What purposes the plaintiff\u2019s counsel expected to answer by this averment it is difficult to conceive; for as the demurrer admits that such an agreement was made, if it had been executed, it would have been an insurmountable obstacle to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery; for it would have shown that the judgment, which is the foundation'of the'suit, was extinguished or satisfied. The plaintiff avers the contract, hut not the execution of the contract, and this in truth he could not do, as there is no doubt the contract was rescinded by the defendant in ' refusing to'give the credit, and by the plaintiff, in prosecuting this suit, which is in. disaffirmance of the. contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
