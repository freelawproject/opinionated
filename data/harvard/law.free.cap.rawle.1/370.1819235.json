The cause came into the Court of Common Pleas on an appeal by the defendant from the judgment of a justice; and the declaration was for <em>goods, chattels, </em>and <em>merchandise, </em>sold and delivered. The allegations of error, material to be stated, were, 1st, That when the plaintiff offered, to .prove, by <em>John Evans, \u201c </em>That on the 8th of <em>June, </em>1807, in pursuance of an order from <em>James Caldwell, </em>he delivered to <em>Robert Thompson, </em>the defendant\u2019s testator, three hundred bushels of wheat that was stored in his store-house, the property of <em>James Caldwell, </em>the plaintiff, and that the price of wheat- was then, one dollar and four cents a bushel; and also, that the defendant admitted the plainr tiff\u2019s account to be correct and right:\u201d the court overruled the evidence which-had been objected -to, on the ground, that it presented a totally different'cause of action from the one.decided by the justice. A balance only of forty dollars and interest, were claimed to be due on the sale of the wheat. \u25a0 .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-10\">\u2022 2d; The plaintiff then offered, in connexion with the proposed testimony of <em>John\u25a0 Evans, </em>the docket of the justice, now in the hands of his administrator, to show; that the return.of the justice upon the transcript, is not in conformity with the docket, and that stating the demand in the said transcript to be for a <em>chair, </em>is a mistake, as no sueh.de'mand is stated in .the docket. And, in connexion with that' evidence,- he also Offered' the affidavits of the plaintiff, and of <em>Boughman, </em>the administrator of the justice, to establish the mistak\u00e9, and then applied for permission to' amend the transcript of the justice by thfe. docket. All these matters were rejected by the court, and bills of exceptions taken thereupon. Among other things, it was alleged by the counsel for the defendant, that the docket entry itself, had been altered. The original transcript was as follows:\u2014 \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number><em>\u201cJames Caldive.ll, Esq. </em>v. <em>Andrew</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A2zH\"><em>T/iompson, </em>Executor <em>of James</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ApB\"><em>Thompson, </em>deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A_-\">Summons, on dem\u00e1nd not exceeding one hundred dollars; debt by book account for a <em>chair, </em>sixty-four dollars and fifty cents. The defendant appeared <em>July </em>27th, 1816. The constable not having notified the plaintiff^ continued to <em>July </em>27th. At 2 o\u2019clock the said da}?, the plaintiff appeared. On hearing, judgment for the plaintiff for sixty-four dollars and fifty cents, by default, the defendant not appearing, with costs of suit; <em>Judy </em>27th,'A; D. 1816; justice\u2019s fees sixty-two and a half cents, constable\u2019s seventy-five cents. \u201d \u25a0 . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-9\">The justice added to the original transcript as <em>follows:\u2014\u201cMistake; </em>defendant\u2019s testator\u2019s name is <em>Robert </em>instead1 of James, and is so stated on my docket,\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b371-10\"><em>Champneys, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtA\">contended, that by the act of 1806, by the law, as it stood before, and all the numerous decisions in this court, the amendment was proper; that, to reject it was error; and that to reject the evidence of <em>Evans </em>was also error. If there was any ground to imagine the docket to have been fraudulently, touched, that was a fact in the cause to be decided like other facts by the jury. He \u2019 referred to <em>Whart. Dig. Amendment, Letter E. Zeigler </em>v. <em>Fowler, 3 Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>238. <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>M\u2018Anulty, 3 Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>364. <em>Bechtol </em>v. <em>Cobaugh, </em>10 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>121. <em>Cochran </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>6 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>549.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b371-11\"><em>Parke </em>and <em>Porter, contra,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Auo\">argued for the defendant, in error, that in a case of most apparent erasure, it was correct to withhold-from the jury a doubtful, if not fraudulent entry,- contrary to the record and transcript in the cause. It was also right not to. suffer a hopeless-demand for \u00bfriding vehicle, called a chair, to be given up, and in lieu of it, an old charge for wheat, to be substituted against the estate of the testator. They cited <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Wait, </em>1 <em>Binn. </em>219. <em>Owen </em>v. <em>Shelmaher, </em>3 <em>Binn. </em>45. <em>M\u2018Laughlin </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>3 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>144. <em>Laird </em>v. <em>M\u2018Conachy, </em>3 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>290. <em>Stehley </em>v. <em>Harp, </em>5 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>544. <em>Cassell </em>v. <em>Cooke, </em>8 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>268, 287. <em>Farmers\u2019 and Mechanics\u2019 Bank </em>v. <em>Israel, </em>6 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>293. <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Musgrave, </em>2 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, 219.

From the decisions, another rule seems equally clear, that the mistakes, the slips of the pen of a, justice of the peace, may be, and ought to be corrected. But here, all mistake was denied.. It was insisted, there was nothing wrong, except in the docket offered; and, upon this head, divers matters were alleged on the one side and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>on the other. The court were to decide what were the true words of the record. It was not a question for the jury. And the court below haying settled it on inspection of' the docket and all the papers, arid affidavits, ought we to interfere, and upon disputed facts, rather than up.on any question of law,- to rev\u00e9rse the judgment? I think not. Much-must be left to the discretion of the court in which such applications are made. Taking all the evidence as it appears on the record, and the testimony offered from <em>John Evans, </em>and considering that the plaintiff\u2019s claim, for the' wheat was of nine years\u2019 standing when he brought his suit before the justice, after the death of the defendant\u2019s testator, it is not \u00e1 case in which,-in my opinion, the law calls upon- us to disturb any part of .the decision of the court below. .</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
