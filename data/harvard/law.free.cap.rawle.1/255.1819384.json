As there are no equitable circumstances in the case, effect must be given to it purely as a legal instrument; and, far as the courts-have latterly gone in construing bonds t\u00f3 be joint and several rather than joint, they have never yet pronoun'ced an instrument like this, unattended by any equity, to be several, even where the parties have not declared themselves bound, as they have done in this c\u00e1se, <em>jointly. </em>The extent to which they have gone, has been to consider a bond as several where it might fairly be inferred from circumstances, that such was.the intention of the parties, or where the deceased obligor has received the money, or been a partner, or derived some benefit from the loan, or some other circumstances existed, which would make it against equity to exonerate his estate. This has been done on the principle of reforming the instrument, In <em>Besore </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>12 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>154, the instrument was precisely like this, except that there the obligors did not declare themselves to <em>be jointly </em>;held. Prior to that case, the words, <em>\u201c </em>we bind.ourselves, our heirs, executors, and administrators, <em>and every of them\u201d </em>had never been held to make a bond several. An examination of that case will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>show that it does not entrench so much as it might be imagined, upon what.was considered the law. It was decided upon the equitable circumstances of the case; Judge Duncan, who delivered the opinion of the court, considering it to be a case in which equity would reform the instrument, and declaring his opinion to be in accordance with that of Chief Justice Marshall, in <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Rousmanier, </em>8 <em>Wheat. </em>174; and though he laid hold of the words, <em>and every of </em>them, as showing intention, he admitted that some, latitude must be taken to give them that effect. It cannot, therefore, be doubted, that if he had been sitting as a law judge merely, he would have construed the bond to be joint, as it&lt; certainly would be held in <em>England. </em>If this view of the subject be correct, the bond in question is a joint bond independently of the word <em>\u201cjointly,\u201d </em>prefixed to the declaration of indebtedness. The defendants\u2019 intestate had received no benefit whatever; there was nothing in- the c\u00e1se to create an equity against him, and he was therefore entitled to that favour, which is always extended to sureties by courts of equity. He is bound to the extent of his bond, but no further. It is no argument to say that the obligors intended to bind themselves severally, and did not know the difference between a joint and a joint and several bond. It is enough to say, that they are supposed to know the law.- But there are substantial reasons why a man should consent to bind himself jointly with another, and thus limit his responsibility to his own life, and y\u00e9t refuse to enter into an obligation the terms of which would subject his representatives to law suits. <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>Shryoch, 6 Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>262.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-5\">If, then, the intention of the parties wer\u00e9 not positively declared by the use of the word <em>\u201cjointly,\u201d </em>the implicatiqn from the words <em>\u201c every \u00f3f .them,\u201d </em>would not be strpng enough to make this a joint bond, viewing it merely as a legal instrument independently of equity. But, whatever may be the force of implication, it is never permitted to push aside the express declaration of the parties; and, as they have said in this instance that they are <em>jointly </em>bound, the court are not to imply, from doubtful words, that they intended to be bound <em>severally'. </em>A bond clearly several in its terms, has heen held joint by the introduction of the word- Conjunctim, 5 <em>Bac. Jib.' </em>163, 164. By considering the bond as joint, effect is given to all its parts, while, to treat it as several, the word <em>jointly </em>must be stricken out. \u2022 The term <em>jointly </em>refers to the resppnsibility which the obligors assume; while the words, <em>\u201cevery of them,\u201d </em>may fairly be construed to mean all the executors of the surviving obligor. If the word <em>\u201cjointly\u201d \u2022 </em>had been introduced inadvertently, there might -be some weight in the suggestion that the parties attached no force to it, and w\u00e9re not. aware of its effects; but.it is to be observed 1 that it is found in the written part of the bond, while the words which are relied upon as words of severalty are in the usual printed form. If, therefore, actual intent is to govern, the ease is with the defendants, so far as intent can be gathered from language.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b258-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number><em>Kittera, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkE\">To pronounce the instrument on which this suit is brought joint, it will be necessary to overturn no less than four decisions, upon words of precisely the same import. <em>Geddis </em>v. <em>Hawk, </em>10 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>33. <em>Besore </em>v. <em>Potter, 12 Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>154. <em>Moneugh </em>v. <em>Butler\u2019s Administrators, </em>cited in 12 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>158. <em>Detterer </em>v. <em>Custer, M. S. Case. </em>The only difference between these cases and that under consideration is, that here the binding is joint in express words; but this is nothing more than the law imports from the words, \u201c we bind ourselves,\u201d which make a joint obligation as completely as any form of words that could be devised, and yet they have been held to be controlled by the subsequent introduction \u00f3f the words, \u201c <em>and every of them\u2019\u2019 </em>by which a joint bond is converted into a joint and several one. The intention of the parties to make this a joint obligation, it is impossible to doubt. It is almost always the intention; for no unlettered man ever dreams of the distinction between such instruments. It was prepared by a man who was not a .lawyer, and who filled up a printed form, inadvertently omitting to introduce the words \u201c and severally,\u2019\u2019.after.theword \u201cjointly.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
