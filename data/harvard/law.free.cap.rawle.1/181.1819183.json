If the 7th section of the act of the 29.th of <em>March, </em>1819, be construed to extend to the present case, it is'-utterly void, because it is in violation of the 17th section of the 9th article of the Constitution of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>and the first part of the 10th -section of the l$t article of the Constitution of the <em>United States. </em>It violated, in the first place, the contract created by the charter between 1 the legislature apd the company, which was a private corporation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>the rights of which, cannot be impaired without its own consent. The king cannot-interfere-with the chartered rights of a corporation without trial and judgment, nor, on the same principle, can the legislature of Pennsylvania, without the consent of the corporation.- No .consent was given by the Union Canal Company to the act of the 29th of <em>March, </em>1819, until the 2,1st of <em>May, </em>T821; at which period the services of the plaintiff ceased. And, if such consent had been given, it would have been in violation of the contract entered into by the company with the plaintiff, to pay him the compensation agreed upon so long as he should continue in office, and until he .should have notice of removal. 4 <em>Wheat. </em>207, 656, 659, 662, 667, 682, 711. 8 <em>Wheat. </em>84, 92. <em>.3 Burr. </em>1661. <em>3 Kyd on Corp. 65.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aj7q\"><em>\u25a0 </em>But the court will, if possible, give-such a construction to the act of assembly, as will, reconcile it with- the Constitution; and in, this there is no difficult}'. In the first place,, it was not intended to apply to the old officers of-the company. The legislature contemplated a reorganization of the company, and intended to prevent, in future, the payment of salaries' where no services were performed. It Was not their intention to go. back, and take away salaries, from officers who-were then receiving them. ' - \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-6\">But, in the second place, if the act, was intended to embrace the old officers, it did not extend to the secretary. He was not such an officer as came within the.provisions of the law, which referred to. those who received large salaries and performed no duties- <em>He </em>was the only officer belonging to the corporation who received a small salary, and performed very laborious-duties. If the business of the company-was neglected,-it was not his .fault; He bad nothing to d\u00f3 with the-'direction'; .The evil to.- be., remedied,\" vyas, that the works upon the canal had ceased; and the object of the law was* that they should be recommenced. ' To effect this, the act of assembly provided a stimulus to those who.had the management of the concerns-of the corporation. Its provisions should, therefore, he confined to officers of that character, \u00e1nd not extended to mere ministerial officers, such as the-secretary, engineers, &amp;c;, who had no control over the affa-irs of the .company, and without whose previous services the works could not be recommenced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-7\">The provisions of the act of assembly, relative to the salaries o.\" officers,'clearly shew, that the secretary was not within the view &gt;' the legislature. Upon the recommencement of the works, the salaries of the officers were to be regulated by the <em>stockholders </em>in the <em>customary manner. . The </em>officers referred to must, therefore, have been those whose-salaries it had been <em>customary </em>for the <em>stockholders </em>to' regulate,; and not the secretary and engineers; whose salaries had never been regulated by the <em>\u00e9tockho\u00edd\u00e9rs, </em>but by the <em>managers </em>in whom their appointment was vested. They were properly not the officers of the company, but of the managers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-8\">But, if the secretary be comprehended by the act, the only rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>sonable construction of it is, that salaries should not <em>he paid </em>until after the recommencement of the works; not that no compensation should,, at any time, be allowed for services rendered-before that.pe-i riod. The most laborious part- of the business was to restore to order the deranged affairs of the company. Active exertions were ta be made; contracts to be entered into; skill, prudence,, and diligence were to be exercised; the president was restrained from pursuing any other mode of gaining a livelihood. Can it be pretended, that for all these exertions and sacrifices, no compensation'whatever was to be made? or could it be expected, that if none were to be made, the works would ever be recommenced? Some of-,the most important and laborious of the duties of the secretary, such as the drawing of contracts, and other preparatory services, must necessarily have been performed before the actual recommencement of the works. Those which were to be performed afterwards, were comparatively light. Upon the principle by which it is.attempted to cut\u2019off the'salary of the secretary, the surveying engineer, upon whose skill, capacity, and fidelity, the whole success of the work must have depended, would be denied any compensation whatever for his services, since those services must all have been rendered before the works could ga into operation. The intention o.f the legislature was, that no salaries, should be paid where no duties were performed. The former were to depend upon the latter; and when the recommencement of the works testified that duties had been rendered, compensation was to. be allowed, as well for services previously, as for those subsequently performed. ...</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-5\">The act of 1819 continues the obligations of the old corporation, All the privileges and immunities,-and, consequently, all the burdens of the old company, were vested in the new one. Strictly speaking, it was not the-creation of a new corporation, but the reorganization of the old corporation, under a new direction,. The defendants admit their liability for services rendered prior to 1819, and therefore are precluded from saying they are not bound by the contracts of their predecessors'. They cannot take all-the property and all the benefits, and throw off the debts of those to whom they succeed. The old board' acknowledged the plaintiff\u2019s claim, which was regularly passed by their proper accounting officers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-6\">If the contract cannot be enforced for the salary of the plaintiff as secretary, he is entitled to recover on a' <em>Quantum Meruit, </em>for his services as an individual. The defendants cannot deny his official character, in order to deprive him of his salary, and assert that character to prevent his recovering a just compensation for services actually rendered. \u25a0 \u25a0</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-7\"><em>Binney, </em>for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ao0\">It was competent to the company alone, to object to the constitutionality of the act of assembly by which they were remodelled;' and they have made no objection. From the lips of third persons, such an objection can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>not Gom\u00e9; nor can it\u2019now come from the company themselves, because they have accepted the charter, not merely from the time of their new organization, but <em>in loto. </em>Their \u00e1cceptanc\u00e9 has a retrospective operation from-the date of the law. To say otherwise, would be to permit on\u00e9 party to adopt a contract in a sense different from what the other party intended; for it is certain the legislature, intended that the law should go into operation from its date. \u2022 The question, therefore, whether the legislature had power to pass the , law, though by no means a -difficult one, doe\u2019s not arise. The company have accepted the charter unconditionally, and do not now object. The objection is' raised, by a third person, for them, and Without th.eir consent. It is true, that if he\u2019 has a- contract which js violated by the law, he- may assert its unconstitutionality; But the plaintiff never had an express contract with the company after 1816, when he was appointed. He received no appointment after-wards. While he was acting as secretary in 1S19, this act of assembly was passed. . With a full. knowledge of its\u2019-provisions, he goes on to render services, without any'new appointment or' contract of any kind, knowing that if the law is valid, he cannot be paid. When, therefore, it was rendered valid by the acceptance of the company, he could not complain of the loss of his salary, because he acted with his eyes open, and had a mer\u00e9 implied contract, dependant upon the acceptance or non-acceptance of the charter by the company. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aa2\">As to the construction of the act; Its terms are plain, and where there are no ambiguities, the court should make no subtle efforts to. find\u2019out other.meanings than those the words imp\u00f3rt. \u25a0 It is clear from the bill of exceptions, that the plaintiff n\u00e9ver claimed in any other character than as secretary. There was no evidence of services rendered otherwise than- as secretary, and the opinion of.\u2019 the District Court , was, that he could not recover upon the common counts, for services rendered in that' capacity.' If he was ah officer, and his services were rendered as such, he.cannot dodg\u00e9 'the act by claiming a compensation on a <em>Quantum Meruit. </em>-.The question then is, was he an officer? That he was sq in point of fact* there is no :do'ubt; but whether he 'was- so, within the meaning of the act, is-another mattter. ' It is said that he was not the officer of the company, but of the managers; but the minutes show, and so does the bill of exceptions, that whenever any thing was to be done by the company, he performed it as tneir secretary. He, attended the meetings of the company, and superintended the transfers pff stock. Besides, the managers were the -representatives of the c\u00f3mp'any, and their acts were the acts of their constituents. The bill of 'exceptions states that the plaintiff in error was appointed by the managers,. <em>\u201c secretary of the </em>company,\u201d and then goes on to say, that he was'entitled to compensation for'his <em>services </em>aforesaid, 'that is, <em>as secretary of the </em>companyThe distinction between engin\u00e9ers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>and officers is obvious, and need not be dwelt upon. Every company must have a secretary, and if he is not an officer of the company, it is impossible to imagine who is. lie is more identified \u25a0 with its concerns than any other officer. He, as well as the. .other officers, doubtless performed some services, but those services were not such as the legislature thought entitled \u25a0 them to compensation. They declared,' that until the -recommencement of the works, the officers should receive no salaries, and the company .accepted the ternjs offered. The president, managers, secretary, all the officers of the company were before the legislature when the law was passed, and no distinction was made between them. All were considered as sufficiently interested in the concerns of the corporation to perform the services preparatory to its reorganization. Whether the officer was appointed by the stockholders or the managers, was o,f no moment; the object being to cut off the salaries of all sinecure officers, no matter by whom appointed, in order to preserve the funds for the future operations of the company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-5\">It is said the act was intended to apply to officers <em>to he, </em>appointed; but such an interpretation would .overturn its express language) and contravene its whole .object. . The legislature have said, that the law should go into immediate operation; and, if.it had beeff otherwise) \u2022it would have been in the power of the old company to continue the old abuses as long as they pleased.'- &lt;</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-6\">The account signed by the auditor and counsel avails nothing. It was against law,- and of no effect; aiid it would have been\u2019the same thing if all the managers had acknowledged its correctness. They were bound, if at all, not as individuals, but in their corporate capacity,,and could not, .by their approbation,.give validity to that which-was contrary to law. \u25a0 ,</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The opinion of \u2018the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b187-8\">'Rogers, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AdFa\">On the 2d of <em>April, </em>.1811, the legislature passed the act to incorporate the Union .Canal Company <em>o\u00ed-Pennsylvania; </em>and, by the 28th .section, gave the company authority to. raise, by \u25a0lottery, three hundred and fifty thousand dollars; and. provided, that the profits arising from the lotteries should not form a capital.stock of the,company, upon which any dividend should be made to-the stockholders, but that the same should he considered 'as a bounty to the corporation, to enable them to make the tolls as low as possible. The company, after having commenced the work, suspended their operations, having raised, and continuing to raise, large sums of money by drawing the lotteries authorized by the act. In the annual return to the legislature, at the session of 1819, the managers made a statement of their accounts; in which it appeared that large salaries had been paid and were paying to the officers of the company, while little or no duties were performed, and that out ,of the funds (for they had no other,) appropriated.by the legislature, for the special purpose of making, the tolls as low as possible. The .plaintiff was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>the secretary of the company, and as such was returned in the statement of their accounts, as in the receipt of a salary of three hundred dollars <em>per annum. </em>With a knowledge of these facts, which are alleged in the preamble to the section to be notorious, and for the purpose of preventing such abuses in future, the legislature enacted, \u201c That from and after the passage, of this act, no <em>compensation </em>shall be allowed by the company to its-officers until the works are actually recommenced upon the canal; ..after which time the salaries may be regulated by the stockholders in the customary manner; <em>Provided, </em>That if. the said work shall be suspended, or interrupted for the space of three months, the salaries allowed to the said officers shall'cease for the time of such suspension, and until the work be recommenced.\u201d The defendants interpose this seventh section of the act of the'29th of <em>March, 1819, </em>in the way of the plaintiff\u2019s recovery, arid allege.that he comes within its, words a.nd spirit, which is denied by the plaintiff; and this, with th,e.constitutionality of the act, forms the question which we are required to decide. The defendants say, the secretary is not an officer, and, if an officer, that he is the officer of the managers, and not of the company. \u25a0 With this I do not agree. . He is as much the officer of the corporation as the cashier or clerk, of a bank, who clearly are the servants of the company, and not of the directors, by whom they are appointed. And, in tbe 6 th section of the act of the 2d of <em>April, </em>1811, he is expressly called an officer; for it is provided, that the president and managers shall have authority to appoint a secretary, engineer, and'such <em>other </em>officers, &amp;c., and allow such compensation as they may find necessary and expedient. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">But the;plaintiff further contends, that although he may be considered an officer, jn the strict sense of the word, he is not-such an officer as,was contemplated by the act; that the legislature had in View the president and managers, and not the secretary. It would appear to me to be strange, that if tbe legislature intended to disferimiriate between the secretary and others, who were in the receipt 'of large salaries out of public monies, they should not have expressed their meaning in explicit terms. And where they have not thought proper to do so, it is not competent for us to make the distinction. It would be wresting language from its'obvious import, in favour of a person, whom it apppeared to the legislature, and to us, has been well compensated for any services he may have performed. The duties of a secretary of a company, which had entirely suspended its operations, could not have been very onerous, and the legislature may well have been struck with the injustice, in his case, of squandering money-appropriated, to a public purpose, on a person whose duties were by no means burdensome.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The legislature, in the enacting clause, drop the word'salary, used in the preamble, and say, <em>\u201c No compensation </em>shall be allowed, by the company to its officers, until the works are actually recommenced.\u201d ' \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>They seem to have anticipated, that expedients would be resorted' to, to avoid the operation of the section, and have used a word which embraces every species of allowance which may be attempted for the-services of the officers of the company, all whose proceedings upon the canal had long since ceased, and whose only funds were derived from lotteries, granted by the legislature. It will not do for the officers of the company to say, that although we cannot receive compensation, by way of salary, yet we are entitled to pay, for our services, on a <em>Quantum Meruit. </em>If this should be the construction of the act, it would be in the power of the managers to defeat the manifest intention expressed by the legislature, the preservation of the fund to enable the corporation to lessen tolls to be charged for-the use of the canal. It would only be necessary to allow the whole salary, by way of compensation, for the company-, who had already abused their trust, would be the judges of the <em>quantum </em>of service, and its'value. ' And if this should be permitted, in the case of the secretary, the same.rule must be adopted as regards the president and managers, who, in the opinion of the legislature, had evidently shown their willingness to appropriate to themselves large salaries, for which adequate services were not rendered. It is to be remembered, that the services for which he claims compensation, were performed by him as secretary of the company, and in no-other capacity whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">It remains now to inquire how far the act interferes with the 10th section of the 1st article of the Constitution of the <em>United States. </em>\u201cNo state shall pass any law impairing, the obligation of a -contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">If the monies, arising from the lotteries authorized by the. act,, were public monies, as the legislature considered, and of which no person can- entertain a reasonable doubt, it would be a matter of regret if they could not interpose to prevent the continuance of a system by which the funds were diverted from their legitimate objects. The trust, in the opinion of those whose duty it was to take care of the .public interest, had been-violated, and the legislature, with their accustomed moderation and regard to private rights,, pass a law, not to compel them to refund, but to prevent, in future, a practice calculated to retard, if not wholly to prevent, the object of the grant, an internal communication between -the waters of the <em>Susquehanna </em>and <em>Schuylkill. </em>The Constitution of the <em>United States </em>was not intended to prohibit the legislature from controlling a fund created for the public interest,- and which had been perverted to private purposes by those to whose charge it had been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">But, it is said that a grant is a contract; that this is a private corporation, and that the creation of a private corporation by charter, is such a grant as includes the obligation of a contract, which no state legislature can pass a law to impair; and for this we have the authority of the Supreme Court of the <em>United Stales, </em>in the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>of <em>The Dartmouth College </em>v. <em>Woodward,4 Wheat. </em>656. Although these, as general positions, are conceded, yet it remains to show their application. The act of assembly did not, it is true, require the consent of the company to the alteration of the charter, yet in point of fact this assent has been given by the stockholders; and I believe no person will be so hardy as to say, that the legislature are prohibited from altering a charter, in its most essential features, if the alteration be agreed to either before or after the passage of the act. The assent of the stockholders relates back to the date of the law, for in no other way could the company entitle themselves to the benefit of its provisions. When the plaintiff performed the duties for which he now claims compensation, he was aware of the consequence of a subsequent assent on the part of the company. I cannot, therefore, perceive that the plaintiff has any right to complain that the president and managers think it their duty to comply with every direction of the law to which the company owes its existence. It would be out of the power of the stockholders to accede to the alteration of the charter in part: they must accept all or none, and the section we are now considering, is among the essential provisions of this act. It violates no contract made with the plaintiffs before the date of the law; for it is worthy of remark, that the secretary was appointed, as is usual, not for a term of time, but that he holds his office during the pleasure of the managers. . He was free to perform the services of secretary at his own will and pleasure. He was neither bound to the company in any contract subsisting at the time, nor were they under any obligations to him. It is a singular feature in this cause, that the company do not complain of a violation of the charter: it is the secretary who insists that it is made in opposition to the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Judgment affirmed..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
