This was an action of ejectment for two pieces of land in <em>Union </em>township, <em>Berks </em>county, brought to <em>January </em>Term, 1827, by the plaintiff in error against the defendants in error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-13\">On the trial of the cause, the cas\u00e9 was briefly this:\u2014In 1799, ajudgment was obtained against <em>Morgan </em>Lewis, under whom both parties claimed. A <em>Fieri Facias </em>issued on the judgment to <em>April </em>Term, 1799, and an <em>Mias Venditioni Exponas </em>to <em>January </em>Terna, 1800, and no further proceedings were had on the judgment until the year 1823. On the 16th day of <em>September, </em>1818,. a small house and ' twenty acres-of land were devised to <em>Morgan </em>Lewis, for and during his natural life; and from, and immediately after his death,. to his children, share and share alike. On fie 23d of <em>March, </em>1821, the debtor, <em>Morgan Lewis, </em>conveyed-and released his life estate to his children, on condition, that <em>thef </em>should support him and his wife during their lives. The children took possession of the estate. An <em>Mias Fieri Facias Post Venditioni. Exponas </em>issued to <em>JLugust </em>Term, 1823, for the residue of the debt, when an.affidavit of defence was made; the judgment entered in 1799 opened; the cause referred, and in the year 1826, a report, or award, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>plaintiff, made for one hundred and'seventy-two dollars, and judgment entered thereon. On a - <em>Venditioni Exponas </em>to <em>August </em>Term, 1836, the property was sold to <em>Jacob Geiger, </em>the plaintiff, who, on the 14th day of <em>August, </em>1836, received the sheriff\u2019s deed for the. same, on which this ejectment was brought. On the trial, it was principally contended, that the deed of 1821, was fraudulent and void, as the grantor was indebted at the time, and this-his only property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-6\"><em>At </em>the close of the trial, the counsel for the plaintiff requested the-eourt to charge the jury as follows:\u2014\u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-7\"><em>\u201c </em>1.

That the propositions submitted to the court had not been answered; or, if answered, they had been answered erroneously. He supported his argument by citing <em>M'Allister </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>6 <em>Binn. </em>338. <em>Thomson </em>v. <em>Dougherty, </em>12 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>448. 5 <em>Conn. 67</em>.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b351-10\"><em>H.

They denied that any evidence had been given to show the existence of any debt at the time of the execution of the deed. If <em>Lewis </em>was in debt at all, he was.so in 1826, and not in 1S21, when the deed was made. The facts, that the improvements, on the property were made by the children, and that they tools possession, are the strongest evidence, that all was done <em>bona fide, </em>and without fraud, either in fact or in law,</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-11\">The points submitted to the court were all substantially and correctly answered. It is not necessary that a,judge should answer each point separately. Where -one answer is applicable to several points, one is sufficient. They cited <em>Hubley </em>v, <em>Vanhorne, 7 Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>185. <em>Brown v. Caldwell, </em>10 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>114. <em>Cope </em>v. <em>Humphreys, </em>14 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle, </em>15. <em>Munderbach v.

It is very evident to my mind, that the court, by their answers, intended to answer the points fully, but unfortunately did not do so. It has been declared again and again, and is a well settled principle of law, that a party has a right to ask the opinion of the court on any matter of law, pertinent to the matter before them, and that the withholding of the opinion is error. In this case, the court could have readily, briefly, and separately, answered each point submitted. In regard to the <em>first </em>point, an affirmative answer,-or one in the words of the'proposition, would have been full, complete, and correct. To the <em>second </em>point, a repetition of it by the court, affirming the proposition, would have formed a complete and sufficient answer. So, in regard to the <em>third </em>and <em>fourth </em>propositions. I, however, by no means say, that it is necessary for the court to answer propositions submitted for their opinion, in the very words of the propositions. It is enough, if the answers be Sufficiently full to be understood; nor is it necessary where the same.proposition is repeated, though in different words, for the court-to answer every repetition of it; one full answer is sufficient; more than one would evidently.be improper, having nothing valuable in it, unless the swelling of the record by a repetition of the same answers would be considered so. But the court did not so answer in this case; one answer only was given.to all the foregoing points, though they materially, differed <em>from </em>each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\"><em>The fifth </em>proposition was not so answered as to convey to the understanding of the jury a correct idea of the law. The answer of the court (in fact, the same that was given to all and each of the preceding points,) is, <em>\u201c </em>that no act whatever, dope to defraud a creditor, or creditors, shall be of any effect against such creditor or.' creditors.\u201d Clearly, this is not a sufficient answer to the points here submitted. In the abstract, it is true and correct, that no act whatever, if done to defraud, creditors, can be of any effect against creditors. But the party was desirous the court should inform the jury explicitly, that if the conveyance from <em>Morgan Lewis </em>to his children, was for the purpose of preventing-his creditors from levying on the premises, the plaintiff would be entitled to recover in this suit.. Nothing was said by the court, in their answer, to lead the minds of the jury, directly to the consideration of the matter contained in the proposition; nor do the court, in their charge, instruct the jury, as I think they ought to have don\u00e9, that if the conveyance was for the purpose of preventing the creditors of <em>Morgan Lewis </em>from levying on the premises, the plaintiff would be entitled to recover.' As 'to this, the court remained silent, and did not instruct the jury. But to the <em>sixth </em>and. last point, t'he court answer, \u201c that <em>Morgan Lewis, </em>being indebted, on the.23d day of <em>March, </em>1821, his deed to his children of that date is fraudulent arid void, as to his creditor or creditors;\u201d and had the court stopped here, the answer would have been full and correct; but the court went on and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>added, \u201cif the jury <em>believed, </em>it was given without, a good and valuable consideration;\u201d and in this the court erred, for the deed would have been fraudulent and void as to creditors, if made t\u00f3 his children, even for a valuable consideration. Under certain circumstances, transactions, honest- between parties themselves, often become fraudulent in relation to others. So, in this ease, if the deed was given to the children, in \u25a0 consideration, or on condition of supporting the grantor for life, which would have been, as.to them, a valuable consideration, and honest between the .parties themselves, yet, if made with a view to hinder or defeat creditors, it would be fraudulent and yoid in relation to them. And so the jury should have been instructed; but the.court told the jury, it was fraudulent and void as to his creditors, <em>if they believed </em>it was given without a good and valuable consideration, which evidently tended to mislead the jury; for they might infer from .the direction, that if the consideration was a good and valuable one, the'deed was not' fraudulent as to creditors, and that a valuable consideration was all that was necessary to make a d\u00e9ed effectual under any circumstances. But so is not the law. I think the court should have instructed the jury, that the facts given in evidence,-uncontradicted as they were, amounted to a fraud in law, which the. court had the right to decide, and not the jury; here, however, the court referred the decision to the jury. In the opinion, of this courts the plaintiff in error has sustained the errors he assigned in the record; and the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas is, therefore, to be reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded. ' ' \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">.Judgment reversed, and <em>&amp; venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
