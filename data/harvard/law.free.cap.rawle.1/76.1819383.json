In conformity with the practice, a <em>Certiorari </em>had been issued to bring up the record; but the clerk of the Orphans\u2019 Court declined sending up the original papers in his office, which were voluminous, offering to make copies of them, upon payment of the fees, for so doing, which he insisted he had the right to do. \u2022 On motion of <em>Wheeler, </em>for the appellants, a rule was granted, upon the clerk, to return the original papers, or show cause whyan attachment should not issue against him, with the view of obtaining the direction of the court, as to the course to be pursued, in such cases, by the officer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-12\">Upon the return of the rule, cause was shown on behalf of the clerk of the Orphans\u2019 Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b76-13\">' <em>Wheeler, </em>in support of the rule.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANY\"><em>The Certiorari </em>issues to bring up the record itself. 2 <em>Pall. </em>190. The appeal only removes the cause. The 11th section of the act creates the Supreme Court, (1 <em>Sm. </em>L. 139,) and gives power to issue <em>Certioraris. Cond. Gen. </em>90, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>an authority, that the <em>Certiorari </em>removes the record itself, out of the inferior court, and 1 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>573, <em>F. N. B. </em>548, <em>Lil. Ent. </em>252, 353, are to the same point.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b77-5\"><em>Ingraham, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ao9\">It is perfectly true, that, upon a <em>Certiorari, </em>the record, itself, is returned, in the condition in which it was when the writ came to the court below, and every thing done in the court, between the <em>teste </em>and return of it; (1 <em>Tid, </em>407, 8th <em>Edit.) </em>that is to say, a complete transcript of the record below, and not the mere substance of it. And, the safety of important papers, filed in the Orphans\u2019 Court office, requires, that such should be the practice; for they are often lost or mislaid, and titles thus rendered defective. In point of fact, the original papers are never sent up in <em>England. </em>Chief Justice Holt, in <em>Rex </em>v. <em>North, 2 Salk. </em>565, says, <em>u </em>It is an error in the clerks in <em>London, </em>that, upon a <em>Certiorari, </em>they return only a transcript, as if the record remained below; for, in C. B., though they do not return the very individual record, yet, the transcript is returned as if it were the record; and so it is in judgment of law; and it is in this sense, that a return of the <em>\u2018 </em>record itself,\u2019 is to be understood, when used by the writers of books of practice, as is evident from the marginal note of this very case, which is, <em>\u2018 </em>upon a <em>Certiorari </em>the very record is returned.\u201d\u2019</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b77-6\">Pee C\u00fceiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AD3\">In every sort of appeal, whether with, or without <em>Certiorari, </em>the practice is to send up the original papers, as far as is practicable. The dockets cannot be removed, and transcripts of the particular entries, necessarily, supply their place. But here there is a <em>Certiorari </em>to remove the record; and, where this writ issues from a superior to an inferior court, whatever may be the law in other instances, the original record is to be retoned. We are of opinion, therefore, that, to return a transcript, would neither agree with our own practice, nor answer the exigence of the writ, at the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Rule made absolute\u00bb</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
