In his letters of the 26th of <em>April </em>and the-5th of <em>May, </em>he-advises Field.that he had not sold .his nankins, but informs. <em>Cheever </em>and <em>Fales </em>that he had, been fortunate with theirs, as the remainder of them had been disposed of at a short credit.' In his letter of the 13th <em>of June, </em>he states, that he will ship the nett proceeds of sales in coffee, but that not' having, received the Government expenses, he cannot exactly state the sum, which by the next opportunity to <em>America, </em>he will dp, enclosing a bill of lading at the same tim\u00e9. On the 17th of <em>June, </em>1820, <em>Wilson </em>borrowed of Messrs. <em>David Corry and Co., </em>of <em>Port-au-Prince, </em>the merchants with whom he transacted- his business, an advance of the nett proceeds of the whole cargo, amounting to about the sum of seventeen thousand five hundred dollars, leaving that house to reimburse themselves by collecting the outstanding debits due upon the sales, from the different purchasers. This advance was -made in green coffee, which was shipped from <em>Port-au-Prince, </em>to the several shippers by the schooner <em>Baltimore, </em>in the proportion of the proceeds of their several invoices. In the account of the sales of <em>Field\u2019s </em>shipment, the names of the purchasers, were not mentioned, but it concluded with {t errors, omissions, and outstanding debts excepted.\u2019-\u2019 In that rendered to <em>Cheever </em>and <em>Fales </em>the names of the purchasers were given, and the account concluded with \u201c errors' and omissions excepted.\u201d In consequence of a.destructive fire which laid waste a great part of the city'of <em>P\u00f3rt-au-Prince, </em>a few weeks after these sales were made, several of the purchasers of the defendant\u2019s goods became wholly insolvent, and the balances due .from them were lost. . The house of <em>Corry and Co. </em>demanded payment of their advances from <em>Wilson, </em>by whom they were referred to the consignors, who neglected to make payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-7\"><em>John Wilson </em>died at <em>Philadelphia, </em>in the summer of 1821, and administration on his estate was granted to the plaintiffs.

And this is the principle of the case of <em>Oakley </em>v. <em>Renshaw, 4 Cow. </em>205.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-14\">After <em>the final settlement, </em>the principal has the-best grounds, <em>to </em>suppose that the agent has been actually paid, or that he is content to take upon himself the responsibility of the purchaser. Where there is nothing in the transaction to rebut the inference, this is undoubtedly a fair presumption. To subject the principal, at any distance-of time, when he has reason to suppose the business finally closed, would be a deception upon him, attended with danger and great inconvenience, and particularly in the case of a foreign creditor, who has no means of knowing the debtors, or guarding against imposition. In the absence of fraud or mistake, it wou\u00edd be unsafe to unravel such a transaction; for after final settlement, the principal, -gives himself no further concern, as he has a right ,to suppose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>that the money has been received, or that the.-factor agrees to take upon himself the risk of the solvency of the purchaser. The difficulty in this case; arises not from any uncertainty in law, but in determining the .nature of the settlement, or in other words, whether this was a'final Settlement, and so understood by the parties. In the letter of the 20th of <em>April, Wilson </em>informs the shippers, that he-had sold <em>part </em>of the consignment on a short credit) but neither states the names of the purchasers .no.r mentions th\u00e9 term of credit) and we are left to conjecture whether short credit means sixty or ninety days, six months or a year. In the letters of the 26th of <em>April </em>and 5th of <em>May, </em>he advises-Nieici, that he had not .sold his nankeens, .but informs <em>Ch'eever </em>and <em>Fates, </em>that he had been mor\u00e9 fortunate with theirs, as the-remainder of them-had been disposed of at a short credit; \u25a0 but in the letter of the 1 Sth of <em>June, </em>he says, lie will ship the nett proceeds of sales in coffee, but-that not having received the Government expenses, he cannot.exactiy state the sum, which by the next opportunity to <em>America, </em>will be done, enclosing the bill.of lading at the same time. On the 19th <em>o\u00ed June, </em>the accounts of sales and bills of lading of .the coffee were duly rendered to the shippers, in which I remark this difference. In the account of sales of <em>Field\u2019s </em>shipment, the names of the purchasers are not given, but it is expressly stated, in the usual mercantile manner, errors, omissions, and <em>outstanding debts </em>excepted. In the account of sales rendered to <em>Cheever </em>and <em>Fates, </em>the <em>names </em>of the <em>purchasers </em>are given, and it is stated, errors and omissions excepted. In the absence of all proof to the contrary, the inference-is, that at the time the balance was paid, it was done with those accounts before them, and with express reference to them. There is then, no room for presumption, that the shippers supposed the debts had been paid; for it appeared in the accounts rendered that they, had not. Nor Tan it be reasonably supposed, that' <em>Wilson </em>intended to take upon himself the risk \u00f3f their collection; for .it is not pretended, -he charged, or was allowed a <em>del credere </em>commission. If the shippers were aware that the debts were outstanding, what injury had they sustained? They were not lulled into a false security, nor were they in any way deceived, and why should they wish to' throw the'loss on an agent, who, it is acknowledged acted-in conformity to his instructions, and with the strictest regard to the' interest of his employers. When a principal has reason to suppose.that-the business is finally closed, and a payment of the balance is made for that purpose, then he should be protected; but I cannot agree, that the mere payment of the balance of the account, without any.accompa'nying circumstance, can have that effect. The case states, that money to the amount of seventeen thousand five hundred dollars, was taken up by <em>Wilson, </em>from Messrs. <em>David Corry and Co., </em>with a view of closing the sales at <em>Port-au-Prince; </em>but it is no where found,, that the balance of the money was paid with the intention of closing the ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>count between the principal and agent, which is the turning point in <em>Oakley </em>v. <em>Renshaw. </em>It has been truly said, by the counsel for the plaintiffs in error, that if an agent sell on credit, it is his duty, within a reasonable \u2022 time, to inform his principal'of the names of the purchasers, and the terms of' sale. In such a case the, agent would be answerable to his principal, in damages for any loss which may have been sustained by reason of his <em>omission to </em>giye the necessary information. I,t does not,,-however, follow, that for this neglect, he shall' at all events be made responsible for the solvency of the purchasers. The cases relied upon were <em>Edgar </em>v. <em>Bumstead, </em>1 <em>Campb. </em>411. <em>Bousfield </em>v. <em>Creswell, </em>2 <em>Campb. </em>545. <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Swan, </em>3 <em>Campb. </em>391, and <em>Wilkinson, Assignee of Gwynne, </em>v. <em>Clay, </em>4 <em>Campb. </em>170, are cases of insurance brokers, who enter into bonds, and by statute are bound to make, kno.wn, upon every contract or bargain, the names of their principals. 1 <em>Liv: on Agency, </em>73. They depend upon the well known course of dealing between the insurance broker, the merchant, and underwriter, and do not touch on the common course of trade, or agencies which have no such usages. - ,' _</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">_ There is no doubt an obligation on the principal,..(which the civilians call <em>obligatio mandato </em>contraria,) to repay his agent such sums of money, as the latter has necessarily expended in the execution of his commission; and to indemnify him for losses sustained by reason of his employment.. To give rise to this obligation, it is necessary that the agent should have sustained some loss, on account of the agency, <em>ex causa mandati, </em>and that the loss should not have been caused by the agent\u2019s fault. These principles are recognized to the fullest extent in <em>D\u2019Arcey </em>v. <em>Lyle, </em>5 <em>Binn. </em>441. The statement of the cas\u00e9 clearly shows that the loss has been sustained on account of the agency, without any blame imputable to the agent, but from one of those accidents which the utmost vigilance of the plaintiff could not have prevented.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">Judgm.ent affirmed\u00bb</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
