J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atb\">A criminal prosecution, whether it be by indictment or action, is not within the purview of the compulsory arbitration act; as in the case of an action to recover a'penalty for a breach of the revenue laws. <em>Buckwalter </em>v. <em>The United States, </em>11 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>193. On the other hand, an action for a penalty which is imposed, not to punish the act as an offence, but to compensate the party aggrieved, as in the case of a penalty for omitting to serve notice of the meeting of arbitrators, \u201cwhich is strictly a private injury, may be referred at the option of either party. <em>The Commonwealth, for the use of Rogers, </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>16 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>243. What is the character of taking illegal' fees in-violation of the act of the 28th of <em>March, </em>1814?'

'And this appears the more satisfactorily, not only because it had been directed in a previous law, that a remedy provided by statute should be pursued in exclusion of the remedy at the common law, but because the means of. prosecution are put,, in every respect, expressly on the footing of an action for a private injury. This pro- ' vision alone, then, if other arguments were wanting, would be decisive Of the question; and we are satisfied that the reference was valid.
