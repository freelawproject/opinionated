Judgments are not within the statutes of set-off. 1 <em>Jim. Dig. </em>344, <em>Set-Off, pi. </em>2. Our defalcation act, <em>(Purd. Dig. </em>177,) allows a set-off, in cases where two or more dealing to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>gether, are indebted to each other, upon bonds, bills, bargains, promises, accounts, or the like; but the enumeration does not embrace judgments. In <em>England, </em>though not within the statutes, judgments may be set off against each other, on motion, under the equitable powers of the court. <em>Montague, </em>6. This may be done, with perfect justice to the parties; but where the plaintiff is obliged to bring suit for the purpose of ascertaining a disputed claim, it,would be manifestly unjust to permit the defendant to set off a judgment against it, and thus throw the costs on the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-4\">2. _The second question is, whether or not an obligor can set off against a second assignee,, a debt due to him by the first assignee, before the execution of the bond? The doctrine of set-off has only been adjudged to affect the assignee of the obligee, on the ground that the obligor has become the creditor of the obligee, on the faith of the instrument. It has never been held that the obligor could set off a debt against the assignee of an assignee, unless, perhaps, during the time the first assignee held the bond, the obligor, on the faith of it, became his creditor. The leading cases in our own' books, are of the defalcation of debtp due by the obligee to the obligor. The decision in <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>1 <em>Dall. 23, </em>was, that the assignee takes the bond subject to all .the equity the obligor has against the obligee. The principle the court has gone upon is, to be liberal as to the subject matter of the set-off, but strict as to the persons between whom it is to take place; and an unwillingness has latterly been shown to extend the doctrine further than it has already gone. It has been truly said, that a set-off against an assignee does not rest on equity or good policy. Where the debt has been incurred .by the first assignee, not only before the bond came into his hands, but even before its execution, no injustice can be done to the obligor by .refusing to let him set it off after the assignment, because the inception of the debt had no reference to the bond; but to permit such a set-off, would be highly inequitable to the innocent assignee, who has paid a valuable consideration for the bond, and had no notice of any pre-existing debts between the first assignee and the obligor. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Barr, 9 Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>141. <em>Bury </em>v. <em>Hartman, </em>4 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>177. <em>The Bank of Niagara </em>v. <em>M\u2018Cracken, 18 Johns. 493. M'Collough </em>v. <em>Houston, </em>1 <em>Dall. </em>441. <em>Reeder </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>9 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>195. <em>Calhoun </em>v. <em>Snyder, 6 Binn. </em>135. The act of 1715, sect. 3, <em>(Purd. Dig. </em>97,) declares that the assignee of a bond shall recover what is due at the time of the assignment, <em>\u201c </em>in like manner as the person or persons to whom the same was made, payable might or could have done.\u201d <em>Valentine </em>and <em>Henry TJhler </em>were therefore entitled to recover whatever the executors, of <em>Andrew Metzgar </em>could have claimed; and as the matters given in evidence could have had no operation in a suit brought-by them upon the bond, it follows, that they eannot affect the instrument in the hands of the real plaintiffs in this suit</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b230-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number><em>Scott, </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"At3Y\">The position attempted to be maintained on the opposite, side\u2014that a judgment cannot be set off against a demand unascertained by judgment\u2014is'against sound reason, and .even against common sense. It would be extraordinary, indeed, if a man were permitted to set off an unascertained claim, and yet, as Soon as it assumed a fixed and'determinate character, be refused that privilege. \u25a0 It is essential to the'goodness of a set-off, that it should be ascertained. Unliquidated damages in tort, which cannot be set off before judgment, may be set off after they are. reduced to certainty by judgment. There is direct authority in support of the position contended for on behalf of the defendants in error. 1 <em>Pac. Ab. </em>137, <em>Set-off, C. Montague, </em>10.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-6\">2. The rule, that a purchaser for a valuable consideration shall be protected against secret trusts, is'doubtless well established,' but it is to be taken with this qualification^ that he has not the means of notice of the existence of such trusts. If he has notice, or the means of knowledge, of which he neglects to avail himself, he is bound. When, therefore, a man is about to receive an assignment of a. bond, it is his business to call ori the obligor, and inquire what claims he has upon the'obligee, or any of the previous .assignees; and, if he neglects this easy precaution, he ought to be the sufferer, and not the obligor, who was a stranger to the transfer. Mutuality of credit has never been deemed an essential ingredient in the doctrine of set-off, but mutuality of remedy has. The settled rule is, that the assignee of a bqnd takes it subject to all the equity existing against the obligee; and payment to. the assignor, without notice of the assignment, is good hgainst the assignee. Notice puts an end to all <em>privity </em>between the assignor and obligor, and. the assignee becomes the owner of the bond, subject to any existing equity against the obligee. \u25a0 After notice of the assignment, a new contract arises between the obligor and the assignee, who holds a chose in action no more negotiable than it was in. the hands of the obligee. If he transfers it, he does so liable to all the equity arising from the' contract between him and the obligor. If this be not the case, the effect of an assignment would be to make the instrument negotiable. The question is not, what equity there is. between the obligor and obligee, but what equity there is in the obligor. The fact that <em>Christian Metzgar </em>was indebted to <em>Philip Metzgar, </em>while the, former held the bond, amounted to payment of' it, and chancery would have decreed it to be given up. <em>Ryal </em>v. <em>Rowles, </em>1 <em>Ves. </em>367. <em>Cromwell </em>v. <em>Arrott, </em>1 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>184. 1 <em>Ves. jr. </em>249. 2 <em>Wash. </em>233, 254. 1 <em>Madd.

Ab. </em>453.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b230-8\">Gibso\u00f1, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6K\">Our defalcation act, having been found extremely beneficial, in -practice, has been construed more largely, than the words would seem to bear. Even the <em>English </em>statute, although more narrow in its words and construction,- Has not been held to require that the debts to be set against each other, should haye <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>arisen out of the same transaction. The object is to promote convenience <em>by </em>preventing circuity of action; and that requires the defalcation of all demands which do not involve any great degree of intricacy in the inquiry. Why, then, should not the act embrace the debt of an intermediate assignee? The words certainly do not restrict the remedy to transactions between the original parties; and there are no equitable considerations to exempt the case of a subsequent assignee. At the time of the assignment, the right of defalcation existed in full force between the obligor and the intermediate assignee. By what right, then, can the latter put a subsequent assignee in a more advantageous situation than he held himself. \u25a0 In. this state, no assignee; whether legal or equitable, can afieet to be prejudiced by yvant of notice; it being his duty, as established by many decisions, to sound the obligor before he parts with his money, as to the amount actually due. With or without actual notice, therefore, he is precisely in the situation of the preceding obligor, whose title he bears.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Nor is there more force in the 'objection, that a judgment cannot be set off before a jury. Judgments.are frequently set against each other by the court; and there is no colour of argument against defalcating them from unascertained demands. - A judgment may be the foundation of an action; and there is no reason why it should not be set up as a cross demand, equally with a bond or recognisance. It would be unjust to subject to the costs of a trial, a defendant who has a judgment sufficient to extinguish the plaintiff\u2019s demand altogether. The <em>English </em>decisions ineontrovertibly establish the right of set-off in similar cases; and, although not the point decided, it was taken for granted by this court in <em>Wain </em>v. <em>Iiewes, </em>(5 <em>Serg. </em>Rawle,'468.) On both grounds, then, the set-off was properly allowed. . Judgment affirmed. '</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
