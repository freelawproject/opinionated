I mentioned the arrangement to Mr. <em>Beatty, </em>that I had proposed to <em>Crawford; </em>he was satisfied with it, and we all went to <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>house together; before I left the house, I put two bonds in <em>my </em>pocket, <em>(Beatty\u2019s </em>papers were all in my possession,) due by <em>Jackson </em>to <em>Beatty; </em>the arrangement was mentioned to <em>Jackson; </em>we all went together to theprothonotary\u2019s office; <em>Jackson, </em>when there, asked for his bonds; I-took one out, on which he had made a partial payment, and made a calculation of the balance due; gave that one up to him, and endorsed a credit on the other, for the balance of <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>account; then this endorsement was put on the record, and signed by Mr. <em>Jackson. \u25a0</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-5\">\n<em>William Jackson .</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AgB\">V.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AOs\">\n<em>Gersham Lambert.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AZ8h\"><em>^0. %%, April, </em>1818.

We then dispersed, and I heard no more of the matter for several months. Mr. <em>Crawford </em>came into my office, and said he had just heard that <em>Lambert </em>had assigned all his property to his children before this judgment, and was not worth any thing. I told him I was,a good deal surprised at it. In the evening I went down to Mr. <em>Jackson\u2019s, </em>took him into a front room, and told him what <em>Crawford </em>had mentioned to me; he appeared to be surprised at the information too. I stated my opinion; that he was liable for the money to <em>Crawford, </em>and that he ought to adopt immediate measures to secure himself. <em>Lambert </em>lived about five miles below this place, and'I advised him to go to him, and try to get possession of some bonds he had on .people in <em>Jersey. Jackson </em>said if he would have to pay that money it would be an injury to him, as he had intended to pay <em>Beatty </em>in the spring, and he would not be able to do so. I adyised him to take legal adyice on the subject; and told him if he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>would come up on Monday morning, we would examine the deeds. I saw him on Monday; he had seen Mr. <em>Smith </em>in the meantime, and he then thought differently on the subject; my application to <em>Crawford, </em>was on <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>account; it was a voluntary act of my own, and not of Mr. <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>seeking; I do not recollect what conversation took, place at the time of the assignment; they were all my friends, and I wanted to have the matter settled all round without a law suit; <em>Jackson </em>demanded his bonds before he signed the assignment; Mr. Beatty, Mr. <em>Crawford, Jackson, </em>and myself, were all there at the time of the assignment; 1 was under the impression that he was liable, and he appeared to be so too; but, whether front my conversation or hot, I do not know.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-5\"><em>William E.

But, whether a party can properly tender a demurrer to parol evidence, seems not so clear. The weight of the authorities seems to be, that where such evidence is certain, and as little susceptible of variance as written evidence, it stands on the same. footing.- ' Where it is loose, and made up of circumstances, which may be urged to a jury with more or less success as evidence of other circumstances, it certainly is not settled, that it may be made the subject of a demurrer, without the assent of both .parties. Y\u00e9t, \u25a0 occasional-expressions are-not wanting to favour an opinion entertained by some, that the party producing such evidence, may be required' to join, -on having secured to him the benefit of every circumstance.which the evidence might legitimately conduce to prove. The demurrer to evidence originally grew out of necessity; there having been no other means of securing to a party, the right of having the law of his ease decided by the constitutional tribunal, when there was in reality no fact in dispute; and it fell into disuse only when the increasing liberality-of the <em>English </em>judges in granting new trials, afforded\u2019a more convenient method of obtaining the judgment of the superior courts at <em>Westminster. </em>With us, there is perhaps, some reason why the use of it should he retained, and even encouraged, inasmuch as the opinion of the court in the last resort, cannot be had on a motion for a new trial-in the Common Pleas. No one can be prejudiced by it, as.it is, at best, a desperate remedy for him who has recourse to it; and it would be hard to deprive him of the miserable advantage it affords in comparison with a trial before a prejudiced or predetermined jury. Be that as it may, our provinc\u00e9 is not to legislate, but to pronounce the law as we. find it, the legislature being alone competent to alter it where there is room to dissent from the reason or policy of its provisions. Without intimating an opinion as to any other case, then, it may be affirmed, that where there is a demurrer to evidence of a fact, which is not evidence of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>other fact, but itself a substantive ingredient of the ease, a party may be required to join.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">What then, was the evidence here? At no time previous to the assignment, had <em>Jackson </em>a transaction with <em>Crawford. Beatty, </em>to whom <em>Jackson </em>is indebted, comes to him along with <em>Crawford, </em>and desires him to assign .his judgment against <em>Lambert, </em>in payment of his debt to <em>Beatty. Jackson </em>does not open his lips to any one, except to require his bonds of <em>Beatty; </em>one of which being delivered up, and a receipt for the residue endorsed on another, he marks, by direction of <em>Beatty, </em>the judgment to <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>use. This comprises every title of the transaction in the presence of the parties. ' The judgment having afterwards been found worth\u00bb less, a common friend calls on <em>Jackson, </em>who appears to think himself liable (the. witness does not say <em>to whom) </em>for the amount' of. the judgment; and he afterwards attempts to collect the money from <em>Lambert. </em>Now it is not pretended, that there was any implied contract of warranty, on which <em>Crawford </em>could have recourse to <em>Jackson; </em>and it has already been twice decided, that the facts which happened at the'time of the transfer, give no colour to the. pretext of a special agreement. Indeed, those facts \u00e1re not relied on by <em>Crawford </em>himself, who claims the inference of such \u00e1n agreement, from <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>subsequent admission of liability to some one. But this admission is attributable to a belief, that he remained liable to <em>Beatty; </em>who, had he not agreed .to accept of the assignment <em>to Crawford </em>as satisfaction, might still have recovered his debt, on the ground, that the means of payment which were put into his hands, or (what is the same) into the hands of' a person designated by him, .had proved' unavailing. But, the delivery of the bond would be decisive proof, that he had consented to consider the assignment as satisfaction; and, if <em>Crawford, </em>also has barred himself from proceeding against <em>Beatty, </em>he cannot get round the impediment, by going against <em>Jackson, </em>who did not consent to be-, com\u00e9liab\u00ede to him. <em>Jackson, </em>therefore, was mistaken in supposing himself liable to any one; and to infer the existence of a secret agreement of warranty, from acts done under a mistaken belief .of liability, and- that, too, in the teeth of a witness who testifies to the contrary, would be forced and unnatural. A jury may make all natural and reasonable deductions; but, they cannot madly assume facts at pleasure, and without the colour .of evidence.- The subsequent conduct of <em>Jackspn </em>is attributable to an imaginary liability to <em>Beatty, </em>not to the consciousness of a' secret agreement with <em>Crawford, </em>for which there is not the least ground of suspicion. It seems, therefore, that the judge Who tried the cause did right in directing the jury, that the refusal to join in the demurrer, was a waiver of the evidence.
