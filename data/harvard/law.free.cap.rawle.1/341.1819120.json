The second discontinuance., by the attorney; was no better. It was after the reference; after the cause was out of court; Discontinuance is, like a nonsuit, an act of the court, and-will- not be permitted when injurious to the other party. The second writ is for the same cause. It is not alleged there was any mistake in the first action. The plan of ending the suit already brought, and commencing another in <em>Philadelphia, </em>was merely for the-advantage of the plaintiff, and to the great detriment of the defendant. He had incurred all the expense and trouble of entering the rule of reference, serving the notice, employing counsel, and preparing for the trial.. He was under the protection of the law in the act of serving the rule, when the new writ was taken out-against him. Suppose leave to discontinue, had been applied for under these circumstances, would it have been granted? Certainly , not. And if the court would hot permit the thing to be done if asked for, they will not sanction it when attempted without their permission. The defendant had the right of pleading the pendency of the former proceedings in abatement of the new writ. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>So, a defalcation might have been offered. AH these fair and legal advantages are taken away from him. by the decision of the Circuit Court. Payment of the costs could be no amends. The plaintiff had made his election, arid is bound by it. The bank chose to sue in <em>Dauphin </em>county. Besides,' the'cause was .out of court, and not subject to a discontinuance. The jurisdiction of the arbitrators had attached. The plaintiff\u2019s only remedy against the award was by appeal, according .to the act .of assembly. <em>Bigler and Stall </em>v. <em>Landis, </em>in this court, <em>Lancaster, May, </em>1825, (MSS.) decided, that a cause under a rule of reference, cannot be put down for trial in court. Reference, puts a cause out of court, and an .award is a record, and a judgment, upon which execution issues. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>White, 4 </em>Serg. <em>&amp; Rawle, </em>135. The court below shall not correct an award of arbitrators, though illegal' on the face of it. <em>Post </em>v. <em>Sweet, </em>8 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle, </em>391. <em>Girard </em>v. <em>Gettig, </em>2 <em>Binn. </em>234. The plaintiff is not permitted to withdraw his suit to the injury of the defendant. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Culbertson, 11 </em>Serg. <em>&amp; Rawle, </em>59.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"At9\"><em>Shunk, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AK1\">The .question is, whether, by law, the plaintiff co.uld discontinue. Circumstances are mentioned in the argument, which, from want of instruction, can neither be admitted nor denied. If a new suit has been brought for the same cause, let the defendant plead to it the pendency of the first action, provided the discontinuance is invalid. The notice served upon the bank, to produce their books before the arbitrators, at <em>Harrisburg, </em>is a very sufficient answer to the complaint of oppression, and a very good reason for preferring to haye the cause decided nearer home, rather than in <em>Philadelphia. </em>A plaintiff may always sue. in any manner most convenient to himself, provided it be- permitted by the law. The warrant directed to Mr. Fahnestock','the prothonotary, from the bank, being filed, was itself a discontinuance. It would be'strange if the clerk may act for his principal in any thing else\u2014may enter judgments, and administer the oath on appeal\u2014and' yet may'not enter on'the docket the'substance of a pap\u00e9r filed in the office, under the hand and seal of a party. But the second discontinuance, the formality of which, appears to be unexceptionable, was entered pn the record, not only before the arbitrators met, but one day at le\u00e1st before they were nominated. No declaration was filed, no proceedings in the cause had, no costs -incurred, except by the defendant himself, and' those were all paid by the plaintiff. 'It is agreed, there are cases where one cannot discontinue his own process; as in replevin, or after a special verdict, or a demurrer, or. plea, of defalcation, or after arbitrators have met, and their opinions have been discovered, or a jury is ready at the bar to give a verdict; and,.perhaps, after arbitrators have been chosen. With these exceptions) not one of which has the least possible bearing upon the case before the court, a plaintiff, upon, paying costs, may go out of court at his own \u2022 option as readily as he may come in. ' It is said, the ca\u00fcse .was out of court by the reference. What is contended for is, that the dis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>continuance was not an act of the \u25a0 court, nor an act in court; and, that a cause referred, is not. out of the reach of the parties: And further, that by our practice, there is no- substantial difference in reason or law, between a nonsuit in court and a discontinuance out of court, They, are but different modes of effecting the same thing; the giving up of a man\u2019s own action. The cases relied on by the appellant only prove, that'while a rule of reference is depending, a cause cannot be proceeded on in court; and, that when arbitrators have been'rightly appointed, their award is irreversible, except by appeal: He cited <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>White, </em>4 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle, </em>141. 1 <em>Tidd. Pr. </em>628. <em>Jac. Law Dict. verb. Discontinuance. Renner </em>v, <em>Marshal, </em>1 <em>Wheaton, </em>215.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b346-4\">Smith, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A3f\">(after shortly stating the facts,) delivered the opinion of the court. ,. .</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">I consider the discontinuance of this suit, on the 28th day of <em>July, </em>1828, by <em>Charles Snider, </em>irregular and void. ' The authority to discontinue, was to <em>Obed Fahnestock, </em>perspnally, and ought to have been strictly .pursued. <em>Charles Snider </em>had no authority from the bank to discontinue their suit, or move <em>in the </em>action; he, in fact, in this respect, was a stranger to-the bank; and at the time he'recorded, or entered the discontinuance, had nothing before him, showing any authority to him for doing so. If so, his act was void, and could not operate as.a discontinuance of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The right of a party to discontinue his suit, under proper restrictions, is not denied;-indeed, generally speaking,\u2019 if is the right of the-party, but is not always a matter of course, for the plaintiff will not be permitted ,to discontinue where he will gain an advantage by it; nor will' he be indulged in doing so, if prejudicial to his opponent, or when le.ading to vexation or oppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">In <em>England, </em>in the King\u2019s Bench\u2019 and Common Pleas, it is generally done by obtaining.a side .bar rule 44 for leave to discontinue the action upon the payment of costs.\u201d But from the case, of <em>Belchier </em>v. <em>Gansell, </em>reported in 4 <em>Burr. </em>2502, not cited at the bar, it is dear, that the rule to discontinue will not be granted, if it be -intended to oppress the defendant by another suit. To me it appears, the case\u2019of <em>Belchier </em>v. <em>Gansell, </em>if not exactly the same as the one before us, is very analogous to it. . In that case, a discontinuance had been entered on- a side bar rule, and.then the plaintiff arrested the defendant again on the very same bonds, only laying the new suit in <em>Middlesex </em>instead of <em>Bondon; </em>but on motion, the discontinuance-was set aside, on the ground, that it was a <em>trick, </em>and an unwarrantable-conduct- in' the attorney, and that it ought not to have the intended effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">In this country, in our own courts, the law is established in the same way, In <em>Pollock </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>3 <em>Yeates, </em>42, Chief Justice Shippen says, discontinuances are the acts' of th.e court, and subject to their discretion. And in <em>Broom </em>v. <em>Fox, 2 </em>Yeates, 531, the court say, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number><em>a </em>Regularly, there can be no discontinuance without-leave of .the court.\u201d In addition to these-cases, there are others, which, by a parity of reason, bear on the present case. In <em>Wikoff </em>v. <em>Perot, </em>1 <em>Yeates, 38, </em>and <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Winchester, </em>2 <em>Yeates, </em>529, it is decided, that the' defendant cannot withdraw his plea, at the time of trial, to give him the benefit of the conclusion to the jury, without the leave of the court; or, wherever trouble or expense hias been incurred by any plea of the defendant\u2019s, the.court will not give leave to retract the plea. So,.in <em>M'Cullough </em>v. M'Cullough, 1 <em>Binn. 214, </em>after an inquest has returned, that the rents and.profits will pay in seven years, the plaintiff eannot discontinue his <em>Fieri Facias, </em>and take out a new one, without leave of the court.- I take the result of this doctrine to be, that courts will protect their suitors from vexation, oppression, or an undue advantage, and will not suffer either party to. do any act which m\u00e1y have this tend\u00e9ncy. \u25a0 In this case, the advantage the plaintiffs proposed to themselves, must be obvious to all, for by discontinuing the suit. in <em>Dauphin </em>_ county, where the defendant was at home, and by suing him immediately for. the same cause of action in <em>Philadelphia, </em>where the plaintiffs resided, they would, of course, get rid of some inconvenience, expense, and trouble; to all which, the defendant would necessarily be-exposed, if compelled to attend at <em>Philadelphia.- </em>I would then ask, was this not a contrivance, or an attempt on the part of the plaintiffs, not only to gain an advantage over their opponent, but was it not also calculated to vex, and oppress, and expose him to unnecessary expense and inconvenience? Whenever, therefore, it appears a party discontinues one suit, for the purpose, merely, of instituting another for the same cause of action elsewhere) the court, on motion, will-set aside the discontinuance, and reinstate the former suit, and subject the party to the. consequences of his. own acts. Here the plaintiffs had chosen the place and the tribunal where, and before which, to sue their debtor; having done, so) the defendant, on his part, as he had a right, moved in the suit, and filed his determination of record to have the suit decided by arbitrators, of which, he noticed the. plaintiffs; but, b\u00e9fore he had'returned home from this service, the plaintiffs .gave directions to discontinue their suit: it was discontinued by one not authorized, and .without the permission of the court. Under these circumstances) I am not disposed to favour the discontinuance of a suit. The rule to arbitrate was not stricken from the record, but remained on the-same when the discontinuance was entered. In the case of <em>Landis </em>v. <em>Bigler, </em>(I believe not reported,) in which a rule to arbitrate had been taken out, but never acted, on, but still remained on record, and the cas\u00e9 afterwards tried, and a verdict and judgment rendered for the plaintiff, this court, on error, reversed the judgment, declaring the law to\" be, that whilst the rule to arbitrate remained, the cause was out of court. If this be so, and the discontinuance of a suit .be the act of the court, then there could be no discohtinuance in the suit before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>us., The arbitrators were afterwards appointed and met, (the bank having been previously duly notified of the time and place of their meeting,) made an award, and filed the same of record, according to law. The act of assembly, under which these proceedings'were had, directs, that the report of the arbitrators shall be entered on the docket of the prothonotary, and from the time of such entry, shall have the effect of a judgment against the party against whom it is made, \u00e1nd be a lien on the party\u2019s real estate, until such judgr ment be reversed <em>on an appeal; </em>and the appeal is .to be made within twenty days after the entry of the 'award.' In the case before us, the plaintiffs did'not appeal; but'oh the,8th day of <em>Jlpril, </em>1829, moved the Circuit Court to strike off the rule of reference, and the subsequent proceedings, which motion the court-granted. Upon the whole, then, this'court is of opinion, that .where it appears a discontinuance is entered with a view to vex and oppress a defendant, by suing him elsewhere for the same cause of action, and the party,, under such circumstances, applies to the court to sanction the discontinuance of the suit, and set aside all subsequent proceedings in the cause, the application should not succeed, unless founded in justice and equity; and not, as in the present case, where an advantage is the.obvious, and necessary-consequence to the plaintiffs, and great-expense, besides-inconvenience to the defendant. The judgment is, therefore, to be, reversed, and the award to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"AXd\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
