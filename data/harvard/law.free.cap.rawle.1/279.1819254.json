Under these circumstances the death of the husband was no revocation of the' power. 2 <em>Vern. </em>559. <em>1 Eq. Ca. Ab. </em>45.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b281-6\">\n<em>Barnitz, contra,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A03\">answered, that although the power of attorney was certainly irrevocable during the life of the husband, yet after his death, his dominion over his wife\u2019s choses in action ceased, and the plaintiff standing in his place, is not entitled to recover. He cited <em>Free, in Ch. </em>125. 8 <em>Wheat. </em>175, 201. <em>Co. Litt. </em>52. <em>Wills. </em>105, 565.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b281-8\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9B\">A letter of attorney maybe irrevocable, and contain an assignment of the thing, to be recovered, as undoubtedly was the cas\u00e9 here. It is certain also, that any disposition of a wife\u2019s chose in action which, is substantially an assignment for valuable consideration, will bar her right. The assignee, however, must be a purchaser, else he will stand in the place of the husband, and failing to reduce the chose to possession in the lifetime of the husband, the wife\u2019s right will survive. In other words, the husband may sell his wife\u2019s chose in action, but ..cannot give it away freed from the incidents of the marriage. This distinction rests on the indisputable authority of <em>Burnett </em>v. <em>Kinnaston, </em>(2 <em>Vern. </em>401,) <em>Garforth </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>(2 <em>Ves. </em>675,) <em>Bates </em>v. <em>Dandy, </em>(2 <em>Atk. </em>207,) and many other cases. In <em>Jewson </em>v. <em>Moulson, </em>(2 <em>Atk. </em>417,) Lord Hakdwicke says it is difficult to reconcile the cases on the subject of the wife\u2019s property in action, but that one thing is clear throughout, if the husband make a voluntary assignment of it,, the assignee will stand in the .place of the husband. And in <em>Packer </em>v. <em>Wyndham, (Prec. in Ch. </em>412,) the reason is said to be because a chose in action is not assignable at law; and, without a valuable consideration paid, equity will not interpose against the conjugal rights of the wife. An equitable assignment is a declaration of trust, <em>(Co. Litt. </em>232, <em>note </em>1,) or rather an agreement that the assignee shall receive the money to his own use, which equity will execute, or not according to circumstances, <em>(Pow. on Cont. </em>191, 192,) but never in favour of a bare volunteer, except against the assignor or those claiming under him, (1 <em>Fonb. </em>203,) and not consequently against a wife, who claims paramount. Hence, I apprehend, the difference between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>an equitable assignment which requires payment of \u00bf consideration, and a release which is effectual at law without receipt of the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">That an assignment in discharge of a debt is on valu\u00e1ble consideration, and that an assignment as a pledge or'collateral security is not, was decided by this court in <em>Petrie v. Clarke, </em>(11 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>377.) Now what 'consideration was there here? The assignment was clearly as a collateral security, the assignor remaining liable till the debt should be discharged by actual payment. No other.terms were imposed than that the assignee should account for the surplus after satisfaction had. The assignment neither was a benefit to the assignor, nor a prejudice to the assignee. \u25a0 It rested on a moral obligation which binds to payment of debts, and which, \u25a0 though a good foundation- for an express contract, would be .insufficient to raise a promise by implication of law. The assignment, \u2022 therefore, was on good consideration merely, which is insufficient to sustain it against any one but the representatives of the assignor.</p>\n<p id=\"ARr\">\u2022 Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
