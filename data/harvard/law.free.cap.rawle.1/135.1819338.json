The language of the act of assembly is not the same as that of the <em>English </em>statute, and a different construction must be the consequence. The vyords, \u201c all actions of debt for arrearages of rent, <em>except </em>the proprietaries\u2019 quit r.ents,\u201d can only'be satisfied by including the present action.. The .words of-the English. statute are simply, f\u2018.all actions of debt for arrearages of rent,\u201d <em>(Ruffh. Stat. vol. </em>3, 101;) and\u201eth,e judicial view taken of them would perhaps include this case, if the old 'decisi\u00f3n in' <em>Hutton\u2019s Reports, (.Freeman </em>v.1 <em>Stacye,~ page </em>109,) be law, which is very-doubtful; but there-can scarcely be a doubt that those who took the <em>English </em>statute for,their guide intended to create a difference, by the use of words, \u201c except the proprietaries\u2019 quit rents,\u201d as it is certain that the addition was not accidental; for-it appears, by a reference to the Votes of Assembly, (vol. <em>2, </em>page 124,) that .the act of assembly was prepared und\u00e9r the direction of a lawyer. It is impossible not to apply, in relation to this alteration in the language of an act of-assembly, evidently eopied from' the statute of <em>James, </em>th\u00e9 reasoning of Chief Justice Tilghman, in <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>Tees, </em>1 <em>Finn. </em>455,. upon the <em>English </em>statute -of frauds and our act of assembly upon the same subject. And this construction is fortified by the fact, that it was unnecessary to say a word upon the proprietaries\u2019 quit rents; for they would have been protected completely under the der cisi\u00f3n in <em>Hutton, </em>which took place in 1652, and was printed in 1682, more than thirty years before the act of assembly was passed. If the additional words be considered as merely evidence of the intention of the legislature, they are conclusive, and the clause will be properly read: \u201cAll actions of debt for arrears of rent shall be barred by the statute of limitations, except where such actions are brought by the proprietary for, arrearages of quit rent. \u201d . It is the more, reasonable construction, because, after all, the obligation to pay is founded upon the occupation of the land.by-the lessee,\u2014the indenture is mere inducement, and need not be set out in the declaration. And, though the party might recover in <em>covenant </em>upon the' deed without occupation, he never could in <em>debt. </em>1 <em>Saund. </em>39.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-6\"><em>Second. </em>As to the pleadings.\u2014Debt lies for use and occupation,, where the demise is not under seal, 1 <em>Chit. Pl. </em>98, because <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>would lie. But the count for use and occupation is not sustainable where there is a demise by deed: it is meant to help a doubtful case, (2 <em>Chit. PL </em>431.) which this was not, as <em>Shoemaker </em>had the'deed himself, and' replied that the demise was by deed, to the plea of the statute. This whole declaration would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>sustained only by showing a parol demise; though the <em>first </em>count, standing by itself,-would do, if- the holding turned 'out to be by deed. The course here would have been for the plaintiff, as there was no demurrer -to the declaration, to have nonprossed, the second \u25a0 count. \" ' v</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-5\">The substance of this replication\u2014which is very inartificially drawn\u2014is a departure from the case made by the declaration, <em>,(Marshall\u2019s Argument in Trueman </em>v. <em>Hurst, </em>1 <em>T. R. </em>40;) and the very mischief - produced, by a departure has occurred here. .When the plea meets the case made -by the declaration, the plaintiff shows another cause of action by his replication., It abandons the first case made to present another. The Lime-kiln case, (1 <em>Chit. Pl. </em>635,) is in <em>point exactly. </em>The replication tenders us an issue upon a fact not set forth in the declaration at all, and perfectly immaterial, if the argument on the first point be right. \u25a0</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b139-6\"><em>Shoemaker, </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8J\">This action is debt for rent in arrear reserved by indenture, and was brought to recover of the plaintiff in error seven years\u2019 rent for a lot in <em>Moyamensing </em>township. The rent in this case is due by the le'ase. <em>Salmon </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>1 <em>Saund. </em>203, <em>n. </em>1. <em>Duppu </em>v. <em>Mayo, </em>Id. 276, <em>n. </em>1 and 2, <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Jaques, 2 Doug. </em>461; and authorities cited in that case. The declaration contains two'counts: the first sets forth the orderly parts of the lease\u2014the day of making it\u2014the annual rent the tenant is to pay\u2014the length of time he is to possess'the land;\u2014and concludes <em>per quod actio accrevit. 1 </em>Chitty, 346. The second is put in without stating the loealsiluation of the premises, and is therefore mer\u00e9ly surplusage, (1 <em>Chitty, </em>618,) and forms no part of the case. 2 <em>Chitty, </em>223, <em>notes d. and p. </em>In no part of the <em>narr. </em>is it stated that the lease is in writing, though, to entitle the plaintiff in error to \u25a0recover, he must prove it so in evidence. It is the only instance where a deed may be -given in evidence in support of a count in which it is not mentioned.; 1 <em>Chitty, </em>348. Authorities need not be cited to show, that at common law leases were valid without writing. Our act of assembly <em>(Purd. Dig. </em>516,) makes them invalid three years after the making,'if they \u00e1re not put in writing; Then the question occurs, as this lease is for more than three years, whether the act of assembly has altered the manner of pleading, if the requisites of the act have been complied with. . That it has not, the ' authorities are abundant to .show. The law is, that where a statute makes vvriting necessary to the validity of a. matter, when it' was not so at th.\u00e9 common law, the manner of pleading'is. not thereby altered: it may be given in evidence. 1 <em>Chitty, </em>348. <em>Atty et al. </em>v. <em>Parish et al. </em>4 <em>Bos. &amp; Pull. </em>104, 109. <em>Birch v. Bellamy, </em>12 <em>Mod. </em>540. 2 <em>Chitty, </em>223, <em>note d. </em>6 <em>Bac, Ab. </em>395. The pleas of the plaintiff in error are <em>nil debet, </em>and the statute of limitations. Issue is joined on the first. The second is a plea, because no estoppel appeared on the record, but the defendant in error replied in. bar to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>it, that the rent is reserved by indenture, and prayed the judgment of the court if the defendant ought to be admitted against his deed to, plead that plea. The demurrer.to this replication acknowledges the deed. <em>Stephens on Pl. </em>159, 160. The defendant in error joins in demurrer, relying upon the estoppel now on the record, and prays judgment of his debt and damages. <em>Veale </em>v. Warner, 1 <em>Saund. 325, note </em>4. <em>Speake </em>v. <em>Richards, Hob. </em>206, 207. It is not merely matter of form to conclude an estoppel without <em>relying on </em>it, for by not doing so the party may often lose the advantage of the estoppel which the law gives him. Now, the question occurs, whether the defendant in error has not, in his replication to the plaintiff in error\u2019s plea of the statute of limitations departed from his case? What is his case? It is,that.the plaintiff in error leased a lot of him- for seven- years at thirty dollars a year, and that the whole rent is due. The replication says the lease is in writing, under his hand and.seal. Does not the replication support and fortify this case? How can it be said that the defendant in error has committed a departure, when the replication supports and fortifies the declaration? 1 <em>Chitty, </em>619, 622. <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Hodges, 2 Saund. </em>84, <em>a. Note </em>1. Why is not <em>nil debet </em>a plea when the deed is declared on in the first-instance? Because it is not necessary to declare on .it at all; and you shall not.deprive the party'of the advantage which the law gives him. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>1 <em>Saund. </em>39, <em>n. 3. </em>1. <em>Chitty, </em>477. The remaining question on the record is, whether-the statute of limitations is a bar to the action. \u25a0 It is no bar, because the action is <em>grounded on a contract' with specialty. Purd. Dig. </em>530. <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Stacie, Hutton\u2019s Rep. </em>109. <em>Hodsden </em>v. <em>Harridge, 2 Saund. </em>66. <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Bickley, </em>13 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>395.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The opinion of the -court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b140-6\">.Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKa\">The act of 1713, -is copied nearly word,for word from the 21 <em>Jac. </em>1, c. 16; and, although the letter ext\u00e9nds to all actions of debt for rent, it has been determined that the statute is a \u25a0 bar to the recovery of rent reserved only-on leases by parol; a lease by indenture being \u00e9qual to a specialty. <em>(Hutt. </em>109, <em>pl. </em>2.) The same principle is admitted in <em>Hodsden </em>v. <em>Harridge, </em>(2 <em>Saund. </em>66.) And this construction is, no doubt, in accordance with the actual intent of the legislature; for it would have been nugatory to protect the lessee from ah action of debt, and leave him exposed to' an action of covenant, clearly maintainable on - the indenture, to which the statute does not extend.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">The remaining point is equally simple. It is settled, -that in debt for rent, the- plaintiff may state the substance of the demise without declaring-on the deed; and where it is doubtful whether the lease were by indenture or parol, it is usual to do so, adding a count for use and occupation by way of further caution. (2 <em>Chitty on Plead. 223, note d.) </em>And to such a declaration the plaintiff may plead <em>nil \u25a0 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number><em>debet; </em>or, as no estoppel appears of record, <em>nil habuit in, tenementis, </em>which is <em>prima facie </em>a good plea, and the plaintiff must-thereupon reply that the lease was by indenture; for if he'replies a sufficient estate in the premises generally, he waives the benefit of the estoppel. (1 <em>Saund. </em>276, <em>note </em>1.) Here the defendant might have given the statute in evidence under <em>nil debet, (Salk. </em>278, <em>pl; </em>1;). but, having pleaded it, the plaintiff had no other course than to reply that the demise was by deed. '. The demurrer to the replication was therefore properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"ATR7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
