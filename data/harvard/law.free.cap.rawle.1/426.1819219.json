In the Court of Common Pleas the plaintiff entered a rule of reference, and the arbitrators awarded ninety-two cents in favour of the plaintiff; the defendant then appealed, and on a trial there was a verdict in favour of the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-12\">The court decided, that the defendant was entitled to recover from the plaintiff the costs of the arbitration, and also the costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>.which' subsequently accrued in court, and that the plaintiff was entitled to the costs before the justice, and if he had paid them, the amount must be deducted from the defendant\u2019s bill;</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-6\">The only question raised in the Supreme Court, was that of the costs, .which was argued by <em>Potter, </em>for the plaintiff in error, and <em>Blanchard, contra.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b427-7\">Pep.

Here he did so by a verdict and judgment on the merits; and that is the only difference. The judgment, so far as it allows the plaintiff the costs before the justice, is erroneous; but as this writ of error, is brought by the plaintiff, the defendant can have no advantage from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">Judgment affirmed. \u25a0</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
