They had used reasonable care to provide a reasonably safe place in which to work, reasonably safe appliances and instrumentalities for his work, and fit and competent persons as his co-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>laborers. The only failure in the premises arose from the operation of the machine. The machine was a fit one; its operator a competent one. The operator failed to justify the promise of his capacity and character, and was negligent. His negligence was in respect to the work of operation, and in respect to nothing else. In this work he did not represent the master. He was undertaking to perform none of the duties imposed upon the defendants. <em>Quoad </em>what he undertook to do in this regard he was a mere workman. The fact that he chanced to occupy the position of foreman is of no importance, save as that fact might tend to raise a moral presumption of his capacity and reliability. He was negligent in respect to a servant\u2019s work. The master was therefore not liable therefor. <em>McElligott </em>v. Randolph, 61 Conn. 157, 164; <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>New Haven Steamboat Co., </em>74 id. 343, 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The appeal complains that the subordinate facts found do not justify the court in finding certain of the facts we have enumerated. With this contention we cannot concern ourselves. All the conclusions referred to are conclusions of fact. Not the least so are those which are deduced from subordinate facts. No conclusion of law is involved, and no conclusion of fact is reached without evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The plaintiff also objects to the action of the court in excluding the evidence of a witness as to a conversation had with Miller, about an hour after the accident, in regard to the condition of the machine. This conversation was not offered to contradict Miller, but to show the condition of the machine. For this purpose the evidence was pure hearsay and properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
