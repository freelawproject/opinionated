At that time Mrs. Medford was sick and about to go to a hos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>pital for treatment. While there, by her direction the goods were delivered to the defendant, who left them in the house of a third party. A few months later Mrs. Medford engaged lodgings in the same house, and remained there till her death, \u25a0except for a visit to relatives in New York when she took most of the goods with her, they having been stored in the room which she was occupying.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The evidence certified up, on exceptions to the findings contains nothing calling for a correction of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">An executed gift is not necessarily revoked because the thing given subsequently comes back into the possession of the donor, whether with or without the consent of the donee.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">Nor was the gift in question affected by the death of the donor, three years afterwards, leaving no property.
