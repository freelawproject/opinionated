In the event of the death of my said wife Margarethe Fritsche, named as executrix in said will, I appoint Joseph Buths of Hartford, executor in her stead of said will and of this codicil. And I hereby ratify and confirm my aforesaid will in all respects, except so far as changed or altered by this codicil.\u201d Later still, Fritsche made another codicil revoking- the gift in the will to the plaintiff and another, and giving them, in lieu thereof, $300 each, using for this purpose the precise language of the first codicil.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-6\">The complaint alleges the making of the will and codicils which are annexed thereto as exhibits, the death of the testator, the defendant\u2019s qualification as executrix, her settlement of .the estate, the acceptance of her final account, the existence in her hands thereafter of sufficient assets to pay all legacies, the right of the plaintiff to receive $300 by virtue of the last codicil, and the defendant\u2019s neglect and refusal to pay the same to him, and prays judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-7\">To this complaint the defendant demurred, upon the ground \u201c that the said Johann L. O. Fritsche by said will gave all his property to his wife, the said Margarethe Fritsche, the defendant herein, and the $300 mentioned in the codicil was a conditional bequest, and was not to be paid to the said Herman Karl Fritsche until after the death of Margarethe Fritsche, and then only in case there was property remaining at the time of her death.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-8\">The court sustained the demurrer and thereupon rendered judgment for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b298-9\"><em>Nolle E. </em>Pierce, with whom was <em>Marcus H. </em>Holcomb, for the appellant (plaintiff).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b299-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number><em>Harrison B.

The plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery depends entirely upon the result of such construction. Neither the will itself, nor its codicils taken in connection with it, unmistakably express the testator\u2019s intention. The ambiguities in them are apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">The cardinal rule of construction with respect to wills is that the intention of the testator is to be sought after and, if not inconsistent with some established principle of law, carried into effect. This intention may be gathered not only from within the instrument itself, but also from the circumstances which surrounded the testator when the will was made, including the situation and condition of his estate, his relations to his family and beneficiaries, and their situation and condition. The construing court will put itself as far as possible in the position of the testator, in the effort to construe the uncertain language used by him in such a way as shall, conformably to the language, give force and effect to his intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">In the present case the defendant demurred to the complaint, which is barren of facts <em>aliunde </em>the will which might aid in its construction. The effect of this procedure is to impose upon him the burden of maintaining that the will was not susceptible of a construction consistent with the plaintiff\u2019s claims. If, under the accepted rules of testamentary interpretation, such a construction was possible, the plaintiff was entitled to have the will go to the court for its construction with such aid as might be furnished by proper evidence to be adduced by the parties. It certainly cannot be claimed for this will and its codicils, that their language is such that it would not bear reasonable interpretation in harmony with the plaintiff\u2019s contention. So far is this from being true, that even upon their face the plaintiff\u2019s position is one which might be urged, as it is, with no little force. If added force could be given by proper evidence tending to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>disclose the intention of- the testator, the plaintiff was entitled to it. If, on the other hand, the evidence proved to be to a contrary effect, it was the defendant\u2019s privilege to avail himself of it. In either event the court was fairly entitled to have such aid to construction as the circumstances of the case furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The demurrer was addressed to the legal effect of the will upon its face; not to the absence of any allegations in the complaint of extrinsic facts to support the construction of its provisions assumed by the plaintiff. Whether, if such facts exist, they should have been pleaded, is a point which, as it has not been presented, we do not consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">There is error in the sustaining of the demurrer and in the rendition of judgment, and the case is remanded to be proceeded with according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
