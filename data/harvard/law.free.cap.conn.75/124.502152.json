J., Baldwin, Hamkbsley, Hall and Pbentice, Js.</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b136-8\">To entitle a plaintiff to treble damages for a collision on the highway due to the defendant\u2019s violation of the law of the road (General Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 2689, 2690, Rev. of 1902, \u00a7\u00a7 2035, 2036) it is essential that the complaint should allege in some form that the defendant\u2019s vehicle was one \u201cfor the conveyance of persons,\u201d as prescribed by the statute. A description of the vehicle merely as a \u201c wagon \u201d or \u201cteam\u201d is insufficient.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b136-9\">The plaintiff, a physician, testified on his direct examination that he was driving to see a patient at the time of the collision. <em>Held </em>that upon his cross-examination he might be asked if he did not have a very large practice; also if he had not talked about the case with a person whose deposition was afterwards taken; and whether he had had any trouble with the defendant, or had said to him that he would secure his removal from his place in the post-office.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b136-10\">Argued June 3d</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Aya\">decided July 18th, 1902.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-11\">Action to recover damages for injuries resulting from a collision on the highway, brought to the City Court of Stamford and thence by the defendant\u2019s appeal to the Court of Common Pleas in Fairfield County, and tried to the jury before <em>Curtis, J.; </em>verdict for the plaintiff for $10 damages, which the court refused to treble on motion of the plaintiff, and appeal by him for alleged errors in the rulings of the court.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"A1N\">\n<em>No error.</em>\n</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-12\">The case is sufficiently stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b136-13\"><em>George P.

The plaintiff\u2019s reply denied the principal averments of the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Upon these pleadings the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $10 damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">The court properly denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for treble damages. Section 2689 of the General Statutes (Rev. 1902, \u00a7 2035) provides that when \u201c the drivers of any vehicles for the conveyance of persons shall meet each other in the public highway, each shall turn to the right and slacken his pace,\u201d etc., and that \u201c any driver who shall violate this section shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>forfeit fifteen dollars to the town, . . . and pay to the injured party his damages\u201d; and \u00a7 2690 (Rev. 1902, \u00a7 2036) provides that \u201c every driver of any such vehicle, who shall, by neglecting to conform to the preceding section, drive against another vehicle and injure its owner or any person in it, or the property of any person . . . shall pay to the party injured treble damages and costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">An essential element of the offense described in these sections, for the commission of which the payment of treble damages may be imposed as a punishment upon the offender, is the driving of \u201c vehicles for the conveyance of persons ; \u201d and to justify a judgment for such treble damages that element must be both alleged and proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">While the plaintiff might have properly alleged that the vehicle driven by the defendant was one for the conveyance of persons, without using the precise words of the statute, it was necessary for him, in order to recover treble damages, to so describe the vehicle in the complaint as to clearly bring it within the class named in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">The substituted complaint describes the vehicle driven by the defendant, and that in which the plaintiff was driving, as \u201c a wagon.\u201d They are also referred to in the complaint as \u201c teams.\u201d Since either of these words may as properly be used to designate a vehicle for the carriage of goods, as one for the conveyance of persons, neither of them nor both of them constitute a sufficiently specific description of the vehicle named in the statute to entitle the plaintiff to a judgment for treble damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">The complaint is, however, not demurrable, as it states a good cause of action for negligence at common law; and the defendant properly took advantage of the absence of an allegation that he was driving a vehicle for the conveyance of persons, by opposing the plaintiff\u2019s motion for treble damages, which motion could only be made to the court after the verdict fixing the actual damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">Practically the same question raised by this appeal, as to the sufficiency of the description of the vehicle to entitle the plaintiff to treble damages, under this statute, was decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>by this court in the recent case of <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>66 Conn. 570. In that case and in the cases of <em>Broschart </em>v. <em>Tuttle, </em>59 Conn. 1, and <em>Hotchkiss </em>v. <em>Hoy, </em>41 id. 568, the question of what allegations must be contained in the complaint to justify a judgment for such damages has been so fully considered as to require no further discussion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The plaintiff in the present case, who was a physician, having testified upon his direct examination that the collision occurred when he was driving to call on a patient, was asked upon cross-examination if he had not a very large practice, whether he had not talked about the case with a certain person who witnessed the collision and whose deposition was after-wards taken, whether he, the plaintiff, had any ill-feeling toward the defendant, and whether he had had any trouble with him or had told the defendant that he would get him removed from his place in the post-office. The last two questions were answered by the witness in the negative. All said questions were admitted against the plaintiff\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">W e discover no error in any of these rulings. Certainly the plaintiff has no cause to complain of them. The verdict was in his favor, and, although it was for a smaller sum than, the amount claimed by him, we fail to see how these rulings could have in any way affected the amount of damages awarded to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
