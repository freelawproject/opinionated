There was named on this ticket as the title of one office, \u201c Town Treasurer and Treasurer of Town Deposit Fund and School Fund.\u201d That of another office was given as \u201c Auditor of Town Accounts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">The. only ground of appeal is that these ballots were counted by the judge of the Superior Court before whom this petition was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">.. Another set of ballots for the same candidates was printed by the .same party for use at the same election, differing slightly in each of the particulars above noted from the first set, and putting the party name or - title farther above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>that of the title of the first office named. Both sets were printed in good faith, each at a different printing office, without any view of furnishing any distinguishing mark or device, and there was no mark or device on any ballot such that it could be identified and traced back to the person who cast it.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">Under these circumstances, all the ballots described were properly counted by the judge of the Superior Court, when the boxes were re-opened.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">Our election laws do not contemplate the printing of ballots by the State, or at any single printing office. The State furnishes blank paper of the proper size, indorsed \u201c Official ballot,\u201d and the names and offices are to be printed on at local printing offices, at the convenience of those interested. Under such a scheme of administration, it could not have been the intention of the General Assembly to commit to the secretary of the State power to exact the use of type precisely similar in face to those employed by the printers in setting up his circular of instruction. It is found by the trial judge that the faces of type are liable to spread by use, and that the height of type of the same kind and style often varies in different fonts. To give weight to such trifling variations in appearance would be not to support but to obstruct the privilege of free suffrage. Const, of Conn., Art. YI, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">The town treasurer, in the absence of any special appointment, 'is the treasurer of the town deposit fund; and he is also the officer to whom the comptroller of the State annually remits the town\u2019s dividend from the school fund. General Statutes, Rev. 1888, \u00a7\u00a7 189, 2229. The appellant contends that the addition to the title \u201c Town Treasurer,\u201d of the words \u201c and Treasurer of Town Deposit Fund and School Fund,\u201d is a fatal departure from the requirements of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">In support of \"this claim it is argued, first, that as these offices were created by statutes, their titles must be described precisely as they are described in those statutes when they were first enacted. No such narrow construction can properly be given to the Act of 1899. It refers to the statutes now in force. No others are accessible to the mass of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>the community. Nor, taking these as the rule of description, is every petty variation of wording, such as the omission of a <em>the, </em>or the insertion of an <em>of, </em>necessarily enough to exclude a ballot, provided the error be one committed in good faith and having no natural tendency to furnish a distinguishing mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">It is also contended that there was here an attempt to combine three offices, differently entitled, under a single title. But the town treasurer, as such, would fill them all, unless-another were elected \u201c treasurer of the town deposit fund \u201d (General Statutes, Rev. of 1888, \u00a7 44). This being so, the ticket may fairly be regarded as simply naming the town treasurer, and adding a statement of his <em>ex officio </em>functions,. as prescribed by law. This puts it on much the same ground as the title given to the office of \u201c Auditor of Town Accounts,\u201d its proper style being \u201c Auditor.\u201d General Statutes, Rev. 1888, \u00a7 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">Neither of these errors, in the absence of any wrong intent,, was enough to justify the rejection of the ballots. The party manager who searches the statutes for the proper title of an office cannot reasonably be held to perfect accuracy in every instance. In the ease at bar, the titles now in question were-printed in substantial conformity with the statutory description, and the additions to them which are the subject of exception, while unnecessary, were not sufficient to make the-ballot void, under the principles of construction applicable to those provisions of our election laws which tend towards-limiting the privileges of the elector. <em>Phelan </em>v. <em>Walsh, 62 </em>Cohn. 260, 291, 294; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bossa, </em>69 id. 335, 341; <em>Coughlin </em>v. <em>McElroy, </em>72 id. 99, 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
