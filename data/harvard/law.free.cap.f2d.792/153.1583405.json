The only issue addressed by this en banc opinion is the meaning of the so-called Haskell Amendment, which excepts from the Internal Revenue Code\u2019s definition of nondisclosable \u201creturn information\u201d \u201cdata in a form which cannot be associated with, or otherwise identify, directly or indirectly, a particular taxpayer.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103(b)(2) (1982). Specifically, we consider whether to adhere to a 1981 panel decision of this court which held that that provision removes from the defined category of protected information all material which, either in its original form or as redacted in response to a FOIA request, does not disclose the identity of the taxpayer to whom it pertains.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b239-14\">The facts of the present case are set forth in the panel opinion issued simultaneously with this opinion. For present purposes, it suffices to recite that the central issue in the appeal is the adequacy of the IRS\u2019s search for requested records; that one of the principal points bearing upon that issue is whether certain files could reasonably be excluded from the search as containing only \u201creturn information\u201d; and that the latter point depends to a considerable extent upon whether redaction (specifically, elimination of portions of documents that would disclose the taxpayer\u2019s identity) removes the material from the protected category.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-15\">After the case had been briefed and argued before the assigned panel, the . court en banc, on its own motion, requested supplemental briefing and, on December 5, 1985, heard oral argument limited to the following issue:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Should the Court adhere to the interpretation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103(b)(2) adopted by the panel opinion in <em>Neufeld v. IRS, </em>646 F.2d 661, 665 (D.C.Cir.1981), or should it adopt a different interpretation, in particular that announced by the Seventh Circuit in <em>King v. IRS, </em>688 F.2d 488, 490-94 (7th Cir.1982)?</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Briefs <em>amicus curiae </em>were received from the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Washington and from Professor John L. Neufeld and the Freedom of Information Clearinghouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">In relevant part, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103(a) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">Returns and return information shall be confidential, and except as authorized by this title\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\">(1) no officer or employee of the United States,____ shall disclose any return or return information obtained by him in any manner in connection with his service as such an officer or an employee or otherwise or under the provisions of this section____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">Willful violation of this provision is a felony. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7213(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">\u201cReturn information\u201d is defined in the statute as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-13\">(A) a taxpayer\u2019s identity, the nature, source, or amount of his income, payments, receipts, deductions, exemptions, credits, assets, liabilities, net worth, tax liability, tax withheld, deficiencies, over-assessments, or tax payments, whether the taxpayer\u2019s return was, is being, or will be examined or subject to other investigation or processing, or any other data, received by, recorded by, prepared by, furnished to, or collected by the Secretary with respect to a return or with respect to the determination of the existence, or possible existence, of liability (or the amount thereof) of any person under this title for any tax, penalty, interest, fine, forfeiture, or other imposition, or offense, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-16\">(B) any part of any written determination or any background file document relating to such written determination (as such terms are defined in section 6110(b)) which is not open to public inspection under section 6110,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOi\">\n<em>but such term does not include data in a form which cannot be associated with, or otherwise identify, directly or indirectly, a particular taxpayer.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-17\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103(b)(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-18\">The last clause in the defining paragraph is the Haskell Amendment, so called because it was inserted into the committee-proposed bill through a floor amendment introduced by that Senator. On the basis of that clause, the Ninth Circuit held in 1979 that data that do not identify a particular taxpayer because names, identifying numbers and other similar information have been deleted are not return information. <em>Long v. IRS, </em>596 F.2d 362 (9th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 917, 100 S.Ct. 1851, 64 L.Ed.2d 271 (1980). In a later case before this court in which the IRS had not briefed the question, the panel found it necessary to reach the issue and, without analysis of its own, followed what was at the time the only court of appeals precedent. <em>Neufeld v. IRS, </em>646 F.2d 661, 665 (D.C.Cir.1981). In so doing, the panel observed that \u201c[w]hile the IRS wishes to reserve the question of the proper statutory definition of return information for another day, it appears to concede, for this case only, that [no harmful error occurred] if in fact [the district court] employed the definition of return information articulated in <em>Long.\u201d Id. </em>(footnote omitted). Subsequently, the Seventh Circuit reached a conclusion different from <em>Long, </em>holding that the statute \u201cprotects from disclosure all non-amalgamated items listed in subsection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>(b)(2)(A), and that the Haskell Amendment provides only for the disclosure of statistical tabulations which are not associated with or do not identify particular taxpayers.\u201d <em>King v. IRS, </em>688 F.2d 488, 493 (7th Cir.1982). The newly emerged circuit conflict has induced us to reconsider the position stated in our 1981 panel decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The starting point of analysis, of course, is the text of the provision at issue, which, we agree with the Seventh Circuit, is ill suited to achieve the result pronounced in <em>Long. </em>It would be most peculiar to catalogue in such detail, in subparagraph (A) of the body of the definition, the specific items that constitute \u201creturn information\u201d <em>(e.g., </em>\u201cincome, payments, receipts, deductions, exemptions, credits, assets, liabilities, net worth, tax liability, tax withheld, deficiencies, over-assessments, or tax payments, ... or any other data, received by, recorded by, prepared by, furnished to, or collected by the Secretary with respect to a return\u201d) while leaving to an afterthought the major qualification that none of those items counts unless it identifies the taxpayer. Such an intent would more naturally have been expressed not in an exclusion (\u201cbut such term does not include ... \u201d) but in the body of the definition \u2014 by stating, for example, that \u201cthe term \u2018return information\u2019 means the following information that can be associated with or identify a particular taxpayer: ____\u201d If the intended scope of the exclusion is as broad as <em>Long </em>holds, the structure of the provision is akin to defining mankind as \u201call mammals in the world, but excluding those that are not relatively hairless bipeds with the power of abstract reasoning.\u201d While such a form of definition is conceivable, it would constitute \u201ceveryday language\u201d (as the dissent characterizes it, Dissent at 174) only for one of Lewis Carroll\u2019s characters, and it hardly takes \u201ctalmudic dissection!]\u201d or \u201cmicroscopic scrutiny,\u201d <em>id., </em>to reject it as implausible.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">The <em>Long </em>interpretation produces a similarly mindless consequence in subparagraph (B) of the definition of return information. That subparagraph includes within the definition of return information IRS-written determinations and related background files that are <em>not </em>open to public inspection under \u00a7 6110. The latter section excludes from the public inspection requirement not only identifying data, \u00a7 6110(c)(1), but many other matters, such as trade secrets, \u00a7 6110(c)(4), information prepared for the use of an agency regulating financial institutions, \u00a7 6110(c)(6), and (with respect to most written determinations) material relating to a taxpayer\u2019s change of annual accounting period, \u00a7 6110(g)(5)(B)(ii). It would be absurd to incorporate these exclusions so precisely into the body of the definition of return information, and then, in the immediately following clause, to write all of them back out \u2014 except the identifying data exclusion (\u00a7 6110(c)(1)), which is not deleted by the Haskell exclusion but merely rendered entirely redundant.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">We also agree with the Seventh Circuit that the formulation of the Haskell provision itself suggests something other than merely the absence of identifying information. It would be strange to express the latter thought by excluding \u201cdata <em>in a form </em>which cannot be associated with, or otherwise identify ... a particular taxpayer\u201d (emphasis added). The emphasized phrase would be superfluous for that purpose, as reading the provision without it will demonstrate. A more natural formulation for the purposes which <em>Long </em>assigns would be similar to that contained in the provision of FOIA that \u201can agency may <em>delete identifying details,\u201d </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(2) (emphasis added); or similar to the formulation used elsewhere in this same Subchapter of the Internal Revenue Code, that no publication shall \u201cpermit ... information ... to be associated with, or otherwise identify, directly or indirectly, a particular taxpayer,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6108(c). Moreover, it is curious usage to describe an item of return information (a particular taxpayer\u2019s tax \u201cpayments,\u201d for example) as having one \u201cform\u201d when made public in a document that includes the taxpayer\u2019s name, and taking a different \u201cform\u201d when made public in the very same document with only the name deleted.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>What is suggested by the language of the provision itself is strongly confirmed by other provisions of \u00a7 6103. Subsections 6103(f)(1) &amp; (2) and subsection 6103(f)(4)(A) permit disclosure of return information to certain committees of Congress, and subsection 6103(f)(4)(B) to the full Senate or House; under all four provisions, however, unless the taxpayer consents in writing the disclosure must be made to the pertinent committee or house \u201csitting in closed executive session\u201d when it concerns \u201creturn information which can be associated with, or otherwise identify, directly or indirectly, a particular taxpayer.\u201d If <em>Long's </em>interpretation of the Haskell Amendment is adopted, the exception in these provisions completely consumes the rule. That is to say, if return information consists, as <em>Long </em>says, of <em>nothing but </em>identifying data, then <em>whenever </em>it is provided under these provisions the receiving committee or house must sit in executive session. Quite plainly, these provisions contemplate return information that is nonidentifying.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">In addition to clear textual indications, rejection of the <em>Long </em>interpretation is suggested by assessment of plausible legislative intent. It is of course true, as two of the <em>amici </em>have asserted, that there is no reason \u201cwhy Congress would have wanted to forbid the disclosure of information which would not threaten the privacy of individual taxpayers.\u201d Brief of Neufeld and Freedom of Information Clearinghouse at 5. But it is also true that the threat to privacy is <em>not </em>entirely eliminated by agency and (ultimately) judicial assessment that certain deletions in response to a FOIA request will suffice to conceal the taxpayer\u2019s identity. The protection afforded by such assessment is always problematic, not only because of the risk of human error, but also because the assessment depends to a large extent upon uninformed estimations as to what data the requester possesses. Consider, for example, a FOIA request for the amounts and beneficiaries of all charitable deductions claimed by taxpayers within a particular postal ZIP code area during a particular tax year. That information would normally not identify the charitable gift of any particular taxpayer; but it would do so if the requester had been told by his neighbor that the latter made a charitable gift last year of $2,775.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">For most information possessed by the government, Congress has determined that the risk of occasional unknowing disclosure of facts entitled to be withheld under FOIA is outweighed by the benefits of openness. But it has not made that judgment for all information. <em>See, e.g., </em>50 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 431 (West Supp.1985) (exempting Central Intelligence Agency operational files from FOIA). It is significant that FOIA\u2019s nonidentification protection has not been considered adequate for the other major category of personal information that the government directs all its citizens to provide: Under the same Exemption 3 at issue here, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3), all census data are protected from disclosure, whether or not they identify the individual to whom they pertain. <em>See Baldridge v. Shapiro, </em>455 U.S. 345, 102 S.Ct. 1103, 71 L.Ed.2d 199 (1982). We think similarly heightened protection was intended with regard to tax information, in order to encourage the full, voluntary self-assessment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>of taxes upon which our internal revenue system largely depends.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The intent to provide this increased assurance of confidentiality is conveyed by the detailed provisions of \u00a7 6108 rigidly restricting the use of tax information within the government itself, and by the severe criminal penalty (up to five years imprisonment) for unlawful disclosure. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7213(a)(1). It is particularly apparent, however \u2014 and the incompatibility of the <em>Long </em>interpretation is particularly clear \u2014 from the provisions of \u00a7 6110, which set forth procedures for public inspection of IRS written determinations and related background files. Unlike most governmental information obtainable under the Freedom of Information Act, which one or more members of the public may be interested in for reasons that amount to no more than curiosity, there is special reason for making written determinations public, since without such a requirement agencies could develop \u201csecret law.\u201d Thus, FOIA requires such determinations not merely to be provided upon written request, but to be made available in the agency\u2019s reading room, and to be reflected in a current index that is publicly distributed. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(2). Yet in the case of tax information, \u00a7 6110 provides <em>greater </em>protection against improper disclosure of this publicly essential information than FOIA provides against disclosure of data in which there is no reason to posit any public need to know. Specifically, the subject of the written determination is given a right to prior written notice of the Secretary\u2019s intention to disclose, an administrative remedy to prevent the disclosure, a cause of action in the Tax Court if that remedy is unsuccessful, a right to intervene in any action seeking disclosure, and even a cause of action for damages in the Claims Court for improper disclosure. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6110(f), (i). In the judicial proceedings to restrain disclosure or to require further disclosure, there is no requirement similar to the provision of FOIA that \u201cthe burden is on the agency to sustain\u201d the withholding. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B). It would be absurd to provide such guarantees against disclosure of identifying information in the context of written determinations while relying upon no more than the FOIA protections (through <em>Long\u2019s </em>interpretation of the Haskell Amendment) when a request for less publicly important return information is received.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The dissent criticizes our use of standard textual analysis on the ground that, while it may be appropriate where Congress \u201clabored arduously over each choice of word and each comma,\u201d it is improper \u201cwhen the legislative history shows that a provision was injected into the bill at the tail end of the process.\u201d Dissent at 174. We need not pause to consider the theoretical deficiencies of such an approach to statutory construction, since it is in any case not properly applicable here. The (ill-considered) Haskell Amendment was not adopted separately and distinctly from the other provisions that we seek to reconcile with it. As we noted earlier, it was not an amendment to a preexisting law, but an amendment to the bill as originally presented on the floor. Congress did not pass into law the Haskell amendment <em>by itself, </em>but as part and parcel of an exceedingly detailed and complex legislative scheme, on which it <em>had </em>\u201clabored arduously over each choice of word and each comma.\u201d Since all the provisions were enacted simultaneously, there is no plausible justification for focusing on the hastily considered nature of one of them and ignoring the carefully crafted character of the remainder.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">In fact, far from militating in favor of the broad <em>Long </em>interpretation, the last-minute and cursory manner in which the Haskell Amendment was proposed and adopted greatly augments the implausibility of that interpretation. The massive effect of the amendment, if <em>Long </em>is correct, was to change the scope of protection from all \u201creturn information,\u201d as carefully and expansively described in \u00a7 6103(b)(2), to merely all such information which would identify the taxpayer. That change would not only make superficially nonidentifying information available to FOIA requesters, and thereby frustrate the carefully drawn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>protections against such disclosure contained in \u00a7 6110, but it would also allow such information to be circulated freely within the government (since the defined term \u201creturn information\u201d is central to both those provisions governing public disclosure and those governing inter-agency dissemination). We are asked to believe that this fundamental change in the committee proposal that the members of the Senate had (presumably) studied was made by this brief proviso at the last minute, without any statement by its sponsor that it had an effect upon anything except statistical studies and compilations of data, <em>see infra </em>at 161, without a floor vote (it was adopted by consent), without dissent from even a single member of the Senate, and indeed without any comment by any members of the body who might have been present except Senator Long\u2019s remark: \u201cMr. President, I will be happy to take this amendment to conference. It might not be entirely necessary, but it might serve a good purpose.\u201d 122 Cong.Rec. 24,012 (1976). Rather than embrace this implausibility it would make more sense \u2014 if one were to favor the dissent\u2019s approach of using supposed inadequacy of consideration as a basis to ignore, rather than seeking to reconcile, textual conflicts \u2014 to endorse the position urged by the government, to wit, that all the befuddled Congress meant to do (never mind that the text will not bear it, <em>see infra </em>at 161-62) was to add the tax model to the disclosure exceptions of \u00a7 6108.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">It is much easier to discern what the Haskell Amendment does not mean <em>(viz., </em>what <em>Long </em>suggests) than what it does. If, as we have concluded, it does not exclude from the definition of return information <em>all </em>nonidentifying data, what particular nonidentifying data does it exclude? Again we think the key is the crucial phrase \u201cin a form.\u201d It is significant that this phrase is <em>not </em>contained in the provisions discussed earlier which seek \u2014 in language otherwise almost identical to the Haskell Amendment \u2014 to describe <em>all </em>identifying data. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 6103(f)(1) &amp; (2); 6103(f)(4)(A) &amp; (B). But it <em>is </em>contained in two other portions of \u00a7 6103. Subsection (j), entitled \u201cStatistical use,\u201d permits disclosure of return information (1) to the Secretary of Commerce \u201cfor the purpose of, but only to the extent necessary in, the structuring of censuses and national economic accounts and conducting related statistical activities authorized by law\u201d; (2) to the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, \u201cfor the purpose of ... administration ... of legally authorized economic surveys of corporations\u201d; and (3) to the Department of the Treasury, \u201cfor the purpose of ... preparing economic or financial forecasts, projections, analyses, and statistical studies and conducting related activities.\u201d The last paragraph of the subsection, entitled \u201cAnonymous form,\u201d concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">No person who receives ... return information under this subsection shall disclose such ... return information to any person other than the taxpayer to whom it relates except <em>in a form </em>which cannot be associated with, or otherwise identify, directly or indirectly, a particular taxpayer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">\u00a7 6103(j)(4) (emphasis added). In this context, the meaning of the emphasized phrase seems clear: It is evidently meant to permit the publication and distribution of the statistical studies, forecasts and surveys that are the purpose of the permitted disclosures to Commerce, the FTC and Treasury. The phrase envisions, in other words, not merely the deletion of an identifying name or symbol on a document that contains return information, but agency <em>reformulation </em>of the return information into a statistical study or some other composite product \u2014 presumably on the theory that such reformulation gives added assurance that a taxpayer\u2019s identity will in fact not be disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">The same meaning fits the other instance in which the phrase \u201cin a form\u201d appears as a disclosure limitation in \u00a7 6103. Subsection (i)(7)(A) provides that return information \u201cshall be open to inspection by, or disclosure to, officers and employees of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>General Accounting Office\u201d for the purpose of conducting legally required audits. Such officers and employees are prohibited, however, from disclosing to others \u201creturn information ... in a form which can be associated with, or otherwise identify, directly or indirectly, a particular taxpayer.\u201d This seems designed to assure that the reformulations of raw return information in the audit reports prepared by GAO officers and employees, if they are to be made public, be carefully devised to avoid the disclosure of identifying data. Once again the phrase is associated with a <em>reformulation </em>of the return information. Significantly, the phrase is not used where the subject of the provision is not \u201creturn information\u201d but material that has <em>already </em>been reformulated. The concluding provision of \u00a7 6108 prescribes that no publication or disclosure of the statistical studies and compilations authorized by that section \u201cshall in any manner permit the statistics, study, or any information so published, furnished, or otherwise disclosed to be associated with, or otherwise identify, directly or indirectly, a particular taxpayer.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6108(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The United States has argued in this appeal that the only type of reformulation that the Haskell Amendment exempts is that envisioned by the last mentioned section. The consequence of this interpretation, . of course, is that the Haskell Amendment becomes substantively superfluous, amounting to no more than a reminder in the definition section that \u00a7 6108 permits disclosure of statistical data. That alone may not be fatal since, as far as we can discern, <em>any </em>interpretation of the amendment, including the one we adopt, creates some redundancy. The insuperable problem, however, is that there is absolutely no textual basis for limiting the phrase \u201cin a form\u201d to the precise types of reformulation set forth in \u00a7 6108. It is not likely that such a surgically exact result would be described by that vague term, rather than by the simple and precise statement that return data \u201cdoes not include statistical studies and compilations prepared under authority of \u00a7 6108.\u201d To support the suggested limitation, the government resorts to what the Seventh Circuit in <em>King </em>called the \u201cscant legislative history\u201d of the Haskell Amendment, 688 F.2d at 492, consisting principally of the following statement by Senator Haskell on the Senate floor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">[T]he purpose of this amendment is to insure that statistical studies and other compilations of data now prepared by the Internal Revenue Service and disclosed by it to outside parties will continue to be subject to disclosure to the extent allowed under present law. Thus the Internal Revenue Service can continue to release for research purposes statistical studies and compilations of data, such as the tax model, which do not identify individual taxpayers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-8\">The definition of \u201creturn information\u201d was intended to neither enhance nor diminish access now obtainable under the Freedom of Information Act to statistical studies and compilations of data by the Internal Revenue Service. Thus, the addition by the Internal Revenue Service of easily deletable identifying information to the type of statistical study or compilation of data which, under its current practice, has been subject to disclosure, will not prevent disclosure of such study or compilation under the newly amended section 6103. In such an instance, the identifying information would be deleted and disclosure of the statistical study or compilation of data be made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">688 F.2d at 493 (quoting 122 Cong. Rec. 24,012 (1976)). As <em>King </em>noted, this statement was made in response to a question whether the IRS could avoid disclosing statistical studies simply by adding identifying information, and thus was not <em>necessarily </em>intended as a comprehensive expression of the purpose of the amendment (though it assuredly adds no support to the textually implausible <em>Long </em>interpretation). Even disregarding that limitation, however, the statement simply does not support the government\u2019s narrow construction. It refers not only to \u201cstatistical studies\u201d but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>also to \u201ccompilations of data, such as the tax model.\u201d The latter is not a statistical tabulation. At the time the Haskell Amendment was adopted, it appears to have been an actual return with identifying details eliminated. Several years later, perhaps out of recognition that the 1976 legislation no longer permitted such redacted material to be made public, it was altered to consist of a reformulated return, with substitution of new figures for certain items \u2014 a partly factual, partly fictional return, so to speak.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There is no way that the tax model can be brought within the publication exemptions of \u00a7 6108. Even if the provision of \u00a7 6108(b) which permits preparation and disclosure of \u201cspecial statistical studies and compilations\u201d is interpreted in such fashion that the. adjective \u201cstatistical\u201d does not modify \u201ccompilations\u201d (which seems to us strained), the tax model \u2014 which the Secretary had prepared and made public for years before the Haskell Amendment and has continued to prepare and make public since \u2014 could not possibly come within that provision, since it is by no stretch of the imagination a \u201cspecial\u201d compilation prepared \u201cupon written request by any party or parties,\u201d as \u00a7 6108(b) requires.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>We may add that, for similar reasons, we find no support in text or legislative history for the Seventh Circuit\u2019s statement in <em>King </em>that \u201cthe Haskell Amendment provides only for the disclosure of <em>statistical tabulations </em>which are not associated with or do not identify particular taxpayers.\u201d 688 F.2d at 493 (emphasis added). We hold, more broadly than <em>King, </em>that as used in \u00a7 6103(b)(2) the phrase \u201cdata in a form which cannot be associated with, or otherwise identify, directly or indirectly, a particular taxpayer\u201d requires \u2014 in addition to the fact of nonidentification \u2014 some alteration by the government of the form in which the return information was originally recorded. That reformulation will typically consist of statistical tabulation or of some other form of combination with other data so as to produce a unitary product that disguises the origin of its components (as in the tax model). We need not define, for purposes of the present appeal, all other manners of reformulation that may be included.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It suffices to say that the mere deletion of the taxpayer\u2019s name or other identifying data is not enough, since that would render the reformulation requirement entirely duplicative of the nonidentification requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">We do not pretend that the interpretation we have given the Haskell Amendment causes it to fit with perfect consistency into the body of Chapter 61 or even, less ambitiously, \u00a7 6103. It causes the provisions of \u00a7 61030(4) and \u00a7 6103(i)(7)(A), discussed above, to be superfluous. But that superfluity is nothing beside the textual and policy absurdities produced by the interpretation in <em>Long </em>\u2014 and exceeds the superfluity produced by the government\u2019s interpretation only because the latter inexplicably limits its \u201cstatistical\u201d restriction to the statistics referred to in \u00a7 6108. As we have construed the Haskell Amendment, it creates no more disruption of the carefully drawn statutory scheme than is commonly produced by the dread genre of floor amendment; indeed, with a scheme as detailed as this it is remarkable that the dislocations are not greater. We are persuaded, in any case, that the meaning we have assigned is the meaning most faithful to the text, most compatible with the remainder of the legislation, and most supportable by a plausible legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">Application of our holding to the facts of the present case, and the other issues presented by the instant appeal, are left to the disposition of the panel, whose opinion is issued simultaneously with this.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-11\">. Judge Wald's dissent expresses concern over \"the court\u2019s recent practice of issuing en banc opinions on legal issues, as opposed to concrete factual scenarios, <em>see also Foster v. United States, </em>783 F.2d 1082 (D.C.Cir.1986) (en banc).\u201d Dissent at 172 n. 1. That concern must logically extend, of course \u2014 and should indeed have heightened application \u2014 to the court\u2019s common practice of rendering en banc decisions on isolated legal issues <em>without </em>en banc rehearing, by means of a so-called <em>\u201cIrons </em>footnote\u201d added to the panel opinion, reflecting the fact that departure from prior law of the circuit has been approved by the full court. <em>See, e.g., Telecommunications Research &amp; Action Center v. FCC, </em>750 F.2d 70, 75 n. 24 (D.C.Cir.1984); <em>In re: Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n, </em>738 F.2d 487, 496 n. 19 (D.C.Cir.1984); <em>Irons v. Diamond, </em>670 F.2d 265, 268 n. 11 (D.C.Cir.1981). Indeed, it must logically extend to the even more venerable practice of en banc <em>reconsideration </em>of issued panel opinions limited to specific issues \u2014 a practice we indulged in only a few weeks ago. <em>See Northern Natural Gas Co. </em>v. <em>FERC, </em>780 F.2d 59, 64 (D.C.Cir.1986) (order granting rehearing en banc \"for the limited purpose of deciding whether the Court should reconsider its holding in <em>Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v. FERC, </em>613 F.2d 1120 (D.C.Cir.1979)\u2019\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-17\">The practice of segregating legal issues requiring the attention of the full court from the remainder of the case reflects the fact that appellate review serves a dual purpose: the correction of legal error and the establishment of legal rules for future guidance. Only the latter is ordinarily worthy of the attention of the full court. The dissent\u2019s perception that judges \"typically\" dispose of all the issues in a case, <em>see </em>Dissent at 172 n. 1, is simply not true at the second appellate level, where the law-clarifying function predominates. The Supreme Court often, if not usually, grants certiorari only on one or more discrete points of law, and issues its opinions (in that sense) on \"legal issues, as opposed to concrete factual scenarios.\u201d En banc consideration (or <em>Irons </em>footnote disposition) effectively constitutes such second-level appellate review \u2014 at least where, as is the case here, the full court has before it the full text of a proposed panel opinion. It would be especially perverse to abandon our efficient practice of limited en banc disposition just as our caseload <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>has steeply increased, and as the size of the court has been expanded, magnifying the number of judge-hours devoted to each issue handled en banc. The proposal to restrict \"piecemeal\u201d consideration would have the effect of making it inordinately difficult to alter prior law of the circuit or to correct panel decisions that adopt erroneous new rules.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b242-5\">. The dissent refers to all the strange textual consequences of the <em>Long </em>interpretation as \u201cstylistic superfluity,\u201d which it equates in character with textual imperfections that remain under our interpretation of the amendment. Dissent at 176-. The latter, however, consist of nothing more than repetition, in later sections, of the exemption which (under our interpretation) the Haskell Amendment has already provided. This cannot reasonably be compared with the Alice-in-Wonderland definitional structure, <em>see supra </em>at 157, the pointless incorporation in the definition of exceptions that have no application, <em>see supra </em>at 157, and the provisions for open meetings that can never occur, <em>see supra </em>at 157-158, that are the consequences of <em>Long. </em>The dissent\u2019s indiscriminate totaling of textual imperfections also happens to be inaccurate. One of the \"superfluities\u201d which it attributes to our interpretation is not that, since the section in question, \u00a7 6108(c), is not specifically tied to the term \"return information.\u201d Moreover, both of the minor imperfections in our interpretation subsist under the <em>Long </em>interpretation as well, and the dissent seems to have miscounted the distinctive problems of <em>Long </em>we have discussed. The simplistic \"score\u201d is not 5-3, as the dissent asserts, but 9-2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b246-4\">. The three sentences preceding this footnote sign did not appear in our original opinion, as issued in slip form. There the corresponding passage read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\">The latter is not a statistical tabulation but a sample return, derived from an actual return but reformulated to substitute new figures for certain items \u2014 a partly actual, partly fictional return, so to speak.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The revision was made to correct a factual inaccuracy brought to our attention by a post-decision motion of amicus American Civil Liberties Union of Washington, which noted that the description of the tax model presented to us by the government in oral argument and reflected in the foregoing passage was accurate for the period beginning about 1980, but was not accurate as of 1976, when the model was an actual return with identifying details eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The dissent\u2019s suggestion, Dissent at 176 n. 7, that our decision turned upon this mistaken factual assumption is demonstrably wrong. Our rejection of <em>Long, </em>set forth in Part II of this opinion, was made and continues to be made without any reference to this snippet of legislative history. And the only reason for raising it in this Part III of our opinion is to refute the government\u2019s position, which relies upon it. The factual inaccuracy in the case as originally presented to us shows the wisdom of relying upon the text and structure of the statute rather than this statement by a single senator as a means of ascertaining the Congress\u2019 intent. We have no way of knowing whether Senator Haskell\u2019s understanding of the tax model \u2014 much less that of his colleagues, if any of them relied upon his remark \u2014 comported with our original understanding or rather with what we now know. The mere term \u201cTax Model\u201d assuredly does not suggest a redacted actual return.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b246-8\">. The absence of any textual basis in \u00a7 6108 for publication of the tax model seems to us a complete response to the concurring opinion\u2019s contention that <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), requires us to defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation of the stat-</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">ute. There is some question, to begin with, whether an interpretive theory put forth only by agency counsel in litigation, which explains agency action that could be explained on different theories, constitutes an \"agency position\u201d for purposes of <em>Chevron. </em>Even granting that principle, however, it cannot possibly have application where counsel\u2019s interpretation in fact does <em>not </em>explain agency action but is, to the contrary, incompatible with the agency\u2019s settled course of conduct. That is the situation here, since the IRS has regularly released, and plans to continue to release, the tax model. Nor does it suffice to appeal to Senator Haskell\u2019s explicit reference to the tax model as the agency\u2019s justification for this singular departure from its (supposed) \u00a7 6108 theory. Legislative history is used to clarify the meaning of a text, not to create extra-statutory law. If it can ever be the basis for plainly departing from the text, it assuredly cannot be so when an interpretation that honors both the text and the history is available.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">The concurrence claims that agency counsel did not take the position that the Haskell Amendment referred exclusively to \u00a7 6108, but rather maintained that the phrase \u201cdata in a form\u201d in \u00a7 6103 referred exclusively to the statistical studies covered by \u00a7 6108 <em>and </em>to the tax model. Concurrence at 171. The oral argument contained the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-13\">[COUNSEL]: ... [I]t is certainly arguable that the Haskell Amendment is redundant in light of 6108.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-14\">QUESTION: ... Your interpretation of the Haskell Amendment is \u00a7 6108?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-15\">[COUNSEL]: That\u2019s right and that is why Senator Long didn\u2019t think it was all that necessary____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-16\">Corrected Tr. of Oral Argument at 28 (Dec. 5, 1985). This concession was not, as the concurrence contends, a matter of government counsel\u2019s \u201dhav[ing] been momentarily caught off guard by the court\u2019s vigorous questioning.\u201d Concurrence at 171 n. 10. To the contrary, what prompted the concession (and what prompted the questioning) was the carefully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>considered and frequently repeated assertion in the IRS\u2019s brief to the full court that the Haskell Amendment covered only \"information ... amalgamated into statistical data,\u201d Supp.Brief for Appellees at 4, 6, and information \u201clikely rendered anonymous by amalgamation into general statistics,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 9; and that the purpose of the Amendment was \"to permit the Internal Revenue Service to continue its collection and release of general statistics,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 11, and \"to permit the release of historically provided statistical data compiled from return information,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 20. These expressions are subject to no interpretation other than that the Haskell Amendment excludes from the definition of \"return information\" only the statistical studies and compilations already covered by \u00a7 6108.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The problem counsel faced at oral argument was reconciling this theory with the embarrassing fact (first brought to the IRS\u2019s attention, evidently, by the Appellant's Supplemental Brief, filed simultaneously with its own) that the tax model is not a statistical study or compilation. We thought, in light of the above-quoted concession at oral argument, that counsel was seeking to mend his hold by adhering to the IRS\u2019s original theory of equivalence between the Haskell Amendment and \u00a7 6108, but explaining the tax model as a legislative-history-prescribed expansion of what the word \"statistics\u201d includes. The concurrence chooses to interpret the discussion as utterly abandoning the position that \"data in a form\u201d means statistics only (\u00a7 6108) and embracing instead the view that it means statistics plus (exclusively) the tax model. This merely substitutes for the vice of nontextual amendment to \u00a7 6108 the vice of nontextual amendment to \u00a7 6103, since in no way can the crucial words \u201cdata in a form\" be categorically limited to statistical studies, the tax model, and nothing else. (Nor is there any apparent reason why Congress should assume that, of all conceivable nonstatistical amalgamations, only the tax model would be sufficiently helpful and would sufficiently secure anonymity to justify publication.) Whatever position counsel was taking, one thing is clear: it is impossible to find here the sort of clear and consistent agency view (even as purportedly expressed by counsel) that must be given deference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b247-13\">. Given the purpose of the reformulation requirement, however \u2014 to wit, the increased assurance of anonymity \u2014 we can readily opine that it does not include the dissent\u2019s example of copying the same data \u201conto a fresh piece of paper, perhaps in narrative style.\" Dissent at 175.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>SILBERMAN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Akn\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"AO9\">The court confronts in this case a difficult issue of statutory interpretation. The puzzle begins with 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103 (1982), which provides generally for nondisclosure of \u201creturn information\u201d in the interest of taxpayer confidentiality. All sides agree that the heart of this controversy is the proper interpretation of the Haskell amendment, which authorizes the agency to release material that otherwise could not be released because it would be (but for the Haskell amendment) \u201creturn information.\u201d In other words, what does the phrase \u201cdata in a form which cannot be associated with or otherwise identify, directly or indirectly, a particular taxpayer\u201d mean? But I believe there is another question presented of equal importance: Did Congress intend that the IRS\u2019s interpretation of what constitutes such \u201cdata in a form ...\u201d be given deference by the judiciary?</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">I think it must be conceded that Section 6103 is, at the very least, ambiguous as to the issue now before the court. Nothing in the language of the statute itself yields a decisive understanding as to whether <em>Neufeld </em>or <em>King </em>is a more faithful rendering of the statute\u2019s purpose. The legislative history is sparse and inconclusive on the <em>Neufeld/King </em>question. Against the backdrop of this ambiguity the parties argue for divergent interpretations of this provision. The agency argues that the Haskell amendment means that data must be amalgamated or combined in a different form (Appellee\u2019s Supp.Br. at 5 n. 4) and specifically points to data \u201crendered anonymous by amalgamation into general statistics\u201d as satisfying that test <em>(Id. </em>at 9).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The agency relies heavily on the adoption of this interpretation by the Seventh Circuit in <em>King </em>and further argues that a broader definition \u2014 such as that adopted by the majority \u2014 apart from creating certain anomalies and inconsistencies in the statutory scheme, presents troublesome administrative problems. The Secretary, we are told, has grave difficulty in determining the ability of one who requests information to \u201ccorrelate facially nonidentifying data with specific taxpayers.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Supp.Br. at 13. The Church, on the other hand, argues that any document in the IRS files that contains return information must be disclosed provided that identifying information is first redacted. Through the majority opinion, this court rejects as excessively narrow the agency\u2019s construction of the statute and offers yet another construction. It concludes that the Haskell amendment exempts from the general rule of nondisclosure nonidentifying return information that has also undergone \u201cagency <em>reformulation ... </em>into a statistical study or some other composite product____\u201d Maj.Op. at 160 (emphasis in original). Each of these interpretations is, in my view, a reasonable construction of a difficult statute, but I disagree with the majority\u2019s decision to treat its own construction as authoritative. I believe the majority's approach oversteps the limitations on the court\u2019s proper role as defined in <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">The message of <em>Chevron </em>is emphatic. A court\u2019s duty in matters of statutory construction is to give effect to congressional intent. If that intent is not precisely apparent, however,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-10\">the court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute, as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation. Rather, if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency\u2019s answer is based oh a permissible construction of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">Id. at 843 (footnote omitted). Beyond this we cannot go.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">I believe <em>Chevron\u2019s </em>instruction applies to the issue of statutory construction now before the court. Section 6103(b)(2), set out in full in the majority opinion at page 156, defines return information by enumerating several different categories of information, but qualifying the enumeration with the words of the Haskell amendment \u201cbut such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>term does not include data in a form which cannot be associated with, or otherwise identify, directly or indirectly, a particular taxpayer.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103(b)(2) (1982). The words of the Haskell amendment seem to me to cry out for application of the doctrine of deference expounded in <em>Chevron. </em>No one, it would seem, is better qualified than the Secretary to decide whether certain classes of information may be released in compliance with the Haskell amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Before proceeding, I must address a question that the majority raises without answering \u2014 \u201cwhether an interpretive theory put forth only by agency counsel in litigation, which explains agency action that could be explained on different theories, constitutes an \u2018agency position\u2019 for purposes of <em>Chevron.\u201d </em>Maj.Op. at 162 n. 4. I think it is much too late to question whether the construction of Section 6103(b)(2) urged by agency counsel in this case really represents the IRS\u2019s position. We know that the IRS has been advancing its interpretation in courts throughout the country at least since 1982, when it persuaded the Seventh Circuit in <em>King </em>to adopt its position, and perhaps even before then. To suggest in these circumstances that the <em>King </em>analysis is <em>not </em>an \u201cagency position\u201d is to imply that IRS counsel are mavericks, disembodied from the agency that they represent. I reject that supposition. <em>See Ashland Oil, Inc. v. FTC, </em>548 F.2d 977, 984-85 (D.C.Cir.1976) (MacKinnon, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The precept that the agency\u2019s rationale must be stated by the agency itself stems from proper respect for the separation of powers among the branches of government. In the seminal case of <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>318 U.S. 80, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943), the Court explained that \u201ca judicial judgment cannot be made to do service for an administrative judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88, 63 S.Ct. at 459. Similarly, in <em>Investment Co. Inst. v. Camp, </em>401 U.S. 617, 91 S.Ct. 1091, 28 L.Ed.2d 367 (1971), the Court declined to defer to agency counsel\u2019s interpretation, noting that \u201cCongress has delegated to the administrative official and not to appellate counsel the responsibility for elaborating and enforcing statutory commands.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 628, 91 S.Ct. at 1097. In these cases, the Supreme Court declined \u201cto substitute [its own] or counsel\u2019s discretion for that of the [agency]\u201d because to do so would be \u201cincompatible with the orderly functioning of the process of judicial review. This is not to deprecate, but to vindicate ... the administrative process, for the purpose of the rule is to avoid \u2018propel[ling] the court into the domain which Congress has set aside exclusively for the administrative agency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 156, 169, 83 S.Ct. 239, 246, 9 L.Ed.2d 207 (1962) (quoting <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 196, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 1577, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947) (citation omitted) <em>(Chenery II)). </em>In other words, the doctrine developed as a manifestation of judicial restraint. If courts were to accept an agency counsel\u2019s position that significantly differed from the agency\u2019s position, they would in effect substitute a judicial interpretation for the agency\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">The doctrine has been applied in a variety of cases. Courts have rejected as inadequate agency counsel\u2019s articulation of a statutory interpretation when that interpretation has been inconsistent with a prior administrative construction, <em>see Securities Indus. Ass\u2019n v. Board of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys., </em>468 U.S. 137, 104 S.Ct. 2979, 2983-84, 82 L.Ed.2d 107 (1984); <em>Pitzak v. OPM, </em>710 F.2d 1476, 1479 n. 2 (10th Cir.1983); when the record evidence before the court demonstrates no link between counsel\u2019s interpretation and administrative practice, <em>Alaniz v. OPM, </em>728 F.2d 1460, 1465 (Fed.Cir.1984); or when agency counsel\u2019s interpretation is revealed as no more than a \u201ccurrent litigating position.\u201d <em>Ames v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>567 F.2d 1174, 1177 n. 3 (2d Cir.1977); <em>see </em>McMillan &amp; Peterson, \u201cThe Permissible Scope of Hearings, Discovery, and Additional Factfinding During Judicial Review of Informal Agency Action,\u201d 1982 Duke L.J. 333, 363 n. 163.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And in <em>Investment Co. Inst. v. Camp, </em>the Supreme Court de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>dined to credit agency counsel\u2019s statutory interpretation, offered in support of an agency regulation, where the Comptroller had \u201cadopted no expressly articulated position at the administrative level as to the meaning and impact\u201d of the relevant statutory provisions. 401 U.S. at 627, 91 S.Ct. at 1097. Those circumstances are not present in this case, however. The construction of the Haskell amendment was not even a central issue in this case in its administrative phase before the agency. There was no need then for the agency to set forth its position on that issue. It was not until the case came before the district court that the issue arose in any form. There the Church argued that in light of <em>Neufeld, </em>which had been decided during the district court litigation, the IRS could not tenably maintain that it need not even search files known to contain return information. The IRS, bound, of course, by the <em>Neufeld </em>court\u2019s construction of the Haskell amendment, argued to the district court that since the Church\u2019s request identified the taxpayer, \u201cno information could be released by the Service that would be anonymous.\u201d Defendants\u2019 Memorandum in Reply to Plaintiff\u2019s Statement of Points and Authorities in Opposition to Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment at 3. On appeal before the D.C. Circuit panel, the IRS acknowledged that it was bound by <em>Neufeld, </em>but urged the court to reconsider <em>Neufeld </em>in light of <em>King. </em>Thus, at the first moment in the case when it was appropriate and relevant for the IRS to articulate its construction of the statute, it did so. <em>En banc </em>consideration of the issue ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">What is clear from all this is that the <em>King </em>analysis is in no way inconsistent with the basis for the agency\u2019s decision in the administrative appeal. <em>See </em>Appellee\u2019s Panel Br. at 24 n. 11. This is not a case like <em>Investment Co. Inst. v. Camp. </em>In that case, the Comptroller of the Currency, to whom Congress had only recently reassigned regulatory responsibility for national banks\u2019 trust activities, adopted, three decades after enactment of the Glass-Steagall Act, a regulation that departed from a long-settled interpretation of the statute. <em>See </em>401 U.S. at 621-22, 91 S.Ct. 1094-95. The Comptroller plainly neglected to furnish an appropriate rationale for his actions at a stage in the proceedings where there was a compelling need to articulate a link between the statutory provisions and the new regulation. The time to provide a statutory interpretation that underpins a newly promulgated rule that sweeps away earlier interpretations of the statute is obviously at the time of the rulemaking. In informal administrative adjudicative proceedings that evolve into federal court litigation, by contrast, the issues may well be shaped and sharpened throughout the proceedings. I think it is enough that the agency, through its counsel, set forth its interpretation of the statute at the first moment when it was appropriate and relevant to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Were the rule to be otherwise \u2014 were the courts to withhold deference unless an agency asserted its interpretation of a statute in a formal adjudication or agency rule-making \u2014 we would be creating a strong incentive for government agencies and departments to undertake their business strictly through formal procedures. Although judicial review of administrative action has seemed in recent times to push in that direction, I doubt that much good can come of this trend or, more importantly, that it is justified by congressional direction. <em>See Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>435 U.S. 519, 98 S.Ct. 1197, 55 L.Ed.2d 460 (1978). We should take care that a doctrine developed to restrain the judiciary not be transformed to serve as a justification for excessive judicial intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">In any event, if this court rejects <em>King </em>on the unwarranted assumption that <em>King </em>is not the IRS\u2019s \u201ctrue\u201d interpretation of the Haskell amendment, the agency presumably could undercut the court\u2019s holding merely by taking some more formal step to adopt <em>King </em>as the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation of the statute. This strikes me as an unseemly institutional <em>pas de deux.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">FOIA\u2019s general policy favors disclosure, but the statute also recognizes nine categories of exemptions from the general rule of disclosure. One of the exemptions, found at Section 552(b)(3), provides that (b) This section does not apply to matters that are ...</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">(3) specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than section 552b of this title) provided that such statute (A) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (B) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3Q\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Thus, the language of Section 552 exempts statutes such as Section 6103<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> from \u201c[t]his section,\u201d which I take to mean the entire Section 552 in the absence of any other plausible reference. But Section 552 contains not only the disclosure requirements; it also contains the provision for de novo judicial review. While it is obvious that materials covered by exemption 3 are exempted from the disclosure requirement of Section 552, mere assertion that requested documents are covered by an exemption 3 statute will not serve to immunize items from disclosure. The de novo review section of FOIA requires courts to examine withheld documents to determine whether they are <em>in fact </em>covered by an exemption 3 statute. But that cannot possibly mean that the law applied in those proceedings is other than that embodied in the exemption 3 statute. That is to say, the definition or scope of \u201cmatters\u201d covered by the exemption 3 statute must derive from the exemption 3 statute. It could come from nowhere else.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">I have found nothing in the legislative history of FOIA or its subsequent amendments that contradicts this analysis. The House Report accompanying S. 1160, the bill whose provisions were eventually codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, explained that \u201c[t]he proceedings are to be de novo so that the court can consider the propriety of the withholding instead of being restricted to judicial sanctioning of agency discretion.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1497, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 9 (1966), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1966, p. 2418. The Senate Report stated: \u201cThat the proceeding must be do novo is essential in order that the ultimate decision as to the propriety of the agency\u2019s action is made by the court and prevent [sic] it from becoming meaningless judicial sanctioning of agency discretion.\u201d S.Rep. No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 8 (1965).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>But does de novo review mean more than an independent examination of the facts in light of applicable law;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is it inconsistent with deference to an agency\u2019s reasonable construction of a statute it administers? In other words, must <em>Chevron </em>give way whenever a court is charged with de novo review?</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">I have concluded that <em>Chevron </em>does apply in such circumstances. The rule of <em>Chevron </em>is not a rule of judicial administration for courts to apply in reviewing administrative decisionmaking. It is an articulation of the fundamental principle that when Congress intends to delegate authority to an agency, that purpose demands recognition by the courts. I reason as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">In entrusting administration of a statute to an agency, Congress typically delegates to the agency concomitant authority to \u201cfill any gap\u201d that Congress has left. <em>Morton v. Ruiz, </em>415 U.S. 199, 231, 94 S.Ct. 1055, 1072, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974). Part of the legislative purpose with respect to a particular statute, then, is Congress\u2019 intent that the agency will exercise its delegated authority in fulfillment of the statute\u2019s purpose. Courts appropriately defer to an agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of a statute that the agency administers, then, not simply out of recognition of the agency\u2019s expertise, but primarily out of respect for congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">In <em>Sims v. CIA, </em>642 F.2d 562 (D.C.Cir. 1980), this court took an approach contrary to my analysis and treated the issue of statutory construction of an exemption 3 statute as a question of law \u201creserved ultimately to our determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 568. In that case, the CIA declined to disclose documents that revealed the names of individuals and institutions that had participated in a controversial research program. The agency argued that the documents were \u201cspecifically exempted by statute\u201d from disclosure within the meaning of Section 552(b)(3). The exemption 3 statute upon which the CIA relied was 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 403(d)(3) (1982), which authorizes the Director to protect \u201cintelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure.\u201d Appellants argued that the institutions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>individuals did not constitute \u201cintelligence sources\u201d within the meaning of the statute. Thus, the issue in the <em>Sims </em>case, as in this case, turned on construction of a term in the exemption 3 statute. On appeal, this court devised a definition of the term \u201cintelligence sources\u201d after reviewing the statute and its legislative history. The court stated that FOIA authorized the judiciary \u201cto undertake de novo review\u201d not only of \u201cagency determinations that particular records fall within exemption classifications,\u201d but also of \u201cagency constructions of applicable statutes.\u201d 642 F.2d at 566 (citation and footnote omitted). The court acknowledged that \u201c[bjecause the term \u2018intelligence ... sources\u2019 appears in the text of the National Security Act, it is appropriate for us to begin our analysis with the construction proposed by the CIA, an agency chartered by that statute and charged with major responsibility for its administration.\u201d 642 F.2d at 568 (citations omitted). The court continued, \u201cBut we must not shrink from the responsibility vested in us by Congress. The question presented is one of law reserved ultimately to our determination.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The <em>Sims </em>court\u2019s observations as to the state of the law on deference to administrative agencies\u2019 determinations in 1980 were, in my view, overbroad and erroneous. It has always been true that statutory interpretation is a question of law but it is equally true that an agency\u2019s construction of its governing statute traditionally has been viewed as entitled to deference in certain contexts. As this court recognized in a case decided after <em>Sims, </em>although the \u201cAPA appears to require <em>de novo </em>review of all questions of law ... courts almost always accord some deference to an agency\u2019s statutory construction.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Office of Communication of the United Church of Christ v. FCC, </em>707 F.2d 1413, 1422-23 n. 12 (D.C.Cir.1983); <em>see Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, </em>395 U.S. 367, 381, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 1801-02, 23 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969); <em>Unemployment Comp. Comm\u2019n v. Aragon, </em>329 U.S. 143, 153-54, 67 S.Ct. 245, 250-51, 91 L.Ed. 136 (1946); <em>McLaren v. Fleischer, </em>256 U.S. 477, 480-81, 41 S.Ct. 577, 577-78, 65 L.Ed. 1052 (1921); <em>Webster v. Luther, </em>163 U.S. 331, 342, 16 S.Ct. 963, 967, 41 L.Ed. 179 (1896). <em>Chevron </em>has put a new gloss on these old truisms. <em>Chevron </em>tells us that if congressional intent respecting a statutory provision is not clear, we must not treat the issue of statutory construction as we would treat any other garden variety question of law. We must defer to another institution\u2019s determination \u2014 that of the agency charged to administer the law\u2014 provided, of course, that the agency\u2019s determination is reasonable. In this sense, I believe that <em>Chevron </em>supersedes the <em>Sims </em>court\u2019s overbroad analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">My view is further reinforced by the Supreme Court\u2019s treatment of the definitional issue when <em>Sims </em>came before that Court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>CIA v. Sims, </em>471 U.S. 159, 105 S.Ct. 1881, 85 L.Ed.2d 173 (1985). Dismissing the court of appeals\u2019 definition of \u201cintelligence sources\u201d as too narrow, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-10\">The plain meaning of the statutory language, as well as the legislative history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>of the National Security Act, ... indicates that Congress vested in the Director of Central Intelligence very broad authority to protect all sources of intelligence information from disclosure. The Court of Appeals\u2019 narrowing of this authority not only contravenes the express intention of Congress, but also overlooks the practical necessities of modern intelligence gathering \u2014 the very reason Congress entrusted this Agency with sweeping power to protect its \u201cintelligence sources and methods.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-4\"><em>Id., </em>105 S.Ct. at 1887-88. This approach is consistent with <em>Chevron </em>insofar as it first undertakes an inquiry as to the clarity of the legislative intent. Having found clear indications of congressional intent in the language of the statute and its legislative history, the Court had no need to move to the next step of the analysis that <em>Chevron </em>directs \u2014 determining whether the administrative agency had advanced a reasonable interpretation of the statute to which the judiciary should defer. But the Court\u2019s recognition of the \u201cpractical necessities of modern intelligence gathering\u201d that compelled Congress to delegate to the CIA \u201csweeping power\u201d to protect \u201cintelligence sources and methods\u201d indicates that the Court\u2019s conclusion as to legislative purpose was buttressed by its understanding of the agency\u2019s delegated authority and practiced expertise. Similarly, here Congress has delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury, authority to administer the federal income tax laws. And Section 6103 is an integral part of the mosaic of those tax laws because it directs the Secretary to protect return information from disclosure. Congress realized that the confidentiality of return information, which taxpayers usually provide voluntarily, is crucial to efficient administration of the tax laws. S.Rep. No. 938, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 316-19 (1976), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976, p. 2897. Naturally, the Secretary, like the Director of Central Intelligence in <em>Sims, </em>is better situated than the courts to determine when disclosure of information is likely to inhibit the collection of that information in the future. For that reason, Congress quite understandably delegated to the Secretary some responsibility for further refining the meaning of \u201cdata in a form which cannot be associated with, or otherwise identify, directly or indirectly, a particular taxpayer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Applying the traditional principle of deference, as refined by <em>Chevron, </em>to this case, I conclude that we should defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation of Section 6103. As noted above, the agency\u2019s interpretation of Section 6103 is not an inevitable one but that is not the test. The <em>Chevron </em>Court indicated, rather, that when congressional intent is not clear</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-8\">a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">467 U.S. at 844, 104 S.Ct. at 2782 (footnote omitted). Congress\u2019 implicit delegation of authority to the agency to refine the definition of \u201creturn information\u201d is buttressed by the broad discretion conferred upon the Secretary in another portion of the statute to disclose return information if he determines that such disclosures would not seriously impair administration of the tax system. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103(e)(7) (1982) (release of return information to persons having material interest). This instance of statutorily-conferred discretion to disclose, albeit to a limited class of requesters, even information sensitive enough to be categorized as return information suggests that the prior determination of <em>what constitutes </em>nondisclosable return information ought to be informed by the agency\u2019s expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">The majority refuses to defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation because it asserts that the agency\u2019s practice is inconsistent with its interpretation of the statutory text. Specifically the majority focuses on the government\u2019s continued release of the tax model as fatal to its interpretation of the Haskell amendment. However, the majority does not contend that the tax model cannot fit easily within the general phrase \u201cdata in a form which cannot be associated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>with, or otherwise identify, directly or indirectly, a particular taxpayer.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103(b). That argument would, in any event, be tenuous in light of the explicit statement Senator Haskell made from the floor. He said that the amendment was intended to permit \u201cthe Internal Revenue Service [to] continue to release for research purposes statistical studies and compilations of data, such as the tax model, which do not identify individual taxpayers.\u201d 122 Cong.Rec. 24,012 (1976) (remarks of Sen. Haskell).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Instead, the majority raises what I view as an artificial textual barrier by ascribing to the government an argument not presented in its brief, and not necessary to its position,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that the Haskell amendment is identical in its scope of disclosure authority to Section 6108 and that Section 6108\u2019s' text provides no authority to release the tax model. The agency, however, as I understand its position, maintains that the Haskell amendment was intended to authorize disclosure of statistical compilations such as those referred to in Section 6108 <em>and </em>disclosure of the tax model, which disclosure is apparently not otherwise authorized by the statute. The legislative history of the Haskell amendment amply supports the government\u2019s position that it was designed to authorize the <em>continued </em>release of data the government had released prior to its passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-17\">To be sure, there may not be a great deal of difference between the agency\u2019s interpretation of the Haskell amendment, adopted by the Seventh Circuit in <em>King, </em>and the majority\u2019s rendition. But the rule of <em>Chevron </em>requires us not to reason our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>own way to an interpretation, even if it were one that the agency might find consistent with its own. Rather, <em>Chevron </em>requires us to defer to agency interpretations, such as the one at issue here, that merit deference. I am reinforced in my conviction that deference is the appropriate course in this case by the majority\u2019s unwillingness to specify the outer boundaries of its own interpretation, Maj. Op. at 163, thus presenting this court with a heightened prospect of further litigation focused on the exploration of those boundaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">On the basis of the foregoing, I concur in the majority\u2019s opinion insofar as it overrules <em>Neufeld. </em>But I cannot join the opinion insofar as it rejects the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute in favor of the majority\u2019s own.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">WALD, Circuit Judge, dissenting, with whom SPOTTSWOOD W. ROBINSON, III, Chief Judge, and MIKVA, Circuit Judge, join:</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">I dissent from the court\u2019s newly adopted interpretation<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103(b)(2) saying that the IRS may never disclose data listed in the section even if there is no risk of identification, unless it has been \u201creformulated.\u201d The court reaches that interpretation based on its reading of the text of the Haskell Amendment, inferences it draws from the relationship between that Amendment and other sections of the Code, and its understanding of plausible legislative intent. I believe that these very same factors support a reaffirmance, rather than a rejection, of the interpretation of \u00a7 6103(b)(2) previously adopted by this court in <em>Neufeld v. IRS, </em>646 F.2d 661 (D.C. Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">I find nothing in the statutory text or structure to support the notion that wholly nonidentifying information<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> may not be disclosed unless it has been put in a different \u201cform.\u201d Such an extreme and curious requirement is at odds with the majority\u2019s own recognition that \u201cthere is no reason \u2018why Congress would have wanted to forbid the disclosure of information which would not threaten the privacy of individual taxpayers.\u2019 \u201d Maj. op. at 158 (quoting Brief of Neufeld and Freedom of Information Clearinghouse at 5). The <em>Neufeld </em>approach, in my view, comports best with Congress\u2019 balancing of the strong interest in taxpayer privacy and the equally strong interest in disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act whenever taxpayers\u2019 privacy rights are not implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">The interpretation adopted in <em>Neufeld </em>adequately safeguards the privacy concerns that the majority and I share. The court in <em>Neufeld </em>explicitly held that \u201cmere deletion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>of names and addresses\u201d does not automatically open the door for disclosure of items listed in \u00a7 6103 (b)(2). <em>Neufeld, </em>646 F.2d at 665. Rather, the court remanded the case to the District Court for determination of \u201cwhat information, other than name and address, poses a risk of identifying a taxpayer,\u201d <em>id., </em>with the understanding that the nature of certain documents may render them entirely nondisclosable. <em>Id. </em>at 666. <em>See also Moody v. IRS, </em>654 F.2d 795 (D.C.Cir.1981); <em>Long v. IRS, </em>596 F.2d 362 (9th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 917, 100 S.Ct. 1851, 64 L.Ed.2d 271 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">I agree that the IRS faces a difficult task in determining just when enough information has been deleted to make the taxpayer unidentifiable. This task is no different, however, from the situation agencies often face under the redaction requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S..C. \u00a7 552(b), a requirement that applies even with regard to matters otherwise \u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u201d under FOIA\u2019s exemption 3. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). While I would grant considerable deference to the agency\u2019s expertise in determining when even seemingly anonymous tax data might lead the informed requester to identify a taxpayer, I believe that this determination is for the Service to carry out on a case-by-case or, at times, a document class-by-class basis, in the same fashion that the panel opinion accompanying the en banc decision requires the IRS to proceed with respect to documents not listed in \u00a7 6103. <em>See Church of Scientology v. Internal Revenue Service </em>(hereinafter \u201cPanel op.\u201d), 792 F.2d 146, 152-153 (D.C.Cir. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">In changing course so fundamentally, the court must beware of the effect that its decision will have on others who seek to review tax information in pursuit of varied goals. The plaintiff in <em>Neufeld, </em>for example, was a professor doing research into the practice of members of Congress, White House staff members, and other high government officials interceding on behalf of taxpayers in ongoing IRS proceedings. Neufeld \u201cspecifically disclaim[ed] any interest in information that would directly or indirectly identify individual taxpayers.\u201d <em>Neufeld, </em>646 F.2d at 662. <em>See also Tax Reform Research Group v. IRS, </em>419 F.Supp. 415 (D.D.C.1976) (public interest group researching Nixon Administration\u2019s actions pressuring IRS with respect to persons perceived as either \u201cfriends\u201d or \u201cenemies\u201d). Yet, under the majority\u2019s holding today, the IRS is forbidden from disclosing \u00a7 6103(b)(2) data in its present form for research purposes to Neufeld, the Tax Reform Research Group, and countless other legitimate groups and scholars, even if the Service is wholly confident that there is no risk of disclosure whatsoever. Since the majority has failed to carry its burden in demonstrating that Congress intended to establish a distinct, statutory requirement of reformulation, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-14\">The majority\u2019s major premise is that the language of the Haskell Amendment, <em>i.e., </em>\u201creturn information ... does not include data <em>in a form </em>which cannot be associated with, or otherwise identify, directly or indirectly, a particular taxpayer,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103(b)(2) (emphasis added), means Congress established a \u201creformulation\u201d requirement. No data listed in \u00a7 6103(b)(2) can ever be released unless it is physically put into a different document from that in which the information presently appears in the IRS files. Deletion of any and all identifying material will never be enough.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Otherwise, the majority urges, the term \u201cin a form\u201d is made superfluous, \u201cas reading the provision without it will demonstrate.\u201d Maj. op. at 157. In my view, however, the term \u201cin a form\u201d is far more easily understood as saying that the <em>substantive </em>types of information listed in \u00a7 6103(b)(2) are not \u201creturn information\u201d if they can be disclosed in a <em>manner </em>that cannot identify a taxpayer. Thus, Congress meant to say no more than return information does not include data that, by itself or even in conjunction with other information, cannot be used to identify a particular taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">One can, of course, make talmudic dissections of everyday language to find hidden and profound implications. Unless statutory language is so clear that it compels a specific result, however, our task in statutory construction is to \u201cascertain the congressional intent and give effect to the legislative will.\u201d <em>Philbrook v. Glodgett, </em>421 U.S. 707, 713, 95 S.Ct. 1893, 1898, 44 L.Ed.2d 525 (1975). <em>See generally id. </em>(\u201c \u2018In expounding a statute, we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Heirs of Boisdore, </em>49 U.S. (8 How.) 113, 122, 12 L.Ed. 1009 (1849)); <em>United States v.

If the history of a statute\u2019s enactment reveals that Congress indeed labored arduously over each choice of word and each comma, then it is likewise proper for us to analyze each word and comma with precision. But when the legislative history shows that a provision was injected into the bill at the tail end of the process, and that Congress made no apparent effort to remove every phrase the new amendment may have rendered superfluous, we only frustrate Congress\u2019 goals by holding its words up to microscopic scrutiny. Judge Posner has pointed out that overemphasis on construing all statutes so as to avoid surplusage \u201crests on the unrealistic premise that [they] are drafted with complete economy of language____ There is \u2018useless surplusage\u2019 in contracts as in statutes, <em>J.

There comes a point when a court must be realistic in deciding whether the drafter was using everyday expressions in the manner that we all do, or was instead creating a technical, statutory requirement. <em>Cf American Radio Relay League v.

The Amendment engendered absolutely no debate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Given this history,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or lack thereof, I cannot agree that the three little words \u201cin a form\u201d evince a clear intent of Congress that data otherwise disc-losable under the Haskell Amendment because it is nonidentifying, cannot be disclosed unless it is somehow \u201creformulated.\u201d The fact is that most information governed by the Haskell Amendment is already likely to be in a form different from that originally submitted to the Service since the actual return submitted by the taxpayer is exempt from disclosure, without regard to identifiability. <em>See su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number><em>pra </em>note 2. Conceding as it does that <em>aggregation </em>is not essential to fulfill the reformulation requirement, the majority has adopted a wooden test that turns on physical form, and in so doing has attributed an absurd intent to Congress. Under the majority\u2019s test, the IRS may only disclose nonidentifying information if it copies it onto a fresh piece of paper, perhaps in narrative style. Yet, there is certainly no evidence that such recopying accomplishes anything that redaction would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The majority concludes that Congress would not have used the \u201cin the form\u201d language had it not wanted to create a reformulation requirement. I, on the other hand, believe Congress would have used much clearer language had it wanted to create such an arbitrary and novel reshaping requirement, without a word of explanation on the floor or in the Conference Report. Given its own emphasis on dissecting the statutory language, and avoiding Alice in Wonderland definitional structures, maj. op. at 158 n. 2,1 am startled by the apparent ease with which the majority is able to read the Haskell Amendment as creating <em>two separate </em>definitional elements. Nothing in the structure of the single sentence Amendment supports such a reading, only the majority\u2019s insistence on removing any trace of redundancy. Since nothing in the main body of \u00a7 6103(b)(2) discusses the \u201cform\u201d that the information is in, I cannot understand how the Haskell Amendment\u2019s use of the term \u201cform\u201d can be understood as allowing disclosure only where the information is in a <em>different </em>form from what it was originally in. As an Amicus points out, \u201cCongress could hardly have embarked on a more oblique route if its goal was to create such a separate requirement.\u201d <em>Brief of Amici Curiae Professor John L. Neufeld and The Freedom of Information Clearinghouse </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">I do not accept the majority\u2019s characterization of our choice here as one between construing a statutory phrase as a meaningful requirement or ignoring the same words as meaningless surplusage. Rather, I see the choice as one between attributing weighty legal significance to a common and inherently vague<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> term that could be just as meaningfully viewed in context simply as a linguistic aide to the Amendment\u2019s main requirement of anonymity, and recognizing it for what it is, a transitional technique of drafting. Under either reading, the words make literal sense, and, functionally, the reading adopted in <em>Neufeld </em>and <em>Long </em>is far less eccentric. Thus, unless other indicia compel the result, the language itself does not, in my view, support the imposition of a distinct statutory requirement of reformulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">But even if Congress <em>did </em>intend to create a reformulation requirement, I am at a loss to understand why the majority so conclusorily assumes that deletion of identifying information does not satisfy this requirement. Why is it a \u201ccurious usage\u201d to say that a document takes a different form once deletions of key information have been made? In its original, it is in a form that identifies; once the necessary deletions are made, it is in a form that does not identify. In my view, the common understanding of keeping documents in anonymous form is satisfied once deletions of possibly identifying materials are made. Nothing in the statute indicates that Congress intended the word \u201cform\u201d to mean any more than this.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>The majority also argues that it \u201cwould be most peculiar to catalogue in such detail, in subparagraph (A) of the body of the definition, the specific items that constitute \u2018return information\u2019 ... while leaving to an afterthought the major qualification that none of those items counts unless it identifies the taxpayer.\u201d Maj. op. at 157. Were the entire statute drafted at one time, there might be some merit in this argument. But, as I already pointed out and as the majority concedes, the Haskell Amendment was indeed an afterthought. It is certainly not unusual that a floor amendment makes a major change in the meaning of an original provision. The majority\u2019s insistence on stylistic congruity ignores the reality of the legislative process. Moreover, the panel opinion itself provides the justification for the list of specific kinds of material to be described as \u201creturn information,\u201d since it holds that items that do not appear in the list are to be treated no differently than any other item requested under FOIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The majority\u2019s efforts to show that the reading adopted by this court in <em>Neufeld v. IRS, </em>646 F.2d 661 (D.C.Cir.1981), and by the Ninth Circuit in <em>Long v. IRS, </em>596 F.2d 362 (9th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 917, 100 S.Ct. 1851, 64 L.Ed.2d 271 (1980), creates pockets of superfluity is similarly unpersuasive. The tension described is actually created by the majority\u2019s insistence that the Haskell Amendment cannot be interpreted as making a few provisions of a large and complex statute internally redundant, although still functionally meaningful and consistent. The futility of relying so heavily on the minor redundancies the Haskell Amendment effects in neighboring provisions that mention \u201creturn information\u201d is demonstrated by the fact that even the majority\u2019s reading makes three such provisions superfluous. <em>See </em>\u00a7 6103(j)(4) (\u201creturn information\u201d not to be released \u201cexcept in a form which cannot be associated with, or otherwise identify ...); \u00a7 6103(i)(7)(A) (same); \u00a7 6108(c) (no disclosure shall be such as can be \u201cassociated with ... \u201d). Recognizing the redundancy of these provisions, the majority finds it \u201cremarkable that the dislocations are not greater,\u201d maj. op. at 163, and concludes that the superfluity inquiry demonstrates the propriety of its approach because the superfluity it causes is much less than that produced by the interpretation in <em>Long. Id. </em>Quantitatively, the majority is correct. Its approach wins 5-3. But qualitatively, the superfluity created by both readings of the Haskell Amendment are alike.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Neither affects any substantive, practical matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Given the unavoidable stylistic superfluity under either construction, I do not see how the redundancy issue can be used to carry the day for either side of the debate. Once it is recognized that any interpretation of the Haskell Amendment \u201cdislocates\u201d some provisions by making them technically unnecessary, I think it useless to award victory to the interpretation that affects the fewer number. The unavoidable conclusion to be drawn from the superfluity created by either construction is that Congress did not concern itself with the fact that some of the other provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>were being made stylistically inelegant. Once that conclusion is reached, minor differences in how many provisions each construction affects become irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Aside from its textual arguments, the majority urges that its reading is consistent with plausible legislative intent since any case-by-case assessment that data will not identify a taxpayer is problematic because it \u201cdepends to a large extent upon uninformed estimations as to what data the requester [already] possesses.\u201d Maj. op. at 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">The problem of identification by an informed requester is not at all unique to the Internal Revenue Service. Exemption 4 of the FOIA, for example, exempts from disclosure material containing confidential, commercial information. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(4). Exemption 6 exempts \u201cpersonnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(6). Exemption 7 deals with law-enforcement investigatory information to the extent that it would \u201cconstitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(c). All of these exemptions clearly implicate the \u201cinformed requester\u201d problem, but the Act nonetheless provides that \u201c[a]ny reasonable segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this subsection.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). Courts have developed standards and procedures to deal with agency assertions that any disclosure might lead to the substantive harm described by FOIA, taking into account the informed requester issue. <em>See Dept. of Air Force v. Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 380, 96 S.Ct. 1592, 1608, 48 L.Ed.2d 11 (1976) (\u201cwhat constitutes identifying information regarding a subject cadet must be weighed not only from the viewpoint of the public, but also from the vantage of those who would have been familiar, as fellow cadets or Academy Staff, with other aspects of his career at the Academy\u201d); <em>Halperin v. Central Intelligence Agency, </em>629 F.2d 144,150 (D.C.Cir.1980) (concluding that CIA was justified in not disclosing information since \u201c[w]e must take into account ... that each individual piece of intelligence information, much like a piece of jigsaw puzzle, may aid in piecing together other bits of information even when the individual piece is not of obvious importance in itself\u201d) (quoted approvingly in S.Rep. No. 221, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 27-28 (1983)); <em>Schonberger v. National Transportation Safety Board, </em>508 F.Supp. 941, 945 (D.D.C.1981) (\u201cthe material cannot be redacted in a manner that would protect the identity of the individual whose privacy interest is at stake\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">As the panel points out in describing the procedure for evaluating the disclosability of information which does not meet the definition of \u201creturn information,\u201d courts can, when appropriate, accept affidavits about classes of documents and information, as opposed to requiring document by document searches and Vaughn Indexes. Panel op. at 160-161. Of course, that approach entails some administrative effort, but administrative inconvenience alone has never been considered a sufficient reason for cutting back on FOIA. <em>See Long, </em>596 F.2d at 367 (discussing amounts that some FOIA searches have cost but pointing out that Congress recognized that statute was an expensive one).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">The majority argues, however, that while Congress was willing to tolerate the \u201crisk of occasional unknowing disclosure\u201d for FOIA disclosures in general, it was not willing to tolerate that risk for certain classes of information. Maj. op. at 158 (citing Central Intelligence Files). The CIA exemption teaches though, that Congress clearly know how to exclude certain classes of information from FOIA altogether when it wanted to. In the Central Intelligence File context it provided that \u201cOperational files of the Central Intelligence Agency may be exempted by the Director of Central Intelligence from the provisions of [FOIA] which require publication or disclosure, or search or review in connection therewith.\u201d 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">Indeed, the majority\u2019s conclusion that Congress sought to guard broadly against the \u201cinformed requester\u201d phenomenon is undercut by the fact that, with regard to IRS written determinations (rulings, determination letters, or technical advice memoranda) and background files relating to written determinations, Congress explicitly provides for public inspection of the doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>uments after <em>deletion </em>of the specific exempted data that is not to be disclosed. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6110. Section 6110 operates independently of FOIA, sets out its own exemptions and procedures, and is in many respects stricter. Yet Congress mandated disclosure after deletion of the nondisclosable material. Written determinations such as private letter rulings that describe the underlying facts of a case surely carry with them the same risk of taxpayer identification, yet Congress was satisfied with deletion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There is, so far as I can tell, nothing to indicate that Congress wanted the informed requester problem treated differently when it comes to return information.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Given my conclusion that items listed in \u00a7 6103(b)(2) that can be disclosed in a manner that does not identify a taxpayer are not \u201creturn information,\u201d and are therefore not wholly immune from FOIA disclosure,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>1 would subject such items to the same procedures as the panel provides for items not specifically listed in \u00a7 6103. <em>See </em>Panel op. at 153. If the Service determines that disclosure cannot be made without risk of identification, that factual assessment, of course, deserves considerable deference, dependent as it is on the agency\u2019s expertise in the area. <em>See Halperin v. Central Intelligence Agency, </em>629 F.2d 144, 148 (D.C.Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The court today overreads an everyday casual phrase of no certain content to impose an important new and comprehensive restriction on disclosure of items listed in \u00a7 6103(b)(2), a requirement that does nothing in itself to advance the cause of taxpayer privacy. The majority adopts a \u201creformulation\u201d test which Congress never intended, and which the majority itself is unable to define. In so doing, the court has misread the thrust of the Haskell Amendment and effectively emasculated its application. The court has, in the most classic sense, elevated \u201cform\u201d over substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b248-5\">. The agency\u2019s brief did not contend that such statistical information was necessarily limited to the statistical compilations described in Section 6108, nor do I. And at oral argument agency counsel reiterated that the tax model would be included within the agency\u2019s construction of the Haskell amendment, as the <em>King </em>court had concluded in 1982. <em>King </em>treated the tax model as a statistical tabulation. 688 F.2d at 493. In light of the <em>King </em>discussion I fail to understand the majority\u2019s \u2018'surprise\" theory. Maj.Op. at 162 n. 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b249-8\">. The notion that deference should not be accorded if the agency\u2019s interpretation appears to be no more than a \u201ccurrent litigation position\" suggests a slightly different but related variation on the original doctrine. But the IRS has, as far as I can tell, always sincerely asserted the <em>King </em>interpretation whenever it was appropriate to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b250-5\">. If the agency were formally to adopt the <em>King </em>position, let us say through a regulation or interpretive rule, it would surely be entitled to deference before other circuits that have not as yet faced the need to interpret the Haskell amendment. But I really see no inherent reason why it would not be entitled to deference in this court in a new proceeding as well. That prospect suggests that if the majority is uncertain as to whether the <em>King </em>analysis is actually the IRS\u2019s position, it should order the case remanded to the agency to allow what it regards as an adequate demonstration to that effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b251-8\">. We have held that Section 6103 is an exemption 3 statute; that is, it meets the criteria set out in subsection (b)(3). <em>Moody </em>v. <em>IRS, </em>654 F.2d 795, 797 <em>&amp; </em>n. 4 (D.C.Cir.1981); <em>see Chamberlain v.

My reading of Section 6103 and FOIA nevertheless differs from the reasoning of <em>Zale Corp. v. IRS, </em>481 F.Supp. 486 (D.D.C.1979), relied upon by <em>King. </em>The <em>Zale </em>court held that Section 6103 was a self-contained provision not subject at all to judicial review under FOIA. <em>Id. </em>at 489-90. The court held that Section 6103 contained its own standard governing disclosure or nondisclosure of tax return information and that decisions not to disclose were subject to review only under the Administrative Procedure Act. <em>Id. </em>In my view, this analysis goes too far. Section 6103 and FOIA are easily construed together without the need to ignore either provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b251-14\">. In 1974 and 1976 Congress amended FOIA to clarify the meaning of de novo review and to tighten the focus of certain exemption provisions. To do this Congress explicitly overruled judicial precedents that it viewed as obstacles to fulfilling FOIA\u2019s pro-disclosure policy. In the 1974 amendments to FOIA, for example. Congress overruled the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>EPA v. Mink, </em>410 U.S. 73, 93 S.Ct. 827, 35 L.Ed.2d 119 (1973). Congress viewed the Court\u2019s holding as having interpreted exemption (b)(1), relating to national security and foreign policy matters, too broadly. Congress clarified in the 1974 amendments that district court judges could conduct in camera inspection of classified documents and need not defer to the agency\u2019s decision to label a document classified. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 1200, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 9, 12 (1974), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1974, p. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>6267 (stating intent to overrule <em>Mink). </em>Similarly, in 1976, Congress overruled <em>FAA v. Robertson, </em>422 U.S. 255, 95 S.Ct. 2140, 45 L.Ed.2d 164 (1975) , which had interpreted exemption (b)(3) to embrace a statute (and by implication a class of statutes) that Congress had not intended to include among those excusing disclosure. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1441, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 25 (1976) , U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976, p. 2183 (stating intent to overrule <em>Robertson).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">The legislative history of the 1974 and 1976 amendments to FOIA does not discuss the term \"de novo review\u201d in any directly relevant respect. But the legislative history of the 1974 amendments does discuss the term in connection with new statutory language that narrowed the scope of exemption (b)(1) and clarified that a district court may order, as part of its de novo review of an agency\u2019s withholding determination, in camera review of classified documents. S.Rep. No. 1200, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 8-9, 11-12 (1974). The Conference Report states that in camera inspection should not be automatically undertaken; that the agency should first receive an opportunity to demonstrate the correctness of its classification decision (the predicate for withholding documents under exemption 1) by means of affidavits. In deference to executive agencies\u2019 expertise in national security and foreign policy matters, the conferees stated their intent that courts should \u201caccord substantial weight to an agency\u2019s affidavit concerning the details of the classified status of the disputed record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1974, p. 6290. Thus, Congress recognized that even within the de novo review that it directed courts to conduct under FOIA, there was room for deference to the agency on factual issues relating to the availability of an exemption in a particular case within the agency\u2019s delegated area of responsibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b252-13\">. The term de novo review, as it is used in the general judicial review provision of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(F), is limited to an independent review of the relevant facts.

Since the en banc court has considered only this discrete legal issue, and has left to the panel the application of its \u201cholding to the facts of the present case,\u201d maj. op. at 163, my dissent must similarly focus on the legal issue of \u00a7 6103(b)(2)'s general meaning. I am concerned, however, that the court\u2019s recent practice of issuing en banc opinions on legal issues, as opposed to concrete factual scenarios, <em>see also United States v. Foster, </em>783 F.2d 1082 (D.C.Cir. 1986) (en banc), poses problems. Judges typically do not issue advisory opinions on abstract legal issues because of the case or controversy requirement of Article III. While our practice here does not, of course, technically implicate those provisions, it does, in my opinion, raise some of the dangers that the case or controversy requirement protects against. For example, it is conceivable that a majority of the en banc court might think that this controversy could be disposed of on some narrower, factual ground than a wholesale repudiation of our old definition of \u00a7 6103(b)(2). Yet the contours of the issue that was heard en banc practically prevent such an alternative. Unlike Supreme Court review, where the justices review the entire record before deciding whether to hear a specific issue, our practice isolates the legal issue from its factual moorings altogether. I hope that, in the future, the court will be cautious in adopting this kind of piecemeal approach to en banc hearings. \"The establishment of legal rules for future guidance,\" maj. op. at 155 n.l, best emerges out of fullfledged, fact-based adversarial proceedings, not judicial rulemaking.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b256-13\">. It is essential to note that the disclosability of actual tax returns and other information filed by the taxpayer is not at issue here. Such items are covered by \u00a7 6103(b)(1), are not subject to the Haskell Amendment, and are thus wholly immune from disclosure under FOIA\u2019s exemption 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b257-11\">. Because it holds that \u00a7 6103(b)(2) requires <em>both </em>anonymity <em>and </em>reformulation, the effect of the majority\u2019s holding is not to require any redaction pursuant to FOIA, since that statute has been held not to require an agency to create new documents. <em>See Renegotiation Board v. Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corp., </em>421 U.S. 168, 192, 95 S.Ct. 1491, 1504, 44 L.Ed.2d 57 (1975); <em>Krohn v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>628 F.2d 195, 197-98 (D.C.Cir. 1980). My approach, by contrast, reads \u00a7 6103(b)(2) as not precluding disclosure of data so long as the disclosed data cannot identify the taxpayer. Deletion of identifying information can, under this approach, take certain data out of the \"return information\u201d definition, and is thus mandated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>segregation requirement of FOIA. <em>See Neufeld, </em>646 F.2d at 665-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Of course, my disagreement with the majority goes far beyond the applicability of the segregation requirement of FOIA. Because of its \"reformulation\u201d requirement, the majority forbids disclosure of any return information in its original state, even if the information, without the need for any redaction, is absolutely nonidentifying.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b258-7\">. As the majority points out, the only <em>substantive </em>comment made was Senator Haskell\u2019s remark about what effect the amendment would have on tax research. <em>See </em>maj. op. at 161.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"A8l\">. The House passed no like provision, and the Conference Committee report states only that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMW\">The Senate amendment provides that returns and return information are confidential and not subject to disclosure except as specifically provided by statute____ Under the amendment, data in a form that cannot be associated with or otherwise identify a particular taxpayer will not constitute return information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AM1\">S.Rep. No. 1236, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. at 476-77 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b259-6\">. Indeed, even the majority is unable to set forth a general test for when information is in a different form. Maj. op. at 160-63. All it is sure of is that deletion is not sufficient and aggregation is not necessary. Yet, somehow, the majority is able to \"readily opine\u201d from the purpose of its reformulation test, that mere copying in different language and style is not sufficient. Maj. op. at 163 n.5. The glaring deficiency with the majority\u2019s \"reformulation\u201d test is that it never specifies from <em>what </em>original form the reformulation must be done and just what satisfies the reformulation requirement. The majority refers to \"some alteration by the government of the form in which the return information was originally recorded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163. Yet the IRS obviously has information in its files in hundreds of different developmental stages. For example, notes of an investigation, abstracts of an investigation, list of investigations done in a week, etc. ... To say that there must be \"reformulation\u201d does not at all answer the question of what is an original form to begin with.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b259-12\">. The fact that Senator Haskell specifically intended to allow disclosure of items such as the tax model strongly supports the <em>Neufeld </em>position that redaction is enough to take a document out of the \"return information\u201d classification. In reaching its original decision in this case, the majority erroneously assumed that the tax mod<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>el was a \"partly actual, partly fictional return,\" and thus met its novel \"reformulation requirement.\u201d Maj. op. at 163 (prior to amendment). Through a helpful post-decision motion filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington, it has now come to light that, at the time of the Haskell Amendment, the tax model was in fact only \"an actual return with identifying details eliminated.\u201d Maj. op., at 162 (as amended). <em>See </em>Motion of Amicus Curiae to Amend Opinion (filed June 10, 1986). Given this acknowledgement of its mistaken factual assumption, I am amazed that the majority continues to claim that redaction is insufficient under the Haskell Amendment. After having relied in the original opinion on the tax model to refute the government\u2019s suggestion that <em>aggregation </em>is required, the majority stubbornly refuses now to examine the effect that the newly discovered definition of the then existing tax model has on its own standard of <em>reformulation. </em>The correct description of the tax model at the time of passage definitively demonstrates that both the interpretations advanced by the government and the majority are wrong, and that all that the framers of the Amendment thought necessary under \u00a7 6103 was effective redaction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b260-9\">. The majority argues that the score is in fact 9-2. Maj. op. at 158 n. 2. It supports this by counting \u00a7 6103 four separate times, by counting \u00a7 6103 twice, by discounting the relevance of \u00a7 6108(c), and by arguing that the phrase \"in a form\u201d is a flaw to be counted against the circuit\u2019s former construction, but not against its own construction. Leaving these accounting issues aside, the fact remains that under either tabulation, neither construction fits snugly with the rest of the statutory scheme.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b262-9\">. The majority argues that the error of the <em>Long </em>construction is made \u201cparticularly clear\" when compared with the detailed provisions set out in \u00a7 6110 for disclosure of written interpretation documents in which the public has an even stronger interest. The majority\u2019s point, however, applies equally to its own analysis of \u00a7 6103. Why, under its construction of \u00a7 6103 would Congress have permitted disclosure of reformulated, nonidentifying information without any of the safeguards of \u00a7 6110 (which itself applies to nonidentifying, and assumedly reformulated, information)? We all agree that \u00a7 6103, unlike \u00a7 6110, operates within the confines of FOIA, and does not provide for the extra safeguards listed in \u00a7 6110. <em>See </em>Panel op. at 148-150. The presence of a separate statutory scheme in \u00a7 6110 does not then help the majority at all in showing that Congress was not satisfied with FOIA-type redaction under \u00a7 6103.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b262-12\">.
