In December 1984 Norris was seen traveling by car with Scutari in Utah. In January 1985 Norris was traced to and arrested in Alabama.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-16\">The Brinks robbery, which was the federal crime underlying Norris\u2019 charge as an accessory, was listed as obstructing, delaying, or affecting commerce by threats of violence, as prohibited by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951. The government presented extensive evidence at trial to show a close connection between Scutari and Norris. Norris was convicted by a jury and sentenced to a prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-17\">On appeal Norris claims that (1) the trial court improperly instructed the jury that the government need not show Norris knew Scutari\u2019s name was Scutari, although it must show that the man who had been with Norris in Utah was the Scutari who had committed the robbery; (2) the evidence at trial was legally insufficient to show Norris knew Scutari had committed the holdup; and (3) 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 had not been violated. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-19\">Norris\u2019 counsel did not object to the contested jury instruction at trial. This precludes our consideration of it on appeal unless the instruction constituted \u201cplain error.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 30, 52(b); <em>United States v. Kilbum, </em>596 F.2d 928, 935 (10th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 966, 99 S.Ct. 1517, 59 L.Ed.2d 782 (1979). There was no denial of a fundamental right here; the instruction was not hopelessly confusing, as alleged. Rather, it was correct under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-20\">Norris bases his insufficiency of the evidence claim on the lack of direct evidence that he knew an offense had been committed. But the knowledge required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3 may be shown wholly by circumstantial evidence. <em>United States v. Burnette, </em>698 F.2d 1038, 1051 (9th Cir. 1983). The circumstantial evidence presented at trial, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, fully supports the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See, e.g., </em>R. 111, 75-82, 87-91, 104-07; R. IV, 199-202, 220-22, 272-83, 307-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-21\">Norris\u2019 final argument is that the robbery did not interfere with interstate commerce, as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(b)(3). We note initially that \u00a7 1951, the \u201cHobbs Act,\u201d was enacted primarily to deal with labor racketeering and extortion. <em>See United States v. Enmons, </em>410 U.S. 396, 401-10, 93 S.Ct. 1007, 1010-15, 35 L.Ed.2d 379 (1973); <em>United States v. Green, </em>350 U.S. 415, 418-21, 76 S.Ct. 522, 524-27, 100 L.Ed. 494 (1956). But the Supreme Court dispelled any doubt over the Act\u2019s application to crimes of the sort involved here in <em>United States v. Culbert, </em>435 U.S. 371, 98 S.Ct. 1112, 55 L.Ed.2d 349 (1978). In <em>Culbert </em>a unanimous Court held that racketeering was not an essential requirement of the crime; it held that a single attempt to extort money from a banker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>fell within the statute\u2019s prohibition. <em>Id. </em>at 374-80, 98 S.Ct. at 1114-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">Section 1951 literally prohibits any act that \u201caffects commerce ... by robbery____\u201d With little discussion, courts</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">have allowed \u00a7 1951 to be used against ordinary robberies. <em>See e.g., United States v. Scaife, </em>749 F.2d 338, 341, 347-48 (6th Cir.1984) (general store); <em>United States v. Caldarazzo, </em>444 F.2d 1046, 1048-49 (7th Cir.1971) (jewelry salesman), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 958, 92 S.Ct. 328, 30 L.Ed.2d 276 (1971). A de minimis effect on commerce has been held to be enough to violate \u00a7 1951. <em>United States v. Conn, </em>769 F.2d 420, 424 (7th Cir.1985) (state court clerk accepting bribes). A mere \u201cdepletion of assets\u201d of a firm engaged in interstate commerce will meet the requirement. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>748 F.2d 1535, 1537 (11th Cir.1984) (bank officer\u2019s extortion).</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-6\">We therefore must conclude that this Brinks robbery violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951. Norris assisted a person who had committed \u201can offense against the United States,\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
