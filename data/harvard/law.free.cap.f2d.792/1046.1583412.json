Denied habeas corpus relief from that sentence in the district court, Holley argues that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the issue of proportionality under <em>Solem v. Helm, </em>463 U.S. 277, 103 S.Ct. 3001, 77 L.Ed.2d 637 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-21\">The decision in this case is controlled by <em>Seritt v. State of Alabama, </em>731 F.2d 728 (11th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 545, 83 L.Ed.2d 433 (1984).

Petitioner, Johnny Holley, Jr., is an inmate at the Holman Correctional Facility, Holman Station, Alabama serving a sentence of life without parole. Petitioner was convicted of first degree robbery<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on April 9,1980 in the Circuit Court of Tuscaloosa County, Alabama. Because he had seven<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> times previously been convicted of felonies, petitioner was sentenced to life without parole pursuant to the mandatory sentencing provisions of Alabama\u2019s Habitual Felony Offender Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The conviction and sentence were affirmed by the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals. <em>Holley v. State, </em>397 So.2d 211 (Ala.Cr.App.), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 So.2d 217 (Ala.1981). Thereafter, Holley filed several petitions for the writ of error coram nobis in the Tuscaloosa County Circuit Court. Those petitions were all denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-4\">THE ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-5\">On this petition Holley claims that a sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole is disproportionate to the crime for which he was convicted and, thus, constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Solem v. Helm, </em>463 U.S. 277, 103 S.Ct. 3001, 77 L.Ed.2d 637 (1983). He does not challenge the constitutionality of Alabama\u2019s Habitual Offender Act itself, but, rather \u201cchallenges the constitutionality of that act as applied to the facts and circumstances of his case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-15\">EXHAUSTION OF STATE REMEDIES</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-16\">Respondent claims petitioner has failed to exhaust state remedies since he has not presented the <em>Solem </em>proportionality claim in state court. On direct appeal, and in at least one petition for the writ of error coram nobis, Holley claimed that his \u201csentence [was] grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime.\u201d <em>Solem </em>was decided two and one-half years after decision of the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals on Holley\u2019s direct appeal. Respondents argue, in effect, that the petitioner must return to the state courts to present his <em>Solem </em>claim because the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals did not have the benefit of that decision at the time it considered his eighth amendment claim on direct appeal. Authoritative decisional law in this circuit answers the claim.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-17\">A petitioner may not be required to exhaust his claim if a change in the law occurs between the exhaustion of available state remedies and the filing of a petition for federal habeas corpus. If the change provides an effective state procedure, <em>Texas v. Payton, </em>390 F.2d 261, 270 (5th Cir.1968), or a fundamental variation in substantive federal law, the petitioner generally will be required to return to the state courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Al9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number><em>Galtieri v. Wainwright, </em>582 F.2d 348, 355 (5th Cir.), <em>reh. denied, </em>587 F.2d 508 (1978).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1128-4\">Clearly, <em>Solem </em>did not provide any effective state procedure which was not available to Holley earlier. Likewise, it was not a fundamental departure from existing federal law. Constitutional principles regarding proportionality were recognized by the United States Supreme Court in 1910. <em>Weems v. United States, </em>217 U.S. 349, 30 S.Ct. 544, 54 L.Ed. 793 (1910). In 1980 the court considered a proportionality claim in <em>Rummel v. Estelle, </em>445 U.S. 263, 100 S.Ct. 1133, 63 L.Ed.2d 382 (1980). In reality, <em>Solem </em>did nothing more than to apply long established principles to the particular facts of that case. Because Holley presented the substance of his federal habeas claim in state court, he has exhausted state remedies and cannot be compelled to return there.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-6\">The facts necessary to a decision in this matter were found by the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-7\">Johnny Holley, Jr., was convicted by a jury in Tuscaloosa County for robbery in the first degree and later was sentenced to life without parole when the Alabama Habitual Felony Offender Act was invoked upon a showing of seven prior felony convictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-8\">Johnny Holley, Jr. was identified by witnesses as the man they saw on Sunday, January 13,1980, outside the Chapel A.M.E. Zion Church in Tuscaloosa County, carrying a box of tools away from a truck belonging to Baylock Sledge. No one saw him break into the truck, and when Holley was accosted he stated that he had bought the tool box. When Sledge and others pursued the appellant, Holley set the box down, pulled a knife and moved toward Sledge. As Sledge and the others drew near, Holley warned, \u201cDon\u2019t come up on me or I\u2019ll cut the hell out of you.\u201d He started to \u201cwave\u201d the knife, but then turned and ran away. The next day the appellant was arrested after being chased into a wooded area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-13\">After the State completed its case, the appellant made a motion to exclude the State\u2019s evidence because the State had failed to make out a prima facie case. The motion was denied and the appellant rested his case without presenting any evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-14\">Subsequently, the jury returned a guilty verdict and the court adjudged the appellant guilty in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict. Afterwards, the State requested a sentencing hearing so that evidence could be presented as to the accused\u2019s record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-15\">A sentencing hearing was held after the appellant had been given reasonable notice. At the hearing, the appellant was represented by counsel and no objection was made to the sentencing hearing, nor was there a motion for a continuance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-16\">During the sentencing hearing the State produced certified copies of judgment entries of seven prior felony convictions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Also, the State offered testimony of a police officer who had known the appellant for ten years and testified concerning his knowledge of two grand larcenies and one burglary in which the appellant had been involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-17\">The appellant did not produce any witnesses during the sentencing hearing, but his attorney did take advantage of the opportunity to cross-examine one of the two State witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajh\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>At the completion of the sentencing hearing and arguments by the parties, the trial court found that the appellant, after having been previously convicted of seven felonies in Alabama, committed the offense of robbery in the first degree. The court therefore sentenced appellant to imprisonment for life without parole, pursuant to Section 13A-5-9(c)(3), Code of Alabama 1975.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1129-5\">211 [397] So.2d at 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-6\">THE REQUEST FOR DISCOVERY AND EVIDENTIARY HEARING</p>\n<p id=\"A90m\">In the opinion of the court the disposition of this case is governed by <em>Seritt v. State of Alabama, </em>731 F.2d 728 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>[\u2014 U.S. -], 105 S.Ct. 545 [83 L.Ed.2d 433] (1984). For that reason no evidentiary hearing is required and no discovery is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-9\">The federal habeas petitioner has the burden to establish the need for an evidentiary hearing. <em>Williams v. Griswald, </em>743 F.2d 1533 (11th Cir.1984); <em>Birt v. Montgomery, </em>725 F.2d 587, 591 (11th Cir.1984) (en banc). The threshold inquiry in deciding whether a hearing should be held is whether the petitioner\u2019s allegations, if proved, would establish the right to habeas corpus relief. <em>Townsend v. Sain, </em>372 U.S. 293, 307 [83] S.Ct. 745, 754, 9 L.Ed.2d 770, 782 (1963); <em>Birt v. Montgomery, supra, </em>at 591, quoting <em>Townsend. </em>In evaluating a request for a hearing a court must \u201cconsider the allegations of the defendant\u2019s habeas petition and supplement the petition with those facts undisputed on the record below.\u201d <em>Birt v. Montgomery, supra, </em>at 591; <em>see Cronnon v. Alabama, </em>587 F.2d 246, 249 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 974, 99 S.Ct. 1542, 59 L.Ed.2d 792 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-10\">The rules governing discovery in ordinary civil cases are applicable to petitions for the writ of habeas corpus only to the extent authorized by the court for good cause shown. Rule 6, Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in the United States District Courts. The petitioner seeks authority from the court to engage in discovery for the purpose of gathering evidence relevant to such questions as: What sentences are imposed in Alabama against persons convicted for the first or second time of serious offenses such as murder and rape? What sentences are actually imposed for convictions based upon conduct of similar seriousness to that of the petitioner? How many persons subject to the habitual offender law escape its provisions through plea bargaining?</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-12\">Petitioner argues that he should be \u201callowed to prove his case based on the facts and circumstances of <em>his </em>offense and an evaluation of those facts and circumstances under the three objective criteria required by <em>Solem.\u201d </em>It is his position that both <em>Solem </em>and <em>Seritt </em>require a case-by-case analysis utilizing \u201cobjective criteria\u201d in every instance where an eighth amendment proportionality attack is made on a criminal sentence. The court does not believe such to be the case. The <em>Solem </em>case is limited by its narrow scope and by the court\u2019s admonition that it not be construed as holding that extensive review of all prison sentences is constitutionally mandated. In <em>Solem v. Helm, </em>the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-13\">[W]e do not adopt or imply approval of a general rule of appellate review of sentences. Absent specific authority, it is not the role of an appellate court to substitute its judgment for that of the sentencing court as to the appropriateness of a particular sentence; rather, in applying the Eighth Amendment the appellate court decides only whether the sentence under review is within constitutional limits. In view of the substantial deference that must be accorded legislatures and sentencing courts, <em>a reviewing court rarely will be required to engage in extended analysis to determine that a sentence is not constitutionally disproportionate. </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1129-14\">463 U.S. at 290 n. 16 [103 S.Ct. at 3009 n. 16]. The court further noted that \u201c \u2018[o]utside the context of capital punishment, <em>successful </em>challenges to the proportionality of particular sentences [will be] exceedingly rare.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original). 463 U.S. at 289-90 [103 S.Ct. at 3009-10].</p>\n<p id=\"AWp\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>Apparently the petitioner would have the court engage in a \u201ccomparative analysis\u201d between the specific facts of his crime and those of Seritt and other persons who have been sentenced under Alabama\u2019s Habitual Felony Offender Act. For example, in a memorandum brief filed November 20, 1984, petitioner seeks to depreciate the seriousness of his offense by characterizing it as a nonviolent \u201cpenny-ante theft of a tool box from the back of an unoccupied pick-up truck with [petitioner] only drawing a pocket-knife as he was \u2018accosted\u2019 by a group of people leaving the scene.\u201d Petitioner seems to reason that his armed robbery was not as violent, and, thus, not as serious as that of Seritt\u2019s. Accordingly, his sentence should not have been as harsh as Seritt\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-4\">Proportionality, as a concept in reviewing criminal sentences, has been used in two different ways; traditional proportionality and comparative proportionality. The two concepts were recently distinguished by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Pulley v. Hams, </em>465 U.S. 37, 104 S.Ct. 871, 79 L.Ed.2d 29 (1984). Harris was sentenced to death after conviction of a capital offense. On appeal he did not claim that death was a disproportionate sentence for his crimes but contended that the sentencing court had not compared his particular crime and sentence to those imposed on others for similar conduct. In distinguishing the two concepts, the court said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-H\">Traditionally, \u201cproportionality\u201d has been used with reference to an abstract evaluation of the appropriateness of a sentence for a particular crime. Looking to the gravity of the offense and the severity of the penalty, the sentences imposed for other crimes, and to sentencing practices in other jurisdictions, this Court has occasionally struck down punishments as inherently disproportionate, and therefore cruel and unusual, when imposed for a particular crime or category of crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1130-5\">* # * * $ *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1130-6\">[A different] sort of proportionality review presumes that the death sentence is not disproportionate to the crime in the traditional sense. It purports to inquire instead whether the penalty is nonetheless unacceptable in a particular case because disproportionate to the punishment imposed on others convicted of the same crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1130-8\">104 S.Ct. at 875-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-9\">The court first considered a case involving comparative proportionality in <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238 [92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346] (1972), where the court was confronted with a claim that Georgia\u2019s death penalty was being administered in an arbitrary and capricious manner. In comparative proportionality the question is not whether a capital convict\u2019s crime was less egregious than those of other capital convicts but whether it was less egregious than the crimes of those who did not receive the death penalty. In other words, was the defendant sentenced to death for less egregious conduct than that which was committed by others who were given sentences less than death? The court seems never to have undertaken to review sentences based upon comparisons of conduct except in the context of death penalty cases. Such cases are not particularly helpful. The court has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1130-10\">Because a sentence of death differs in kind from any sentence of imprisonment, no matter how long, our decisions applying the prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments to capital cases are of limited assistance in deciding the constitutionality of the punishment meted out to Rummel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1130-11\"><em>Rummel v. Estelle, supra </em>[445 U.S.], at 272 [100 S.Ct. at 1138]. Even in death cases, there is no constitutional requirement that the courts engage in any comparative proportionality analysis. <em>Pulley v. Harris, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1130-12\">Under the mandatory provisions of Alabama Code Section 13A-5-9(c)(3), a three times convicted felon who is subsequently convicted of a Class A felony is ensured a sentence of life without parole. Thus, each sentence imposed under that section is proportionate to all other sentences so im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>posed. In similar circumstances the court of appeals refused to order a hearing in <em>Seritt. </em>It noted that the district court had before it evidence of the petitioner\u2019s prior felony record and his subsequent Class A felony conviction. The court specifically approved the district court\u2019s finding in that case that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1131-5\">The imposition of such a penalty is reasonable in light of the offender\u2019s repeated demonstration of his inability to function within societal limitations. Since the sentence imposed herein could not be deemed ... disproportionate to the offense committed (robbery after three prior felony convictions), this court finds that the application of the statute ... does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1131-6\">731 F.2d at 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-7\">Because the petitioner is not entitled to have the court review his sentence on the basis of his claim that his conduct was not as egregious as the conduct of other robbers, no evidentiary hearing is required and his motion to engage in discovery on that issue is due to be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-8\">THE MERITS</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-9\">In <em>Solem v. Helms, supra, </em>a divided Supreme Court held that a sentence of life imprisonment without parole under South Dakota\u2019s recidivist statute was constitutionally disproportionate where the conviction was for uttering a \u201cno account\u201d check for $100.00. The defendant there had been previously convicted six times for conduct which involved nonviolent property crimes, all of which were alcohol related. The court reaffirmed its prior holding that a criminal sentence must be proportionate to the crime for which the defendant has been convicted. 463 U.S. at 290 [103 S.Ct. at 3009-10]. In finding Helm\u2019s sentence unconstitutionally disproportionate to his conviction, the court articulated three \u201cobjective criteria\u201d for guiding a proportionality analysis under the eighth amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1131-12\">(1) the gravity of the offense and the harshness of the penalty;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1131-13\">(2) the sentence imposed on other criminals in the same jurisdiction; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1131-14\">(3) the sentences imposed for commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1131-15\">463 U.S. at 292 [103 S.Ct. at 3011],</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-16\">In <em>Seritt v. State of Alabama, supra, </em>the court characterized the issue in <em>Solem </em>to be \u201cthe extremely narrow one of \u2018whether the Eighth Amendment proscribes a life sentence without possibility of parole for a seventh <em>nonviolent felony.\u2019 \u201d </em>731 F.2d at 732. The court held <em>Solem </em>to be \u201csharply distinguishable, ... factually different and therefore inapposite\u201d since \u201cSeritt\u2019s most recent conviction was for first degree robbery, a crime of violence, and the defendant in <em>Solem </em>was convicted of uttering a \u2018no account\u2019 check for $100, a nonviolent offense.\u201d 731 F.2d at 732. The court emphasized the distinction between Seritt\u2019s violent crime and Helm\u2019s nonviolent crime and concluded on \u201cfactual differences\u201d that, <em>\u201cSolem v. Helm </em>does not demand that we declare Seritt\u2019s life imprisonment sentence unconstitutionally disproportionate to the crime of armed robbery.\u201d 731 F.2d at 732. The court reached this conclusion pri- or to applying the three-pronged <em>Solem </em>criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-17\">Although the court found, on factual differences alone, that <em>Solem </em>did not render Seritt\u2019s sentence unconstitutional, it nevertheless went on to analyze Seritt\u2019s proportionality claim under <em>Solem. </em>It concluded that Alabama\u2019s limitation of a life sentence without parole to persons who have three times been convicted of felonies and are subsequently convicted of a Class A felony,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> meets the first prong of the <em>Solem </em>criteria. The court next examined Alabama law and found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Auh\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>[W]e are convinced that Seritt has been treated in the same manner as defendants who have committed equally life-endangering felonies. We also conclude that the relevant statute equally metes out punishment inasmuch as criminals convicted of less serious offenses, i.e., non-life threatening crimes, are given more lenient sentences. Thus, we hold that section 13A-5-9 of the Alabama Code clearly meets the second objective criteria as articulated by the <em>Solent </em>court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1132-4\">731 F.2d at 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-5\">Finally the court compared the sentence received by Seritt with the sentence he could have received had he committed his crime in any of the surrounding states of Florida, Mississippi, Tennessee or Georgia and determined that his Alabama sentence was not disproportionate to what he could have received in those states. 731 F.2d at 736. Thus, the third prong of <em>Solem </em>was met.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-6\">The facts underlying Holley\u2019s habitual offender status are as least as egregious as those of Seritt. In that case the petitioner had five prior convictions for selling unlawful substances. He threatened two motel employees and stole money from them after cutting one\u2019s trousers. In Holley\u2019s case, the state proved seven prior convictions. He stole tools from the victim and threatened \u201cto cut the hell\u201d out of him and others if they interfered with him. Both Seritt and Holley were convicted of Class A felonies after previously having been convicted of three or more felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-7\">CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION</p>\n<p id=\"Ar7S\">Based upon the foregoing the magistrate concludes that the petition for the writ of habeas corpus should be denied. It is so recommended.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-8\">Any party may file specific written objections to this report within ten (10) days of the date it is filed.

The judgment entries evidenced five previous convictions for grand larceny and two convictions for second degree burglary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1131-10\">. The court noted that the Alabama legislature has limited Class A felonies to murder, first-degree kidnapping, first-degree rape, first-degree sodomy, first-degree burglary, first-degree arson, first-degree robbery and treason. All, with the exception of treason, are clearly the most serious of crimes. 731 F.2d at 733.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
