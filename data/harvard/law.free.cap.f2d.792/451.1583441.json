HALL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b539-23\">Officials of the North Carolina Department of Human Resources (\u201cDHR\u201d) and the North Carolina Teachers\u2019 and State Employees\u2019 Retirement System (the \u201cRetirement System\u201d) appeal from the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment and awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to plaintiffs. Plaintiffs cross-appeal, contesting the interest component of the judgment. We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand for a redetermination of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-24\">Plaintiffs, visually handicapped persons who operate vending stands in North Carolina, brought this class action, pursuant to the Randolph-Sheppard Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), 20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 107 <em>et seq., </em>to recover monies diverted from them as employer contributions to the Retirement System. The district court ruled that DHR violated plaintiffs\u2019 rights under the Act when it deducted employer contributions to the Retirement System from vending stand proceeds. It held that plaintiffs are entitled to recover those contributions from the Retirement System with interest at the rate of four percent. The district court ruled, however, that recovery would be barred by the three-year statute of limitations in the case of vendors who withdrew from the Retirement System more than three years before commencement of the action, and that recovery should be reduced by the amount of any disability retirement, disability salary continuation, or death benefits received by individual plaintiffs. Additionally, the court awarded plaintiffs attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">In calculating the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees, the district court first determined lodestar figures for plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, Sanford, Adams, McCullough &amp; Beard (\u201cSAMB\u201d), and Charles R. Hassell, by multiplying reasonable hourly rates by reasonable hours expended. It then made upward adjustments to those figures through application of factors listed in this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Barber v. Kimbrell\u2019s, Inc., </em>577 F.2d 216, 226 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 934, 99 S.Ct. 329, 58 L.Ed.2d 330 (1978) (adopting the twelve factors set forth in <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., </em>488 F.2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir. 1974)). The court increased both figures ten percent due to the complexity and novelty of the case, another ten percent due to the case's contingent nature, and an additional five percent in view of the results obtained. The district court further enhanced the lodestar amount for SAMB by an additional ten percent because of the reputation, ability, and experience of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">On appeal, DHR and the Retirement System raise a number of contentions: (1) that the district court erred in ruling that the eleventh amendment does not bar recovery from the Retirement System; (2) that the district court erred in holding that the DHR defendants violated the Act; (3) that the district court erred in ruling the Retirement System liable in equity to plaintiffs; (4) that the district court abused its discretion in the award of attorneys\u2019 fees to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel; (5) that the district court erred in holding that the statute of limitations does not bar recovery of employer contributions made more than three years before the action was filed; and (6) that the district court erred in failing to hold that recovery was barred for vendors who left their employment before the limitation period but who did not withdraw their employee contributions to the program. In their cross-appeal, plaintiffs allege that the district court erred by awarding them only four percent interest rather than investment income at fair market rates on the funds diverted from them to the Retirement System as employer contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">With the exception of the attorneys\u2019 fees issue, we reject as meritless appellants\u2019 contentions one through five for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Almond v. Boyles, </em>612 F.Supp. 223 (E.D.N.C. 1985) . We find no merit in their sixth allegation. Likewise, we determine that plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal must fail, as the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding plaintiffs only four percent interest. Therefore, the judgment below is affirmed as to these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">With respect to the award of attorneys\u2019 fees, we conclude that the district court applied the wrong standard in calculating the award. As we recently noted in <em>Daly v. Hill, </em>790 F.2d 1071, 1078-79 (4th Cir. 1986) , the latest Supreme Court decisions on this matter, <em>Blum v. Stenson, </em>465 U.S. 886, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984), and <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983), make clear that \u201c[a] fee based upon reasonable rates and hours is presumed to be fully compensatory without producing a windfall.\u201d Under <em>Blum </em>and <em>Hensley, </em>upward adjustments of the lodestar amount based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>on the other factors listed in <em>Barber </em>are not favored and are appropriate only where exceptional circumstances are present. Moreover, many of these additional factors are normally subsumed in initially determining the lodestar figure. <em>Blum, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1548-49, <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 434 n. 9, 103 S.Ct. at 1940 n. 9.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">In the instant case, the district court calculated lodestar figures for plaintiffs\u2019 counsel and then increased the two lodestar amounts thirty-five percent and twenty-five percent, respectively, based on its application of various <em>Barber </em>factors. We find nothing in the record to indicate that the district court identified any exceptional circumstances which warrant such increases. We conclude, therefore, that under <em>Blum </em>and <em>Hensley, </em>this enhancement of the lodestar figures was improper. Accordingly, we vacate and remand to the district court for a redetermination of appropriate attorneys\u2019 fees in light of <em>Blum </em>and <em>Hensley </em>and our decision in <em>Daly.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b541-15\"> The complexity or novelty of the case, the quality of representation, and the results obtained are <em>Barber </em>factors which are generally subsumed within the factors used to calculate a reasonable fee and do not normally provide an independent basis for increasing the fee award. <em>Blum, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1548-49.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
