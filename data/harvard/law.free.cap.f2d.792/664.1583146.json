Both defendants claim that numerous errors warrant reversal of their convictions. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Defendant Goudy masterminded this scheme which operated from 1979 to 1981. Goudy studied bank procedures, particularly check-clearing timetables and interstate banking procedures, to learn how long it takes for a check deposited in one bank to be cleared through another bank. Having recruited people such as codefendant King to join the conspiracy, Goudy travelled from state to state with other coconspirators and opened bank accounts across the country. Back in Chicago, the conspirators opened bank accounts with a small cash deposit, deposited checks drawn on fictitious accounts at banks in other states, and then made large withdrawals from the local accounts before the bad out-of-state checks were returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Goudy and King were tried together. The evidence of the conspiracy came primarily from the testimony of conspirators who had pled guilty and testified pursuant to plea agreements. Bank officials and tellers who had dealings with the defendants testified about specific transactions alleged in the indictment. After a five-day trial, the jury found both defendants guilty on all counts. Both defendants appeal and raise several claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">I. CYNTHIA KING</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">King was convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit bank larceny in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(b), two counts of causing a falsely made security to be transported in interstate commerce in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314, and one count of entering a bank with intent to commit a felony in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). King was sentenced to six months in prison, probation for five years, and ordered to make restitution of $3,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">King argues that the trial judge erred in refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether a security guard for the First National Bank of Chicago was acting as an agent of the police in arresting King in December 1980. King claims that the lack of an evidentiary hearing prevented her from challenging certain unspecified \u201ctacit admissions\u201d apparently obtained from King by the security guard and used by the government at trial. King asserts that her motion to suppress pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(e)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> clearly and specifically alleged facts challenging both the existence of probable cause for the arrest and the government\u2019s claim that the security guard acted as a private citizen in making the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">\u201cA district court is required to conduct an evidentiary hearing on a motion for suppression and return only if evidence on an issue of fact is necessary to the decision of the motion____ The party requesting a hearing bears the burden of showing that there are disputed material facts.\u201d <em>Nechy v. United States (In re Searches and Seizures Conducted on October 2, and 3, 1980), </em>665 F.2d 775, 776 (7th Cir.1981). King asserts that her motion to suppress clearly sets forth facts showing that the bank security guard acted as an agent for the police and unlawfully arrested her. King claims that the guard\u2019s report disputes the government\u2019s claim that the guard acted as a private citizen. She also argues that subpoenaed police bulletins raise a probable cause issue by refuting the security guard\u2019s statement that King was the subject of a fraud bulletin.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-14\">The government, however, contends that the guard acted solely as an agent of the bank in detaining, questioning, and searching King. The government asserts that the security guard\u2019s report clearly estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>lishes that bank personnel contacted the police after the bank guard detained King. The government argues that the only cooperation between the guard and the police occurred when the guard, acting as the bank\u2019s agent, signed a complaint against King after the police arrived. The government therefore concludes that King\u2019s motion did not allege any specific facts showing that the guard acted as an agent of the police in detaining King.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">The only material fact necessary to the decision of King\u2019s suppression motion was whether the bank security guard was acting as an agent for the police when the guard detained King. The guard\u2019s report clearly supports the government\u2019s contentions. The defendant has failed to establish the existence of material disputed facts, and the district court therefore was not required to hold an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">King next claims error in the district court\u2019s denial of her motion to quash her arrest on February 17, 1981, outside Damen Savings and Loan (\u201cDamen\u201d) in Schaumburg, Illinois, and to suppress evidence obtained as a result of that arrest. King contends that the police officer did not have probable cause to detain or arrest King when he encountered her in the bank parking lot and that the subsequent search of her purse was therefore illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">After an evidentiary hearing, the district court found that the arresting officer had expertise in financial crimes and that the information provided him was reasonably trustworthy. The trial judge also found that the arresting officer had conducted prior investigations of check-kiting schemes which \u201cclosely paralleled\u201d King\u2019s checking account transactions. The trial court concluded that Detective Fries had probable cause to arrest King and therefore denied the motion to quash the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">On review, we will not overturn the district court\u2019s findings unless they are clearly erroneous, as the trial judge has had the opportunity to assess the credibility of the witnesses at the evidentiary hearing. <em>United States v. Covelli, </em>738 F.2d 847, 853 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 211, 83 L.Ed.2d 141 (1984). The <em>Covelli </em>court set out the standard for a trial court\u2019s probable cause determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-9\">The police have probable cause to arrest an individual where \u201cthe facts and circumstances within their knowledge and of which they [have] reasonable trustworthy information [are] sufficient to warrant a prudent [person] in believing that the [suspect] had committed or was committing an offense.\u201d <em>Beck v. Ohio, </em>379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 223, 225, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>696 F.2d 479, 486 (7th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>[462 U.S. 1106], 103 S.Ct. 2453, 77 L.Ed.2d 1333 (1983). \u201c[Probable cause requires only a probability or substantial chance of criminal activity, not an actual showing of such activity.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2335 n. 13, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). The determination of whether probable cause exists in a given situation involves \u201cthe factual, practical considerations of everyday life upon which reasonable, prudent [persons], not legal technicians act.\u201d <em>United States v. Watson, </em>587 F.2d 365, 368 (7th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, Davis v. United States, </em>439 U.S. 1132, 99 S.Ct. 1055, 59 L.Ed.2d 95 (1979).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-11\">Detective Fries arrested King in Damen\u2019s parking lot on the strength of information received from Jerry Gartner, Damen\u2019s branch manager, in a telephone conversation. Gartner told Fries that: (1) a woman named Cynthia King had opened an account at Damen on February 6, 1981, with a $20 cash deposit; (2) after the account was opened, a $6,800 check drawn on a bank in Cleveland, Ohio, was deposited into the account; (3) the $6,800 check was a starter check from the Ohio bank and was dated February 9, 1981; (4) the $6,800 check was not honored by the Cleveland bank; (5) Gartner had recently received information from the Cleveland bank that the bank account was opened with fictitious identification; and (6) Cynthia King was presently at Damen picking up printed checks for her account. Gartner also gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Fries a physical description of King. When Fries and another detective arrived at Damen, approximately ten minutes after speaking with Gartner, he saw a woman matching Gartner\u2019s physical description of King leaving the building. After King identified herself, Fries told her to wait with the other detective while Fries went inside to confirm the facts with Gartner.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Reviewing this information with the principles governing a trial court\u2019s probable cause determination in mind, we are satisfied that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in finding that Detective Fries had probable cause to arrest King.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">King\u2019s final objection is to the juxtaposition of instructions on accountability, joint venture, and conspiracy without an additional clarifying instruction. King does not dispute that each instruction given accurately summarizes the law. She instead argues that these instructions, given back-to-back without a clarifying instruction, confused and misled the jury into concluding that they could find King guilty of conspiracy without first finding that she had knowledge of the conspiracy. King asserts that the trial court erred in not giving an additional instruction informing the jury that before they applied the accountability and joint venture instructions to the conspiracy charge they must initially find that the defendant knew that a conspiracy existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">\u201cIn examining the propriety of jury instructions, we view the instructions as a whole and \u2018as long as the instructions treat the issues fairly and accurately, they will not be interfered with on appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Thibodeaux, </em>758 F.2d 199, 202 (7th Cir.1985) <em>(quoting United States v. Croft, </em>750 F.2d 1354, 1366 (7th Cir.1984)). The judge here instructed the jury on the elements of conspiracy, one of which is \u201cthat the defendant knowingly and intentionally became a member of the conspiracy.\u201d The judge also charged the jury that \u201c[t]he government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt from the defendant\u2019s own acts and statements that he or she was aware of the common purpose and was a willing participant.\u201d Furthermore the trial judge also explained that \u201c[i]f you find that the defendant merely \u2014 and this would be the defendant King \u2014 associated with members of the conspiracy, had an opportunity to join the conspiracy, or had knowledge without an intent and agreement to accomplish a specific illegal objective, then she is not a conspirator and you must find her not guilty.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-12\">Considering these instructions as a whole, the instructions sufficiently and accurately informed the jury that to find King guilty of conspiracy they must find that King knew of the conspiracy and willingly joined it. We therefore find no error in the trial court\u2019s jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-13\">II. DAVID GOUDY</p>\n<p id=\"b753-14\">D\u00e9fendant Goudy was convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit bank larceny in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(b); two counts of aiding and abetting the interstate transportation of a falsely made security in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 2314; two counts of bank larceny in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(b); one count of entering a bank with the intent to commit a felony in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a); and one count of aiding and abetting the commission of bank larceny in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 2113(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-15\">Goudy was sentenced to concurrent sentences of fifteen years on one count of entering a bank with the intent to commit a felony; ten years each on two counts of bank larceny; ten years each on two counts of aiding and abetting the interstate trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>portation of a falsely made security; ten years on one count of aiding and abetting the commission of bank larceny; and five years on one count of conspiracy. Goudy also was ordered to pay restitution of $75,-000.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Goudy specifies five claims of error warranting either reversal of his conviction, reversal and remand for a new trial, or reduction of his sentence. Goudy challenges his indictment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) instead of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(b), the effectiveness of his counsel, the district court\u2019s denial of his motions for mistrial and for severance, the sufficiency of the evidence, and his sentence of fifteen years for entering a bank with the intent to commit a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Goudy argues that in count ten of the indictment the government improperly charged Goudy with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). Goudy concedes that the \u201cliteral language\u201d of section 2113(a) covers his offense, but nonetheless claims that Congress did not intend that the punishment for a nonviolent fraud upon a bank be \u201cdoubled\u201d simply because an act in furtherance of the scheme to defraud happened to take place in a bank. Goudy claims that section 2113(a) should not apply to fraud prosecutions and, citing <em>Bell v. United States, </em>462 U.S. 356, 103 S.Ct. 2398, 76 L.Ed.2d 638 (1983), argues that only section 2113(b) should be used to prosecute nonviolent entries with intent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-12\">As Goudy raises this issue for the first time on appeal, Goudy has waived this challenge to the indictment. Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(2) and (f).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Covelli, </em>738 F.2d 847, 862 (7th Cir.1984). \u201cRule 12 ensures that trials will be efficient and that criminal defendants will not be allowed to delay raising claims for tactical reasons.\u201d <em>United States v. Griffin, </em>765 F.2d 677, 681 (7th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-13\">Even if we were to disregard Goudy\u2019s waiver, however, we would find his claim meritless. Goudy concedes that his conduct falls within the literal language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>section 2113(a). Furthermore, as section 2113(d)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> deals specifically with violent entry, it seems that Congress did intend section 2113(a) to cover nonviolent entry of a bank. The statute\u2019s legislative history supports this interpretation. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Bell, </em>in its original form the Federal Bank Robbery Act</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab3\">governed only robbery \u2014 a crime requiring a forcible taking____ By 1937 the concern was broader, for the limited nature of the original Act \u201cha[d] led to some incongruous results.\u201d ... It was possible for a thief to steal a large amount from a bank \u201cwithout displaying any force or without putting anyone in fear,\u201d ... and he would not violate any federal law. Congress amended the Act to fill this gap, adding language now found at \u00a7 2113(a) and (b)____ Although the term \u201clarceny\u201d appears in the legislative reports, the congressional purpose plainly was to protect banks from those who wished to steal banks\u2019 assets \u2014 even if they used no force in doing so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">462 U.S. at 361-62, 103 S.Ct. at 2401-02. Moreover, the Supreme Court has interpreted section 2113(a) \u201cto cover the situation where a person enters a bank for the purpose of committing a crime, but is frustrated for some reason before completing the crime. The gravamen of the offense is not in the act of entering____ Rather the heart of the crime is in the intent to steal.\u201d <em>Prince v. United States, </em>352 U.S. 322, 328, 77 S.Ct. 403, 406, 1 L.Ed.2d 370 (1957). In contrast, section 2113(b) was intended \u201cto cover a situation where a person entered a bank with no unlawful intent, but after entry formed an intent to commit and committed a larceny, or where a larceny was committed and the fact of entry with unlawful intent could not be established.\u201d <em>Purdom v. United States, </em>249 F.2d 822, 827 (10th Cir.1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-13\">As the language and the legislative history of the statute indicates, the government properly alleged count ten as a violation of section 2113(a), not 2113(b). The government alleged that Goudy entered the Elgin National Bank and attempted to withdraw $500 from a savings account with the intent to commit a felony, bank larceny in violation of section 2113(b). The government did not charge, nor did the proof at trial establish, an actual \u201ctaking and carrying away,\u201d an essential element of section 2113(b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-14\">By waiting to raise this issue on appeal, Goudy has waived this challenge to the indictment. But even if he had not waived the issue, his challenge to the indictment would fail as the government properly charged a violation of section 2113(a) in count ten.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-15\">Goudy next claims that his trial counsel\u2019s preparation of the case was not reasonable according to prevailing professional norms and thus violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Goudy bases his claim on three omissions by his counsel: (1) his attorney did not file any pretrial motions; (2) his attorney did not visit or discuss the case with him in the two and one-half months directly preceding the trial; and (3) his attorney allegedly did not completely review the evidence with him. Stating these three reasons, Goudy asked the district court on the first day of trial to order his counsel to withdraw. The trial judge questioned Goudy\u2019s attorney and then denied Goudy\u2019s motion for new counsel and for a continuance. Goudy appeals this denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>A defendant asserting an ineffective assistance claim has the burden of establishing that his lawyer\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficiency prejudiced the outcome of the trial. <em>United States v. Dyer, </em>784 F.2d 812, 816 (7th Cir. 1986). \u201cDeficient performance is to be judged according to an objective standard of reasonableness, giving a high degree of deference to counsel, and making every effort to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time without the distorting effects of hindsight.\u201d <em>United States v. Sherwood, </em>770 F.2d 650, 655 (7th Cir.1985). Furthermore, a reviewing court must consider \u201cthe totality of circumstances in the particular case\u201d to determine whether the attorney\u2019s performance met a minimum standard of professional representation. <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>640 F.2d 87, 92 (7th Cir.1981). Such a review necessitates \u201ca strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 689,104 S.Ct. 2052, 2066 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Goudy has not established that his trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. Goudy faults his attorney for not making any pretrial motions, but does not indicate what motions his attorney should have made. Furthermore, Goudy\u2019s assertion that his attorney failed to visit him during the months immediately preceding trial does not establish that his counsel was not adequately prepared for trial. Goudy\u2019s attorney visited him three times in November 1984. The trial began on February 19, 1985. At a hearing on Goudy\u2019s motion for new counsel, his attorney stated that he had no reason to meet with his client in the months immediately before trial. Goudy himself gives no reason for a meeting; nor does Goudy point to any action or inaction by his counsel at trial that would suggest that his counsel was unprepared. Goudy instead merely concludes that his attorney could not possibly have been prepared for this trial because his counsel only interviewed him three times. The record does not support this conclusion. As for Goudy\u2019s third objection, the government asserts that they followed an \u201copen file discovery\u201d practice for documents in this case, and Goudy\u2019s counsel contends that he forwarded all documents received in discovery to Goudy. Furthermore, the trial judge delayed the trial for several hours specifically to allow Goudy to review all the documents with his attorney. After reviewing the evidence with his attorney, Goudy told the court that he felt better and was ready to go to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">Goudy\u2019s assertions also fail to establish that his trial counsel\u2019s alleged \u201cdeficiencies\u201d prejudiced the outcome of the trial. Goudy does not point to any evidence that would have been excluded by a pretrial motion. Nor does Goudy suggest in any way how the outcome of the trial would have differed if some unspecified motions had been filed or if his attorney had met with him' some unspecified number of times before the trial. Furthermore, Goudy\u2019s attorney at trial made timely objections to questions and to the admission of evidence and thoroughly cross-examined witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">Goudy\u2019s conclusory allegations fall far short of showing that his attorney failed to meet professional standards and that his attorney\u2019s conduct prejudiced the outcome of the trial. A review of the record satisfies us that his trial counsel\u2019s representation more than met professional standards. Goudy\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must therefore fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">Goudy contends also that the district judge\u2019s denial of his motion for severance or for mistrial requires reversal on all counts and remand for a new trial. Goudy claims that the actual conduct of codefendant Cynthia King\u2019s defense mandated severance. Goudy objects to the cross-examinations of Paula Stigler, Charles Hill, and Detective Thomas Fries, a Schaumburg police officer, in which King\u2019s attorney attempted to develop the defense that the women in this conspiracy, including King, had been coerced into participating.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">During cross-examination of Paula Stigler, King questioned her about the men physically abusing her and other women to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>force them to participate in the conspiracy. On redirect, the government elicited Stigler\u2019s testimony that David Goudy and other male coconspirators beat her and burned her with an iron. On recross of Stigler, King returned to the subject of physical abuse by Goudy and other male coconspirators. When cross-examining Charles Hill, one of the coconspirators, King attempted to elicit testimony that the male coconspirators waited outside the banks for the women to make sure the women did what the men wanted. When Hill denied this, King asked leading questions about women being abused, burned, pistol-whipped, and sent out in the cold barefoot. King also brought out that Hill and Goudy both carried guns. During cross-examination of Detective Fries, King questioned Fries about Webster Nolen, another coconspirator, waiting for codefendant King outside Damen Savings and Loan while King went in to pick up printed checks for an account that was opened with a bad check.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Goudy never objected to King\u2019s cross-examination of Paula Stigler. The government objected on hearsay grounds when King asked if Stigler was aware of other women who were forced to participate in the conspiracy, but the judge overruled this objection. During the government\u2019s redirect of Stigler, Goudy made two general objections which were overruled and one hearsay objection which was sustained. On King\u2019s recross-examination of Stigler, Goudy did not object when King again raised the issue of Goudy and other male members of the conspiracy physically abusing the female coconspirators. After Stigler finished her testimony, however, Goudy moved for severance or a mistrial on the basis of the evidence about physical abuse. The judge overruled this motion. Goudy made no objection to King\u2019s series of leading questions to Charles Hill or to King\u2019s cross-examination of Detective Fries.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\"> Mutually antagonistic defenses require severance under Fed.R.Crim.P. 14<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201conly where acceptance of one party\u2019s defense precludes the acquittal of the other.\u201d <em>United States v. Banks, </em>687 F.2d 967, 973 (7th Cir.1982). As Goudy acknowledges that is not the case here. Severance may also be granted if the actual conduct of one defense unduly prejudices the other defendant. \u201cThis ground[] for severance, however, depends upon a careful evaluation of facts elicited, prejudicial tendencies, and the entire course of the trial prior to the challenged conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The trial judge is in the best position to assess any prejudice from the conduct of a defense, and a reviewing court will reverse a judge\u2019s ruling on a severance motion only upon a showing of a clear abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Hedman, </em>630 F.2d 1184, 1200 (7th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">The problem here did not arise until trial. Goudy made no pretrial motion for severance, and the judge therefore did not have advance warning that this issue might arise. Once the issue arose at trial, however, Goudy\u2019s objections and subsequent motion for severance or mistrial were too little and too late. The evidence had already gotten in by the time Goudy objected. Goudy did not object when King first questioned Stigler about physical abuse of the female coconspirators by the males; Goudy instead waited until the government\u2019s redirect of Stigler to object. Goudy thus allowed King to open the door to this subject during the cross-examination of Stigler. Once the defense opened the door, the government had the right to pursue the issue on redirect. <em>See United States v. Draiman, </em>784 F.2d 248, 255 (7th Cir.1986). When Goudy finally objected to the government\u2019s redirect of Stigler, he made a general objection that did not alert the judge to his specific concern about this evidence. Moreover, Goudy never moved to strike any of this testimony, nor did he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>request or tender a curative instruction. Nevertheless, the evidence was not emphasized to the jury as the court barred both sides from mentioning in closing argument that either of the defendants had been coerced into participating in the conspiracy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">In these circumstances, we do not find that the actual conduct of King\u2019s defense was such that the district court abused its discretion by denying Goudy\u2019s severance motion. Furthermore, as the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in allowing this testimony in these circumstances, <em>see United States v. Covelli, </em>738 F.2d 847, 854 (7th Cir.1984), he did not abuse his discretion in denying Goudy\u2019s motion for mistrial. <em>See United States v. Torres, </em>733 F.2d 449, 460-62 (7th Cir.1984); <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>640 F.2d 87, 91 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 991,101 S.Ct. 2331, 68 L.Ed.2d 851 (1981); <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>507 F.2d 433, 436-37 (7th Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Goudy also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence on six of the seven counts of his conviction. The test for sufficiency of the evidence is whether, viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the government, \u201c <em>\u2018any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Herrera, </em>757 F.2d 144, 149 (7th Cir.1985) <em>(quoting Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). The appellant bears a heavy burden and \u201cthus \u2018[ojnly when the record contains no evidence, regardless of how it is weighed, from which the jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, may an appellate court overturn the verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>764 F.2d 476, 478 (7th Cir.1985) <em>(quoting United States v. Redwine, </em>715 F.2d 315, 319 (7th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>467 U.S. 1216, 104 S.Ct. 2661, 81 L.Ed.2d 367 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">Goudy further argues that the evidence of count ten<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> did not establish that he entered a bank, and therefore the evidence was insufficient to convict him of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). The evidence established that on February 27, 1980,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Goudy went to the walk-up window of the drive-up facility of Elgin National Bank, a block away from the main bank building, and attempted to withdraw money from an account in the name of Larry Watson. Goudy argues that no \u201centry\u201d as required in the statute occurred because the transaction occurred at a drive-up facility, and also because he used the walk-up window and never actually entered the drive-up building.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">Neither of these arguments is persuasive. Section 2113(a) applies to \u201cany bank ... or any building used in whole or in part as a bank.\u201d \u201cThe words of the statute ... reflect that Congress by appropriate language intended to make it a crime to enter <em>any part of a bank building </em>with intent to steal.\u201d <em>United States v. Lankford, </em>573 F.2d 1051, 1053 (8th Cir.1978) (emphasis added). It is undisputed that the drive-up facility is a building used as a bank, an arm of the Elgin Bank. The drive-up facility of the Elgin Bank there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>fore is covered by the statute. A teller for the Elgin National Bank testified that Goudy \u201cdid come to the walk-up portion of the drive-up bank.\u201d Goudy points out that the teller\u2019s testimony does not describe the drive-up; however, a reasonable inference from the teller\u2019s testimony is that the walk-up window is in some way a part of an outside wall of the drive-up facility. We conclude that using the walk-up window of the drive-up facility constitutes \u201centering a bank\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Phillips, </em>609 F.2d 1271, 1272-73 (8th Cir.1978) (using drive-up window constitutes entering bank under section 2113(a)); <em>Lankford, </em>573 F.2d at 1053 (an attempt to enter night depository chute is an attempt to enter the bank).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Goudy next claims that the evidence was insufficient to show interstate transportation of the checks supporting counts seventeen and five.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Goudy complains that the testimony of the government\u2019s two witnesses established the normal banking procedures for clearing checks but did not establish that each particular check had in fact been transported in interstate transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The check at issue in count seventeen was drawn on a fictitious account at the United California Bank of Los Angeles. John Prah, Vice-President of Cragin Federal Savings and Loan in Chicago, Illinois testified that the check was deposited in King\u2019s account at Cragin. Prah stated that the check was subsequently returned to Cragin stamped \u201cAccount Closed.\u201d Prah stated that the stamp on the check had to have been made by the United California Bank because only that bank could indicate that the account was closed. Prah also testified that the \u201cnormal routine\u201d practice with a deposited out-of-state check is to return the check to the bank on which it was drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">The check at issue in count five was also drawn on the United California Bank. The check was stamped \u201cReturned not paid by 16-20.\u201d Robin Dadik, a coconspirator who pled guilty, testified that she deposited this check into an account at Damen Savings Bank in Schaumburg, Illinois. An FBI agent with several years\u2019 experience in banking investigations testified that the 1984 volume of Polk\u2019s Bank Director indicates that banks with the routing number prefix \u201c16\u201d are in Los Angeles, California. The trial court admitted the directory into evidence pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 803(17).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">Goudy\u2019s objections to the sufficiency of the proof on these two counts are merit-less. Courts have consistently held that knowingly cashing a check in one state drawn on a bank in another state or delivering such a check for collection is sufficient evidence of the interstate transportation requirement of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>605 F.2d 389, 393 (8th Cir.1979); <em>United States v. Newson, </em>531 F.2d 979, 981 (10th Cir.1976); <em>United States v. Hill, </em>468 F.2d 899, 899 (5th Cir. 1972); <em>United States v. Webb, </em>443 F.2d 308, 310 (5th Cir.1971); <em>Amer v. United States, </em>367 F.2d 803, 804 (8th Cir.1966). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Delivering the check for collection<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201ccauses\u201d it to be transported in interstate commerce. <em>Pereira v. United States, </em>347 U.S. 1, 9, 74 S.Ct. 358, 363, 98 L.Ed. 435 (1954). \u201cIt is common knowledge that such checks must be sent to the drawee bank for collection, and it follows that [the defendant] intended the [local] bank to send this check across state lines.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">The government introduced two checks drawn on a California bank. Two prosecution witnesses testified that these checks were deposited in two Illinois banks. The government also properly introduced evidence regarding the markings on the backs of the checks through a bank official and an experienced FBI agent. <em>See United States v. Mustin, </em>369 F.2d 626, 627 (7th Cir.1966) (per curiam) (bank employee\u2019s expert opinion about markings on check and normal movement of checks was proper expert testimony). The evidence was more than sufficient for a reasonable juror to find interstate transportation of these checks beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Goudy also complains that the evidence supporting count nineteen<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> was insufficient because the bank official\u2019s testimony was based on documents of which she had no personal knowledge. The bank\u2019s vice-president and cashier testified that the bank suffered a $2,500 loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">A trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings may be reversed only upon a showing of abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>772 F.2d 1339, 1343 (7th Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>761 F.2d 394, 398 (7th Cir.1985). The district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the bank official\u2019s testimony which was based upon bank records properly admitted pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 803(6).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-13\">An appellate court may not overturn a guilty verdict unless \u201c \u2018the record contains no evidence, regardless of how it is weighed, from which the jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Redwine, </em>715 F.2d 315, 319 (7th Cir.1983) <em>(quoting Brandom v. United States, </em>431 F.2d 1391, 1400 (7th Cir.1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 1022, 91 S.Ct. 586, 27 L.Ed.2d 634 (1971)). Viewed in the light most favorable to the government, <em>United States v. Percival, </em>756 F.2d 600, 610 (7th Cir.1985), the evidence of count nineteen showed that Goudy opened an account at Union National Bank on February 11, 1980, under the name Larry Watson with a $25 cash deposit. On June 2, 1980, Goudy deposited a $6,380 check payable to Larry Watson and drawn on an Indiana bank. On June 6, Union National Bank cashed a $2,500 check drawn by Larry Watson payable to Webster Nolen. On June 8, the check drawn on the Indiana bank returned unpaid because the account was closed. These facts are such that a rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Goudy aided and abetted the commission of bank larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Goudy also claims the evidence of counts eight and nine<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> was insufficient because the government did not prove that the banks involved suffered a loss. The vice-presidents of the respective banks testified that the banks suffered no loss because the deposited checks had already cleared when the withdrawals were made. Goudy cites no authority, however, and we have found none, for the proposition that section 2113(b) requires proof that the bank suffered a loss. The statute itself contains no language indicating that an actual loss is an element of the crime. The evidence established that these two checks were part of the continuing scheme to defraud these banks. The evidence of counts eight and nine was therefore sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Goudy finally claims that the district court abused its discretion in sentencing him to fifteen years on count ten for entering a bank with intent to commit a felony. Goudy argues that the sentence on count ten should be reduced to not more than ten years, the maximum term allowed under section 2113(b). Goudy posits that Congress could not have intended to penalize more severely the inchoate offense than the completed offense of larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The statutory scheme of section 2113<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> has been explained by this court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX2\">Subsections (a) and (b) are alternative methods of committing the offense defined by the statute. Under the second paragraph of section 2113(a), the entry or the attempted entry of a bank with intent to commit a felony or larceny is sufficient to sustain a conviction. The intended felony or larceny need not be accomplished. On the other hand, under section 2113(b) an offender need not have formed an intent to steal before entering the bank; if he steals money belonging to the bank, he is guilty regardless of when he formed the intent. An offender may not only be guilty of having entered the bank to commit a larceny (proscribed by \u00a7 2113(a)) but may also have accomplished the intended larceny (proscribed by \u00a7 2113(b)). In that situation he may be indicted under either or both subsections, but the sentences may not be pyramided____ Moreover, a violation of section 2113(b) may be committed without force, violence, or intimidation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-10\"><em>United States v. Brunjes, </em>329 F.2d 339, 341 (7th Cir.1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>377 U.S. 983, 84 S.Ct. 1892, 12 L.Ed.2d 751 (1964) (citations omitted). Moreover, the Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-11\">It is a fair inference from the wording in the Act, uncontradicted by anything in the meager legislative history, that the unlawful entry provision was inserted to cover the situation where a person enters a bank for the purpose of committing a crime, but is frustrated for some reason before completing the crime. The gravamen of the offense is not in the act of entering, which satisfies the terms of the statute even if it is simply walking through an open, public door during normal business hours. Rather the heart of the crime is the intent to steal. This mental element merges into the completed crime if the robbery is consummated____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-12\">We hold, therefore, that when Congress made either robbery or an entry for that purpose a crime it intended that the maximum punishment for robbery should remain at 20 years, but that, even if the culprit should fall short of accomplishing his purpose, he could be imprisoned for 20 years for entering with the felonious intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-13\"><em>Prince v. United States, </em>352 U.S. 322, 328-29, 77 S.Ct. 403, 406-07, 1 L.Ed.2d 370 (1957) (footnotes omitted).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>cases indicate, although the statute may not be a model of draftsmanship, it is clear that the possible penalty for entering a bank with the intent to commit a felony is a maximum fine of $5,000 and/or a prison term of twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">An appellate court \u201cmay not reduce or change a sentence imposed within statutory limits \u2018unless the trial court relied on improper or unreliable information in exercising its discretion or failed to exercise any discretion at all in imposing the sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Schmidt, </em>760 F.2d 828, 833 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom, Folak v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 86, 88 L.Ed.2d 71 (1985). <em>Accord United States v. McCoy, </em>770 F.2d 647, 649 (7th Cir.1985). Goudy does not claim that the district judge relied on improper or unreliable information or failed to exercise any discretion at all, and Goudy\u2019s sentence was well within the statutory limit of twenty years. Moreover, the evidence showed that Goudy headed a large check-kiting conspiracy that operated for several years and defrauded several banks out of substantial sums of money. We find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Goudy to fifteen years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">III.

King never testified so there was no direct evidence that she was compelled or coerced into participating in the conspiracy. And apparently none of the witnesses testified that they saw King being physically abused. The judge therefore granted the government\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>and prevented King from arguing coercion as a defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b758-7\">.

Goudy also claims that the evidence was insufficient because the proof did not establish that the acts supporting count ten took place on the date indicated in the indictment. The evidence at trial established that the events actually occurred two days after the date specified in the indictment. This difference in dates, however, does not establish that evidence of an essential element of the crime was insufficient. The indictment charged that Goudy entered the Elgin National Bank with intent to commit a felony \u201con or about February 25, 1980.\u201d The proof at trial showed that this act took place on February 27. The evidence need not establish the exact date of the offense. It is sufficient that the evidence establish, as it did here, that the offense was committed on a date reasonably near the date charged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b759-7\">. Goudy also argues that his presence in the lobby of the drive-up when the police arrived was not an entry into the bank. He furthermore asserts that even if it were an entry, he did not possess the requisite intent because he entered the lobby in response to the bank teller\u2019s efforts to detain Goudy until the police arrived.
