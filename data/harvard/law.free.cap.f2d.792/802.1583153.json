The challenged sections specify the membership of the state central committees of ballot-qualified political parties and the term of office of committee chairs, and prohibit both state and county central committees from endorsing candidates in party primaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-21\">Plaintiffs are various county central committees of the Democratic and Republican parties, the state central committee of the Libertarian party, members of these and other party central committees, and various other groups and individuals active in partisan politics in California. They sued the Secretary of State and Attorney General of California and the district attorneys of various counties (hereinafter, \u201cthe Secretary\u201d) for declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 seeking to vindicate their asserted First Amendment right to endorse candidates running in California\u2019s direct primary elections and to structure and conduct their internal affairs free of unjustified interference by the state.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-22\">In the first count of their first amended complaint, plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of Cal.Elec.Code \u00a7 11702, which prohibits state and county central committees from endorsing, supporting, or opposing candidates for partisan office in direct primary elections. Plaintiffs\u2019 second count challenges sections of the Elections Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>and the state constitution that prohibit central committees from endorsing candidates in nonpartisan county, city and school elections. Plaintiffs\u2019 third count challenges Code sections that prescribe the membership of state central committees, the term of office of state committee chairpersons, the time and place of state and county central committee meetings, and the dues to be paid by county committee members.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on all three counts. In response, the Secretary moved to dismiss the amended complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) and (6) and cross-moved for summary judgment. The district court granted summary judgment on plaintiffs\u2019 first count, ruling that section 11702\u2019s ban on preprimary endorsements violated the First Amendment. The court stayed all proceedings on plaintiffs\u2019 second count under the abstention doctrine of <em>Railroad Commission of Texas v. Pullman Co., </em>312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941). The court granted partial summary judgment on plaintiffs\u2019 third count, ruling that the sections prescribing the membership of state central committees and the term of their chairs violated the First Amendment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court, however, denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment with respect to those Code sections regulating the time and place of committee meetings and county committee dues. The court also denied in all respects the Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss and cross-motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Although the district court did not finally dispose of all issues with respect to all parties, it directed the entry of final judgment for plaintiffs under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) on the first count and as to those claims in the third count decided in plaintiffs\u2019 favor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we have jurisdiction to hear the Secretary\u2019s appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">Plaintiffs contend that California\u2019s political parties and their governing bodies \u2014 the state and county central committees \u2014 are voluntary associations entitled to the full protection of the First Amendment. They argue that California\u2019s prohibition of preprimary endorsements and the state\u2019s regulation of party structure and internal affairs abridge their freedom of political expression and association.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In response, the Secretary argues that the state and county central committees of ballot-qualified political parties in California do not enjoy First Amendment status because they are public entities, not private associations. In the alternative, the Secretary argues that the challenged provisions of the Election Code pass First Amendment muster because they are narrowly drawn regulations that serve compelling state interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-12\">\u201cOur form of government is built on the premise that every citizen shall have the right to engage in political expression and association.\u201d <em>Sweezy v. New Hampshire, </em>354 U.S. 234, 250, 77 S.Ct. 1203, 1212, 1 L.Ed.2d 1311 (1957). Because \u201c[ejxercise of these basic freedoms ... has traditionally been through the media of political associations,\u201d <em>id., </em>political parties as well as individual party adherents enjoy First Amendment rights. <em>See Democratic Par</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number><em>ty v.

Finally, courts have \u201cplaced the internal workings of a political party squarely within the protection of the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Ripon Society Inc. v. National Republican Party, </em>525 F.2d 567, 586 (D.C.Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 933, 96 S.Ct. 1148, 47 L.Ed.2d 341 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">In this case we must apply these settled First Amendment principles to the restrictions imposed on California political parties by various provisions of the California Elections Code. To place the important constitutional questions presented by this appeal into perspective, we will first provide an overview of state regulation of political parties in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">Like our national political parties,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> California\u2019s political parties were originally unregulated voluntary associations of individuals \u201cgoverned largely by custom and usage.\u201d <em>Unger v. Superior Court, </em>37 Cal.3d 612, 615, 692 P.2d 238, 209 Cal.Rptr. 474 (1984) <em>(Unger II); see also </em>59 Ops. Cal. Atty. Gen. 60 (1976); 23 Ops. Cal. Atty. Gen. 119, 120 (1954) (citing <em>Spelling v. Brown, </em>122 Cal. 277, 279, 55 P. 126 (1898)). These voluntary associations \u201cfix[ed] membership criteria, nominat[ed] candidates for public office, conducted] their campaigns, and shap[ed] their platforms\u201d with neither recognition nor interference from the state. Friedman, <em>Reflections Upon the Law of Political Parties, </em>44 Cal.L.Rev. 65, 66 (1956); <em>see also Spier v. Baker, </em>120 Cal. 370, 380, 52 P. 659 (1898). Internal party decisions were generally made at party conventions where choices as important as \u201cwho shall represent [the] party on the election day ballot [were] left exclusively to a select group of its leaders.\u201d J. Owens, E. Costantini &amp; L. Weschler, <em>California Politics and Parties </em>78 (1970) [hereinafter, <em>\u201cCalifornia Politics </em>\u201d]. At the turn of the century, Progressive Republicans, led by Hiram Johnson, set out to replace this prevailing laissez-faire regime with one ostensibly designed to democratize and purify the parties by rescuing them from the stranglehold of wealthy special interests.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Assembly Interim Committee on Elections and Reapportionment, </em>Report on Political Party Organization 7, <em>reprinted in </em>1 Appendix to Journal of the Assembly (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">Spurred on by the Progressive reformers, the state legislature took the first\u2014 and most fundamental \u2014 step toward democratizing political parties by enacting a direct primary law, which transferred the power to nominate candidates from party organizations to the voters themselves. <em>See Hart v. Jordan, </em>168 Cal. 321, 143 P. 537 (1914); <em>Katz v. Fitzgerald, </em>152 Cal. 433, 93 P. 112 (1907); <em>see also California Politics, supra </em>at 35. As part of the same reform movement <em>(see </em>Opinion, Legislative Counsel of California, February 23, 1978, Excerpt of Record 465), the California legislature required political parties to form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>state and county central committees and adopted rules for party governance.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">The Elections Code provisions regulating party governance are byzantine in their complexity<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and vary in extent and detail from party to party. <em>See, e.g., </em>Cal.Elec. Code \u00a7\u00a7 8500 \u2014 8945 (Democratic Party), 9000 \u2014 9510 (Republican Party), 9600 \u2014 9745 (American Independent Party), 9750 \u2014 9855 (Peace and Freedom Party). To take the Democratic party as an illustration, the Code establishes party central committees at the county, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 8820, and state-wide levels, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 8660; it dictates the size, membership, and apportionment of these committees, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 8660 \u2014 8672 (state committee), 8820 \u2014 8834 (county committees); it mandates the place and time of committee meetings, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 8710 \u2014 8711, 8920 \u2014 8922; it enjoins the state central committee to observe standard parliamentary procedure, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 8778; and it provides for the election of a state chair and vice-chair and requires that they be selected alternately from the northern and southern sections of the state. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 8774.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Most importantly, the Elections Code assigns to each party\u2019s state central committee the \u201cstatutory function of party leadership\u201d by placing it \u201cat the very helm of the party\u2019s general election campaign.\u201d 23 Ops Cal. Atty. Gen. 119, 123 (1954); <em>see </em>Cal.Elec.Code \u00a7\u00a7 8776, 8940.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Similarly, the Code provides that the county committees \u201cshall have charge of the party campaign under general direction of the state central committee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 8940 (Democratic Party), 9440 (Republican Party), 9740 (American Independent Party), 9850 (Peace and Freedom Party). Hence, at least in theory, the central committees constitute the governing bodies of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">In practice, commentators have noted that the statutory organization of the central committees is so cumbersome as to make only titular leadership realistically possible.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See California Politics, supra </em>at 190-91. For example, the Democratic state central committee is composed of over 1,000 members \u2014 more than five times the size of the State Convention. <em>Id. </em>at 191. The membership includes all Democratic officeholders from Governor to members of the Congress and the state legislature. Cal.Elec.Code \u00a7 8660(a). Each statewide officeholder,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> United States Senator and state senator, appoints three other state committee members, \u201cat least two of whom shall be of the opposite sex\u201d; and each member of Congress and the State Assembly appoints two other members, \u201cat least one of whom shall be of the opposite sex.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 8663. Defeated party nomi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>nees for these offices also serve on the committee and appoint their share of additional members. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 8661. Rounding out the membership are members elected by the county committees on a basis proportionate to registered party strength in each county, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 8660(b), 8667; five members elected by a caucus convened in each assembly district, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 8660(g) &amp; 8669; and miscellaneous others.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\">Thus, the legislative design favors elected officials over party members who do not hold elective office. The design particularly favors incumbent state legislators, who enact and amend the legislation. Members of the California State Assembly and Senate can control as many as 400 positions; in comparison, the California delegation to the United States Congress and Senate controls only 143 positions. <em>See </em>Cal.Elec.Code \u00a7 8660.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Finally, all party central committees have been prohibited from endorsing or opposing candidates in party primaries. Commentators have claimed that, like the cumbersome provisions dictating party governance, the ban on preprimary endorsements has weakened political parties, especially their ability to recruit and elect candidates who will further the party\u2019s goals.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Friedman, <em>supra </em>at 70; <em>California Politics, supra </em>at 4; <em>see also </em>23 Ops. Cal. Atty. Gen. 119, 122 (1954). Plaintiffs\u2019 uncontroverted affidavits show that by excluding the committees from the process of choosing party nominees, \u201ca basic function of a political party [in our system],\u201d <em>Kusper v. Pontikes, </em>414 U.S. 51, 58, 94 S.Ct. 303, 308, 38 L.Ed.2d 260 (1973), the state has effectively drained party central committees of political power. Although the legislature has charged the committees with the responsibility of running the general election campaigns of party nominees, in reality nominees run their own campaigns through ad hoc campaign committees. Supplemental Declaration of Austin Ranney; <em>see also California Politics, supra </em>at 199-200. Indeed, the California Attorney General has opined that the ban on preprimary endorsements reflects the Progressives\u2019 \u201cintent to minimize the role of the established party agencies.\u201d 23 Ops. Cal.Atty.Gen. at 122. Overall, it has been observed that California\u2019s regulation of political parties has pushed them \u201cout of much of their original domain.\u201d Friedman, <em>supra </em>at 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">At the outset, we consider various threshold issues raised by the Secretary in her motion to dismiss below and renewed on appeal. The Secretary presents four reasons for reversing the district court without reaching the merits: (1) plaintiffs\u2019 complaint fails to raise a justiciable controversy; (2) plaintiffs lack standing to bring the action; (3) the action is barred by the Eleventh Amendment; and (4) the district court should have abstained under the <em>Pullman </em>doctrine from adjudicating the first and third causes of action. We find none of these arguments persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">Article III limits the exercise of federal judicial power to actual cases and controversies. <em>NAACP v. City of Richmond, </em>743 F.2d 1346,1350 (9th Cir.1984). A plaintiff who challenges a statute must demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>strate \u201ca realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the statute\u2019s operation or enforcement.\u201d <em>Babbitt v. United Farm Workers National Union, </em>442 U.S. 289, 298, 99 S.Ct. 2301, 2308, 60 L.Ed.2d 895 (1979); <em>see also O\u2019Shea v. Littleton, </em>414 U.S. 488, 494, 94 S.Ct. 669, 675, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974). But \u201c[o]ne does not have to await the consummation of the threatened injury [to seek relief]. If the injury is certainly impending that is enough.\u201d <em>Babbitt, </em>442 U.S. at 298, 99 S.Ct. at 2308 (quoting <em>Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, </em>262 U.S. 553, 593, 43 S.Ct. 658, 663, 67 L.Ed. 1117 (1923)). When a plaintiff seeks to engage in conduct proscribed by statute and a credible threat of prosecution exists, he need not \u201cexpose himself to actual arrest and prosecution to be entitled to challenge [the] statute____\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Steffel v. Thompson, </em>415 U.S. 452, 459, 94 S.Ct. 1209, 1215, 39 L.Ed.2d 505 (1974)); <em>see also Doe v. Bolton, </em>410 U.S. 179, 188, 93 S.Ct. 739, 745, 35 L.Ed.2d 201 (1973). This is especially true in a First Amendment case because of \u201cthe sensitive nature of constitutionally protected expression.\u201d <em>Dombrowski v. Pfister, </em>380 U.S. 479, 486, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 1121, 14 L.Ed.2d 22 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Relying on <em>Poe v. Ullman, </em>367 U.S. 497, 81 S.Ct. 1752, 6 L.Ed.2d 989 (1961), the Secretary claims that the action is not justiciable because the Elections Code provisions that plaintiffs challenge have never been enforced. In <em>Poe, </em>the Supreme Court held that a constitutional challenge to a Connecticut ban on contraceptives was not justiciable because the ban had never been enforced during its seventy-five year history, <em>id. </em>at 501, 81 S.Ct. at 1754, even though \u201ccontraceptives [were] commonly and notoriously sold in Connecticut drug stores.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502, 81 S.Ct. at 1755. This case, however, is distinguishable from <em>Poe </em>in that here we have no record that the relevant provisions have been \u201ccommonly and notoriously\u201d violated. Indeed plaintiffs\u2019 uncontroverted affidavits show that they have consistently, if reluctantly, obeyed the statutes in conducting party affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">Rather than <em>Poe, </em>we believe resolution of the justiciability issue is controlled by <em>Babbitt, </em>442 U.S. at 302-03, 94 S.Ct. at 2310-11, and <em>Epperson v. Arkansas, </em>393 U.S. 97, 101-02, 89 S.Ct. 266, 268-69, 21 L.Ed.2d 228 (1968). In both cases, the Court found justiciability notwithstanding a record of non-enforcement because, as distinguished from <em>Poe, </em>the record did not show that the statutes had been \u201ccommonly and notoriously\u201d violated.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">The Secretary further contends that, under <em>Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, </em>465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984), federal courts lack the authority to determine that a violation of a challenged state statute is a criminal offense unless the statute has already been enforced through a criminal prosecution.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> She asserts that because federal courts cannot \u201cinstruct^ ] state officials on how to conform their conduct to state law,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 106, 104 S.Ct. at 911, they are necessarily disabled from finding that a state statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>requires criminal prosecution. We cannot accept this reading of <em>Pennhurst. </em>There the Supreme Court merely held that federal courts had no jurisdiction over an action to compel state officials to adhere to state law. <em>Pennhurst </em>does not undermine either explicitly or implicitly the settled rule that when a plaintiff is \u201cone against whom the[ ] criminal statutes directly operate ... a sufficiently direct threat of personal detriment\u201d is alleged. <em>Bolton, </em>410 U.S. at 188, 93 S.Ct. at 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Closely related to the case or controversy requirement is the requirement that plaintiffs have standing to bring the action. <em>See Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, </em>426 U.S. 26, 38, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 1924, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976). The Secretary argues that plaintiffs lack standing because they would not obtain effective relief from a judicial declaration that the statutes were unconstitutional. The premise of the Secretary\u2019s standing argument is that the party central committees have voluntarily adopted the statutory restrictions on preprimary endorsements and internal governance. Under these circumstances, she concludes, plaintiffs have no standing to seek an adjudication of the constitutionality of the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">We reject the Secretary\u2019s standing argument. She has made no showing that the political parties have voluntarily adopted the statutory restrictions. Indeed, the uncontroverted affidavits of party representatives indicate the contrary: they would reform the composition of their parties\u2019 central committees if the statutes were invalidated. Moreover, all committee plaintiffs say they would make preprimary endorsements if the practice were not prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">The Secretary\u2019s argument rests on the premise that legislative action can be equated with voluntary action by political parties. She asserts that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZd\">when the nominees of a party who are actually elected to the Legislature enact legislation affecting the organization and procedures of the party institutions the legislation is an act of self-governance by the party itself. Appellants presented evidence in the district court to support their motion for summary judgment and to oppose appellee\u2019s (sic) motion demonstrating that by custom and practice the political parties represented in the legislature accept each other\u2019s party legislation. Obviously, the legislators, who are inherently their party, are also exercising the legislative power of the state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6p\">Appellants\u2019 Supplemental Brief Pursuant to Court Order Dated August 5, 1985, p. 3 [hereinafter, \u201cAppellants\u2019 Supplemental Brief\u201d].</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">The Secretary\u2019s astonishing argument collapses on its own terms. State legislators are not \u201cinherently their party.\u201d Nor do legislative enactments that bind the parties and carry criminal penalties represent the parties\u2019 own voluntary action. The exercise of the coercive power of the state is the antithesis of voluntary action by political associations. Regardless of the motives of individual legislators or the quid pro quo arrangements that led to passage of the challenged statutes, the result remains the same: state regulation of political parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">We hold that plaintiffs have standing to bring this action. To hold otherwise would be to allow the state legislature to endow the committees with \u201cthe statutory function of party leadership,\u201d 23 Ops. Cal. Atty. Gen. 119, 123 (1954), and place this leadership in the effective control of state legislators, <em>see California Politics </em>at 191, without fear that their exercise of legislative power will be reviewed under the First Amendment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">The Secretary next argues that plaintiffs\u2019 action is barred by the Eleventh Amendment. It is settled law, however, that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar an action seeking prospective relief from enforcement of an unconstitutional statute. <em>Ex parte Young, </em>209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908). Because plaintiffs do not seek damages, but only declaratory and injunctive relief, <em>Ex parte Young </em>is directly controlling. <em>See also Edelman v. Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 664, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1356, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Finally, relying on <em>Railroad Commission of Texas v. Pullman Co., </em>312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941), the Secretary contends that the district court should have abstained from adjudicating plaintiffs\u2019 first and third counts pending the resolution of litigation in state court raising similar challenges to the Elections Code. In <em>Pullman, </em>the Supreme Court held that abstention may be appropriate \u201cwhen difficult and unsettled questions of state law must be resolved before a substantial federal constitutional question can be decided.\u201d <em>Hawaii Homing Authority v. Midkiff </em>467 U.S. 229, 236, 104 S.Ct. 2321, 2327, 81 L.Ed.2d 186 (1984). <em>Pullman </em>abstention is inappropriate, however, \u201cwhen a state statute is not \u2018fairly subject to an interpretation which will render unnecessary\u2019 adjudication of the federal constitutional question.\u201d <em>Id </em>(citation omitted); <em>see also Canton v. Spokane School District No. 81, </em>498 F.2d 840, 845 (9th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">Here, the Secretary does not advance an interpretation of the Elections Code that would moot the constitutional questions raised by plaintiffs. Nor could she. Section 11702 is clear on its face that central committees may not make preprimary endorsements, and other provisions prescribe in minute detail committee membership and limit the terms of committee chairs. Thus the district court\u2019s refusal to invoke <em>Pullman </em>abstention was not an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>See C Y Development Co. v. City of Redlands, </em>703 F.2d 375, 377 (9th Cir. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b894-12\">Before considering plaintiffs\u2019 claims that the Elections Code unjustifiably burdens their First Amendment rights, we address the Secretary\u2019s contention that the state and county central committees of California\u2019s ballot-qualified political parties have no First Amendment rights because they are public entities, not private associations. The Secretary asserts that the legislature transformed the committees from voluntary political associations into public entities \u201cintegral [to] the state\u2019s election system,\u201d Appellants\u2019 Supplemental Brief, p. 15, when it dictated the committees\u2019 organization and powers and charged them with the responsibility of conducting the general election campaigns of party nominees. <em>Id., </em>p. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-13\">In essence, the Secretary argues that by regulating the committees, the legislature may deprive them of First Amendment rights. The Secretary\u2019s argument is flawed by \u201cbootstrap reasoning.\u201d <em>Abrams v. Reno, </em>452 F.Supp. 1166, 1170 (S.D.Fla. 1978) (\u201c[without begging the question of the right of a political executive committee to exist and function without the breath of life provided by the election code, it seems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>to be bootstrap reasoning to suggest that election code regulation permits the denial of substantial constitutional rights\u201d), <em>affd, </em>649 F.2d 342 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 1016, 102 S.Ct. 1710, 72 L.Ed.2d 133 (1982). Even if the California Elections Code had expressly characterized the committees as public agencies,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> we would reject the Secretary\u2019s premise that a state can strip a voluntary political association of First Amendment rights by legislating it into an arm of the state. In <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. Public Service Commission, </em>447 U.S. 530,100 S.Ct. 2326, 65 L.Ed.2d 319 (1980), for instance, the Supreme Court held that extensive regulation, however beneficial to the public, cannot deprive a utility of its status as a private entity entitled to constitutional rights. <em>Id. </em>at 533-34 &amp; n. 1, 100 S.Ct. at 2330-31 &amp; n. 1. Likewise, in <em>First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, </em>435 U.S. 765, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978), the Court repudiated the notion that the status of corporations as \u201ccreatures of the state\u201d permits the state to prohibit corporate speech. <em>Id. </em>at 778 n. 14, 98 S.Ct. at 1416 n. 14. It follows <em>a fortiori </em>that the state cannot abridge the First Amendment rights of political associations by arguing that regulatory legislation makes them \u201ccreatures of the state.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ajz\">We recognize that California has extensively regulated political parties. The Secretary, however, turns constitutional analysis upside down when she argues that the. state regulations are immune from constitutional attack because they deprive the party committees of First Amendment status. The question is not whether the committees lack First Amendment rights because of state regulation. Rather, the question is whether the challenged regulations must fall because they violate the committees\u2019 First Amendment rights. Turning to this question, we address the constitutionality of the provisions that regulate the structure and internal affairs of the party committees in Part III. In Part IV, we consider the constitutionality of the ban on preprimary endorsements.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Our analysis of plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims begins with the fundamental premise that \u201ca significant impairment of First Amendment rights must survive exacting scrutiny.\u201d <em>Elrod v. Burns, </em>427 U.S. 347, 362, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 2684, 49 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>547 (1976) (plurality); <em>see also Citizens Against Rent Control v. City of Berkeley, </em>454 U.S. 290, 294, 102 S.Ct. 434, 436, 70 L.Ed.2d 492 (1981). If, as plaintiffs allege, the state regulations interfere with their rights to free association and free expression, the regulations can survive First Amendment scrutiny only if the Secretary shows that they are \u201cnecessary to serve a compelling interest.\u201d <em>Illinois State Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party, </em>440 U.S. 173, 184, 99 S.Ct. 983, 990, 59 L.Ed.2d 230 (1979); <em>see also Kusper v. Pontikes, </em>414 U.S. 51, 58-59, 94 S.Ct. 303, 308-09, 38 L.Ed.2d 260 (1973) (\u201ceven when pursuing a legitimate interest, a State may not choose means that unnecessarily restrict constitutionally protected liberty\u201d).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">We first consider whether the state\u2019s regulation of the selection of state committee members and the term of office of committee chairs burdens plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment rights. We then consider whether the regulations serve compelling state interests. <em>See Anderson v. Celebrezze, </em>460 U.S. 780, 789, 103 S.Ct. 1564, 1570, 75 L.Ed.2d 547 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">\u201c[T]he right of individuals to associate for the advancement of political beliefs\u201d is fundamental, <em>Williams v. Rhodes, </em>393 U.S. 23, 30, 89 S.Ct. 5, 10, 21 L.Ed.2d 24 (1968), and includes the \u201cfreedom to identify the people who constitute the association, and to limit the association to those people only.\u201d <em>Wisconsin ex rel. La Follette, </em>450 U.S. at 122,101 S.Ct. at 1019. Because the right of association would be hollow without a corollary right of self-governance, \u201cthere must be a right not only to form political associations but to organize and direct them in the way that will make them most effective.\u201d <em>Ripon Society Inc. v. National Republican Party, </em>525 F.2d 567, 585 (D.C.Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 933, 96 S.Ct. 1147, 47 L.Ed.2d 341 (1976). Thus the party\u2019s freedom of association necessarily includes the right \u201cto choose its own structure, select its own standard bearers, and formulate its own platform\u2014 all free from the intrusion of state regulation.\u201d <em>Republican Party v. Tashjian, </em>770 F.2d 265, 281 (2d Cir.1985); <em>see also Ripon Society Inc., </em>525 F.2d at 585 (\u201ca party\u2019s choice, as among various ways of governing itself, of the one which seems best calculated to strengthen the party and advance its interests, deserves the <em>protection </em>of the Constitution____\u201d) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-11\">It is readily apparent that the regulations burden the parties\u2019 right to govern themselves as they think best. By legislative fiat, the state vests party leadership in the central committees, determines the size of the committees, and apportions their membership according to a statutory formula. Whether this formula is or is not \u201cbest calculated to strengthen the party and advance its interests,\u201d <em>Ripon Society Inc., </em>525 F.2d at 585, is irrelevant to First Amendment analysis. It is the right of the party, not the state, to decide how the party shall be governed. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b897-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>In stacking the deck heavily in favor of elected officials and party nominees, the legislature has dictated to each ballot-qualified party an organizational structure that may not be the party\u2019s choice. For example, a party trying to adapt to changing conditions may have interests that differ from the interests of entrenched incumbents. Commentators have noted that the pro-incumbent composition and unwieldy size of California\u2019s state central committees have made them \u201cfairly rigid organization[s] incapable of adjusting and responding to changing conditions.\u201d <em>California Politics, supra </em>at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">The experience of the Libertarian party exemplifies the plight of a political party forced to operate under state-mandated rules of governance. When the Libertarian party qualified for the ballot, it was forced to jettison its \u201cpreferred and natural\u201d party organization and replace it with one already mandated for one of the existing qualified parties.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Declaration of Mary Gingell. After adopting the rules of the Peace and Freedom Party as the least objectionable interim model, the Libertarians drafted a body of rules specifically tailored to their party\u2019s distinctive needs. When presented to the legislature, the proposed rules languished and died in committee. <em>See id. </em>Thus, the Libertarian party has been compelled by the state to organize itself in a way considered inimical to its political interests. <em>Cf. Tashjian, </em>770 F.2d at 283 &amp; n. 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Moreover, we believe that the challenged regulations directly interfere with the parties\u2019 free expression by inevitably coloring the message that the parties communicate to the electorate. <em>See Tashjian, </em>770 F.2d at 282 (\u201cin light of the intimate relationship between the structure of a political association and the message ultimately transmitted by that group, ... the inexorable effect of [regulating the structure of political parties] is to alter the Party\u2019s message\u201d). By favoring incumbents, the California legislature may give ballot-qualified parties a pro-incumbent image that impedes their associational goals.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> For instance, a party\u2019s efforts to change political course may be frustrated by the incumbent bias inherent in its organizational structure. We do not intend to say that elected officials and party nominees are incapable of providing strong and effective leadership. What we do intend to say is that when the state restricts a party\u2019s freedom to choose its leadership, the state burdens the party\u2019s First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">The parties\u2019 associational right to choose their own leadership is also burdened by the single-term limit on committee chairs. In limiting committee chairpersons to one two-year term \u2014 regardless of their popularity and effectiveness \u2014 the legislature has impaired the parties\u2019 ability to commit their fortunes to experienced and successful leadership. As Judge Patel recognized below, parties are \u201cgravely weakened if the members are not permitted to make use of an able leader for a long enough period of time to ensure effective administration.\u201d <em>San Francisco County Central Committee v. Eu, </em>No. C-83-5599 at 20 (Order filed May 3, 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">Having established that the challenged regulations burden plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment rights, we turn to \u201cthe precise inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>ests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>460 U.S. at 789, 103 S.Ct. at 1570.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">The Secretary claims that the state has a compelling interest in sheltering the state central committees from the internecine strife of the primary elections so that the committees will be in a strong position to carry out their statutory responsibility of running the general election campaigns of party nominees. This interest in avoiding factionalism, the argument goes, justifies state interference with the associational rights of political parties and their adherents. The Secretary argues that vesting control of the state committees in elected officials and party nominees assures that the committees will be broadly representative and resistant to factionalism.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">The Secretary also cites the state\u2019s professed interest in restraining factions as justification for limiting the terms of party chairs. She argues that when the term limitation is combined with the statutory requirement that chairs rotate between northern and southern California, friction between these distinct regional interests is minimized.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">In sum, the Secretary maintains that the Election Code provisions regulating the membership of state central committees and limiting the terms of committee chairs serve the state\u2019s assertedly compelling interest in avoiding \u201csplintered parties and unrestrained factionalism.\u201d <em>Storer v. Brown, </em>415 U.S. 724, 736, 94 S.Ct. 1274, 1282, 39 L.Ed.2d 714 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">Even if the Secretary could demonstrate that the state\u2019s regulation of ballot-qualified parties served its asserted interest in minimizing party faction, we disagree that promoting harmony in political parties is a compelling state interest. We recognize that the state\u2019s responsibility to hold elections and certify the results gives rise to a legitimate state interest in regulating elections. Without question, the state may act to protect \u201cthe integrity of the electoral process.\u201d <em>Rosario v. Rockefeller, </em>410 U.S. 752, 761, 93 S.Ct. 1245, 1251, 36 L.Ed.2d 1 (1973). As the Supreme Court said in <em>Storer, </em>\u201cas a practical matter, there must be a substantial regulation of elections if they are to be fair and honest and if some sort of order, rather than chaos, is to accompany the democratic processes.\u201d 415 U.S. at 730, 94 S.Ct. at 1279.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">Because of its compelling interest in orderly elections, the state may restrict access to the ballot. <em>See Bullock v. Carter, </em>405 U.S. 134, 145, 92 S.Ct. 849, 857, 31 L.Ed.2d 92 (1972) (the state \u201chas a legitimate interest in regulating the number of candidates on the ballot\u201d). Toward this end, the state may require that candidates meet minimum standards to qualify for the ballot in order to keep \u201cits ballots within manageable, understandable limits,\u201d <em>Lubin v. Panish, </em>415 U.S. 709, 715, 94 S.Ct. 1315, 1319, 39 L.Ed.2d 702 (1974), \u201cavoid voter confusion, and assure that the winner is the choice of a majority ... of those voting, without the expense and burden of runoff elections.\u201d <em>Bullock, </em>405 U.S. at 145, 92 S.Ct. at 857. For example, independent candidates may be required to present nominating petitions that demonstrate \u201ca significant modicum of [electoral] support.\u201d <em>Jenness v. Fortson, </em>403 U.S. 431, 442, 91 S.Ct. 1970, 1976, 29 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971); <em>see also American Party of Texas v. White, </em>415 U.S. 767, 782, 94 S.Ct. 1296, 1306, 39 L.Ed.2d 744 (1974). The state may also require the payment of filing-fees to weed out spurious candidacies, <em>see Bullock, </em>405 U.S. at 145, 92 S.Ct. at 857, so long as the fees are not excessive or a bar to indigent candidates. <em>Lubin v. Panish, </em>415 U.S. at 717-18, 94 S.Ct. at 1320-21. Further, the state may protect the integrity of its primary elections by imposing a waiting period before voters can switch their registered party affiliation, <em>Rosario v. Rockefeller, </em>410 U.S. 752, 93 S.Ct. 1245, 36 L.Ed.2d 1 (1973), and before candidates registered with one party can renounce their affiliation to run as independent candidates. <em>Storer v. Brown, </em>415 U.S. 724, 94 S.Ct. 1274, 39 L.Ed.2d 714 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">It is equally clear, however, that the state\u2019s interest in \u201cthe stability of its politi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>cal system\u201d, <em>Storer, </em>415 U.S. at 736, 94 S.Ct. at 1282, does not extend to regulations that effectively restrict the ballot to the major parties or that ensure that the major parties remain ballot-qualified. <em>Williams, </em>393 U.S. at 32, 89 S.Ct. at 11; <em>see also Illinois State Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party, </em>440 U.S. 173, 185-86, 99 S.Ct. 983, 990-91, 59 L.Ed.2d 230 (1979). As the Supreme Court noted in a related context, \u201ccare must be taken not to confuse the interest of partisan organizations with governmental interests.\u201d <em>Elrod, </em>427 U.S. at 362, 96 S.Ct. at 2684. Thus, although the state\u2019s interest in orderly elections allows it to impose reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions on ballot access, the state may not go to bat for political parties to assure that they remain ballot-qualified. In other words, the state has no interest in regulating political parties for the purpose of helping them win or retain voter support. Political parties are nothing more than voluntary associations of individuals who band together in pursuit of shared political goals. A party\u2019s survival depends upon its ability to compete in the free marketplace of political ideas and ideals. The First Amendment limits the state to a neutral role in that competitive process. The state may not interfere with the associational rights of political parties beyond what is necessary to assure honest and orderly elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">The Secretary relies upon <em>Storer v. Brown </em>as support for her argument that the state may prescribe the composition of state central committees and limit the terms of party chairs because of the state\u2019s asserted interest in assuring strong consensus leadership for the general election campaigns. We believe her reliance on <em>Storer </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">In <em>Storer, </em>the Court upheld a California \u201csore loser\u201d statute that required independent candidates for political office to disaffiliate from their former political party at least one year prior to the party primary. <em>Storer </em>recognizes that the state\u2019s legitimate interest in limiting access to the general election ballot entitles it to reserve that ballot for \u201cmajor struggles,\u201d free of the destabilizing effect of \u201ccontinuing intraparty feuds.\u201d <em>Storer, </em>415 U.S. at 735, 94 S.Ct. at 1281; <em>see also American Party of Texas, </em>415 U.S. at 781, 94 S.Ct. at 1306 (the state \u201cmay insist that intraparty competition be settled before the general election____\u201d). But critical to the <em>Storer </em>holding was that California\u2019s disaffiliation provision did not attempt to control intraparty feuding during the primary campaigns. To the contrary, the primary was recognized as the forum in which \u201ccontending forces within the party finally settle their differences.\u201d <em>Storer, </em>415 U.S. at 735, 94 S.Ct. at 1281; <em>see also Anderson, </em>460 U.S. at 803, 103 S.Ct. at 1577 (the <em>Storer </em>Court did not \u201csuggest that a political party could invoke the powers of the State to assure monolithic control over its own members and supporters.\u201d). <em>Storer </em>does not stand for the proposition that the state has a compelling interest in perpetuating strong ballot-qualified parties. Nor does <em>Storer </em>authorize states to regulate political parties in an effort to keep them strong and conflict-free. In sum, the state has no legitimate interest in promoting the generalized goal of \u201ccompromise and political stability.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>393 U.S. at 32, 89 S.Ct. at ll.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>When we apply these principles to the California Elections Code, it becomes evident that the state\u2019s asserted interest in fostering party leadership does not derive from the state\u2019s legitimate interest in orderly elections. Weak and divided campaign leadership may result in defeat at the polls, but it does not threaten the state\u2019s interest in an orderly election process. The Secretary\u2019s argument confuses campaigns with elections, partisan interests with the interests of the state. We conclude, therefore, that regulations designed to give ballot-qualified parties effective campaign leadership do not rest on a compelling state interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">Moreover, even if we assume that the state has a compelling interest in minimizing party faction, the Secretary has failed to carry her burden of showing \u201ca substantially relevant correlation between the governmental interest asserted,\u201d <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of California, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 903, 913, 89 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986), and the Elections Code sections regulating the selection of state committee members and the term of office of their chairs. We agree with Judge Patel that the Secretary failed to submit \u201ca shred of evidence\u201d, <em>San Francisco County Central Committee v. Eu, </em>at 22, in support of her claim that unregulated parties would be more vulnerable to \u201cthe predations of faction.\u201d Defendant-Appellants\u2019 Supplemental Brief, p. 44. In opposing plaintiffs\u2019 summary judgment motion on the merits, the Secretary relied exclusively on the affidavit of retired Democratic state senator Albert S. Rodda, Jr., a long-time member of the Democratic state central committee. As Judge Patel observed, this affidavit consists of \u201copinions ... not based on facts, but on speculations.\u201d <em>San Francisco County Central Committee v. Eu, </em>at 16. With respect to the provisions that regulate committee governance, Rodda makes the single conclusory statement that they \u201cprovide some protection against devices used by factions to exclude others from participation in party affairs.\u201d Affidavit of Albert S. Rodda, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">The Rodda affidavit fails to controvert plaintiffs\u2019 declarations concerning the impact that the challenged Elections Code provisions have on political parties. Plaintiffs' declarations demonstrate that these provisions weaken rather than strengthen the leadership of ballot-qualified parties. For example, the provisions regulating state committee membership stifle party debate by overrepresenting elected officials. Declarations of David E. Sturrock and Bert Coffey. Plaintiffs have also shown the difficulty of effecting a change in party leadership because party initiatives are left to the mercy of a slow-moving, possibly recalcitrant legislature. Declaration of Hugh Bone.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">Finally, plaintiffs\u2019 declarations show that the state\u2019s extensive regulation of party leadership discourages able people from taking an active role in party organization and hinders a party\u2019s recruitment of new leaders. Declarations of Bert Coffey and Austin Ranney. Although the Secretary claims that the challenged regulations invigorate and democratize the parties, as the Progressives ostensibly set out to do, <em>see supra </em>at .805, the record demonstrates the opposite: in fact, the parties have become weak and fossilized. Thus, we conclude that the Secretary has failed to demonstrate that the state\u2019s regulations advance its professed interest in strong party leadership.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">Finally, we consider the constitutionality of California\u2019s outright ban on partisan preprimary endorsements, Cal. Elec.Code \u00a7 11702.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Because section 11702 prohibits political speech, the inviolability of which rests at the core of the First Amendment, <em>see, e.g., Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1,14, 96 S.Ct. 612, 632, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976); <em>Monitor Patriot Co. v.

Finally, \u201cthe state action may be sustained only if the government can show that the regulation is a precisely drawn means of serving\u201d its interests. <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. Public Service Commission, </em>447 U.S. 530, 540, 100 S.Ct. 2326, 2334, 65 L.Ed.2d 319 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">The Secretary argues that the ban on preprimary endorsements serves three state interests that she claims to be compelling: (1) avoiding party factionalism; (2) protecting voters from the undue influence of party leaders; and (3) minimizing voter confusion. We will address each interest in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">The Secretary asserts that the ban on preprimary endorsements serves the state\u2019s interest in averting internal party dissension and factionalism. As we discussed above, the state\u2019s interest in regulating political parties derives from its role in conducting the primary and general elections and certifying election results. We held that the state has no interest in assuring that ballot-qualified parties remain strong and vigorous. We now hold similarly that the state\u2019s asserted interest in preserving party cohesion during primary election campaigns is not a compelling interest that could justify a prohibition on preprimary endorsements. Moreover, even if preserving party cohesion during primary campaigns were a compelling state interest, the Secretary has made no showing that banning preprimary endorsements sufficiently serves that interest to justify an outright prohibition on political speech.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">The Secretary again cites <em>Storer v. Brown, </em>415 U.S. 724, 94 S.Ct. 1274, 39 L.Ed.2d 714 (1974), for the proposition that the state has a compelling interest in preventing party committees from disintegrating into hostile factions during primaries, thereby disabling them from running the general election campaigns of party nominees. According to the Secretary, section 11702 advances this interest by disembroiling the committees from the primary contest. Thus, the argument goes, opportunistic primary candidates have no reason to seize control of the party leadership. Likewise, the leadership\u2019s enforced neutrality among primary rivals encourages the preservation of party resources for the eventual party nominee.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">The Secretary\u2019s reliance on <em>Storer </em>is misplaced. <em>Storer </em>recognized that the state\u2019s interest in limiting access to the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>election ballot entitles it to prevent \u201csore losers\u201d from running again as independent candidates. 415 U.S. at 734, 94 S.Ct. at 1281. Moreover, <em>Storer </em>viewed the primary as set apart for healthy intraparty confrontation, even bloodletting. <em>Id. </em>at 735, 94 S.Ct. at 1281. It offers no support for the Secretary\u2019s claim that the state has a compelling interest in fostering party cohesiveness during primaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Even if we assume that the state has such an interest, the Secretary made no showing that the ban on preprimary endorsements preserves party cohesion. Again, the only affidavit she submitted was the declaration of former state senator Rodda, and this affidavit consists of unsupported conjecture.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 uncontroverted affidavits, on the other hand, bear out the following: First, section 11702 has eroded the parties\u2019 ability to identify, recruit, and promote \u201cstrong opposition candidates.\u201d Declaration of David E. Sturrock. In the void caused by silencing the committees\u2019 power of endorsement, each candidate forms an ad hoc committee to run his primary campaign and, if he is successful, that committee goes on to run the general election campaign independently of the party organization. The result of banning preprimary endorsements, according to the affidavit of Williams College political scientist James MacGregor Burns, is that party control degenerates into a \u201cpersonalistic system that caters to irresponsible political campaigning and public service.\u201d Thus, as Burns concludes, \u201ctaking away the endorsement power strikes at the very core of the party.\u201d <em>See also </em>Declaration of Eugene Lee (\u201c[a] political party unable to endorse candidates is, by definition, a weak party\u201d); <em>California Politics, supra </em>at 5 (\u201c[Cjalifornia campaigns are highly personalized extravaganzas\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Second, plaintiffs showed that in states that permit partisan primary endorsements, the practice is generally used in a selective, circumspect fashion so as not to endanger party unity. Several affiants experienced in the politics of other states testified that when no candidate has been the clear favorite of the party leadership, the leadership has either refrained from issuing controversial endorsements or endorsed several candidates in the same race. <em>See, e.g., </em>Declarations of Eugene Lee and James MacGregor Burns. Moreover, the ability to issue endorsements has helped party leadership distinguish candidates genuinely allied with the party from candidates who are essentially masquerading as party adherents. In California, conversely, the ban on preprimary endorsements has on occasion allowed hostile candidates to win the party nomination. For instance, in a much-publicized episode discussed in plaintiffs\u2019 affidavits, a grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan campaigned for and won the 1980 Democratic party nomination for Congress in the San Diego area while the Democratic county central committee remained powerless to oppose him. Declaration of Edmond Constantini.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">In sum, the Secretary has failed to show that section 11702 serves party cohesion. Thus, even if we considered party cohesion to be a compelling state interest, we would conclude that the Secretary has failed to show that the interest is furthered by banning preprimary endorsements.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">The Secretary further claims that the ban on preprimary endorsements is justified by the state\u2019s interest in safeguarding the right of party adherents to choose primary candidates without undue influence from the party leadership. The Secretary thus attempts to justify the restraint on committee speech by arguing that the ban promotes the First Amendment rights of party rank and file. We must reject the argument that one person\u2019s First Amendment rights may be restricted in order to enhance the rights of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">It is by now settled First Amendment law that the state may not \u201crestrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others.\u201d <em>Buckley, </em>424 U.S. at 48-49, 96 S.Ct. at 648-49, <em>quoted in Bellotti, </em>435 U.S. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>790-91, 98 S.Ct. at 1423-24; <em>see also Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, </em>418 U.S. 241, 94 S.Ct. 2831, 41 L.Ed.2d 730 (1974). In <em>Bellotti, </em>the state argued that curbing corporate speech in referenda elections furthered \u201cthe State\u2019s interest in sustaining the active role of the individual citizen in the electoral process.\u201d <em>Bellotti, </em>435 U.S. at 787, 98 S.Ct. at 1422. The Supreme Court rejected this argument on the ground that the First Amendment does not tolerate discriminatory silencing measures designed to equalize political debate. Thus, <em>Bellotti </em>forecloses the Secretary\u2019s argument that the ban on preprimary endorsements is constitutionally acceptable because in the state\u2019s judgment it yields an outcome favorable to free speech. <em>See also Pacific Gas &amp; Electric v. Public Utilities Commission of California, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 903, 89 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">With the exception of cases upholding laws carefully tailored to proscribe fraud and corruption, <em>see, e.g., Buckley, </em>424 U.S. at 26-27, 96 S.Ct. at 638-39, the Secretary cites no authority for the proposition that the state can regulate the flow of information between political associations and their members. Prohibiting the governing body of a political party from supporting some candidates and opposing others patently infringes both the right of the party to express itself freely and the right of party members to an unrestricted flow of political information. <em>See Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, </em>106 S.Ct. at 907 (\u201cThe First Amendment protects the public\u2019s interest in receiving information\u201d); <em>cf. Brown v.

We cannot accept the Secretary\u2019s claim that denying voters access to the views of party leadership somehow enhances their First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">In any case, we would reject \u201cthe \u2018highly paternalistic approach\u2019 of statutes like [section 11702] which restrict what the people may hear.\u201d <em>Bellotti, </em>435 U.S. at 791 n. 31, 98 S.Ct. at 1424 n. 31 (quoting <em>Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., </em>425 U.S. 748, 770, 96 S.Ct. 1817, 48 L.Ed.2d 346 (1976)). As <em>Bellotti </em>teaches, \u201cthe people in our democracy are entrusted with the responsibility for ... evaluating the relative merits of conflicting arguments [and] the source and credibility of the advocate.\u201d 435 U.S. at 791-92, 98 S.Ct. at 1423-24; <em>cf. Police Department v. Masley, </em>408 U.S. 92, 95, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 2289, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972) (\u201cgovernment has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content\u201d). Plaintiffs\u2019 affidavits confirm what is implicit in the First Amendment: when the people are exposed to a public debate that is \u201cuninhibited, robust, and wide-open,\u201d <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 270, 84 S.Ct. 710, 721, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964), they are fully capable of thinking for themselves. Party endorsements are unrestricted in all other states, <em>see supra </em>at n. 26; and plaintiffs\u2019 affidavits show that the electorate of these states typically considers the party\u2019s imprimatur as simply one relevant datum in the pool of information on rival candidates for the party nomination. Declarations of Donald Fraser, Malcolm Jewell, and Bert Coffey. Thus, the Secretary\u2019s fear that party members will blindly rubber-stamp the party\u2019s endorsement is speculation not borne out by either experience or common sense. California\u2019s ban on preprimary endorsements is a form of paternalism that is inconsistent with the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">Finally, the Secretary attempts to justify the ban on preprimary endorsements on the ground that it minimizes voter confusion.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>She asserts that voters might be confused if they are not sheltered from the views of party leadership. The Secretary\u2019s apparent concern is that voters will be discouraged from participating in the primary election because they will view the party-endorsed candidate as the party\u2019s foreordained choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Again, we think that the Secretary has given voters too little credit. She has made no showing in support of her charge that voters will be confused by party endorsements. To the contrary, plaintiffs have made a showing that voters understand that endorsements are intended to counsel, not pre-empt their votes, and that the primary victor alone constitutes the general election candidate of the party. Analyzed properly, the asserted state interest in avoiding voter confusion collapses into a professed interest in ensuring that voters do not cast their primary ballots in unthinking obedience to party directives. On this score, we agree with the Second Circuit that \u201ca state certainly does not have a compelling interest in shielding from confusion those voters who engage in unthinking and Pavlovian reliance on party labels.\u201d <em>Tashjian, </em>770 F.2d at 284. Moreover, to the extent that the risk of confusion arises because the central committees carry the official imprimatur of the state, state legislation \u2014 not the inherent coerciveness of party endorsements \u2014 is the root of the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">California\u2019s asserted interests are insufficient to justify its ban on preprimary endorsements. Accordingly, we hold that section 11702 violates the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">The judgment of the district court invalidating the provisions of the California Elections Code that regulate the selection of state central committee members, limit the term of office of committee chairs, and prohibit state and county central committees from endorsing, supporting, or opposing candidates in party primary elections is</p>\n<p id=\"Aho\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b887-14\">.

Each of these Progressive-era innovations has curbed the ability of the party organization to shape the party\u2019s political agenda and support sympathetic candidates. <em>See California Politics </em>at 4 &amp; 294-95; <em>cf. </em>Ranney, <em>Curing the Mischief of Faction, supra </em>at 17-19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b892-6\">.

While the state\u2019s characterization of state political parties does not bind this court\u2019s determination of plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment status, we note that the Secretary\u2019s characterization of the committees as public entities is belied by the refusal of both the California Supreme Court and the California Attorney General so to characterize them. <em>See Unger II, </em>37 Cal.3d at 615, 692 P.2d 238 (committees \"are not agencies of the state for all purposes\u201d); 59 Ops.

Moreover, the contention that the committees are state agencies is somewhat incongruous because unlike the sovereign, party central committees are expected to serve party interests, not the interests of the public at large; specifically, they are charged by statute with the responsibility of running the general election campaigns of party nominees. <em>See, e.g., </em>Cal.

Likewise, the Secretary's use of <em>Marchioro v. Chaney, </em>442 U.S. 191, 99 S.Ct. 2243, 60 L.Ed.2d 816 (1979), to support the challenged governance provisions outstrips the limited rationale of that case. In <em>Marchioro, </em>the State of Washington attempted to require that the state central committee be composed in a representative fashion. The authorizing statute empowered the central committee to perform certain limited duties, such as calling party conventions and filling vacancies on the party ticket. In addition, the charter of the Democratic Party delegated to the committee considerable responsibility in raising funds, recruiting candidates, and setting general policy. The plaintiffs, would-be committee members who were elected pursuant to a charter amendment that sought to supplement the membership stipulated by state law, sued to enjoin their exclusion based on the statute on the ground that a party policymaking body enjoyed a First Amendment exemption from state regulation. The Supreme Court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 claim without resolving the constitutionality of the Washington regulations. The Court noted that the party freely delegated the committee powers upon which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>plaintiffs predicated their challenge; and plaintiffs did not oppose the committee\u2019s performance of its state-imposed duties. <em>Id. </em>at 197-98, 99 S.Ct. at 2247-48. Thus, the Court held that the source of the plaintiffs\u2019 grievance was the party\u2019s exercise of its right of self-governance, not state interferences with that right. <em>Id. </em>at 199, 99 S.Ct. at 2248.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b900-11\">.
