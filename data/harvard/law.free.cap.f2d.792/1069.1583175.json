Strickland, </em>567 F.Supp. 146 (M.D.Fla. 1983), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>760 F.2d 1107 (11th Cir.1985), <em>vacated, </em>760 F.2d 1116 (11th Cir.1985). The proceedings that brought the issue before this Court are set forth fully in those opinions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold that the district court\u2019s injunction was overbroad, but that the district court has authority to impose serious restrictions on Procup\u2019s bringing matters before the court without an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-8\">Procup, who is serving a life sentence for murder in the first degree, has engaged in ridiculously extensive litigation in the District Court for the Middle District of Florida, fully set out in the district court\u2019s opinion. 567 F.Supp. at 148-51. As of June 1983, Procup had filed 176 cases in the Jacksonville Division of the Middle District of Florida alone, not counting suits filed in other federal and state courts. Most of Procup\u2019s suits have been <em>pro se, in forma pauperis </em>civil rights actions under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983. None has reached the stage of trial on the merits; most have been frivolous. Procup often has filed repeated claims and failed to comply with court rules and procedures. His pleadings are long and rambling. He has ignored repeated warnings and admonitions from the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-13\">There is no question that Procup\u2019s activities call for some curtailment. The district court injunction against his filing any complaint with the court without the aid of an attorney is an attempt to reduce the number of frivolous lawsuits without foreclosing truly meritorious claims. The injunction was based on the premise that if Procup had an arguably meritorious claim, he would be able to obtain an attorney to handle it for him. The district court noted that because \u201cvirtually every action\u201d filed by Procup had been brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983, the, provision for an attorney\u2019s fees award in 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1988 would provide \u201cample incentive for members of the increasingly large private bar to handle a claim which appears to be meritorious.\u201d 567 F.Supp. at 160. The district court also noted the availability of legal assistance to indigent inmates from Florida Institutional Legal Services, Inc. From these, the district court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>[T]he attorney\u2019s duties under Rule 11, Fed.R.Civ.P. and the Code of Ethics \u2014 to file suit only where there are good grounds to support the pleading \u2014 will serve as an invaluable preliminary screening mechanism which will shield the Court from Procup\u2019s well-documented proclivity to barrage the Court with frivolous and ill-conceived lawsuits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-5\">... Additionally, the Court will be ensured that'claims brought before it on behalf of Procup have been conscientiously scrutinized before being filed. This has obviously not occurred in the past.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1151-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 161 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-7\">In this Court\u2019s judgment, however, the requirement that Procup file suits only through an attorney may well foreclose him from filing any suits at all. A private attorney, knowing Procup\u2019s track record, might well be unwilling to devote the time and effort necessary to sift through Procup\u2019s generally frivolous claims to see if there is one of sufficient merit to undertake legal representation. A legitimate claim could well go undiscovered. Moreover, due to Procup\u2019s shotgun litigation techniques, attorneys in the legal services office already have found themselves as defendants in Procup\u2019s rambling pleadings. This not only would deter an attorney from representing such a difficult client, but also raises the possibility that, due to intra-office conflicts of interest, the legal services attorneys would be unavailable to represent Procup. With the premise that Procup would simply be unable to get any attorney to represent him, the injunction then effectively enjoins Procup from filing any suit. The district court neither intended this result nor indicated in any way that such an absolute injunction would be appropriate. An absolute bar against a prisoner filing any suit in federal court would be patently unconstitutional. We, therefore, vacate the injunction and remand for consideration of such modification as will, as much as possible, achieve the desired purposes without encroaching on Procup\u2019s constitutional right to court access.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-8\">This does not mean that the district court was incorrect in employing injunctive relief. The district court was fully justified and within its authority in entering injunctive restrictions against Procup. Such action is necessary and prudent to protect the rights of all litigants in the federal system.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-9\">Recent years have witnessed an explosion of prisoner litigation in the federal courts. From 218 civil rights petitions of prisoners to federal courts in 1966, there were 18,034 such suits in 1984. Annual Report of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts for the Twelve Month Period Ended June 30, 1984, at 142-43. According to a 1979 study, 80% to 95% of prisoner filings are brought <em>in forma pauperis. </em>Turner, <em>When Prisoners Sue: A Study of Prisoner Section 1983 Suits in the Federal Courts, </em>92 Harv.L.Rev. 610, 617 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-10\">The prisoner litigant may possess several distinct advantages over the ordinary litigant: time to draft multiple and prolonged pleadings; ability to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and thus escape any financial obstacles confronting the usual litigant; and availability of free materials which the state must provide the prisoner, including paper and postage. As a result, there is virtually no cost to a prisoner\u2019s filing repeated, frivolous lawsuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-11\">In order to more adequately handle this upsurge of cases, the federal courts have adopted various administrative procedures designed to streamline the process. Some of these procedures are found in the <em>in forma pauperis </em>statute itself, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915. Others have been adopted from recommendations contained in the so-called Aldisert Report. <em>See </em>Federal Judicial Center, <em>Recommended Procedures for Handling Prisoner Civil Rights Cases in the Federal Courts </em>(1980). Many courts have developed sophisticated procedures involving the court, staff attorneys, magistrates, law clerks, and judges to try to sort out from the mass of frivolous suits, the meritorious ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-12\">Occasionally a particularly abusive prisoner, taking advantage of his unique sit\u00faa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number>tion, will come along with a flood of claims designed to either harass those in positions of authority or to grind the wheels of the judicial system to a halt. No matter how efficient a court\u2019s administrative procedures may be, when one litigant files upwards of a lawsuit a day, the claims of other litigants necessarily suffer. Every lawsuit filed, no matter how frivolous or repetitious, requires the investment of court time, whether the complaint is reviewed initially by a law clerk, a staff attorney, a magistrate, or the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">In devising methods to attain the objective of curtailing the activity of such a prisoner, however, courts must carefully observe the fine line between legitimate restraints and an impermissible restriction on a prisoner\u2019s constitutional right of access to the courts. Various courts have employed and approved a variety of injunctive devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-5\">As to prisoners who bring frequent or repetitious claims, courts have:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1152-6\">\u2014enjoined prisoner litigants from relitigating specific, claims or claims arising from the same set of factual circumstances;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Act\">\u2014required litigants to accompany all future pleadings with affidavits certifying that the claims being raised are novel, subject to contempt for false swearing;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1152-14\">\u2014directed the litigant to attach to future complaints a list of all cases previously filed 'involving the same, similar, or related cause of action, and to send an extra copy of each pleading filed to the law clerk of the chief judge of the district;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014directed the litigant to seek leave of court before filing pleadings in any new or pending lawsuit; <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1152-15\">\u2014permitted abusive prisoner litigants to file <em>in forma pauperis </em>only claims alleging actual or threatened physical harm; and requiring payment of a filing fee to bring other claims;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>\u2014limited the number of filings by a particular inmate; and<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ6\">\u2014entered injunctions prohibiting the abusive prisoner from acting as a writ writer or jailhouse lawyer for other inmates.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ajl\">We do not here intend to indicate how this Court would treat any of the above injunctions in a particular case, but cite them as examples of how other courts have handled the problem. Other restrictions which might be considered by a court attempting to deal with the problems created by a litigant such as Procup include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1153-5\">\u2014limitation of the number of pages to a complaint and other pleadings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1153-6\">\u2014requiring a plaintiff to file an affidavit setting forth what attempts he has made to obtain an attorney to represent him;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1153-7\">\u2014limitation of further pleadings without order of court, after the complaint has been filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1153-8\">This list is intended to be neither exhaustive nor limiting. As new ideas develop and old devices prove ineffective, the judiciary must respond with imaginative new techniques designed to protect the court access of all litigants. <em>See Taylor v. Gibson, </em>529 F.2d 709, 717 (5th Cir.1976). We make no suggestion as to the combination of restrictions that might be appropriate and do not pass on the constitutionality of any such limitation for a given case. Neither do we suggest the precise form of an injunction. Some procedures, for instance, are directed to the officers of the court rather than the litigants themselves.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1153-17\">There should be little doubt that the district court has the jurisdiction to protect itself against the abuses that litigants like Procup visit upon it. Federal courts have both the inherent power and the constitutional obligation to protect their jurisdiction from conduct which impairs their ability to carry out Article III functions. <em>In re Martin-Trigona, </em>737 F.2d 1254, 1261-62 (2d Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 807, 88 L.Ed.2d 782 (1986).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The fact that Procup\u2019s complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>in this case may have failed to state a justiciable federal claim is of no impact on the court\u2019s power to enter injunctive relief against such a recalcitrant litigant. The court has a responsibility to prevent single litigants from unnecessarily encroaching on the judicial machinery needed by others. Were a frivolous lawsuit a bar to the court\u2019s inherent jurisdiction, the court would be powerless to act upon even a flood of frivolous lawsuits which threatened to bring judicial business to a standstill.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-4\">We do not here design the kind of injuction that would be appropriate in this case. Considerable discretion necessarily is reposed in the district court. Procup can be severely restricted as to what he may file and how he must behave in his applications for judicial relief. He just cannot be completely foreclosed from <em>any </em>access to the court. The injunction is vacated and the case is remanded for the district court to consider an appropriate substitute order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-5\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1150-11\">. Contrary to Judge Tjoflat\u2019s dissent, the Court construes the district court order as an injunction, effective unless vacated or modified, appealable under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). Although not named in the injunction, Procup, a party to the suit in which it has been entered, is clearly affected thereby and might possibly be reached by contempt if he sought to file pleadings in violation thereof. <em>Cf. </em>43A C.J.S. <em>Injunctions </em>\u00a7 296 (1978); <em>Waffenschmidt v. MacKay, </em>763 F.2d 711 (5th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 794, 88 L.Ed.2d 771 (1986); <em>United States v. Hall, </em>472 F.2d 261 (5th Cir. 1972). Procup, therefore, has standing to seek review of that injunction. <em>In re Oliver, </em>682 F.2d 443, 445 (3d Cir.1982) (entertaining an appeal from an almost identical order pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1292). Injunctions are construed broadly to carry out the intent of the court, which in this case clearly was to prevent Procup from filing further complaints without an attorney. The district court stated in its first sentence that it had entered an \"Order to Show Cause, permitting plaintiff thirty days in which to demonstrate why the Court should not enter an injunction prohibiting him from filing any further pleadings in the courts of this district.\u201d 567 F.Supp. at 146-47.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1152-7\">. <em>Harrelson v.

By listing these limitations, the majority impliedly authorizes their use so long as they are not applied in a manner to deny access to the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-8\">I construe the underlined portion of the following limitation as an unconstitutional denial of access and the right to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915(d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1154-9\">permittpng] abusive prisoner litigants to file <em>in forma pauperis </em>only claims alleging actual or threatened physical harm; <em>and requiring payment of a filing fee to bring other claims;</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1154-13\">In every other respect I agree with the majority opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1154-14\">TJOFLAT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A5_\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-15\">The majority\u2019s opinion recites a compelling tale of the problems abusive litigants, including Procup, can pose for the federal courts. An even more compelling version can be found in the district court\u2019s opinion. In its eagerness to sanction a means to curb these abuses, however, the majority neglects the time-honored principle that a court of appeals is constrained to decide only appealable decisions of the district court. The majority\u2019s opinion fails to discuss how this case arose, what actions were taken in the district court, and how the case came to this court on appeal. In fact, the majority\u2019s opinion scarcely acknowledges that the order in question arose in the context of an actual lawsuit. A proper consideration of the procedural history of this case in the district court makes it apparent that this court lacks jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-16\">Procup, a Florida prisoner serving a life sentence, initiated this litigation by filing a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982) action against various prison officials, complaining of his treatment in prison. Attached to the complaint was an affidavit asserting that Procup lacked sufficient funds to prepay the fees associated with commencing an action in the district court. The affidavit was sufficient on its face as to economic eligibility to allow Procup to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a) (1982), and the complaint was accordingly placed on the docket. <em>See Watson v. Ault, </em>525 F.2d 886, 891 (5th Cir.1976).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>The district court, noting the volume and nature of Procup\u2019s previous litigation, issued an order to show cause why an injunction should not issue prohibiting Procup from filing any further pleadings in the district court. The Florida attorney general\u2019s office was sent a copy of the show cause order and given the opportunity to present its position to the court. Following the receipt of responses from both parties, the district court issued an opinion finding that Procup had engaged in extensive and abusive litigation in an attempt to disrupt the functioning of the federal courts and that sanctions were warranted. The district court concluded that the sanction necessary to curb Procup\u2019s abuses was an order \u201cenjoining\u201d the clerk of the court from filing any additional cases, or pleadings in those additional cases, submitted by Procup unless such additional cases or pleadings were submitted on behalf of Procup by an attorney.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court rejected Procup\u2019s motions to reconsider its order and his attempts to have the \u201cinjunction\u201d dissolved and granted Procup leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1155-5\">The district court has made no finding that <em>this </em>case brought by Procup is frivolous or malicious. As far as the record indicates, Procup\u2019s section 1983 suit is still pending before the district court. The court\u2019s order to the clerk pertains to \u201cadditional cases or pleadings therein\u201d and apparently does not preclude Procup from litigating his current action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In fact, contrary to any finding of frivolousness, Procup has, in effect, obtained leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a) (1982), and the district court has not undertaken to dismiss the case as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d) (1982). <em>See supra </em>note 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-13\">It is therefore beyond dispute that the district court has not rendered a final decision appealable pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1982). The district court\u2019s order is interlocutory in nature and could only be appealed if it constituted an order granting an injunction within 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) (1982).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is therefore necessary to look beyond what the district court\u2019s order was called and carefully consider its true nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-14\">The first thing to note, which is apparent on the face of the order, is that the court did not enjoin <em>Procup's </em>activities in any way. The order was directed to the clerk of the court, \u201cenjoining\u201d the clerk from filing non-complying pleadings. A careful reading of the court\u2019s order discloses that it does not attempt to constrain Procup\u2019s conduct in any fashion. In fact, the order contemplates that Procup probably will file <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>additional cases or pleadings without a licensed attorney\u2019s participation. Because the district court expected such a situation to arise, it directed the clerk of the court to refuse to accept such filings. Contrary to the suggestion in the majority opinion, <em>ante </em>p. 1070, n. 1, Procup would not be in contempt of the court\u2019s order if he filed additional pleadings not signed by an attorney because the court\u2019s order does not prohibit such filings; it merely instructs the clerk of the court to refuse them.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nor can it be said that, although not directed at Procup, the order had the effect of preventing him from litigating this case. The district court did not issue the order to enable it to adjudicate the case before it. On the contrary, the order was inapplicable to pending cases. It is also clear that the court did not grant injunctive relief against Procup at the behest of beleaguered litigants harassed by Procup\u2019s litigation tactics. In sum, the district court\u2019s order was not tantamount to the granting of an injunction in this case<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and is not appealable as an interlocutory order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-4\">Although the order in question bears some resemblance to a sanction imposed pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 11, it could not be characterized as such. Rule 11, which grants the district courts wide latitude to sanction a litigant or attorney who submits a baseless pleading, motion, or paper, could not be invoked in a case such as this where there has been no finding that the complaint in question failed to comply with the rule\u2019s requirements. In this case\u2019s current posture, we must assume that Procup\u2019s pleading satisfies the standard imposed by Rule 11 and is not abusive.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1156-11\">The district court\u2019s order, despite being entitled a permanent injunction, is in effect an administrative order, directed to the clerk of the court, governing the way the court will handle its business in the future as to one particular litigant. Although entered in the context of this case, the order bears no relation to it. There is no right to take an appeal from such an order where it has no effect on the current case. As pointed out previously, the district court has not prevented Procup from litigating <em>this </em>case to a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-12\">A situation precisely on point arose in <em>Pavilonis v. King, </em>626 F.2d 1075 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 829, 101 S.Ct. 96, 66 L.Ed.2d 34 (1980). Pavilonis brought two civil rights suits against various officials connected with the Boston schools. The district court issued an order enjoining Pavilonis from filing new lawsuits without leave of court and directed the clerk to refuse to accept non-complying papers. No action was taken with regard to the pending complaints. The district court refused to vacate its order and Pavilonis appealed. The First Circuit Court of Appeals dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>missed the appeal because final judgments had not been entered in the lawsuits. <em>Pavilonis v. King, </em>626 F.2d at 1077 n. 4. Sometime thereafter, the district court dismissed Pavilonis\u2019 complaints and an appeal ensued. At that point, with final judgments rendered, the court of appeals was able to review the district court\u2019s dismissal of the suits and the appropriateness of the sanction it imposed. Our circuit, employing established legal principles, should reach the same result reached by the First Circuit. Procup\u2019s appeal should be dismissed, and appellate review must await final disposition by the district court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1157-4\">Accordingly, I must respectfully dissent from the court's judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1154-11\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), this court adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981. In <em>Watson, </em>the court discussed the procedure to be followed under the <em>in forma pauperis </em>statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 (1982). If an affidavit filed with a complaint demonstrates economic eligibility, the requirements of section 1915(a) are satisfied and the district court must docket the case. The court may then proceed to the inquiry dictated by section 1915(d) and dismiss the case if the allegation of poverty is untrue or if the action is frivolous or malicious.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1155-6\">. The full text of the order is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-7\">PERMANENT INJUNCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-8\">In accordance with the Opinion entered herein on this date, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-9\">ADJUDGED that the Clerk of Court for the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida is hereby permanently enjoined from filing any additional cases or pleadings therein submitted by or on behalf of Robert Procup, unless such additional cases or pleadings therein are submitted on behalf of Procup by a duly licensed attorney admitted to practice before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-10\">DONE AND ORDERED at Jacksonville, Florida, this 17 day of June, 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1155-11\">. Although this point was at one time disputed by the parties, both parties now appear to concede that the order does not apply to pending cases. The language of the order is consistent with this conclusion. <em>Cf. Procup </em>v. <em>Strickland, </em>760 F.2d 1107, 1110 n. 3 (11th Cir.1985) (panel inclined to construe order as inapplicable to pending cases).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1155-15\">. The court\u2019s order does not have the attributes of the limited class of collateral orders appeal-able under the doctrine of <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949), where immediate review of separate and independent matters is necessary to secure important interests. To the extent the district court\u2019s order is currently preventing Procup from filing any new lawsuit that he has the right to pursue, there is an available mechanism whereby Procup can contest the validity of the district court\u2019s order. If and when the clerk of the district court, pursuant to the order in question, refuses to file a future case or pleading. Procup could seek a writ of mandamus from the district court ordering the clerk to accept and file such papers. If the district court refuses to issue the writ and Procup appeals, the validity of the district court\u2019s order would be squarely before this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1156-5\">. <em>Waffenschmidt v.

Hall, </em>472 F.2d 261 (5th Cir.1972), are not to the contrary. In those cases, the district court\u2019s injunctive order had been violated and the issue was whether a nonparty who violated an injunction or aided and abetted in its violation could be held in contempt. In both cases, a clear violation of the injunctive order had occurred. In contrast, should Procup, without a licensed attorney, tender a new pleading to the clerk for filing, Procup would have done nothing prohibited by the court\u2019s order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1156-8\">. The majority\u2019s opinion points out, <em>ante </em>p. 1070, n. 1, that the district court\u2019s show cause order asked Procup to demonstrate why the court should not enjoin <em>his </em>conduct. After hearing from the parties and giving the matter its consideration, the court decided against issuing an injunction addressed to Procup, instead entering an order directed to the clerk of the court. It is of no moment that the court may have, at one time, considered enjoining Procup, for it failed to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1156-14\">. If the district court had found the present complaint frivolous, noted a history of abusive litigation, imposed a Rule 11 sanction, and dismissed the complaint, we would have an appeal-able order. The dismissal of the complaint would, of course, be subject to appellate review. In addition, we could review the sanction imposed and determine if the district court was within its authority to impose such a sanction and whether the imposition of the sanction was an appropriate exercise of the court\u2019s discretion. Even in that situation, the <em>application </em>of the sanction in some future case might raise problems that could only be appropriately reviewed when that actual controversy arose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1157-8\">. Were I to reach the merits of this case, I would agree that the district court\u2019s order must be vacated. As an initial matter, the district court proceeded quite irregularly by issuing such an order without first assessing the complaint in this case. Second, the order\u2019s application to even the most meritorious future filing presents obvious problems. Finally, the order violates the long-established principle that a court exercising its equitable powers or its inherent powers should do so in a measured fashion, narrowly tailoring the relief to accomplish its intended goal, and proceeding to more drastic means only if necessary. Having concluded that this order must be vacated, the majority opinion goes further and, in dicta, engages in substantial speculation as to what type of sanctions might be agreeable. The inclusion of a laundry list of possible sanctions that may or may not present constitutional or other problems in particular situations is both ill-advised and wholly unnecessary to the resolution of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-6\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1157-5\">FAY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AHgi\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-6\">While agreeing with most of what is stated in the majority opinion, I respectfully dissent from the vacating of the injunctive order issued by the district court.

If, in the future, the clerk of the Middle District of Florida, pursuant to that court\u2019s injunction, should refuse to file another Procup <em>pro se </em>petition, Procup then could challenge the injunction by petitioning for a writ of mandamus pursuant to Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 21(a).

There can be no question that Robert Procup has abused the federal judicial system by filing scores of frivolous claims. Majority Opinion <em>ante, </em>at 1070. Nor can there be any suggestion that Procup is alone in his discovery of this <em>modus operandi </em>or that it does not pose serious problems for the courts. <em>See, e.g., Harrelson v.

But in our haste to respond to the \u201cexplosion of prisoner litigation in the federal courts,\u201d Majority Opinion <em>ante, </em>at 1071, we must keep paramount in our minds a concern for \u201cthe fine line between legitimate restraints and an impermissible restriction on a prisoner\u2019s constitutional right of access to the courts.\u201d <em>Id. ante, </em>at 1072. In responding to this sensitive problem courts must be especially careful to craft remedies \u201cnarrowly drawn to fit the specific vice encountered.\u201d <em>Castro, </em>775 F.2d at 410; <em>Abdullah, 773 </em>F.2d at 488; <em>Wood v.

I write in dissent to emphasize that the Court\u2019s opinion is based upon and approves illegal restrictions on prisoner access to the courts. It sanctions access restrictions that standing alone might or might not be unobjectionable but which \u201ctaken together [are] so burdensome as to deny the litigant meaningful access to the courts.\u201d <em>Green, </em>669 F.2d at 786; <em>Abdullah, 773 </em>F.2d at 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-6\">First, the majority endorses limiting abusive prisoner litigants to filing \u201conly <em>[in forma </em>pauperis] claims alleging actual or threatened physical harm; and requiring payment of a filing fee to bring other claims,\u201d Majority Opinion <em>ante, </em>at 1072, and limiting \u201cthe number of filings by a particular inmate\u201d in a given time period to a given number, <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1158-7\">The common thread that has guided all courts of appeals in reviewing restrictions on court access has been the firm conviction that the relevant statute places upon the <em>courts </em>the ultimate responsibility for determining which claims are frivolous and which are not. <em>See, e.g., Johnson v. Kemp, </em>781 F.2d 1570 (11th Cir.1986) <em>(per curiam); Phillips v. Mashburn, </em>746 F.2d 782 (11th Cir.1984) <em>(per curiam); Urban v.

When Congress wrote 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915(a) (1985), providing for <em>in forma pauperis </em>suits and vesting in the trial courts limited latitude to dismiss such cases if \u201cfrivolous or malicious,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 1915(d), it penned a prescription for individualized, case-by-case determination of the merit or frivolity of <em>each filing. Green, </em>669 F.2d at 786; <em>Carter, 733 </em>F.2d at 737. On appeal we will not normally prescribe the particular <em>method </em>by which a trial court will undertake this determination, but we are nonetheless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>bound to compel the trial court to exercise <em>some </em>particularized review. <em>Steffler v.

Evans, </em>709 F.2d 1428, 1429 (11th Cir.1983) <em>(per curiam). </em>My quarrel with the majority is with the assumption that, under the rubric of \u201cdiscretion,\u201d we can permit trial courts to issue a blanket ruling that certain types or more than a certain number of filings are, <em>ipso facto, </em>frivolous. \u201cDiscretion\u201d connotes more than a mere arithmetic counting of filings as determinative of the likely merits of any subsequent claim. \u201cInstead, one must analyze the nature of plaintiffs litigation in light of the scope of the Section 1915 privilege and additionally pinpoint specific abuses to which appropriate responsive remedies can be tied.\u201d <em>Carter v. Telectron, Inc., </em>452 F.Supp. 944, 990 (S.D.Tex.1977). The trial court may not, we have clearly held, \u201cact arbitrarily and it may not deny the application on erroneous grounds.\u201d <em>Pace, </em>709 F.2d at 1429; <em>Johnson, </em>781 F.2d at 1572 (reversing trial court for setting restrictions on frivolous prisoner filings \u201con the basis of litigation history without regard to the particular circumstances thereof and their relevance to the [restriction imposed].\u201d); <em>Flowers v. Turbine Support Division, </em>507 F.2d 1242, 1244 (5th Cir.1975). I have difficulty conjuring a more obvious recipe for arbitrary or erroneous decision-making than the issuance of a <em>per se </em>limit on the filing of claims of abuse either to an arbitrarily selected number (say six, as the majority suggests) or unless the abuse is physical in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-9\">The majority\u2019s approach will erect a complete bar preventing some prisoners from presenting valid, actionable claims of constitutional magnitude<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> simply because the delict is something other than physical abuse or follows on the heels of a randomly selected \u201cmagic number\u201d of previous filings that year. To that extent, the majority\u2019s approach violates the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Franklin v. Murphy, </em>745 F.2d 1221, 1232, (9th Cir.1984); <em>Green, </em>669 F.2d at 786. The effect of the majority\u2019s limitation is to rewrite the statutory provisions Congress provided. The majority also sanctions the trial court\u2019s abdication of its obligation to determine if it should take the awesome step of interdicting the access of a citizen to the courts of justice. It creates an irrebuttable presumption that, at least for some, no claim of non-physical abuse is worthy of even cursory consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-10\">Second, I find troubling the majority\u2019s willingness to restrict <em>in forma pauperis </em>actions to those alleging claims of physical harm while permitting other such actions to go forward only upon \u201cpayment of a filing fee.\u201d Majority Opinion <em>ante, </em>at 1072. Proceeding <em>in forma pauperis </em>is a privilege and not a right. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915(d). Nevertheless, when a prisoner presents a meritorious allegation of constitutional deprivation in the form of an <em>in forma pauperis </em>civil action, and he has no other reasonable avenue to secure relief, he simply may not be required to pay a filing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>fee. <em>Boddie v. Connecticut, </em>401 U.S. 371, 380-82, 91 S.Ct. 780, 787-88, 28 L.Ed.2d 113 (1971);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Davis v. Page, </em>618 F.2d 374, 383 n. 9 (5th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Davis v. Gladstone, </em>464 U.S. 1052, 104 S.Ct. 735, 79 L.Ed.2d 194 (1984). I see no principled basis for pretermitting <em>Bod-die\u2019s </em>holding merely because the valid claim comes to the court amid a sea of frivolous suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">I object to the fee requirement for a second reason: it has the effect of erecting a hierarchy of value preferences within the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Henceforth, the Court determines, for a discrete class of litigants non-physical abuse is either a due process violation of a lesser order or, more accurately, no longer an actionable deprivation at all. I had always thought that the Constitution protected citizens against due process and equal protection violations be they in the form of physical or emotional abuse, derogation of civil rights, denial of legal process, or any other of the congeries of rights subsumed under the banner of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-5\">Third, the majority suggests that trial courts may require \u201ca plaintiff to file an affidavit setting forth what attempts he has made to obtain an attorney to represent him.\u201d Majority Opinion <em>ante, </em>at 1073. The purpose of this restriction is puzzling. The Court evidently assumes that the tide of frivolous suits may be stemmed by requiring a prisoner to secure counsel, in the expectation that doing so will introduce an element of restraint. Presumably this restraint results from fear of sanctions available under Fed.R.Civ.P. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-10\">The Court\u2019s reliance on this restriction is misplaced for two reasons. To the extent that the majority uses Rule 11 sanctions as a means to minimize frivolous filings there is little advantage to be gained by the requirement of counsel. Rule 11 sanctions are equally available for use against lawyers and <em>pro se </em>litigants. But more importantly, the clear implication of the Court\u2019s requirement is that <em>if </em>a prisoner can obtain counsel he <em>must </em>obtain counsel. This is squarely at odds with the right to self-representation protected by the Sixth Amendment, <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 832-34, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 2539-41, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975), and by statute, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1654 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-11\">Fourth, the majority proposes that trial courts may elect to impose \u201climitation of further pleadings without order of court, after the complaint has been filed.\u201d Majority Opinion <em>ante, </em>at 1073. My objection here is two-fold. By placing limitations on subsequent \u201cpleadings,\u201d rather than on subsequent \u201ccauses of action,\u201d the majority permits a prisoner to start an action but makes it extraordinarily difficult for him to resolve it expeditiously. Each time an <em>in forma pauperis </em>prisoner seeks to file a reply brief, to tender a motion for summary judgment or to respond to one, to compel discovery \u2014 in short to engage in the usual motion practice \u2014 he must wait upon the trial court for a specific grant of leave to file. If our objective is to minimize the diversion of court resources to frivolous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>cases, this seems an odd way to effect that goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-4\">If the majority\u2019s opinion is interpreted to limit a prisoner\u2019s filing of subsequent causes of action, this argument fails for the reasons I advanced in considering the Court\u2019s proposed limitation on filings to a given number or type of injury. The simple fact that one delict has already occurred is in no way indicative of the likely merits of subsequent claims. Such a limitation, I believe, impermissibly deprives the prisoner of \u201cadequate, effective, and meaningful\u201d access to the courts. <em>Bounds, </em>430 U.S. at 822, 97 S.Ct. at 1495; <em>Mitchum v. Purvis, </em>650 F.2d at 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-5\">Finally, I take exception to the majority\u2019s opinion in a fifth respect. The Court suggests that one means of curbing frivolous litigation is by entering injunctions against so-called \u201cjailhouse lawyers\u201d who help prisoners generate dozens of meritless complaints. The Supreme Court has determined that prisoners have, at least in limited circumstances, a protected interest in access to an inmate writ writer. <em>Johnson v. Avery, </em>393 U.S. 483, 490, 89 S.Ct. 747, 751, 21 L.Ed.2d 718 (1969). It is clear that states retain power to impose certain limitations on the activities of such persons, or even to forbid them from plying their craft. <em>Id. </em>But we are not properly called upon today to consider or decide the scope of that power. Procup is his own publicist. He relies on his own wits to generate his pleadings. Accordingly, that portion of the majority\u2019s holding is <em>obiter dictum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1161-6\">The majority\u2019s opinion represents a response to what it perceives as a serious threat to the integrity of the adjudicatory process. We must always be careful as judges not to sound the alarm too hastily. We must be even more careful not to become swept up in our own rhetoric and on that account to attack problems with blunt, poorly chosen tools that inflict damage of a constitutional sort far worse than the blight we set out to excise. The majority today does just that. It makes available a plethora of access restrictions that are ill-advised and ill-suited to the task at hand. I am unable to join in its opinion. Therefore, with deference, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1157-15\">. Byron, <em>Don Juan, </em>canto I, st. 117 (1818).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1159-6\">. Admittedly the Supreme Court has narrowed the scope of constitutionally-based claims of deprivation that prisoners may bring, <em>see e.g., Parrott v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981), <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984), <em>Daniels v. Williams, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986). But there is nothing in any of the Court\u2019s recent statements to suggest that valid claims of deprivation need not be heard simply because a prisoner has in the past abused the judicial process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1159-11\">. The majority acknowledges at its footnote 6 that a complete ban on all <em>in forma pauperis </em>filings by a litigant is impermissible. But it apparently holds that by leaving the courthouse door slightly ajar \u2014 so that a limited number of claims, or claims of a particular type, can slip inside \u2014 it has made adequate provision for the constitutional right of court access. Clearly the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments require more.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1160-6\">. Indeed, the Court in <em>Boddie </em>neatly anticipated and rejected the majority\u2019s rationale for using fees to weed out frivolous claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1160-7\">The arguments for [imposing fees and costs in bringing a civil action for divorce] are that the State\u2019s interest in the prevention of frivolous litigation is substantial, its use of court fees and process costs to allocate scarce resources is rational, and its balance between the defendant\u2019s right to notice and the plaintiffs right to access is reasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1160-8\">In our opinion, none of these considerations is sufficient to override the interest of these plaintiff-appellants in having access to the only avenue open for [securing the relief sought]. Not only is there no necessary connection between a litigant\u2019s assets and the seriousness of his motives in bringing suit, but it is here beyond present dispute that appellants bring these actions in good faith. Moreover, other alternatives exist to fees and costs requirements as a means for conserving the time of courts and protecting parties from frivolous litigation____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1160-13\"><em>Boddie, </em>401 U.S. at 381-82, 91 S.Ct. at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-14\">Of course, the majority can find no refuge in the <em>bona fide </em>nature of the claims in <em>Boddie, </em>for it here declines to provide prisoners with the opportunity to demonstrate that their claims are in good faith brought. Rather, the majority simply assumes that they are not.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
