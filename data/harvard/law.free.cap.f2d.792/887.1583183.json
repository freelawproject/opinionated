(Asarco) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The central question on appeal is whether a governmentally authorized cleanup program is a prerequisite to a private action under section 107(a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a). Wickland also appeals from a judgment in favor of the State Lands Commission of California (the Commission) on Wickland\u2019s claim for declaratory relief. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We reverse the dismissal of Wickland\u2019s claims against Asarco and remand the case, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>we dismiss Wickland\u2019s appeal against the Commission for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">Wickland\u2019s complaint advises us that from approximately 1886 through 1970, Asarco conducted smelting operations for the extraction of lead, zinc, and other metals on two contiguous parcels of land in Selby, California (the Selby site). Asarco owned one of the parcels. It occupied the other parcel under license until 1951, when the State of California became owner of the parcel; thereafter, Asarco leased the parcel from the Commission, which acted as custodian for the State of California. Wickland alleges that in the course of Asarco\u2019s smelting operations, Asarco deposited up to one million metric tons of smelter slag above the surface of the Selby site, and deposited an unascertained amount of slag below the surface. The slag remains on the Selby site.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">Wickland purchased the parcel owned by Asarco in 1977. Wickland alleges that in April 1980 it learned for the first time that the slag abandoned by Asarco on the Selby site might contain hazardous concentrations of various metals. In July 1980, the California Department of Health Services (the Health Department) informed Wick-land that the slag constituted a potentially serious environmental hazard and ordered Wickland \u201cnot [to] excavate, remove or recover the slag waste without written approval\u201d from the Health Department. In October 1980, the Health Department notified Wickland that a Health Department study indicated that the Selby site contained hazardous waste; it further advised Wickland that Wickland was responsible for cleanup measures on the Selby site. Working with the Health Department and other state agencies, Wickland then developed and conducted testing on the Selby site of the groundwater concentrations of heavy metals and of the migration of slag particles.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">In July 1981, Wickland leased the second parcel from the Commission. In the summer and fall of 1981, Wickland assembled a task force consisting of personnel from Wickland, the Health Department, and other state and federal bodies to conduct tests to evaluate the hazard posed by the slag. In December 1981, the Health Department and other state agencies mandated additional testing of the slag as a precondition to further commercial redevelopment of the Selby site by Wickland. By early 1982, Wickland had expended approximately $150,000 on slag testing required by state agencies. In January 1983, the Selby site ranked 21st on the Health Department\u2019s Priority Ranking of Hazardous Waste Sites. <em>See generally </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9605(8)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">Wickland brought suit in district court against Asarco and the Commission under CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9601-9657. Wick-land brought three federal claims against Asarco: it sought damages under section 107(a) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a), for testing costs incurred; it requested a declaration that, as between Wickland and Asarco, Asarco was solely and entirely liable under CERCLA for any release of hazardous substances on the Selby site; and it asked for an order requiring Asarco to initiate cleanup of the Selby site. Wickland also sought a declaration that the Commission was liable under CERCLA for any release of hazardous substances on the Selby site.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-11\">On Asarco\u2019s motion, the district court dismissed Wickland\u2019s three claims against Asarco for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>Wickland Oil Terminals v. Asarco, Inc., </em>590 F.Supp. 72 (N.D.Ca.1984) <em>(Wickland). </em>Wickland then voluntarily dismissed its claim against the Commission. The district court entered final judgments in favor of both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b969-13\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of Wickland\u2019s three claims against Asarco for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>Guillory v. County of Orange, </em>731 F.2d 1379, 1381 (9th Cir.1984). We must accept all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>material allegations in the complaint as true and construe them in the light most favorable to Wickland. <em>North Star International v. Arizona Corporation Commission, </em>720 F.2d 578, 580 (9th Cir.1983). We cannot uphold the dismissal unless it appears to a certainty that Wickland would be entitled to no relief under any state of facts that could be proved. <em>Halet v. Wend Investment Co., </em>672 F.2d 1305, 1309 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">Wickland pleaded a claim for damages against Asarco pursuant to section 107(a)(2)(B) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a)(2)(B), for approximately $150,000 in costs incurred in testing the Selby site for hazardous substances. The district court ruled that \u201can authorized governmental cleanup program, initiated by the EPA or by state authorities pursuant to a cooperative agreement, must commence before a private party can state a claim for damages under CERCLA.\u201d <em>Wickland, </em>590 F.Supp. at 77. Determining that Wickland had not alleged satisfaction of this prerequisite, the district court dismissed the damages claim. <em>Id. </em>at 77-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">Congress enacted CERCLA in 1980 to provide a comprehensive response to the problem of hazardous substance release. CERCLA implements this plan through an array of mechanisms. Section 105 of CERCLA authorizes the President to incorporate into the national contingency plan \u201cprocedures and standards for responding to releases of hazardous substances.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9605. Section 221 establishes the Hazardous Substance Response Trust Fund, popularly known as Superfund. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9631. Superfund monies finance response measures by the federal government that are consistent with the national contingency plan. CERCLA \u00a7\u00a7 104, 111(a)(1), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9604, 9611(a)(1). They also finance private response costs that are approved under the national contingency plan and are federally certified. CERCLA \u00a7 111(a)(2), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9611(a)(2). In addition, under section 106 the federal government may seek judicial relief from the actual or threatened release of a hazardous substance. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9606. Section 107(a)(l-4)(A) makes certain parties responsible for the presence of hazardous substances liable to federal and state governments for response costs. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a)(l-4)(A). Similarly, section 107(a)(l-4)(B) makes responsible parties liable to private persons for response costs. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a)(l-4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">Section 107(a) of CERCLA is the focal point of our inquiry. This section states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-10\">Notwithstanding any other provision or rule of law, and subject only to the defenses set forth in subsection (b) of this section\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-11\">(2) any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of, ... shall be liable for\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-12\">(A) all costs of removal or remedial action incurred by the United States Government or a State not inconsistent with the national contingency plan; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-13\">(B) any other necessary costs of response incurred by any other person consistent with the national contingency plan____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b970-15\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a)(2)(A), (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-16\">Section 107(a)(2)(B) expressly creates a private cause of action for damages. <em>See Walls v. Waste Resource Corp., </em>761 F.2d 311, 318 (6th Cir.1985) <em>(Walls). </em>We must address whether the district court correctly determined that a governmentally authorized cleanup program is a precondition to maintaining this private cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-17\">Asarco makes two basic arguments in support of the district court\u2019s ruling. Its first argument rests on the phrase <em>\u201cother </em>necessary costs of response\u201d (emphasis added) in section 107(a)(2)(B). Asarco asserts that when sections 107(a)(2)(A) and 107(a)(2)(B) are read together, the word \u201cother\u201d in subsection (B) indicates that the incurrence of governmental response costs under subsection (A) is a prerequisite to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>the recovery of \u201cother\u201d response costs incurred by a private party. Asarco contends this interpretation is necessary so that the word \u201cother\u201d does not become surplus.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">We see no basis for grafting on this ordinary word the critical role suggested for it by Asarco. We conclude that Asarco\u2019s interpretation is not correct and that the word \u201cother\u201d has an alternative, more plausible purpose. The word \u201cother\u201d in section 107(a)(2)(B) reasonably functions to distinguish between government response costs in subsection (A) and private response costs in subsection (B). Our interpretation is consistent with a broader view of the statute which demonstrates that Congress in CERCLA was able to impose a clear prerequisite of government approval on private recovery when it intended to do so. <em>See </em>CERCLA \u00a7 111(a)(2), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9611(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">Second, Asarco argues that in order to incur costs \u201cconsistent with the national contingency plan,\u201d a private party must act pursuant to a governmentally authorized cleanup program. In order to address Asarco\u2019s argument, we must first discuss the national contingency plan in effect at the time Wickland allegedly incurred response costs. Pursuant to section 105 of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9605, and Executive Order No. 12,316, 46 Fed.Reg. 42,237 (1981), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued in 1982 the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (the 1982 national contingency plan), 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 300.1-.86 (1985).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> One subpart of the 1982 national contingency plan addresses hazardous substance response. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 300.61-.71 (1985). This subpart \u201cestablishes methods and criteria for determining the appropriate extent of response authorized by CERCLA when any hazardous substance is released.\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.61(a) (1985). It outlines the role that the \u201clead agency\u201d (generally the EPA or a state agency operating pursuant to a contract or cooperative agreement executed under CERCLA, 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.6 (1985)) is to play in the successive phases of response. Asarco relies on various of these references to the role of the lead agency to argue that a private party may incur response costs pursuant to the section 107(a)(2)(B) requirement that they be \u201cconsistent with the national contingency plan\u201d only if it acts pursuant to a cleanup program that has been authorized by a lead agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">Whether consistency with the 1982 national contingency plan requires that a private party obtain prior lead agency approval of a cleanup program is not easily discerned from the provisions of the 1982 national contingency plan. On one hand, several provisions delineate a prominent role for the lead agency in the formulation of responses to releases of hazardous wastes. Section 300.68(d)(1), for example, states that the \u201clead agency ... will examine available information and determine ... the type or types of remedial response that may be needed to remedy the release.\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.68(d)(1) (1985). On the other hand, these provisions possibly do not constrain private parties seeking to recover response costs incurred under section 107(a). Arguably, for example, section 107(a) does not require strict compliance with the national contingency plan; rather, response costs incurred by a private party may be \u201cconsistent with the national contingency plan\u201d so long as the response measures promote the broader purposes of the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-11\">Fortunately, we need not resolve this question in a vacuum. Since the time of the district court opinion, the EPA has on two occasions presented its interpretation of how the national contingency plan bears on this issue. We must accord very great deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its regulations. <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1,16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965) <em>(Udall); Hawaiian Electric Co. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number><em>United States EPA, </em>723 F.2d 1440, 1447 (9th Cir.1984). An agency\u2019s interpretation of its regulations is \u201c \u2018of controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation[s].\u2019 \u201d <em>Udall, </em>380 U.S. at 16-17, 85 S.Ct. at 801, <em>quoting Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., </em>325 U.S. 410, 414, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 1217, 89 L.Ed. 1700 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">In the preamble to its proposed rule revising the 1982 national contingency plan, 50 Fed.Reg. 5862-83 (1985), the EPA stated that proposed revisions would \u201cclarify\u201d what a private party seeking to recover response costs under section 107 must do in order to act in a manner consistent with the national contingency plan. 50 Fed.Reg. 5870 (1985). These revisions would clarify that \u201cthe lead agency does <em>not </em>have to evaluate and approve a response action for those costs to be recovered from a responsible party pursuant to CERCLA section 107.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). Because EPA states that these revisions would simply clarify \u2014 not alter \u2014 the requirements of the national contingency plan, we read this language in the preamble as an interpretation by the EPA that the 1982 national contingency plan does not impose on section 107(a) actions by private parties a prerequisite of lead agency approval of a cleanup program.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">The preamble to the final rule revising the 1982 national contingency plan, 50 Fed. Reg. 47,912-50 (1985), confirms our reading. In this preamble, the EPA acknowledged \u201cthe widespread confusion and conflicting judicial interpretations of the issue\u201d of what consistency with the national contingency plan requires in private actions under section 107(a). 50 Fed.Reg. 47,934 (1985). The EPA stated that the final rule \u201cmakes it absolutely clear that no Federal approval of any kind is a prerequisite to a cost recovery under section 107.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This language plainly reflects an EPA interpretation that the 1982 national contingency plan does not require lead agency approval of cleanup programs as a prerequisite to section 107(a) actions by private parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">We certainly cannot say that this EPA interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the 1982 national contingency plan. We may reasonably believe that the provisions in the 1982 national contingency plan delineating the role of the lead agency in approving cleanup programs were not intended to limit private parties suing under section 107(a) of CERCLA. This reading is buttressed by the lack of any procedure whereby a private party could seek to obtain prior governmental approval of a cleanup program. Furthermore, this reading, consistent with CERCLA\u2019s broad remedial purpose, promotes the effectiveness of private enforcement actions under section 107(a) as a remedy independent of governmental actions financed by Superfund. We therefore must conclude that the district court erred in ruling that an authorized governmental cleanup program was a prerequisite to-Wickland\u2019s claim for damages under section 107(a) of CERCLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">Asarco also suggests an alternative ground for the district court\u2019s dismissal of Wickland\u2019s damages claim. Asarco argues that Wickland\u2019s action under section 107(a) is not ripe since Wickland has alleged only investigatory costs and has not alleged incurrence of actual, on-site cleanup costs. The distinction that Asarco attempts to manufacture between investigatory costs and on-site cleanup costs is immaterial under section 107(a). Section 107(a)(2)(B) allows recovery of \u201ccosts of response,\u201d which includes the costs of \u201csuch actions as may be necessary to monitor, assess, and evaluate the release or threat of release of hazardous substances.\u201d <em>See </em>CERCLA \u00a7 101(23), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601(23); <em>see also </em>CERCLA \u00a7 101(25), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601(25). We hold that the testing expenses alleged by Wickland fall within this definition. They are therefore recoverable under section 107(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">We thus conclude that the district court erred in dismissing Wickland\u2019s damages claim against Asarco under section 107(a) of CERCLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Wickland also pleaded a claim for declaratory relief against Asarco pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201. Wickland sought a declaration that, as between Wickland and Asarco, Asarco was solely and entirely liable under CERCLA for the existence of any hazardous substances on the Selby site. The district court ruled that Wickland\u2019s claim for declaratory relief was not ripe since no governmental enforcement actions under CERCLA had yet been taken against Wick-land.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">Jurisdiction to award declaratory relief exists only in \u201ca case of actual controversy.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201. \u201cBasically, the question in each case is whether the facts alleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.\u201d <em>Maryland Casualty Co. v. Pacific Coal &amp; Oil Co., </em>312 U.S. 270, 273, 61 S.Ct. 510, 512, 85 L.Ed. 826 (1941); <em>see Western Mining Council v. Watt, </em>643 F.2d 618, 623-24 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1031, 102 S.Ct. 567, 70 L.Ed.2d 474 (1981). A case is ripe where the essential facts establishing the right to declaratory relief have already occurred. <em>See Aetna Life Insurance Co. v. Haworth, </em>300 U.S. 227, 242, 57 S.Ct. 461, 464, 81 L.Ed. 617 (1937); <em>Riehl v. Travelers Insurance Co., </em>772 F.2d 19, 22 (3d Cir.1985); 10A C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; M. Kane, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 2757, at 585 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">Here we find that Wickland\u2019s claim for declaratory relief is ripe. The essential fact establishing Wickland\u2019s right to declaratory relief \u2014 the alleged disposal of hazardous substances at the Selby site at the time Asarco owned and operated the smelting facility \u2014 has already occurred. The absence of government enforcement actions against Wickland under CERCLA does not render the controversy between Wickland and Asarco remote and hypothetical. <em>Cf. Societe de Conditionnement en Aluminium v. Hunter Engineering Co., </em>655 F.2d 938, 944 (9th Cir.1981) (actual threat of litigation not necessary for declaratory judgment action to be justiciable). Therefore, we reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-10\">Wickland also pleaded a claim for injunctive relief ordering Asarco to initiate cleanup of the Selby site in coordination with the appropriate federal and state agencies and in a manner consistent with the national contingency plan. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2202, Wickland predicated this request for relief on its claim for declaratory relief. The district court ruled that since it had dismissed Wickland\u2019s claim for declaratory relief, it also had to dismiss the claim for injunctive relief. Because we have held that the claim for declaratory relief should not have been dismissed, we reverse the dismissal of the claim for injunctive relief, and remand it for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b973-12\">Wickland sought a declaration that the Commission, as owner of a portion of the Selby site, was liable , under CERCLA for the release of hazardous substances. After Wickland voluntarily dismissed this claim, the district court granted judgment for the Commission. Wickland may not appeal this voluntary dismissal because it is not an involuntary adverse judgment against it. <em>Seidman v. City of Beverly Hills, </em>785 F.2d 1447, 1448 (9th Cir.1986) <em>(Seidman)-, see Hoover v. Switlik Parachute Co., </em>663 F.2d 964, 966 (9th Cir.1981). We therefore dismiss Wickland\u2019s appeal on this claim for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Seidman, </em>785 F.2d at 1448.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-13\">REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b971-8\">.
