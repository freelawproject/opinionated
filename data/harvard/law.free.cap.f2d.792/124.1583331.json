Bucks County Water &amp; Sewer Authority, </em>641 F.2d 1087, 1097 (3d Cir.1981).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number><em>784 F.2d at 1013 (right-hand column); slip op. at 9: </em>delete \u201cit is evident ... new policy.\u201d and replace with:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5n\">the Airport cannot reasonably be understood to have entertained the maximization of revenue or the desires of the public as purposes underlying its adoption of the new policy.</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b208-19\"> The Supreme Court cases on a court's ability to hypothesize purposes underlying a governmental policy are not altogether clear. In <em>Weinberger v. Wisenfeld, </em>420 U.S. 636, 648 n. 16, 95 S.Ct. 1225, 1233 n. 16, 43 L.Ed.2d 514 (1975), the Court stated that a court should not consider a hypothesized purpose if it is clear that \"the asserted purpose could not have been a goal of the [policy].\u201d Five years later, in <em>United States Railroad Retirement Board v. Fritz, </em>449 U.S. 166, 179, 101 S.Ct. 453, 461, 66 L.Ed.2d 368 (1980), the Court stated that it is \"constitutionally irrelevant whether [a hypothesized purpose] in fact underlay the [governmental] decision because this Court has never insisted that a legislative body articulate its reasons for enacting a statute.\u201d In <em>Fritz, </em>however, there was no claim or evidence that the hypothesized purpose was not the actual purpose. Furthermore, six weeks after deciding <em>Fritz, </em>the Court reaffirmed <em>Wisenfeld </em>in <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Clover Leaf Creamery, </em>449 U.S. 456, 463 n. 7, 101 S.Ct. 715, 723 n. 7, 66 L.Ed.2d 659 (1981), when it quoted the <em>Wisenfeld </em>language verbatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-20\">The Third Circuit appears to be the only court that has attempted to harmonize the decisions. While we have used language like that used in <em>Fritz </em>in several cases, <em>see, e.g., Bunyon v. Camacho, </em>770 F.2d 773 (9th Cir.1985); <em>Hoffman v. United States, </em>767 F.2d 1431 (9th Cir. 1985); <em>In re Lara, </em>731 F.2d 1455 (9th Cir.1984); <em>Brandwein v. California Board, </em>708 F.2d 1466 (9th Cir.1983); <em>Lamb v. Scripps College, </em>627 F.2d 1015 (9th Cir.1980), we have never had to confront the problem posed in <em>Wisenfeld </em>and in the case before us. None of our prior decisions involved a case in which the record showed that the hypothesized purpose could not have been the actual purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-21\"><em>784 F.2d at 1013 (right-hand column); slip op. at 9: </em>add \u201cor the desires of the traveling public\u201d after \u201cWe do not suggest that revenue considerations\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
