The Union subsequently commenced a lawful strike against the railroads and their parent company, Guilford Transportation Industries (\u201cGuilford\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">To enhance the bargaining position of its striking members, BMWE also sought to picket various rail carriers as secondary employers who provided direct and indirect assistance to Guilford or its subsidiaries. One such carrier was Consolidated Rail Corporation (\u201cConrail\u201d). Conrail interchanges traffic with the Delaware &amp; Hudson Railroad and the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, two Guilford subsidiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">BMWE notified Conrail of its plans by telegram. Conrail thereupon obtained a preliminary injunction from the United States District Court for the Western District of New York, enjoining the Union from commencing its picketing of Conrail. The district judge acknowledged the facial applicability of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C. 101 <em>et seq., </em>which generally deprives federal courts of jurisdiction to issue injunctive relief in labor disputes. The district court, however, believed the Union had a duty to exhaust RLA negotiation procedures with Conrail, the secondary employer, in addition to those transacted with the primary employer. Judge Telesca based his analysis on the perceived \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of the RLA \u2014 avoidance of disruption to interstate rail transport. This expedited appeal followed. After oral argument, we stayed the injunction pending the outcome of this appeal. We now vacate the order of the district court granting the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">The issue here is whether the BMWE must exhaust the virtually interminable RLA negotiation procedures with a secondary employer. We hold that the Union is under no such obligation. This supposed duty, therefore, cannot serve as a basis for an exception to the dictates of the NorrisLaGuardia Act. A contrary result would lead to the freewheeling judicial interference that the Act was meant to prevent. <em>See Chicago &amp; North Western Ry. Co. v. United Transportation, Inc., </em>402 U.S. 570, 582, 91 S.Ct. 1731, 1738, 29 L.Ed.2d 187 (1971) (RLA exception to Norris-LaGuardia Act must be narrowly drawn). Accordingly, we decline to remove from the Union\u2019s self-help arsenal a lawful and potent weapon \u2014 peaceful picketing. Unlike the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(4), the RLA does not ban secondary activity. <em>Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., </em>394 U.S. 369, 378-79, 89 S.Ct. 1109, 1115-16, 22 L.Ed.2d 344 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">We draw support for our conclusion from the specific language of the RLA, which imposes the duty to negotiate on \u201ccarriers and the employees <em>thereof.\u201d </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 152, First (emphasis added); <em>see generally </em>Note, <em>Judicial Approaches to Secondary Boycotts under the Railway Labor Act, </em>42 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 928, (1962) (\u201c[T]he language of the statute restricts the [Mediation] Board\u2019s jurisdiction to disputes between a carrier and <em>its </em>employees.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">More significantly, the general statutory scheme also supports our conclusion. The RLA mediation procedures are designed to be lengthy. To impose them upon secondary disputants would effectively deprive unions of the right to engage in secondary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>picketing, for the underlying primary dispute would often be more speedily resolved. Moreover, the RLA also provides for Presidential appointment of an emergency board to investigate a strike that threatens to disrupt substantially interstate commerce. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 160. Congress, therefore, did not envision an active judicial role in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Finally, we note that other courts have been reluctant to ignore the clear strictures of the Norris-LaGuardia Act in favor of a vague duty to negotiate not clearly expressed in the RLA. <em>See, e.g., Central Vermont Ry. v. BMWE, </em>639 F.Supp. 220 (D.D.C.1986), <em>affd, </em>793 F.2d 1298 (D.C.Cir. 1986); <em>Richmond, F. &amp; P. Ry. v. BMWE, </em>No. 86-3544 (4th Cir. May 5, 1986) (vacated injunction pending appeal); <em>Western Maryland R.R. v. System Bd. of Adjustment, </em>465 F.Supp. 963, 968 (D.Md.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Accordingly, the order of the district court is vacated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
