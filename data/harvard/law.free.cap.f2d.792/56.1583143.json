Under Louisiana law, is an indemnitor\u2019s obligation to defend a suit against the indemnitee for personal injuries sustained determined entirely by the allegations of the complaint against the indemnitee? That is, if the petition against the indemnitee alleges only the fault of the indemnitee, does the indemnitor have a duty to defend?</p>\n<p id=\"b140-23\">2. If the indemnitor does not have a duty to defend the suit, but if, after trial on the merits, the injury is found to have resulted in whole from the fault of the indemnitor and judgment is rendered against the plaintiff, is the indemnitee entitled to recover the costs of defense (assuming the indemnity agreement is interpreted to include costs of defense)?</p>\n<p id=\"b140-24\">3. Under the Louisiana Oilfield Indemnity Act of 1981, La.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 9:2780, is an indemnity agreement covered by the Act nullified only to the extent that the agreement requires the indemnitor to indemnify the indemnitee for damages attributable to the indemnitee\u2019s fault? That is, is the contract valid if it provides for indemnity to the extent of the comparative fault of the indemnitor?</p>\n<p id=\"b140-25\">The answers to these questions appear to be determinative of the issues in this case. We, therefore, propose to defer decision on them and certify them to the Louisiana Supreme Court, disclaiming any intention or desire that the Supreme Court of the State of Louisiana confine its reply to the precise form or scope of the questions certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-26\">We direct counsel for the parties to confer as soon as practical and, within 15 days, to submit to this court a proposed agreed statement of the case and an agreed phrasing of the questions to be certified.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the parties are unable to agree on either the statement of the case or the questions to be certified, the appellant will prepare a proposed statement of each, within 15 days, and, within seven days thereafter, the appellee will prepare and file its proposed objections to and suggested changes to the appellant\u2019s suggestions.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Opinion and judgment withdrawn \u2014 case to be certified to Louisiana Supreme Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b140-27\">. 784 F.2d 1320 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b140-28\">. <em>See West v.
