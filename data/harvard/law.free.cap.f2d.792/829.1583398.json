The narrow issue on appeal is whether liability for a sales tax, required by state law to be collected by sellers from their customers, is governed by the \u201ctrust fund\u201d tax or \u201cexcise\u201d tax provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-24\">The Code provisions in question are section 507(a)(6)(C), which covers a tax \u201crequired to be collected,\u201d commonly referred to as a \u201ctrust fund\u201d tax, and section 507(a)(6)(E), which covers an \u201cexcise\u201d tax.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-25\">A trust fund tax is always given a priority and is never subject to discharge in bankruptcy. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 507(a)(6)(C), 523(a)(1)(A). An excise tax, however, is given a priority and is not subject to discharge if the transaction occasioning the tax occurred less than three years prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 507(a)(6)(E), 523(a)(1)(A). Consequently, \u201cstale\u201d claims for excise taxes are not entitled to a priority and are discharge-able.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-27\">Darrel Shank (debtor) operated a retail establishment in the State of Washington. As a retailer, debtor was required by Washington law to collect sales tax on all retail sales and forward the collected funds to the Washington Department of Revenue (Department). RCW 82.08.050 (1981). Debtor failed to forward the collected funds. When the business was discontinued in 1979, debtor\u2019s total liability for sales taxes was in excess of $45,000. Debtor soon left the state. After filing for bankruptcy in 1984, debtor instituted an adversary proceeding against the Department seeking a determination that the sales tax debt to the State was dischargeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>The bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in favor of the Department. The bankruptcy court, primarily relying on <em>In re Rosenow, </em>715 F.2d 277 (7th Cir.1983), concluded that Congress intended collected sales tax to be characterized as a trust fund tax and was thus excepted from discharge under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 507(a)(6)(C) and 523(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">The district court reversed the judgment of the bankruptcy court. The district court examined the joint explanatory statement by the House and Senate floor managers of \u00a7 507 and concluded that all sales taxes owed by the sellers, including those collected by sellers and held in trust, were intended by Congress to be characterized as excise taxes and dischargeable under \u00a7 507(a)(6)(E). The Department timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">The district court\u2019s conclusions of law are reviewed <em>de novo. In re Global Western Development Corp., </em>759 F.2d 724 (9th Cir.1985). Because the material facts are uncontested, the only issue is how to construe the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">In its 1966 amendment to the Bankruptcy Act, Congress placed a time limitation on the non-dischargeability of tax debts. Most tax debts more than three years old became dischargeable. Act of July 5,1966, Pub.L. No. 89-496 \u00a7 2, 80 Stat. 270. However, a proviso added by the 1966 Amendment identified certain tax debts that remained non-dischargeable even though the tax debt was more than three years old. One such debt was a trust-fund tax. Act, \u00a7 17(a)(1)(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">Section 17(a)(1)(e) excepted from discharge taxes the debtor \u201chas collected or withheld from others.\u201d Although this language did not expressly refer to sales taxes, the legislative history strongly suggests that Congress did not intend to limit the \u00a7 17(a)(1)(e) exception to withholding taxes. <em>DeChiaro v. New York State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>760 F.2d 432, 434 (2d Cir.1985). The indication was, in fact, that the 17(a)(1)(e) exception was intended to extend to sales taxes a vendor has collected from his customers. <em>Id. </em>Courts construing 17(a)(1)(e) applied it to a sales tax that sellers were obligated to collect from buyers. <em>See, e.g., In re Fox, </em>609 F.2d 178, 181 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 821, 101 S.Ct. 78, 66 L.Ed.2d 23 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">With the 1966 amendments to the Act in mind, we turn to the legislative history of the 1978 enactments of sections in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">The House and Senate versions of \u00a7 507 were markedly different. <em>See In re Monaco, </em>47 B.R. 602, 610-13 (Bankr.W.D.N.Y. 1985), <em>reversed, Kelly v. New York State Dep\u2019t of Tax., </em>61 B.R. 674 (W.D.N.Y.1985) (remanded to conform with <em>DeChiaro). </em>Section 507 resulted from a compromise between the floor leaders of the bill: Congressman Edwards and Senator DeConcini. <em>Id. </em>at 608. The House version of subsection (C) encompassed only \u201ctaxes to be withheld from wages, salaries, commissions, dividends, interest, or other payments that were paid by the debtor ...\u201d <em>Monaco, </em>47 B.R. at 611; <em>see also H.R.

It included \u201ctax required to be collected or withheld from others and for which the debtor is liable in any capacity ...\u201d <em>Monaco, </em>47 B.R. at 611. The Senate Report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-14\">This category covers the so-called \u201ctrust fund\u201d taxes, that is, income taxes which an employer is required to withhold from the pay of his employees, the employees\u2019 shares of social security and railroad retirement taxes, and also Federal Unemployment Insurance. <em>This category also includes excise taxes which a seller of goods or services is required to collect from a buyer and pay over to a taxing authority.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>S.Rep.

We recognize that the reference to collected excise taxes in the Senate Report was, intentionally or unintentionally, deleted from the Joint Statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">The House version of subsection (E) was essentially the same as the enacted version, with one difference: excise tax debts were dischargeable if older than one year, instead of three years. The House Report does not elaborate on what the term \u201cexcise tax\u201d would encompass. H.Rep. No. 595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 357-58 (1977), <em>reprinted in </em>A. Herzog &amp; L. King, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 507 at 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">The joint statement of Edwards and De-Concini defines excise taxes as including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-8\">All Federal, State or local taxes generally considered by this category, including sales tax, estate and gift tax, gasoline and special fuel taxes, and wagering and truck taxes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">124 Cong.Rec. 32,416 (1978), <em>reprinted in </em>A. Herzog &amp; L. King, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 507 at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">As the <em>DeChiaro </em>court recognized, the statutory language creates an overlap between the provisions for trust fund and excise taxes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-11\">Congress may have intended to differentiate between two categories of excise taxes: those not collected from third parties, which are dischargeable if stale, and those collected from third parties, which are not dischargeable. Alternatively, Congress may have intended to differentiate between two categories of trust fund taxes: those that are also sales taxes and hence dischargeable if stale, and all other taxes collected from third parties, which are not dischargeable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-13\">760 F.2d at 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-14\">We believe that Congress intended to retain the distinction between the two forms of sales tax liability: those owed personally by a retailer and those incurred by a retailer\u2019s customers which are collected by the retailer under the authority of the state, held in trust, and then remitted by the retailer to the state. We find no indication that Congress intended to treat retailers differently than employers, who clearly cannot discharge their liability for withheld income taxes. <em>Rosenow, </em>715 F.2d at 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-15\">This interpretation is supported by important public policy considerations. A failing retailer should not be given incentive to default on sales tax obligations. If the obligation to the taxing authority can be discharged by a bankruptcy filing three years after the transaction giving rise to the tax, such an incentive to default will exist. For these reasons, we hold that Congress intended to differentiate between two categories of excise taxes and that the trust fund tax provision excepts from discharge those excise taxes required to be collected from third parties. <em>DeChiaro, </em>760 F.2d at 435; <em>Rosenow, </em>715 F.2d at 280; <em>Contra In re Boyd, </em>25 B.R. 1003 (Bankr.S. D.Ohio 1982); <em>In re Tapp, </em>16 B.R. 315 (Bankr.D.Alaska 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-16\">The dissent places emphasis on the fact that the Senate Report of \u00a7 507(a)(6)(C) specifically mentioned excise taxes collected by retailers from third parties, but that the Joint Statement that accompanies the compromise subsection did not contain similar language. Since the Senate\u2019s version of subsection (C) was adopted, the dissent infers that Congress intended to character<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>ize third-party-collected sales taxes as excise taxes rather than as trust fund taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">This theory is plausible, but strained. We do not believe that without more the intentional or unintentional deletion in the Joint Statement of the Senate Report\u2019s reference to collected excise taxes signals Congress\u2019 intent to perform what would be a significant about-face in its treatment of sales taxes collected from third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">In view of the entire history of the trust fund tax provision, we hold that a debt for a \u201ctrust fund sales tax\u201d is not released by a bankruptcy discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-14\">.

On the other hand, under section 507(a)(6)(E), liabilities for \u201cexcise tax[es]\u201d are dis-chargeable if the transaction giving rise to the tax occurred more than three years prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy case. The parties agree that the tax liabilities in this case are more than three years old and are thus dischargeable if the Washington State sales tax is an \u201cexcise tax\u201d, but are not dischargeable if the tax is one \u201crequired to be collected or withheld.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">The majority, in reaching its conclusion, first determines that the words of the statute do not provide a means for determining whether the sales tax at issue is an \u201cexcise tax\u201d or a tax \u201crequired to be collected.\u201d The majority then goes on to examine the law under the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 (the predecessor to the Bankruptcy Code of 1978), the legislative history of the Senate version of the Bankruptcy Code, and the decisions of the Second and Seventh Circuits, before reaching its holding that sales tax is a tax \u201crequired to be collected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b917-14\">I agree with the majority that the words of section 507(a)(6) are unclear. Under such circumstances, a court must turn to the legislative history of the statute for guidance. The legislative history of the Bankruptcy Code is complicated. On February 1, 1978, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 8200, the House version of the Bankruptcy Code. 124 Cong.Rec. 1804 (1978). In H.R. 8200, section 507(a)(6)(C) provided that \u201ctaxes required to be withheld from wages, salaries, commissions, dividends, interest, or other payments that were paid by the debtor\u201d were dischargeable if the transaction giving rise to the tax occurred at least two years prior to bankruptcy. <em>See </em>123 Cong.Rec. 35653 (1977). Section 507(a)(6)(E) provided that \u201cexcise tax[es]\u201d were dischargeable after one year. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-15\">On September 7, 1978, the Senate passed its version of the Bankruptcy Code. 124 Cong.Rec. 28284 (1978). Section 507(a)(6)(C) provided that \u201ctax[es] required to be collected or withheld\u201d were not dis-chargeable. <em>See </em>S. 2266, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. (1978); 124 Cong.Rec. 28284 (1978). Excise taxes were not mentioned in the Senate version of section 507(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-17\">There were substantial differences between the House and Senate versions of the Code, some of them so significant that it was decided not to have a conference committee consider the matter. Klee, <em>Legislative History of the New Bankruptcy Law, </em>28 De Paul L.Rev. 941, 953-54 (1979). Instead, the floor managers of the proposed Code, Senator DeConcini and Representative Edwards, with the assistance of some other members, negotiated an amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>ment which was then introduced in both houses. <em>Id. </em>at 954-55. This joint amendment was passed by both houses, and the Bankruptcy Code became law. <em>Id. </em>at 955-57.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">Section 507 was one of the sections covered by the joint amendment. The only legislative history concerning the amendment is found in the Joint Statement of Senator DeConcini and Representative Edwards. <em>See </em>124 Cong.Rec. 33989 (1978) (Senate), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 6505; 124 Cong.Rec. 32350 (1978) (House), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 6436. The Joint Statement was presented to both houses prior to the vote as the explanation of the negotiators, including the floor managers, as to the compromise that they reached. The majority errs by failing to rely on this critical legislative history. Instead, it focuses on the report which accompanied S. 2266, the Senate version of the Bankruptcy Code that conflicted with the House version. The Senate report obviously preceded the negotiations that produced the joint amendment. The majority relies on the earlier Senate report because the language of section 507(a)(6)(C) as enacted is nearly identical to the language found in S. 2266. Senator DeConcini and Representative Edwards, however, viewed the entirety of section 507(a)(6) in its final form as a compromise between the House and Senate versions. 124 Cong.Rec. 33997 (Senate), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 6505, 6520, 124 Cong.Rec. 32398 (House), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 6436, 6451. Of particular importance is section 507(a)(6)(E) which expressly makes excise taxes dischargeable and which was included as a part of the joint amendment although no comparable provision had been contained in S. 2266. The majority, by relying only on the legislative history <em>prior </em>to the joint amendment, fails to give effect to the compromise reached by the floor managers of the Code. To avoid such an error, section 507(a)(6)(C) as enacted must be construed with reference to, and in light of, section 507(a)(6)(E) as enacted. Differences between the explanation of section 507(a)(6) in the Senate report prior to the joint amendment and the explanation of the section after the compromise in the Joint Statement are far from the irrelevancies the majority believes them to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">The Joint Statement \u2014 the legislative history of section 507(a)(6) as enacted \u2014 makes it quite clear that a sales tax is an \u201cexcise tax\u201d and not a \u201ctax required to be collected or withheld.\u201d Senator DeConcini and Representative Edwards stated that the category of taxes required to be collected or withheld \u201ccovers the so-called \u2018trust fund\u2019 taxes, that is, income taxes which an employer is required to withhold from the pay of his employees, and the employees\u2019 share of social security taxes.\u201d 124 Cong.Rec. 34015 (Senate), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 6506, 6566; 124 Cong. Rec. 32415 (House), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 6436, 6497. With respect to <em>excise taxes, </em>the Joint Statement said that \u201c[a]ll Federal, State or local taxes generally considered or expressly treated as excises are covered by this category, including <em>sales taxes, </em>estate and gift taxes, gasoline and special fuel taxes, and wagering and truck taxes.\u201d 124 Cong.Rec. 34016 (Senate), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 6505, 6567; 124 Cong.Rec. 32416 (House), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 6436, 6498 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">Thus, the Joint Statement leaves little room for doubt that a sales tax is an \u201cexcise tax\u201d under section 507(a)(6)(E), and not, as the majority concludes, a \u201ctax required to be collected or withheld\u201d under section 507(a)(6)(C). The Joint Statement <em>is </em>the legislative history of the Bankruptcy Code as enacted. Given this clarity, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>would give effect to the expressed Congressional intent and hold that because Shank\u2019s liability is a sales tax liability over three years old, it is dischargeable under section 507(a)(6)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">The decision by the floor managers to adopt the House version of section 507(a)(6) insofar as it made excise taxes, including sales taxes, dischargeable (but extending the period from one to three years), and to incorporate that agreement in subsection E, explains why, when they also decided to use the Senate language regarding \u201ctaxes required to be collected\u201d in subsection C, it was necessary to delete a sentence from the original Senate explanation of the purpose and effect of subsection (C). The Senate report supporting its version of section 507(a)(6)(C) stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-6\">This category covers the so-called \u201ctrust fund\u201d taxes, that is, income taxes which an employer is required to withhold from the pay of his employees, and the employees\u2019 shares of social security and railroad retirement taxes, and also Federal Unemployment Insurance. <em>This category also includes excise taxes which a seller of goods and services is required to collect from a buyer and pay over to a taxing authority.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">S.Rep. No. 989, 95th Cong, 2nd Sess. 71 (1978), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5787, 5857 (emphasis added). The floor managers, after they reached their compromise, retained nearly identical language in their explanation of subsection (C) except that they omitted the sentence emphasized above that states that the subsection \u201calso includes excise taxes.\u201d It is apparent that their reason for doing so was the agreement to make excise taxes (including sales taxes) dischargeable, as evidenced by the inclusion in section 507 of subsection (E) which deals expressly with excise taxes and provides for their dischargeability and the Joint Statement\u2019s definition of excise taxes as \u201cincluding sales taxes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">Even if I found it necessary to consider the law under the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, or the decisions of the Second and Seventh Circuits, my conclusion would not change.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-12\">Under the 1898 Act, the dischargeability of taxes was regulated by section 17(a)(1), which was vastly different in both form and substance from the current section 507(a)(6).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Despite these differences, the majority believes that section 507(a)(6) must be given the same interpretation as section 17(a)(1) has been given, arguing that Congress did not explicitly indicate an intent to change the law in this area. There are two problems with the majority\u2019s position. First, when Congress completely rewrites the law in a particular field, as it did in enacting the Bankruptcy Code of 1978, it should not be required to specify explicitly each instance in which it is changing prior law; such would be too great a burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-13\">Second, the cases interpreting section 17(a)(1) on which the majority relies were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>all decided <em>after </em>the enactment of the 1978 Code, and thus Congress was entirely unaware of them when it revised the bankruptcy law. Apparently only two courts have held that a sales tax was a tax \u201ccollected or withheld\u201d under section 17(a)(1)(e). <em>See In re Fox, </em>609 F.2d 178 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 821, 101 S.Ct. 78, 66 L.Ed.2d 23 (1980); <em>Lawrence v. Lindley, </em>65 Ohio St.2d 105, 418 N.E.2d 1351 (1981) (relying on Fox). Prior to <em>Fox </em>and at the time the 1978 Code was enacted, the commentators appeared to believe that the phrase \u201ctaxes____ collected or withheld\u201d as used in section 17(a)(1)(e) referred to \u201cincome and social security withholdings.\u201d 1A <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>H 17.-14[6] (14th ed. 1978). Thus, it is quite likely that when Congress drafted section 507(a)(6) it thought that section 17(a)(1)(e) did not refer to sales taxes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, given the degree of uncertainty that exists, I do not believe section 17(a)(1) can provide much guidance either way as to the meaning of section 507(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">Two circuits have reached the same conclusion the majority reaches here. <em>See In re Rosenow, </em>715 F.2d 277 (7th Cir.1983); <em>DeChiaro v. New York State Tax Commission, </em>760 F.2d 432 (2d Cir.1985). These cases, however, are not persuasive. The court in <em>Rosenow </em>incorrectly believed that the Joint Statement reflected the view of the House of Representatives only, rather than the views of both the House and Senate, and accordingly refused to rely on it. 715 F.2d at 280. Such an error makes the holding highly questionable, and of little utility here. In <em>DeChiaro, </em>the court also appeared to have misunderstood the nature of the Joint Statement and the compromise it represented, referring to it as mere \u201cfloor debate\u201d. 760 F.2d at 436. The court, without adequate or convincing explanation, decided to rely instead on past interpretations of section 17(a)(1) and the legislative history of the Senate\u2019s version of the Bankruptcy Code. Its conclusion, therefore, constitutes somewhat of a non sequitur, and is hardly convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">The majority finally attempts to buttress its conclusion with arguments concerning the undesirability of allowing sales tax liabilities to be dischargeable. The wisdom of the policy decisions incorporated in section 507(a)(6) is a matter for Congress, not the courts, and Congress is free to amend the statute at any time. Furthermore, the policy arguments concerning the dischargeability of tax liabilities are far more complex than the majority appears to think. While dischargeability may encourage taxpayers to default, nondischargeability may encourage taxing authorities to be overly lax in their collection activities and may cause harm to other creditors of the debtor. <em>See, e.g., </em>H.R.Rep. No. 372, 88th Cong., 1st Sess. 3-4 (1963); S.Rep. No. 114, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 4-5 (1965); H.R.Rep. No. 687, 8th Cong., 1st Sess. 3-4 (1965); S.Rep. No. 1158, 89th Cong. 2d Sess. 4 (1966), <em>reprinted in </em>1966 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 2468, 2471. We must assume that Congress has carefully balanced these conflicting policies, and we should respect its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">Because the legislative history of section 507(a)(6) as enacted \u2014 the Joint Statement\u2014 makes it clear that a sales tax is an excise tax under section 507(a)(6)(E), I would hold that Shank\u2019s debt to the State of Washington is dischargeable. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b917-18\">. Section 523(a) actually deals with discharge-ability. However, \u00a7 523(a)(1)(A) by its own terms requires us to refer to \u00a7 507(a)(6) to determine whether, and on what terms, specific tax liabilities are dischargeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-19\">Unless otherwise indicated, all references are to the Bankruptcy Code of 1978 prior to its amendment by the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984, Pub.L.

In addition to passing the joint amendment, the Senate on October 5, 1978, passed a series of amendments regarding technical corrections, rolling stock equipment, and the status and appointment of bankruptcy judges. <em>See </em>124 Cong.
