They primarily attack the way in which the government first presented its case to the jury, namely, by having two government agents describe what an informer had previously told them about what the appellants said and did in a series of meetings with the informer. We agree with the appellants that the admission of this descriptive testimony was erroneous; but we also think the error was harmless. In Part I we shall set out at length how we reach this conclusion. In Part II we shall consider the appellants\u2019 other arguments, none of which, in our view, warrants a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-17\">Our analysis of the appellants\u2019 main argument depends heavily on the specific facts of the case. We shall first summarize these facts, then discuss the basic error of law, and finally explain why we think that error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-18\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-19\">The government\u2019s evidence, much of which was on tape, shows the following series of events, all of which took place in late summer of 1984.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-20\"><em>August 3: </em>Agents of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration lawfully searched the home of Armand Barrasso. They found about a pound of cocaine. In return for a promise to recommend leniency to his eventual sentencing judge, Barrasso promised to help the DEA by becoming an informer. His actions during the ensuing investigation of the appellants were closely supervised by two DEA agents, Peter Vinton and Daniel Doherty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-21\"><em>August 7: </em>Barrasso told Doherty that \u201cTony Ramo\u201d had. called and wanted to see him. \u201cTony Ramo\u201d turned out to be an alias for Antonio Mazza, one of the appellants. Barrasso met Mazza that afternoon at the Sports Page Lounge in Revere, Massachusetts. Mazza introduced him to Anthony DeCologero, the other appellant. According to Barrasso, the appellants asked him to supply six kilograms of cocaine per month, as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>as some marijuana, but Barrasso said he wasn\u2019t interested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1293-5\"><em>August 13: </em>After consulting with the DEA agents, Barrasso called Mazza and left a recorded message, stating, \u201cWhen I catch up with ya, I wanna talk to you about something. May be comfortable for both of us.\u201d (The jury heard a tape of the message.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1293-6\"><em>August U: </em>Barrasso called Mazza. Barrasso said Mazza had put him in a \u201cpeculiar position\u201d and that Barrasso would \u201cneed an explanation\u201d from Mazza \u201cbefore I can talk to you.\u201d Mazza. replied that he was \u201ctrying to form the company to go to work, and this is it.\u201d Barrasso and Mazza agreed to meet again. (The jury heard a tape of the call.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1293-7\"><em>August 15: </em>Barrasso called Mazza. Mazza said that he had spoken with his \u201cother friend\u201d and that he (Mazza) wanted to see Barrasso about something \u201cvery important.\u201d (The jury heard a tape of the call.) Barrasso met Mazza that evening at Mazza\u2019s home. According to Barrasso, Mazza showed him six or seven ounces of cocaine and asked him if he (Barrasso) could get him cocaine \u201cto take care of something local.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1293-8\"><em>August 16: </em>Barrasso called Mazza. Mazza said, \u201c[M]y guy ... [is] desperate---- He\u2019ll go along with anything I tell him to do.\u201d They agreed to meet at a restaurant that afternoon. (The jury heard a tape of the call.) Barrasso then met Mazza and DeCologero at Mario\u2019s Restaurant in East Boston. According to Barrasso, DeCologero told him \u201c[h]e was ready but ... [t]hey wanted the narcotics brought up to Boston\u201d before paying. Barrasso said he would try to arrange things. Later that day Barrasso called Mazza and told him he was going on vacation but would be in touch when he got back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1293-10\"><em>September 5: </em>Barrasso called Mazza and said he was \u201cback from vacation.\u201d Barrasso asked to meet \u201cwith you and your friend,\u201d and set up a meeting for that evening at the Heritage Flooring store in North Reading. (The jury heard a tape of the call.) At the evening meeting (which Barrasso secretly recorded) Barrasso explained his not having been in touch by saying \u201cother things turned up.\u201d He said he had gone \u201cdown there\u201d and his source had agreed to \u201ccome up here.\u201d DeCologero said he had \u201cmoved\u201d twelve \u201cpieces\u201d since last speaking to Barrasso. He told Barrasso, \u201cI\u2019m on consignment with people. They\u2019re on consignment with me. Understand? I have the biggest hook-up in New England. With my boats and everything.\u201d Mazza asked Barrasso whether he had worked out \u201cthat other thing\u201d involving \u201cthe smoke ... the weed.\u201d DeCologero said, \u201cI can move at least 20 \u2014 20 thousand pounds of the shit. I mean if you got ah, the smoke____ The other stuff I can move three or four. I told you, maybe 5-6 a month.\u201d DeCologero added that he had \u201cdone enough dealings with a lot of people in New England____ I know everybody there is possible to know.\u201d He told Barrasso not to worry about getting hurt by \u201coutlaw\u201d drug dealers. \u201cIf there\u2019s any trouble on that end of it,\u201d DeCologero said, \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it____ I got an army you understand____ I don\u2019t fuck around.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1293-16\">Barrasso told Mazza and DeCologero, \u201cHere\u2019s what I can do____ They\u2019ll bring the stuff up like that there____ I know that the money is here. I just pick up the phone and say the money is here, bang.\u201d Barrasso added that DeCologero did not have to \u201cgive\u201d him any money, \u201c[a]s long as I see the money.\u201d He said the price would be \u201c32.\u201d Mazza said they wanted \u201c3 pieces tomorrow.\u201d Barrasso said DeCologero should come up with \u201cabout sixty up front.\u201d DeCologero eventually replied, \u201cI can come up with a little better than 40.\u201d All three agreed to meet in the parking lot of the Hilltop Steak House in Saugus. At one point in the meeting Barrasso showed Mazza and DeCologero a sample of cocaine (supposedly from his Florida source but actually supplied by the DEA). (The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>jury heard a tape of the Heritage Flooring conversation.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-4\"><em>September 6: </em>Barrasso and Mazza spoke by phone. They arranged a meeting for that evening. (The jury heard tapes of the calls.) According to Barrasso, Mazza asked at the meeting whether Barrasso could help him with a separate cocaine deal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-5\"><em>September 7: </em>Barrasso met Mazza and DeCologero at the Hilltop Steak House. According to Barrasso, DeCologero told him that the money was in the trunk of his car. Barrasso said he did not actually see the money. Barrasso spoke to the DEA agents by phone during the meeting. (He pretended he was talking to his \u201cFlorida source.\u201d) At one point, Barrasso told Agent Vinton there was \u201ca problem\u201d; Vinton told Barrasso he should leave the meeting. (Barrasso secretly recorded the meeting; the government introduced the resulting tape into evidence, but did not play it for the jury.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-6\">That afternoon, Barrasso called Mazza and suggested that \u201cyou and your friend meet me at Eastern Airlines parking lot, at ah, five o\u2019clock, and we\u2019ll have it, we\u2019ll be all set.\u201d Mazza said no. Later, Barrasso and Mazza agreed to meet at De-Cologero\u2019s house once the \u201cFlorida source\u201d arrived. Later still, Barrasso called Mazza to say that the source had not arrived and that he was going to Florida to straighten things out. (Recordings of the first two of these three calls were played for the jury.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-7\"><em>September 15: </em>Barrasso called Mazza from Miami and told him, \u201c[Tjhey\u2019re going to leave with that thing. It\u2019s all set.\u201d Mazza told Barrasso to call him when he returned to Boston. (The jury heard a tape of the call.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-8\"><em>September 19: </em>Having returned to Massachusetts, Barrasso called Mazza from Medford and said, \u201c[T]he thing is here safe.\u201d He called Mazza again to make various arrangements. (The jury heard tapes of both calls.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-9\"><em>September 20: </em>Barrasso called Mazza \u2022 twice and arranged a meeting at the Meridien Hotel in Boston. (The jury heard tapes of both calls.) Barrasso, Mazza, DeCologero, and DEA agent John Kelly (masquerading as the \u201cFlorida source\u201d) met in the Meridien lobby at 1 p.m. Kelly testified that he told the defendants he had \u201ctwo kilos of cocaine\u201d in Boston and he \u201cunderstood they wanted to do some business\u201d; but, he said they would see no cocaine until he saw the money. Mazza replied, \u201c[TJhere has to be some trust here.\u201d He said he was \u201cin organized crime up here\u201d and he was \u201cout on bail for first-degree murder.\u201d DeCologero asked Kelly how he wanted to do the deal. Kelly told Mazza and DeCologero to get the money, put it in the trunk of their car, return to the Meridien, give Kelly the key to the trunk, and let him see the money; he would then deliver the cocaine. After further discussion \u2014 during which DeCologero said he had \u201cdone twelve kilos of cocaine since the last night [sic] at the Hilltop,\u201d and Mazza asked Kelly how soon he could do another deal \u2014 the appellants said they would get the money and \u201cget back\u201d to Kelly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-11\">Late that afternoon, Mazza called Kelly at the Meridien, acknowledged that he had \u201cthe thing,\u201d and arranged to meet Kelly in the hotel lobby. Kelly and Barrasso then met Mazza and DeCologero in the lobby. DeCologero said he had the money. He went with Kelly into the men\u2019s room, where he showed him a canvas bag filled with cash. The two men returned outside and met with Mazza and Barrasso. At that point, agents arrested Mazza and DeCologero and seized the canvas bag containing $64,000. (The evidence about the Meridien meetings consisted primarily of Kelly\u2019s testimony, along with tapes of the phone calls involved.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1294-12\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-13\">The appellants\u2019 major claim on this appeal is that the way in which the government presented its case to the jury was unfair. Before calling Barrasso to describe what happened during the August and September meetings, the government called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>DEA agents Doherty and Vinton, who supervised the investigation of Mazza and DeCologero. On direct examination, the agents were permitted to describe what Barrasso had told them outside the courtroom about what he and the appellants had said and done in these conversations, at which the agents were not present. Indeed, in at least one instance, one of the agents testified about what Barrasso had told the other agent (outside the courtroom) about one of his conversations with the appellants. The agents\u2019 testimony contained many statements by Barrasso that, if taken as true, would strongly incriminate the appellants. Indeed, the jury initially heard much of the story that we have presented in Part A, <em>supra, </em>through the government agents\u2019 descriptions of what Barrasso had told them out of court. This way of presenting the evidence, the appellants claim, led the jury to hear the government\u2019s case three times \u2014 twice out of the mouths of the government agents, in the form of inadmissible hearsay testimony, and only later in the form of admissible testimony by Barrasso himself. Barrasso, they add, was a highly untrustworthy witness whose credibility was unfairly enhanced by the government\u2019s manner of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">In our opinion, both reason and authority indicate the appellants are right about the inadmissibility of the challenged testimony of the government agents. Technically speaking, the agents\u2019 testimony was not hearsay, for the court repeatedly cautioned the jury not to consider the out-of-court statements for their truth, but, rather, to consider them as \u201cbackground,\u201d or as showing \u201cthe basis for the actions taken by the government.\u201d The court apparently meant for the jury to take the agents\u2019 accounts of what Barrasso told them as showing only the <em>fact </em>that Barrasso said certain words to the agents, not as evidence of the <em>truth </em>of Barrasso\u2019s out-of-court words. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801(c) (evidence of out-of-court assertion is not hearsay if not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted); <em>United States v. Mancillas, </em>580 F.2d 1301, 1309 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 958, 99 S.Ct. 361, 58 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978). Nevertheless, as we shall explain below, the risk that the jury would consider those words for their truth was great, and the government\u2019s need to present them to the jury \u2014 through the agents\u2019 testimony \u2014 was virtually nonexistent. Because the \u201cprobative value\u201d of the agents\u2019 testimony was \u201csubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,\u201d it should have been excluded under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-7\">We fully recognize that out-of-court statements are often admissible for non-hearsay purposes and that a district court has considerable leeway in applying Rule 403. Nonetheless, in this instance, the testimony should have been excluded, for three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-8\">First, the <em>amount </em>of out-of-court-statement evidence was large. Barrasso\u2019s out-of-court statements pervaded the direct examination of both agents. The agents related so many of these statements that the government effectively managed to have the jury hear a second-hand account of Barrasso\u2019s entire story through witnesses whose credibility the jury was less apt to question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-9\">Second, when the out-of-court statements were admitted, the <em>risk </em>that they could improperly sway the jury was high. The testimony might have shown facts not later corroborated; it would also likely bolster the credibility of the informer Barrasso before he took the stand. <em>United States v. Pedroza, </em>750 F.2d 187, 200 (2d Cir.1984) (admission of such statements inappropriate \u201cwhere ... the declarant does not reiterate the statements\u201d and \u201calso inappropriate where ... the declarant does so testify, since the hearsay testimony serves to bolster the testimony of the declarant\u201d); <em>United States v. Ziegler, </em>583 F.2d 77, 81 <em>&amp; </em>n. 8 (2d Cir.1978) (although informer testified at trial, agent\u2019s testimony incorporating informer\u2019s out-of-court statements should have been excluded as \u201can attempt to obtain illegitimate corroboration\u201d). The jury was particularly likely to consider these out-of-court declarations for their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>truth, for they directly implicated the defendants in the specific criminal acts at issue. <em>See Mancillas, </em>580 F.2d at 1310 (\u201ctestimonial repetition of a declarant\u2019s out-of-court charge that the defendant ... was engaged in specific criminality\u201d creates \u201ctoo great a risk\u201d that jury will consider out-of-court statement for its truth). <em>Compare United States v. Bradshaw, </em>719 F.2d 907, 919-20 (7th Cir.1983) (risk of prejudice insubstantial where agent\u2019s alleged hearsay statement \u201cwas incomplete and subject to innocent interpretation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\">Third, the agents\u2019 testimony about Barrasso\u2019s out-of-court statements had almost no probative value. The government says the testimony was relevant to the issue of entrapment. But, \u201c[entrapment occurs when the offense for which a defendant is being prosecuted was instigated by the law-enforcement officers and the defendant had no previous disposition to commit it.\u201d <em>United States v. Kakley, </em>741 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1984). The <em>fact </em>that Barrasso told Agents Vinton and Doherty much of what he claims to have been told by the appellants has nothing to do with the appellants\u2019 \u2018predisposition.\u2019 <em>See United States v. Webster, </em>649 F.2d 346, 349 (5th Cir.1981) (en banc). And, the \u2018instigation\u2019 question here focused on the actions of Barrasso, not on the reasonableness of Vinton\u2019s or Doherty\u2019s behavior in respect to what Barrasso told them. <em>See also Webster, </em>649 F.2d at 351 (government\u2019s reasonableness or good faith is \u201cof only secondary significance\u201d to entrapment); <em>United States v. Russell, </em>411 U.S. 423, 93 S.Ct. 1637, 36 L.Ed.2d 366 (1973); 2 C. Wright, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal </em>\u00a7 495, at 769 (2d ed. 1982) (doubtful whether jury has any role in considering issue of inducement).</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-5\">In context, the government could simply have asked the agents to testify that they debriefed Barrasso after his conversations with the appellants. The government could \u2014 and should \u2014 have left Barrasso to testify about the substance of those conversations. <em>See also United States v. Walker, </em>636 F.2d 194 (8th Cir.1980) (no error where.agent \u201cdid not testify as to any statement made by the confidential informant,\u201d but \u201cmerely testified as to his own behavior based on information he received from the informant\u201d); <em>Ziegler, </em>583 F.2d at 81-82 n. 9 (agent could recount his instructions to informer, but could not recount informer\u2019s narration to agent repeating alleged statements by defendant to informer). In sum, the amount of potentially prejudicial testimony admitted, combined with the lack of need, convinces us that its admission was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-7\">Case law involving this type of testimony supports this conclusion. Where, as here, the risk of.prejudice is great and the need for the testimony is small, appellate courts have insisted on exclusion. <em>See Webster, </em>649 F.2d at 351; <em>Ziegler, </em>583 F.2d at 81; <em>Mancillas, </em>580 F.2d at 1310. The cases that allow arguably similar testimony involve greater need, less risk of prejudice, or both. <em>See United States v. Echeverry, </em>759 F.2d 1451, 1457 (9th Cir.1985) (little risk of prejudice in allowing agent\u2019s second-hand testimony where out-of-court declarant did not directly implicate defendants, had little motive to exaggerate, and was speaking against penal interest); <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>749 F.2d 1078, 1082-84 &amp; n. 8 (4th Cir.1984) (agents\u2019 testimony was probative of government\u2019s motives, which were drawn in issue by <em>due process </em>defense; testimony \u201cdid not bear in any way\u201d on <em>entrapment </em>defense), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 3479, 87 L.Ed.2d 614 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-10\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-11\">The remaining, and more difficult, question is whether the error proved harmless in light of other, properly admitted evidence. To answer this question, we have reviewed the entire record; we have considered the likely impact of the error on the minds of the jurors, <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 763-64, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1247, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946); and we have asked ourselves whether we can say \u201cwith fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the [ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>rors\u2019] judgment was not substantially swayed by the error,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 765, 66 S.Ct. at 1248; <em>accord United States v. Pisari, </em>636 F.2d 855, 859 (1st Cir.1981); <em>see </em>Fed.R. Crim.P. 52(a) (error harmless if it \u201cdoes not affect substantial rights\u201d). <em>Compare Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 828, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967) (higher standard for federal constitutional error).</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">To answer these questions, we have located each instance in which Doherty or Vinton brought potentially prejudicial out-of-court statements to the jury\u2019s attention, and compared this testimony with other, corroborative evidence that was properly admitted. <em>Cf. United States v. Indelicato, </em>611 F.2d 376, 384 (1st Cir.1979). Barrasso\u2019s later, admissible testimony offers only some, not total, corroboration, since the agents\u2019 improper testimony arguably preconditioned the jurors to overvalue Barrasso\u2019s credibility. We shall describe our results in detail, in part to show precisely how inadequate care in the conduct of a trial can convert an overwhelmingly strong prosecution case into a difficult issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">The following summary sets out the improper testimony and the evidence corroborating it:</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-7\"><em>Event 1: </em>Mazza calls Barrasso on August 7.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-8\"><em>Out-of-court statement: </em>Vinton testified that Doherty told him that Barrasso told Doherty that \u201cTony Ramo [an alias for Mazza] had called [Barrasso] on the telephone and requested a meeting to discuss a cocaine transaction.\u201d Doherty testified that Barrasso told him \u201che had just spoken with a man called Tony Ramo and ...

Barrasso said he did not look inside the trunk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-5\">Barrasso wore a body recorder to this meeting. The resulting tape was put into evidence, but apparently was never played for the jury. We have listened to the tape. Although it is hard to make out some of the conversation, enough is intelligible to show that DeCologero claimed to have brought money to the Hilltop and that Barrasso left without seeing it. In fact, DeCologero\u2019s own testimony about what happened at this meeting does not differ substantially from the government\u2019s version. On direct examination, DeCologero stated the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-6\">Q. ... Now, you drove, as you testified, to the Hilltop parking lot on the 7th. When you went there, did you have something with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-7\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-8\">Q.

I pulled into the Hilltop parking lot and saw Mr. Barrasso standing near the phone and I parked near the phone. He came over to me and asked me if I had the money. I told him I did. Then all of a sudden, he went back to the phone where Mr. Mazza was standing and says to Mr. Mazza, \u201cI believe you, I believe you, he has the money.\u201d He didn\u2019t see the money at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-16\">Q.

As to event 5, the jury heard a tape of precisely what occurred. As to event 6, Vinton\u2019s synopsis of what went on at the Hilltop does not differ significantly from DeCologero\u2019s version. As to event 7, Vinton\u2019s testimony was corroborated by Agent Kelly, testifying from first-hand observation, and Kelly\u2019s veracity was not in serious doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"AURI\">Events 1, 2, 3 and 4 pose more serious questions. Nonetheless, we conclude it is \u201chighly probable\u201d that the testimony in question \u201cdid not affect the [jury\u2019s] judgment.\u201d <em>Government of Virgin Islands v. Toto, </em>529 F.2d 278, 284 (3d Cir.1976) (quoting R. Traynor, <em>The Riddle of Harmless Error </em>35 (1970)). Except in respect to the issue of entrapment, the tape recordings and other independent evidence (such as Agent Kelly\u2019s testimony) presented an overwhelming case. The strength of that case makes the improper testimony harmless in respect to proving the usual elements of criminal conspiracy. In respect to Mazza\u2019s entrapment defense, the challenged testimony was also harmless. We do not believe it could have made a difference, given the remaining evidence of Mazza\u2019s actions, intent, and predisposition. <em>Cf. United States v. Fera, </em>616 F.2d 590, 597 (1st Cir.) (defendant was not entitled to jury instruction on entrapment where there was no evidence of his unreadiness to commit the offense), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 969, 100 S.Ct. 2951, 64 L.Ed.2d 830 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"AEG\">DeCologero\u2019s case, in respect to entrapment, is more difficult because he testified to a specific, conflicting version of events 2 and 4. According to DeCologero, Mazza invited him to the Sports Page Lounge on August 7 to discuss a real estate transaction. They were joined by Barrasso, whom DeCologero had never met before. DeCologero mentioned he had $50,000 he wanted to invest. Barrasso said DeCologero could double his money by participating in a cocaine deal, but DeCologero said he didn\u2019t do that kind of business. On August 16, DeCologero met Mazza at Mario\u2019s Restaurant and, to his surprise, found Barrasso there. DeCologero repeated that he was not interested in a cocaine deal, and walked out. Barrasso followed him outside, grabbed him by the arm, told him Mazza \u201cfe[lt] bad about you walking out like that,\u201d and persuaded DeCologero to come back inside. Barrasso then said that he needed \u201cto get back in good standing\u201d with his Florida cocaine suppliers and that he wanted DeCologero simply to \u201cshow\u201d \u2014 not to \u201cgive\u201d \u2014 enough money for two kilos of cocaine. In return, Barrasso would double DeCologero\u2019s money, while forgiving a debt Mazza owed Barrasso. DeCologero refused and walked out. Later, on September 5, without any further conversations with Barrasso, DeCologero agreed to show the money. On the way to the September 5 meeting at Heritage Flooring, Mazza told him, \u201cIf you are going to show Mr. Barrasso money, you better start talking like you know what you are doing.\u201d This, DeCologero says, explains his recorded remarks at Heritage Flooring about his extensive experience in the narcotics trade.</p>\n<p id=\"AF3m\">For the out-of-court statements about events 1 through 4 to have made a difference in respect to DeCologero\u2019s entrapment defense, the jury would have had to believe DeCologero\u2019s version of the relevant events and believe that his version showed entrapment, namely, that the government instigated an offense he was not predisposed to commit. This conclusion, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>logically possible, requires heroic assumptions about the rest of the evidence. Consider, for example, DeCologero\u2019s recorded comments on September 5 at Heritage Flooring: he told Barrasso he had \u201cmoved\u201d twelve \u201cpieces\u201d since their last conversation; he spoke at length about recent dealings with a Hispanic cocaine supplier; and he boasted of having not only \u201cthe biggest hook-up in New England\u201d but also an \u201carmy\u201d of people to protect him. In light of these remarks, it seems highly unlikely that the jury would have doubted DeCologero\u2019s predisposition. Of course, DeCologero tried to explain his comments away as mere bravado: \u201cI told [Barrasso] a lot of things to build myself up like I knew what I was talking about ... to show him that I didn\u2019t want any games played with my money.\u201d But how could one accept <em>both </em>(1) DeCologero\u2019s claim that Barrasso pressured a known \u2018innocent\u2019 (DeCologero) into taking part in the cocaine deal, <em>and (2) </em>DeCologero\u2019s claim that he had to deceive <em>Barrasso </em>about his own prior experience in dealing cocaine? If the point of DeCologero\u2019s \u2018showing the money\u2019 was, as he put it, to help Barrasso \u201cget back in good standing\u201d with his Florida source, wouldn\u2019t the person DeCologero needed to \u2018impress\u2019 have been, not Barrasso (his \u2018corrupter\u2019), but the source (whose confidence Barrasso was trying to regain)? And, even if one assumes DeCologero felt some need to \u2018impress\u2019 Barrasso, could one reasonably believe <em>both </em>(1) that in August DeCologero presented himself to Barrasso as a stranger to the narcotics trade, <em>and </em>(2) that less than a month later DeCologero tried to pass himself off to Barrasso (an experienced Boston-area drug dealer) as having \u201cthe biggest hook-up in New England\u201d and as knowing \u201ceverybody there is possible to know\u201d? Considerations like these make it hard to accept even DeCologero\u2019s version of the events as showing that he was an \u201cunwary innocent,\u201d <em>United States v. Russell, </em>411 U.S. at 436, 93 S.Ct. at 1645, who was \u2018corrupted\u2019 into committing a crime. In sum, the logical possibility that, in the absence of the challenged testimony, the jury would have both accepted DeCologero\u2019s story and concluded that it showed entrapment is no more than that \u2014 a logical possibility. In light of the overwhelming proof of guilt emanating from the properly admitted evidence, particularly the evidence on tape, we find it highly probable that the DEA agents\u2019 improper testimony did not substantially sway the jurors\u2019 judgment in respect to DeCologero\u2019s entrapment defense, or the other issues in the case. We therefore cannot, in good conscience, find the error other than harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-6\">The appellants make several other arguments, which they believe show that their trial was unfair and that they should have a new one. We shall discuss these arguments briefly, indicating our basic reasons for finding them legally inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-8\">Mazza says that the district court erred in agreeing to admit three pieces of evidence showing \u201cprior bad acts,\u201d namely, (1) evidence of Mazza's recent state court murder conviction, (2) Barrasso\u2019s testimony that Mazza had bought cocaine from him ten times before the alleged conspiracy began, and (3) Agent Kelly\u2019s testimony that during the Meridien meeting Mazza said he was \u201cin organized crime up here\u201d and was \u201cout on bail for first-degree murder.\u201d Mazza says these pieces of evidence should have been excluded under Rules 404(b) and 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Rule 404(b) bars evidence showing that a defendant on trial for one crime has been involved in some other bad act, <em>if </em>the evidence is introduced solely to prove that the defendant has a bad character and therefore might commit crimes of the sort for which he is on trial. <em>See United States v. Johnston, </em>784 F.2d 416, 423 n. 10 (1st Cir.1986). If the evidence proves relevant in some other way, however, it is admissible, subject only to the balancing test of Rule 403. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-9\">Mazza cannot here complain about the first piece of evidence \u2014 the murder con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>viction \u2014 because the court did not admit the evidence. Rather, relying on Fed.R. Evid. 609(a), the court ruled that it <em>would </em>admit the evidence for impeachment purposes <em>if </em>Mazza testified. The Supreme Court has made clear that a criminal defendant cannot appeal this type of conditional ruling by the trial court. Rather, he must take the stand and give the court a chance to perform the required balancing in the concrete context of actual question and answer; only if the defendant does testify and the conviction is actually admitted may he raise the issue on appeal. <em>Luce v. United States, </em>469 U.S. 38, 105 S.Ct. 460, 83 L.Ed.2d 443 (1984). We are bound here by the decision in <em>Luce.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1303-4\">The remaining two pieces of evidence were properly admitted under Rule 404(b) because they were offered for permissible purposes. The evidence of Mazza\u2019s prior cocaine purchases from Barrasso suggests a predisposition to buy cocaine, an issue that became material in light of Mazza\u2019s entrapment defense. <em>See United States v. Russell, </em>411 U.S. 423, 429, 93 S.Ct. 1637, 1641, 36 L.Ed.2d 366 (1973) (\u201c[I]f the defendant seeks acquittal by reason of entrapment he cannot complain of an appropriate and searching inquiry into his own conduct and predisposition as bearing upon that issue.\u201d) (quoting <em>Sorrells v. United States, </em>287 U.S. 435, 451, 53 S.Ct. 210, 216, 77 L.Ed. 413 (1932)); <em>United States v. Parrish, </em>736 F.2d 152, 156 (5th Cir.1984) (per curiam); 2 D. Louisell &amp; C. Mueller, <em>Federal Evidence </em>\u00a7 140, at 241-46 (rev.ed. 1985); 2 J. Weinstein &amp; M. Berger, <em>Weinstein\u2019s Evidence </em>1404[04], at 404-30 to -31 (1985); <em>see also United States v. Palow, 111 </em>F.2d 52, 54-55 (1st Cir.1985) (\u201cA defendant\u2019s statements concerning future narcotics transactions are relevant to establish his predisposition to commit crimes for which the entrapment defense is asserted.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 1277, 89 L.Ed.2d 585 (1986). And, since the evidence of the prior dealings suggests that Mazza knew Barrasso as a cocaine supplier, it is also probative in clarifying the meaning of otherwise ambiguous language in the recorded conversations between the two. '</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-8\">Similarly, when viewed in context, <em>see supra </em>p. 1214, Mazza\u2019s statements to Agent Kelly (who was posing as the \u201cFlorida source\u201d) tended to show an effort by Mazza to impress Kelly with his \u2018experience\u2019 in the drug trade and thereby to encourage Kelly to go ahead with the transaction. Thus, Mazza\u2019s remarks were probative of his intent, namely, his \u201cpurpose of promoting or facilitating [the] commission\u201d of a crime. Model Penal Code \u00a7 5.03(1) (definition of criminal conspiracy). And, the court limited any possible prejudice to Mazza by instructing the jury to consider Mazza\u2019s remarks without regard to whether he was telling the truth; their significance lay in the (asserted) fact that he made them to Kelly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-9\">Because the \u2018bad acts\u2019 evidence was introduced for legitimate purposes, it was properly admitted under Rule 404(b). <em>United States v. Zeuli, </em>725 F.2d 813, 816 (1st Cir.1984). And, in light of the probative value of the evidence, the court\u2019s attempt to minimize any prejudice through limiting instructions, and the rest of the record, the decision not to exclude the evidence under Rule 403 was within the court\u2019s lawful powers. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Kadouh, </em>768 F.2d 20, 21-22 (1st Cir.1985); <em>United States v. McNeill, </em>728 F.2d 5, 13 (1st Cir.1984); <em>Zeuli, </em>725 F.2d at 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-11\">DeCologero claims that the district court should have severed his trial from Mazza\u2019s because (1) Mazza would then have testified at DeCologero\u2019s trial, rather than remain silent, (2) the jury would not have associated DeCologero with Mazza\u2019s prior bad behavior, and (3) the jury would not have blamed him for Mazza\u2019s outburst during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-12\">To obtain severance for the first of these reasons, DeCologero had to show the district court that Mazza would in fact testify at a separate trial and that his testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>ny would in fact prove exculpatory. <em>United States v. Arruda, </em>715 F.2d 671, 679-80 (1st Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Smolar, </em>557 F.2d 13, 21 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 866, 966, 971, 98 S.Ct. 203, 508, 523, 54 L.Ed.2d 143, 453, 461 (1977); <em>see United States v. Reis, </em>788 F.2d 54, 60 (1st Cir. 1986). When DeCologero first raised the point \u2014 on the ninth day of trial \u2014 the district court told his counsel \u201cto provide me with a sufficient specific exculpatory basis for [Mazza\u2019s] testimony, a likelihood, reasonable likelihood that he would testify if he were called \u2014 you\u2019ve got to show me compelling prejudice.\u201d Counsel again asked for severance on the trial\u2019s tenth day, but he still provided only a general, conclusory assertion that Mazza\u2019s testimony would prove helpful. Although Mazza\u2019s counsel then offered to summarize how Mazza would testify, the trial court pointed out to him, \u201cYou are not the moving party\u201d; and, DeCologero\u2019s counsel still not did offer details. Given DeCologero\u2019s failure to provide specific information, the trial court acted within its lawful powers in not ordering a severance on this ground. <em>See </em>P. Marcus, <em>The Prosecution and Defense of Criminal Conspiracy Cases </em>\u00a7 6.03[4], at 6-44 &amp; n. 77 (1985) (\u201c[T]he burden is on the defendant] to demonstrate the exculpatory importance of the <em>particular </em>testimony [he] desire[s] from [his co-defendant;] allegations of general exculpatory testimony will not be sufficient.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-4\">In respect to DeCologero\u2019s second argument for severance, we understand why he feared that the jury would associate him with Mazza; yet the legal rule in this area reflects a balance of considerations, including the need for effective and expeditious trials. As the Tenth Circuit has recently stated, in the absence of \u201ca showing of clear prejudice, a joint trial of the defendants who are charged with a single conspiracy in the same indictment is favored where proof of the charge is predicated upon the same evidence and alleged acts.\u201d <em>United States v. Hack, </em>782 F.2d 862, 871 (10th Cir.1986); <em>accord United States v. Garcia, </em>785 F.2d 214, 220 (8th Cir.1986). In this case, the government relied mainly on a single body of evidence to make its case against both defendants; and, the court, through instructions, in effect told the jury not to consider the separate evidence of Mazza\u2019s past bad acts against DeCologero. Hence, with one exception, we find little more prejudice in this case \u201cthan that which necessarily inheres whenever multiple defendants ... are jointly tried.\u201d <em>United States v. Palow, 777 </em>F.2d at 56 (quoting <em>United States v. Greenleaf </em>692 F.2d 182, 187 (1st Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1069, 103 S.Ct. 1523, 75 L.Ed.2d 946 (1983)); <em>see United States v. Silvestri, </em>790 F.2d 186, 188-89 (1st Cir. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-6\">The one exception involves Mazza\u2019s outburst at trial during Barrasso\u2019s testimony. Mazza shouted: \u201cHe is lying. I got shot for you, you mother piece of shit. This is my pay back.\u201d We have previously said, however, that \u201c[i]f such conduct by a co-defendant on trial were to require a retrial it might never be possible to conclude a trial involving more than one defendant; it would provide an easy device for defendants to provoke mistrials whenever they might choose to do so.\u201d <em>United States v. Tashjian, </em>660 F.2d 829, 838 (1st Cir.) (quoting <em>United States v. Aviles, </em>274 F.2d 179, 193 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>362 U.S. 974, 80 S.Ct. 1057, 4 L.Ed.2d 1009 (1960)), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1102, 102 S.Ct. 681, 70 L.Ed.2d 646 (1981). Indeed, in this case, the district judge said he thought Mazza\u2019s outburst was premeditated. Of course, we have also said that a trial court, in such a situation, \u201cmust proceed with particular care, sensitive to the rights of the \u2018passive\u2019 defendant ],\u201d <em>Tashjian, </em>660 F.2d at 837-38; but DeCologero\u2019s counsel did not ask the court for any special jury instruction. This kind of outburst by a codefendant does not <em>automatically </em>entitle a codefendant to a new trial. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Smith, </em>578 F.2d 1227, 1235-36 (8th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Marshall, </em>458 F.2d 446, 451 (2d Cir.1972); <em>United States v. Bamberger, </em>456 F.2d 1119, 1128 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>406 U.S. 969, 92 S.Ct. 2424, 32 L.Ed.2d 668 (1972), 413 U.S. 919, 93 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>3067, 37 L.Ed.2d 1040 (1973). Nor do we believe that this incident, when taken together with DeCologero\u2019s other severance arguments, \u201cdeprived [him] of a fair trial\u201d or \u201cresulted] in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Albert, </em>773 F.2d 386, 388 (1st Cir.1985); <em>see United States v. Porter, </em>764 F.2d 1, 12 (1st Cir.1985). Hence, we see no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s decision not to sever.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-7\">The appellants object to a specific piece of Agent Doherty\u2019s testimony about the September 7 meeting in the parking lot of the Hilltop Steak House. The jury had previously heard that during the meeting Barrasso (pretending to be speaking with his \u201cFlorida source\u201d) had spoken by phone with Agent Vinton. According to Vinton, Barrasso at one point indicated there was \u201ca problem,\u201d and Vinton told him to leave. On cross-examination, Doherty was asked about the Hilltop meeting; then, on redirect, the prosecutor asked Doherty <em>why </em>Vinton told Barrasso to leave. Doherty answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1305-8\">Special Agent Vinton told [Barrasso] to leave the parking lot because he was not sure of what was going to happen. He feared that Mr. Barrasso might be thrown in the trunk of the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnK\">Appellants first claim that Doherty\u2019s answer reflects Vinton\u2019s knowledge of a part of the September 5 Heritage Flooring meeting from which Barrasso was absent (he had gone to the bathroom) and which, consequently, the government had intercepted illegally. The government stipulated before trial that it would not introduce this portion of the September 5 tape, in which the appellants had discussed the possibility of murdering or robbing Barrasso after the drug deal. But, the appellants say, Doherty\u2019s answer is a \u2018fruit\u2019 of that \u2018poisonous tree.\u2019 And the government\u2019s effort to elicit that answer, they add, amounted to prosecutorial misconduct warranting a new trial. <em>Compare, e.g., United States v. Westbo, </em>576 F.2d 285, 289-92 (10th Cir. 1978) (misconduct warranted new trial), <em>overruled in part en banc on other grounds, United States v. Hopkins, </em>744 F.2d 716 (10th Cir.1984), <em>with United States v. Liefer, </em>778 F.2d 1236, 1244-46 (7th Cir.1985) (misconduct did not warrant new trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-10\">The trial court, however, evidently did not accept the assertion that the question to Doherty reflected an effort by the prosecutor to put a \u2018poisoned fruit\u2019 before the jury. And, we are not persuaded otherwise. Vinton\u2019s fear for Barrasso might just as well have arisen from (1) his belief that the defendants were important narcotics dealers, (2) his \u2018expert\u2019 awareness of the risk of violence that often accompanies drug deals, (3) his having heard DeCologero tell Barrasso about his \u201carmy\u201d of protectors, (4) his concern that DeCologero or Mazza might detect Barrasso\u2019s body recorder, and (5) his uncertainty about what Barrasso meant when he said there was \u201ca problem,\u201d particularly in light of Barrasso\u2019s inability to elaborate with the appellants standing nearby. Given these possible reasons for Vinton\u2019s fear, we think it unlikely that Doherty\u2019s testimony led the jury to infer that Vinton\u2019s fear derived from some special information that Vinton knew about but the jury did not. And, given the unlikelihood of such an inference, we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion in determining that the prosecutor did not willfully attempt to plant that inference in the jurors\u2019 minds, or that any such attempt did not result in prejudice sufficient to warrant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-11\">For similar reasons, we reject the appellants\u2019 other grounds for attacking this testimony, namely, that it was not based on Doherty\u2019s personal knowledge, Fed.R.Evid. 602, or that it was hearsay (presumably in the sense that Doherty was relating Vinton\u2019s out-of-court explanation for telling Barrasso to leave). In light of the jury\u2019s likely inferences about the basis for Vinton\u2019s fear, <em>see supra </em>p. 1225, as well as the rest of the record, any error in admitting Vinton\u2019s answer was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-4\">The appellants object to the district court\u2019s having allowed the jury to use government-prepared transcripts as an aid to understanding the tape recordings admitted into evidence. They say that the trial judge should himself have verified the accuracy of the transcripts before allowing the jury to use them. The appellants, however, had copies of both the tapes and the transcripts several weeks before trial. They did not raise any objection to the use of the transcripts until the trial began, and even then, in response to a direct question from the court, they failed to identify any specific material inaccuracies. Rather, De-Cologero\u2019s counsel referred to \u201c[wjords here and there. You can\u2019t read the thing verbatim as you go along. It\u2019s highly prejudicial. Some of the tapes get clouded.\u201d The closest the appellants came to making a specific material objection was when they complained during trial about the sound quality of the September 5 tape. Yet, the court and this recording to have been intelligible the first time it was played; and, in any event, any initial problem with the tape\u2019s clarity was evidently cured when the prosecutor later replayed it after adjusting the treble control on the tape player.</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-5\">Consequently, the appellants could prevail on this point only were this circuit to create an absolute rule requiring district judges themselves to review transcripts whenever the parties do not stipulate to their accuracy \u2014 even in the absence of any showing of significant disparities between transcript and tape. The appellants find support for such an approach in <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>707 F.2d 872 (6th Cir. 1983), in which the Sixth Circuit suggested the trial court should \u201cmake an independent determination of accuracy by reading the transcript against the tape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 879. But this circuit has adopted no such rule. Rather, we agree with the Fourth Circuit that \u201cdefendants, on the strength simply of general objection to transcripts, [cannot] place the district court in the position of either having itself to undertake the laborious process of verifying the accuracy of the transcripts or having to prevent the government from using transcripts at all to aid in the presentation of tape recorded evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Collazo, </em>732 F.2d 1200, 1203 (4th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 777, 83 L.Ed.2d 773 (1985); <em>see also United States v. Slade, </em>627 F.2d 293, 302-03 (D.C.Cir.) (although parties did not stipulate to transcripts\u2019 accuracy, failure of trial court to review them <em>in camera </em>was not an abuse of discretion), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1034, 101 S.Ct. 608, 66 L.Ed.2d 495 (1980). Thus, we find no error in the district court\u2019s decision to allow the jury to use the transcripts as an aid to understanding the tapes. <em>See United States v. Nashawaty, </em>571 F.2d 71, 75 (1st Cir.1978) (permitting use of transcripts to aid jury lies within district court\u2019s sound discretion). <em>Compare United States v. Rengifo, </em>789 F.2d 975, 980-84 (1st Cir.1986) (discussing admissibility of transcripts <em>as </em>evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-9\">The appellants also claim that, at one point, the district court wrongly suggested to the jury that the transcripts were not simply aids to understanding the tapes, but were themselves evidence of what was said. <em>See United States v. Rickman, </em>600 F.2d 286, 294-95 (1st Cir.1979) (when transcripts are used as aids, court must tell jury that evidence consists of the tapes, not the transcripts). Specifically, when Mazza\u2019s counsel sought to replay a particular tape while cross-examining Barrasso, the judge said: \u201cThe tape is in evidence. The jury heard it. If you want to have the transcript, move the admission of the transcript. <em>That certainly is as good as the tape.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1306-10\">In context, however, the judge\u2019s remark does not mean what appellants suggest. The tape in question contained Barrasso\u2019s call to Mazza on August 13, in which Barrasso said, \u201cI want to talk to ya about something. May be comfortable for both of us.\u201d The jury had already heard this tape during Agenct Doherty\u2019s direct examination. In cross-examining Barrasso, Mazza\u2019s counsel wanted to suggest to the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>that Barrasso was confused, or lying, because he had previously told a <em>grand </em>jury that <em>Mazza </em>was the one who claimed to have had \u201csomething interesting\u201d for <em>Barrasso. </em>Earlier in the cross-examination, however, Barrasso had explained that there was no contradiction; he had indeed made the \u201csomething comfortable\u201d remark on August 13, while Mazza had made the \u201csomething interesting\u201d remark on a different date. Since Barrasso conceded he had made the \u201csomething comfortable\u201d remark on August 13, the district court evidently felt that to play the tape again would be a waste of time. And, he apparently believed no one would object should Mazza\u2019s counsel seek to use the transcript to show what had been said.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-5\">Regardless, in context the remark could not have led the jury to think it was being told the transcripts were evidence just like the tapes, for the judge had instructed the jury at least four times that they were not. For example, when the prosecution was about to play the first tape, the court told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-6\">Now, you are going to hear conversations which were recorded in this case. This is proper evidence just like all the evidence I admit. This is proper evidence for you to consider. In order to help you further, I\u2019m going to allow a transcript to be furnished to you. The transcript is merely to help you understand what is said on the tape. But if you believe that transcript says something different from what you hear on the tape, remember, it is the tape that is the evidence and what counts. The tapes are the evidence, not the transcripts. Any variation between the two, you must be guided solely by the tape and not by the transcripts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1307-7\">In light of the clarity of this instruction and its repetition, we see no real possibility that the isolated remark quoted by the appellants could have misled the jury or prejudiced the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-8\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-9\">The appellants argue that the court did not instruct the jury that it had to find Mazza and DeCologero had conspired <em>with each other; </em>instead, they say, the jury might have found that each had conspired separately with Barrasso. The relevant part of the instructions reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1307-11\">[The government] must prove ... beyond a reasonable doubt ... that there was an agreement or conspiracy ... between the defendants to possess a controlled substance with intent to distribute____ <em>A conspiracy ... is a combination of [sic] an agreement of two or more persons to join together to attempt to accomplish an unlawful </em>purpose____ <em>It takes at least two. It\u2019s a kind of partnership for a criminal purpose in which each member becomes the agent of every other member. The essence of the offense is the combination or mutual agreement by two or more people to disobey or disregard the </em>law____ So what the evidence must show in the case ... is that the defendants in some way, either positively or passively, came to a mutual understanding to possess cocaine with intent to distribute it; and they willfully became members of that conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1307-16\">The appellants focus on the underscored statements, which do not refer to the defendants. The <em>other </em>words in the instruction, however, specifically say the government had to show that \u201cthere was an agreement or conspiracy ... <em>between the defendants \u201d </em>and that \u201cthe <em>defendants </em>came to a <em>mutual </em>understanding to possess cocaine.\u201d Thus, the instruction, read as a whole, was adequate, and the court acted lawfully in refusing to give a further instruction. <em>See United States v. Johnston, </em>784 F.2d 416, 426 (1st Cir.1986) (district court need not give defendant\u2019s requested instructions as long as court\u2019s own instructions are \u201ccorrect and cover the issues\u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Fusaro, </em>708 F.2d 17, 22 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1007, 104 S.Ct. 524, 78 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-17\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b1307-18\">Mazza challenges what he calls the district court\u2019s \u201crefusal\u201d to repeat its charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>to the jury. After the jury had deliberated for two hours, it asked to \u201crehear the judge\u2019s instructions.\u201d After conferring with all counsel, the judge told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2B\">... I gave you those instructions last night, within the past 24 hours, and they took about a half hour to give you. What you\u2019ve said to me is you want to rehear the instructions. Well, perhaps you can focus on some part of those instructions that bother you the most or about which you are unclear or, to put it better, I was unclear in giving them to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-4\">If you want to rehear them over again, I will, of course, honor that request. I think you should give it further consideration and maybe focus in on a particular part of the instruction that bothers you the most. To hear the Judge\u2019s instructions mean for me to repeat word for word what I told you yesterday, some of which I\u2019m sure ... perhaps you do not require.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1308-5\">So would you please resume your deliberations and try to be more specific in your requests to the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1308-6\">This does not amount to a \u201crefusal\u201d to instruct the jury; Mazza did not object to it at trial; and we see no \u201cplain error,\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-7\">G</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-8\">The appellants say the district court unreasonably restricted their efforts to cross-examine Barrasso. In our review of the record, we have paid particular attention to the more than 250 pages of transcript covering the cross-examination of Barrasso. We have found that the court basically tried to restrict what it saw as repetitive, argumentative, and immaterial questions. In our view, the defendants had an adequate opportunity to cross-examine and, in particular, to impeach Barrasso, and the court\u2019s efforts to control the cross-examination fell well within its lawful powers. <em>See United States v. Silvestri, </em>790 F.2d 186, 190 (1st Cir.1986) (noting trial court\u2019s broad discretion in this area); <em>United States v. Keithan, </em>751 F.2d 9,11-12 (1st Cir.1984); <em>United States v. Fortes, </em>619 F.2d 108, 118 (1st Cir.1980) (\u201cThe court need not permit unending excursions into each and every matter touching upon veracity if a reasonably complete picture has already been developed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-10\">H</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-11\">Finally, Mazza makes a technical argument that we should vacate his conviction because, in his view, he was unlawfully transferred back and forth between state and federal custody before his federal trial, in violation of article IV(e) of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, 18 U.S.C. app. Mazza did not raise this argument before or during trial, and he offers no explanation for the delay; we therefore consider the argument waived on this appeal. <em>United States v.
