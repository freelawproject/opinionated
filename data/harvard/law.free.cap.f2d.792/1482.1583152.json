Williams appeals <em>pro se </em>from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Edward Apffels Coffee Company. He contends that the district court erred in finding that: (1) no genuine issue of material fact remained as to whether Apffels had discriminated against Williams on the basis of race and age; (2) Williams had not alleged sufficient facts to state a cause of action under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act; and (3) Williams had not alleged sufficient facts to support his action in tort for fraud and deceit. We find Williams\u2019 contentions are correct. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-19\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-20\">Between 1979 and 1981, Arnold B. Williams, an elderly black male, worked intermittently, for a total of twenty-two months, as a temporary or \u201ccasual\u201d employee of the Edward Apffels Coffee Company (Apffels). Williams made oral requests to be considered for available permanent jobs on at least three occasions, and Apffels acknowledges that it regarded Williams as an applicant. In each case, Apffels hired someone other than Williams for the permanent position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-21\">Williams\u2019 last request for permanent employment occurred when he was hired to fill in for a regular employee who was dying of cancer. Williams contends that when J.C. Hill, the plant foreman, hired Williams, Hill told Williams he would eventually be hired on a permanent basis. Williams also states that Hill demanded a kickback from Williams in exchange for the promise of permanent employment. After the regular employee died, Apffels hired someone other than Williams as a permanent replacement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-22\">Williams filed a complaint against Apffels with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH), alleging discrimination on the basis of race and age. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), under its work-sharing agreement with the DFEH, investigated Williams\u2019 complaint, and found insufficient evidence to sustain the discrimination charge. The DFEH then terminated its involvement with Williams\u2019 case, and referred the complaint to the EEOC, which in turn terminated its involvement in the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1484\">*1484</page-number>and issued Williams a \u201cNotice of Right to Sue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-4\">Williams filed a complaint in the district court against Apffels, J.C. Hill, and Bill Berry (Apffels\u2019 former plant supervisor), alleging: (1) employment discrimination based on race and age, in violation of both 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 and Cal.Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 12920; and (2) fraud and deceit, under California tort law. Williams\u2019 subsequent motion for summary judgment was denied. Defendants then filed their own motion for summary judgment, and the district court, adopting the Magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation, granted the motion for summary judgment. Williams appeals <em>pro se </em>from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AWeM\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-8\">A grant of summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo. Franklin v. Murphy, </em>745 F.2d 1221, 1235 (9th Cir.1984). An appellate court\u2019s review is governed by the same standard used by the trial court under Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. v. MCA, </em>715 F.2d 1327, 1328 (9th Cir.1983). This court must first determine whether the complaint adequately states a claim upon which relief can be granted. In making that determination, the court must construe liberally the allegations of a <em>pro se </em>complainant. <em>Haines v. Kemer, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 595-96, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972); <em>Christensen v. C.I.R., </em>786 F.2d 1382, 1384 (9th Cir.1986); <em>Franklin, </em>745 F.2d at 1235. If the complainant states a proper claim, the court must then determine whether, on the basis of the pleadings and affidavits, and viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, there is any genuine issue of material fact and whether the substantive law was correctly applied. <em>Amaro v. Continental Can Co., </em>724 F.2d 747, 749 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-10\">\n<em>B. Williams\u2019 Federal Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-11\">Williams, citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, alleges that Apffels discriminated against him on the basis of race and age. Section 1981, however, redresses only discrimination based on race. <em>Lowe v. City of Monrovia, </em>775 F.2d 998, 1010 (9th Cir.1986). In the federal system, age discrimination is covered under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621-634 (1982 &amp; Supp.II 1984). Construing Williams\u2019 <em>pro se </em>complaint liberally, we view it as including a claim under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1) (the ADEA statute prohibiting employers from failing to hire an individual because of the individual\u2019s age).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1558-12\">Williams claims disparate treatment rather than disparate impact. Disparate treatment claims under \u00a7 1981 and the ADEA are analyzed according to the same standard used to analyze disparate treatment claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17 (1982). <em>Gay v. Waiters\u2019 and Dairy Lunehmen\u2019s Union, Local No. 30, </em>694 F.2d 531, 537 (9th Cir.1982) (Section 1981); <em>Sutton v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>646 F.2d 407, 411 (9th Cir.1981) (ADEA). The Title VII analysis follows three basic steps:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1558-13\">[A] plaintiff must first establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. If the plaintiff establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case, the burden then shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision. Then, in order to prevail, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the employer\u2019s alleged reason for the adverse employment is a pretext for another motive which is discriminatory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1558-14\"><em>Lowe, </em>775 F.2d at 1004-05 (citing <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-05, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824-26, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1485\">*1485</page-number>\n<em>1. Williams\u2019 Prima Facie Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-4\">The plaintiff in a disparate treatment case must offer evidence that \u201cgive[s] rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.\u201d <em>Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1094, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). A common way to establish this inference is to show that the four requirements set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>are met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1559-5\">1. that the plaintiff belongs to a class protected by Title VII;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1559-6\">2. that the plaintiff applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1559-7\">3. that, despite being qualified, the plaintiff was rejected; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1559-8\">4. that, after the plaintiffs rejection, the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applications from persons of comparable qualifications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1559-9\"><em>See McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. at 1824. Satisfaction of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>criteria is sufficient to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case. <em>Lowe, </em>775 F.2d at 1005; <em>Fumco Construction Corp. v. Waters, </em>438 U.S. 567, 575, 98 S.Ct. 2943, 2948-49, 57 L.Ed.2d 957 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-10\">Williams easily satisfies three of the four <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>requirements. First, as a black person over forty, he belongs to classes protected by Title VII and the ADEA. Second, he applied to Apffels for available permanent jobs as a \u201cpacker\u201d and as a \u201cmechanic.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Apffels concedes that Williams was qualified as a packer<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. It appears that Williams also was qualified for the mechanic\u2019s job.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Third, despite being qualified, Williams was rejected for both jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-15\">The fourth <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>requirement is more troublesome, but Williams has satisfied it also. The Magistrate concluded that Williams was simply part of a pool of applicants from which Apffels chose a permanent employee, and that therefore the job did not \u201cremain open\u201d after Williams\u2019 rejection. However, the Supreme Court did not intend that the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>requirements be read inflexibly; indeed, it has gone so far as to remark that the requirements are \u201cnot necessarily applicable in every respect to differing factual situations.\u201d <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802 n. 13, 93 S.Ct. at 1824 n. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-16\">In a factual situation similar to the one here, the Court demonstrated the flexibility of the fourth requirement. Quoting the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>language just cited, the Court in <em>Burdine </em>held that a Title VII plaintiff was able to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case by showing that she was a qualified applicant who sought an available position, even though the position was filled by a man at the moment of her rejection. <em>See </em>450 U.S. at 254 n. 6, 101 S.Ct. at 1094 n. 6. Williams, then, does not have to show that any discrete period of time elapsed between the moment he was rejected and the moment someone else was hired; it is enough, for purposes of the fourth <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>requirement, that the position remained open after the qualified candidate applied for the job, and that someone else was ultimately selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-17\">Williams has shown that: (1) the packer\u2019s job was declared open on June 26,1981, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1486\">*1486</page-number>not filled until August 10, 1981; and (2) he was considered an applicant for the job during that entire period. Thus, under <em>Burdine, </em>Williams has satisfied the fourth <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>requirement, and established a <em>prima facie </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1560-4\">\n<em>2. Apffels\u2019 Articulated Nondiscriminatory Reason For Not Hiring Williams</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1560-6\">Since Williams has established a <em>prima facie </em>case, the burden shifts to Apffels to \u201crebut the presumption of discrimination by producing evidence that [Williams] was rejected, or someone else was preferred, for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason.\u201d <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 254, 101 S.Ct. at 1094. However, it is only the burden of production that shifts. The burden of persuasion never shifts from the plaintiff. Therefore, Apffels need not <em>persuade </em>the court that it was actually motivated by the proferred reason: \u201cIt is sufficient if the defendant\u2019s evidence raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 254-55, 101 S.Ct. at 1094.</p>\n<p id=\"b1560-7\">Apffels states that it hired someone other than Williams as a packer because the other candidate was \u201cmore qualified,\u201d and that it did not hire Williams as a mechanic because of Williams\u2019 \u201clack of prior job related requirements [sic].\u201d These reasons raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether Apffels discriminated against Williams; thus, Apffels has met its burden of production under the second stage of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>disparate treatment analysis. However, this \u201cserves only to shift the burden back to the plaintiff to raise a genuine factual question as to whether the proffered reason is pretextual.\u201d <em>Lowe, </em>775 F.2d at 1008.</p>\n<p id=\"b1560-8\">\n<em>3. Williams\u2019 Evidence of Apffels\u2019 Pretext</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1560-9\">Williams is not required to offer additional evidence, beyond that offered to establish his <em>prima facie </em>case, in order to meet his burden at this stage. <em>Lowe, </em>775 F.2d at 1008. He has, however, offered copies of: (1) the employment applications submitted to Apffels by the five people Apffels hired over him; and (2) Apffels\u2019 salary records for those five employees.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvV\">Once a <em>prima facie </em>case is established either by the introduction of actual evidence or reliance on the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>presumption, summary judgment for the defendant will ordinarily not be appropriate on any ground relating to the merits because the crux of a Title VII dispute is the \u201celusive factual question of intentional discrimination,\u201d <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 255 n. 8 [101 S.Ct. at 1094 n. 8] ... Moreover, when a plaintiff has established a <em>prima facie </em>inference of disparate treatment through direct or circumstantial evidence of discriminatory intent, he will necessarily have raised a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the legitimacy or bona fides of the employer\u2019s articulated reason for its employment decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuZ\"><em>Lowe, </em>775 F.2d at 1009.</p>\n<p id=\"b1560-11\">The documents Williams has introduced reveal a great deal of specific factual information about the five individuals Apffels hired over Williams, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1560-12\">1. <em>J.L. </em>Hill: 20 years old; Caucasian; no work experience; son of J.C. Hill, the shop foreman who Williams contends demanded a kickback in exchange for a permanent job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1560-13\">2. <em>Javier Quezeda: </em>19 years old; Hispanic; one previous job as a cabinet maker; relative of Manny Lomas, an Apffels employee (step-son, according to Williams);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1560-14\">3. <em>Robert McWhorter: </em>24 years old; Caucasian; one previous job in general construction, and two installing hot tubs; friend of J.C. and J.L. Hill (according to Williams);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1560-15\">4. <em>Richard Bishop : </em>40 years old; Caucasian; previous experience in maintenance and installing insulation; relative of Fran Bonn, an Apffels employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1560-16\">5. <em>Luis Berumer: </em>33 years old; Hispanic; five years\u2019 experience in shipping and receiving for a food producer; friend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1487\">*1487</page-number>of Javier Quezeda and Manny Lomas (according to Williams).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1561-5\">Williams contends that this information raises genuine factual questions as to whether Apffels\u2019 proffered reason for not hiring Williams is pretextual. We agree. Certainly, J.L. Hill\u2019s total lack of experience, and the limited experience of Quezeda and McWhorter, raise some question about whether Apffels\u2019 hiring decisions were, as Apffels asserts, \u201cmade on merit alone.\u201d The fact that three of the five people hired were relatives of Apffels employees raises the same question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-6\">Viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to Williams, and resolving all inferences in his favor, we find that Williams\u2019 considerable factual evidence raises \u201can indication of discriminatory motive ... [sufficient] to raise a question that can only be resolved by a factfinder.\u201d <em>Lowe, </em>775 F.2d at 1009. By contrast, Apffels has produced scant evidence in support of its motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, we find that the district court should not have granted summary judgment to Apffels with regard to Williams\u2019 race and age claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-7\">\n<em>C. Williams\u2019 Claim Under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-8\">In support of his state discrimination claim, Williams cites CaLGov\u2019t Code \u00a7 12920. This section states California\u2019s public policy against discrimination, as embodied in the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), Cal.Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7\u00a7 12900-12906 (West 1980 &amp; Supp.1983). Because Williams appeals <em>pro se, </em>we construe his complaint as including claims under Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7\u00a7 12940 and 12941 (the FEHA provisions prohibiting employment discrimination based, respectively, on race and age).</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-9\">The report and recommendation of the United States Magistrate, which the district court adopted, dismissed Williams\u2019 FEHA claim with little discussion. Referring to Williams\u2019 citation of \u00a7 12920, the report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1561-10\">This California statute appears to be a statement of state public policy____ However, the relevancy of this statute to the case presented by the plaintiff is unclear. The statute ... is a clear preface to the institution of the State of California\u2019s Fair Employment and Housing Commission____ <em>Plaintiff has not, however, made reference to seeking administrative relief from this California commission.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1561-14\">Report and Recommendation of the Magistrate at 6 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-15\">The Magistrate evidently made no attempt to construe Williams\u2019 claim liberally in order to determine the particular FEHA provisions under which Williams\u2019 claim should have been brought. Further, the Magistrate was incorrect in stating that Williams had not made reference to seeking administrative relief from the DFEH. In his original complaint, Williams stated that he had filed a complaint with the DFEH, and that the DFEH, after investigating, terminated its involvement with Williams\u2019 case and issued a right-to-sue letter. Williams included two letters from the DFEH to support his statement. Thus, the district court never directly considered the adequacy of Williams\u2019 FEHA claim; it simply adopted the Magistrate\u2019s incorrect conclusion that, because Williams had not sought relief from the DFEH, his references to the FEHA were unimportant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-16\">In order to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of disparate treatment under the FEHA, the plaintiff</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1561-17\">must first prove by a preponderance of the evidence (1) that the complainant is within the group of people for whose benefit the statute was enacted; (2) that the complainant suffered an adverse employment decision; and (3) that a causal connection exists between the complainant\u2019s protected status and the adverse action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1561-18\"><em>DFEH v. Ambylou Enterprises, Inc., </em>FEHC Dec. No. 82-06, at 5 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1561-19\">Williams is clearly within a protected group and has suffered an adverse employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1488\">*1488</page-number>ment decision. The Fair Employment and Housing Commission (FEHC) has stated that the \u201ccausal connection\u201d requirement can be satisfied by establishing an inference of discrimination, as under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>standards, or by other competent evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 5-6. As discussed above, Williams has satisfied the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>standards, and has established facts that create an inference of discrimination; he has therefore established the \u201ccausal connection\u201d required for a <em>prima facie </em>case under the FEHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-4\">For the reasons discussed <em>supra, </em>in relation to Williams\u2019 federal claims, we find that a genuine issue of material fact remains regarding Williams\u2019 claim under the FEHA. Accordingly, we find that the district court should not have granted summary judgment to Apffels with regard to Williams\u2019 FEHA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-5\">\n<em>D. Williams\u2019 Tort Claim for Fraud and Deceit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-6\">Williams\u2019 state tort action for fraud and deceit is based on his allegation that J.C. Hill, Apffels' shop foreman, promised Williams a permanent job in exchange for a kickback. Actual fraud is defined in Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1572; deceit is defined in nearly identical language in Cal.Civ.Code \u00a7\u00a7 1709 and 1710. Of the four kinds of fraud and deceit which are similarly defined by these statutes, two are applicable to Williams\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-7\">The first is commonly called \u201cintentional misrepresentation\u201d: \u201c[t]he suggestion, as a fact, of that which is not true, by one who does not believe it to be true.\u201d Cal.Civ. Code \u00a7\u00a7 1572(1), 1710(1). The second is commonly called \u201cfalse promise\u201d: \u201c[a] promise, made without any intention of performing it.\u201d Cal.Civ.Code \u00a7\u00a7 1572(4), 1710(4). A third applicable type of fraud, defined only in Cal.Civ.Code \u00a7 1572(5), includes \u201c[a]ny other act fitted to deceive.\u201d Under California law,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1562-9\">[t]he elements of fraud, which give rise to the tort action for deceit, are (1) misrepresentation (false representation, concealment or nondisclosure); (2) knowledge of falsity (or \u201cscienter\u201d); (3) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (4) justifiable reliance; and (5) resulting damage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1562-11\">[Although the mere failure to perform a promise is not a tort, ... a statement of what the defendant or some third person <em>intends to do </em>relates to an existing state of mind, and is a representation of <em>fact </em>____ It is on this theory that a promise made without any intention to perform may constitute fraud: A promise to do something necessarily implies the <em>intention to perform, </em>and, where such intention is absent, there is an implied misrepresentation of fact, which is actionable fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1562-14\">4 B.E. Witkin, <em>Summary of California Law </em>\u00a7\u00a7 446, 453 (8th ed. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-15\">The United States Magistrate found that Williams had failed to state a tort claim because he had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1562-16\">neither pleaded <em>nor alleged </em>facts which would indicate that a promise was made. Plaintiff has not shown an actual agreement between defendant and plaintiff, <em>nor has plaintiff shown any subsequent conduct which would lead to an inference that such a promise of future employment was ever made.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1562-17\">Report and Recommendation of the Magistrate at 7-8 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1562-18\">The Magistrate\u2019s findings are incorrect. First, Williams has repeatedly alleged that a promise was made. Second, Williams has submitted evidence which would lead to an inference that the promise was made. Williams submitted the sworn affidavit of Art Ordonez, who worked in a liquor store patronized by both Williams and J.C. Hill. Ordonez stated that every Friday, which was Apffels\u2019 payday, (1) Williams came into the liquor store and purchased two fifths of Early Times whiskey; (2) Williams left the bottles with Ordonez, with instructions to give them to J.C. Hill; and (3) Ordonez kept the bottles on a shelf below the counter, and personally gave them to J.C. Hill when Hill came in and asked for them. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1489\">*1489</page-number>Viewed in the light most favorable to Williams, this evidence tends to support his allegation of a kickback arrangement between himself and J.C. Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b1563-4\">Williams has alleged facts which, if true, state an adequate claim for fraud and deceit. Hill\u2019s promise may well have been made \u201cwithout any intention of performing it.\u201d If so, Hill obviously had knowledge of the statement\u2019s falsity. The only logical motive for such a promise would be to induce Williams\u2019 reliance, and Williams would be justified in relying on a promise made by Apffels\u2019 shop foreman. Williams has also clearly suffered a loss of earnings as a result of not being hired for the permanent position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1563-5\">The Magistrate concluded that Williams, \u201c[i]n response to the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, ... set forth additional allegations, none of which found support in the affidavits.\u201d Report and Recommendation of the Magistrate at 8. This conclusion overlooks the affidavit of Art Ordonez, which, as discussed above, tends to support Williams\u2019 allegation of a kickback agreement between himself and J.C. Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b1563-6\">Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Williams, we conclude that a genuine issue of fact remains regarding the existence of a fraudulent promise of employment. Accordingly, the district court should not have granted summary judgment to Apffels with regard to Williams\u2019 tort claim for fraud and deceit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1563-7\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1558-9\">. Section 623(a)(1) makes it unlawful for an employer \u201cto fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s age.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1559-11\">. The second <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>requirement \"relates only to whether there was an opening either when the plaintiff applied or at any time [his] application was pending.\u201d <em>Lowe, </em>775 F.2d at 1006.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1559-12\">. Williams had performed the job for six months before the permanent position became available.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1559-13\">. Apffels told the DFEH that the mechanic\u2019s job required \"some mechanical maintenance background and experience (though such knowledge and experience must [sic] not be specifically related to the area of coffee production), and also ... a basic understanding of electrical circuitry along with some prior experience in supervisory responsibilities.\u201d No preexisting statement of qualifications for the job was entered into evidence. Williams submitted evidence that he was qualified as a journeyman shipfitter and certified welder, and that he was trained to read blueprints and work in aircraft structure assembly. Williams also contends that during his period of employment as a packer, he performed a considerable amount of mechanical work at the Apffels plant. Apffels denies this contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
