Tenneco filed various counterclaims, including a claim for lost profits arising out of Kern Oil\u2019s failure to supply crude oil to Tenneco. In No. 84-6268, Tenneco challenges the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of Kern Oil on the restitution claim. In No. 84-6482, Tenneco seeks reversal of the district court\u2019s order granting attorneys\u2019 fees to Kern Oil. In No. 84-6367, Tenneco challenges the dismissal of the lost profits counterclaim for lack of prosecution. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-21\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-22\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-23\">Kern Oil is a general partnership doing business in California.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Tenneco is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Texas. On May 19, 1977, Tenneco entered into a contract to sell crude oil to Kern Oil. Tenneco agreed to sell its production from twenty-four specified leases to Kern Oil. The contract contained the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1461-24\">Crude oil from the above leases will be balanced against crude oil sold to Tenneco by [Kern Oil] up to 3,000 barrels per day. All stripper crude oil from the above leases and the Rosecrans Field ... will be sold at the appropriate lower tier price. Each month, enough oil from the Yowlumne Field will be sold at the lower tier price to make the total stripper and Yowlumne crude oil sold at the lower tier price equal to 3,000 barrels per day. <em>The remaining barrels produced from the Yowlumne Field will be sold at the upper tier price, and the non-stripper leases will be sold at the appropriate lower or upper tier prices.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1382\">*1382</page-number>(emphasis added). The primary issue in this case is the interpretation of those terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-4\">In the mid-1970s, the Federal Energy Administration adopted a complex system to regulate the price of domestic crude oil. The FEA divided crude oil into three classes: \u201cold,\u201d \u201cnew,\u201d and \u201cstripper well.\u201d 10 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 212.54, 212.72 (1977). \u201cOld\u201d crude oil of a particular grade could not be sold for a price higher than the \u201clower tier ceiling price\u201d for that grade. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 212.-73(a). \u201cNew\u201d crude oil of a particular grade could not be sold for a price higher than the \u201cupper tier ceiling price\u201d for that grade. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 212.74(a). \u201cStripper well\u201d crude oil could be sold at any price. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 212.54(aHb).</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-5\">By 1980, this system had become more complicated. As a part of the Carter Administration\u2019s effort to deregulate crude oil, the Department of Energy created several new classes of crude oil that could be sold at market price. One such class was \u201cmarket level new\u201d crude oil. The regulation stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-6\">\u201cMarket level new crude oil\u201d means, with respect to a particular property during a particular month, the product of the market level factor for that month and the volume of new crude oil produced and sold from that property during that month. The market level factor for January 1980 shall be four and sixtenths percent (4.6%) and shall be increased by four and six-tenths percent (4.6%) in each succeeding month.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1462-7\">10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.72 (1980). \u201cMarket level new\u201d crude oil is also referred to as \u201cupper-tier released\u201d crude oil. Under this system, all \u201cnew\u201d crude oil would be deregulated in twenty-two months. The DOE also created two new classes of deregulated crude oil: \u201cnewly discovered\u201d crude oil, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 212.79, and \u201ctertiary incentive\u201d crude oil, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 212.78(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-9\">After Kern Oil and Tenneco entered into the contract, Tenneco consistently charged Kern Oil the posted upper tier price for \u201cnew\u201d crude oil. At times, the posted upper tier price was less than the upper tier ceiling price. Accordingly, much of the crude oil was sold at prices below the ceiling price.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-10\">Beginning with the invoices for oil delivered in January 1980, Tenneco charged Kern Oil uncontrolled prices for a portion of the oil delivered pursuant to the contract. Tenneco\u2019s invoices described this crude oil as \u201cnewly discovered\u201d or \u201cupper-tier released.\u201d Kern Oil\u2019s accounting staff was not aware of the price limitation in the contract and thus paid the invoices without question. Kern Oil\u2019s management did not learn of the discrepancy until December 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-11\">On December 30, 1980, Kern Oil notified Tenneco of the alleged overpayments and informed Tenneco that Kern Oil would withhold payment on outstanding Tenneco invoices to offset the overpayments. On February 13, 1981, Kern\u2019s attorneys sent a letter to Tenneco demanding reimbursement for the alleged overpayments. Kern Oil subsequently filed the present action to obtain restitution of the alleged over-payments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Tenneco\u2019s answer contained six counterclaims, two of which were settled before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-12\">A. <em>Nos. 84-6268 and 84-6482</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1462-13\">The case was initially set before Judge Marshall. On March 20, 1984, Judge Mar-shall transferred the case to Judge Real for trial. The case was tried in June 1984. On July 31, 1984, Judge Real entered judgment for Kern Oil. Kern Oil received damages in the sum of $1,901,430.72, plus interest, costs, and attorneys\u2019 fees. On October 4, 1984, the attorneys\u2019 fee award was fixed at $516,863.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1383\">*1383</page-number>B. <em>No. 84-6367</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1463-5\">Tenneco\u2019s fourth counterclaim (\u201cCount IV\u201d) sought damages for lost profits. On February 16, 1984, Judge Marshall granted Kern Oil\u2019s motion for a partial summary judgment and dismissed Count IV. On March 16, 1984, Tenneco filed a motion for reconsideration. After the rest of the case had been transferred to Judge Real, Tenneco filed a motion for voluntary dismissal without prejudice. Tenneco sought the voluntary dismissal so that it could pursue its claim in a related action before Judge Waters. While Judge Marshall considered these motions, the rest of the case was tried before Judge Real.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-6\">On June 14, 1984, Judge Marshall granted the motion for reconsideration and vacated the summary judgment. The parties did not become aware of that decision until late June. On August 3, Judge Marshall denied the motion for voluntary dismissal. Judge Real set a trial date of August 20. On August 13, Tenneco renewed its motion for voluntary dismissal without prejudice. On August 20, Judge Real denied the motion and stated that the trial would commence on August 22. Tenneco then unsuccessfully sought an emergency stay from this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-7\">On the morning of August 22, the parties appeared before Judge Real. After again denying Tenneco\u2019s request for a voluntary dismissal without prejudice, Judge Real requested Tenneco\u2019s attorney to proceed with his opening statement. When the attorney refused to proceed, Judge Real dismissed Count IV with prejudice under Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-9\">\n<em>The Interpretation of the Contract</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AY3\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"A70L\">We have stated the appropriate standard of review for the interpretation of a contract as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1463-10\">When an appellate court restricts its review of the trial court\u2019s interpretation of a contract to an analysis of the language used in the contract, the issue of interpretation is a matter of law and freely reviewable____ When the interpretation includes a review of factual circumstances surrounding the contract, the principles of contract interpretation applied to those facts present issues of law which this court can freely review. When the inquiry extends beyond the words of the contract and focuses on related facts, however, the trial court\u2019s consideration of extrinsic evidence is entitled to great deference and its interpretation of the contract will not be reversed unless it is clearly erroneous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1463-13\"><em>In re U.S. Financial Securities Litigation, </em>729 F.2d 628, 631-32 (9th Cir.1984) (citations omitted). We review the district court\u2019s decisions regarding the admissibility of evidence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Mitchell v. Keith, </em>752 F.2d 385, 392 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 3502, 87 L.Ed.2d 633 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-16\">B. <em>The Meaning of \u201cUpper Tier Price\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1463-17\">Contrary to Tenneco\u2019s assertions, the record reveals that the meaning of the term \u201cupper tier price\u201d was virtually undisputed. The \u201cupper tier price\u201d was the price charged for crude oil that was subject to the upper tier ceiling price. The upper tier price was less than or equal to the upper tier ceiling price, depending on market conditions. Crude oil that was not subject to the upper tier ceiling price was sold at the \u201clower tier price\u201d or the \u201cuncontrolled price,\u201d depending on the type of oil. \u201cNew\u201d crude oil that was not subject to the upper tier ceiling price was sold at the \u201cuncontrolled price.\u201d Crude oil from a particular field would normally have two or three different prices because the oil would be subject to different regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-18\">The district court made the following finding of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1463-19\">The term \u201cupper-tier price,\u201d as used in the May 19, 1977 agreement, is unambiguous. Upper-tier ceiling prices are specific ceiling prices established by DOE regulations and computed by a formula set forth in those regulations. 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 212.74(b) (1977 and 1980). Posted up<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1384\">*1384</page-number>per-tier prices are prices at or below upper-tier ceiling prices, published in price bulletins issued by major oil companies. The term \u201cupper-tier price\u201d does not mean uncontrolled market prices posted for crude oil released by the government from price controls.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1464-4\">The district court\u2019s finding was correct.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1464-5\">C. <em>Extrinsic Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1464-6\">The district court found that the contract was intended to be \u201ca final and complete expression\u201d of the parties\u2019 agreement. As a result, section 2-202 of the Uniform Commercial Code governs the interpretation of the agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1464-7\">Terms ... which are ... set forth in writing intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement with respect to such terms as are included therein may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement but may be explained or supplemented</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1464-8\">(a) by course of dealing or usage of trade (Section 1-205) or by course of performance (Section 2-208); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1464-9\">(b) by evidence of consistent additional terms unless the court finds the writing to have been intended also as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1464-13\">Tex.Bus. &amp; Com.Code Ann. \u00a7 2.202. Tenneco does not contend that the record reflects the existence of \u201cconsistent additional terms\u201d within the meaning of section 2-202(b). Instead, Tenneco argues that the record reveals the existence of a course of dealing and a course of performance contrary to the district court\u2019s findings. Section 2-208(2) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1464-14\">The express terms of the agreement and any ... course of performance, as well as any course of dealing and usage of trade, shall be construed whenever reasonable as consistent with each other; but when such construction is unreasonable, express terms shall control course of performance and course of performance shall control both course of dealing and usage of trade____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1464-16\">Tex.Bus. &amp; Com.Code Ann. \u00a7 2.208(b). Section 2-208(2) is liberally applied to allow the admission of extrinsic evidence that is reasonably consistent with the express terms of the contract. <em>Modine Manufacturing Co. v. North East Independent School District, </em>503 S.W.2d 833, 840 (Tex. Civ.App.1973); <em>see Nanakuli Paving &amp; Rock Co. v. Shell Oil Co., </em>664 F.2d 772, 794-805 (9th Cir.1981) (applying Hawaii law); Hawkland, <em>Sales Contract Terms Under the UCC, </em>17 UCC L.J. 195, 208-17 (1985).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1385\">*1385</page-number>To avoid the prohibition contained in section 2-208(2), Tenneco must show that the extrinsic evidence \u201cexplains\u201d or \u201csupplements\u201d the express terms of the contract. The extrinsic evidence cited by Tenneco does not show that \u201cupper tier price\u201d has a meaning different from the meaning found by the district court. As a result, the extrinsic evidence does not \u201cexplain\u201d that term. The remaining inquiry is whether the extrinsic evidence \u201csupplements\u201d the contract. To be admissible under that theory, the extrinsic evidence must tend to show that the parties intended for Tenneco to charge the highest available market price without the need to negotiate with Kern Oil in the event of deregulation. <em>See Columbia Nitrogen Corp. v. Royster Co., </em>451 F.2d 3, 7-10 (4th Cir.1971) (requiring the admission of evidence showing that, in the fertilizer industry, quantity terms in contracts are \u201cmere projections\u201d) (applying Virginia law); Duesenberg, <em>Sales, Bulk Transfers, and Documents of Title, </em>38 Bus.Law. 1109, 1112-14 (1983). A careful review of the record reveals that Tenneco\u2019s extrinsic evidence did not meet that requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-5\">Initially, Tenneco argues that the district court improperly excluded evidence relating to the prior course of dealings between Tenneco and Kern Oil. In fact, the evidence that was excluded related to the negotiation of a single prior contract. \u201c[A] single transaction cannot contitute a course of dealing.\u201d <em>International Therapeutics, Inc. v. McGraw-Edison Co., </em>721 F.2d 488, 491 (5th Cir.1983) (applying Texas law); <em>see </em>U.C.C. \u00a7 2-208 comment 4 (noting that a \u201csingle occasion of conduct\u201d does not establish a course of performance). Moreover, Tenneco\u2019s witnesses indicated that the 1977 contract fully reflected the parties\u2019 agreement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court properly excluded the evidence relating to the prior transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-11\">Tenneco also asserts that the record shows four occasions on which Tenneco sold crude oil to Kern Oil at prices higher than those authorized by the contract. Tenneco claims that this evidence establishes a course of performance. In fact, the record reveals that each price variation was negotiated.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, the four occasions cited by Tenneco do not establish a course of performance contrary to the district court\u2019s findings. <em>See Jon-T Chemicals, Inc. v. Freeport Chemical Co., </em>704 F.2d 1412,1416 n. 5 (5th Cir.1983) (applying Texas law).</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-12\">Finally, Tenneco argues that Kern Oil\u2019s payment of the invoices in 1980 establishes a course of performance. To the extent that Kern Oil acted under a mistake of fact, however, its payment of the invoices cannot constitute a course of performance. The mistake of fact issue is discussed below.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1465-13\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-14\">\n<em>Kern Oil\u2019s Mistake</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A1V\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"AU5p\">The district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a); <em>see Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1386\">*1386</page-number>564, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985); <em>Allen v. Steele, </em>759 F.2d 1469, 1470 (9th Cir.1985). Tenneco asserts that the district court adopted Kern Oil\u2019s proposed findings of fact \u201cvirtually verbatim.\u201d In such a case, the clearly erroneous standard applies, although \u201cclose scrutiny\u201d of the record is appropriate. <em>United States v. Washington, </em>641 F.2d 1368, 1371 (9th Cir. 1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1143, 102 S.Ct. 1001, 71 L.Ed.2d 294 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-4\">B. <em>The Existence of a Mistake</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1466-5\">The district court entered lengthy findings of fact regarding the existence of a mistake. The district court found that Kern Oil\u2019s senior management did not become aware of Tenneco\u2019s pricing decision until December 1980 and that Kern Oil\u2019s accounting department had paid the invoices mechanically, relying on Tenneco\u2019s assertion that the crude oil was \u201cnewly discovered\u201d or \u201cupper tier released.\u201d The district court\u2019s findings are thoroughly supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-6\">Tenneco argues at great length that the district court\u2019s findings are wrong. It is apparent that the record contains a great deal of evidence that could be interpreted in more than one way. Nevertheless, the district court\u2019s conclusion that the record supported Kern Oil's position was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-7\">C. <em>Mistake of Fact vs. Mistake of Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1466-8\">Under Texas law, it is well settled that, \u201ceven though [a party to a contract] was under no legal obligation to make the overpayments, if the money was voluntarily paid, with full knowledge of all the facts, it cannot be recovered.\u201d <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v. Lone Star Producing Co., </em>322 F. 2d 28, 31 (5th Cir.1963) (applying Texas law); <em>see Pennell v. United Insurance Co., </em>150 Tex. 541, 243 S.W.2d 572, 576 (1951); 3 G. Palmer, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 14.27. The district court found that Kern Oil made a mistake of fact, rather than a mistake of law. Finding of Fact No. 27 states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1466-11\">Kern\u2019s payment of the uncontrolled market price invoices for January through October 1980 deliveries was a mistake. It was not made voluntarily or with the intention to waive Kern\u2019s contractual rights. Kern did not knowingly acquiesce in Tenneco\u2019s charging prices above the contract price.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1466-12\">The district court found that Kern Oil\u2019s accounting staff was not aware that the uncontrolled price was improper and that Kern Oil\u2019s senior management was not aware that Tenneco was charging the uncontrolled price until December, 1980. Accordingly, no single person at Kern Oil had the requisite knowledge to render the payment a mistake of law. As noted above, these findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-13\">The district court\u2019s findings raise a single issue of law: whether Kern Oil can assert that the payments were made under a mistake of fact when its employees collectively knew all of the relevant facts. Tenneco argues that the knowledge of different employees of a business entity must be imputed to the entity. Under Texas law, Tenneco is incorrect. Before a mistake of law will be found, \u201cthe over-payments must have been truly voluntary, that is, \u2018done by design or intentionally or purposely or by choice or of one\u2019s own accord or by the free exercise of the will.\u2019 There must appear \u2018an intention on the part of the payor to waive his rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gulf Oil, </em>322 F.2d at 31 (citations omitted). Under the district court\u2019s findings of fact, it cannot be said that Kern Oil intended to waive its rights. Accordingly, the district court properly concluded that Kern Oil committed a mistake of fact. <em>See id. </em>at 32-33 (finding a mistake of fact when a corporation\u2019s accounting department paid an invoice with excessive charges); 3 G. Palmer, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 14.8, at 175 (\u201cCarelessness of the payor is not a sufficient reason for denying recovery of the unjust gain.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-14\">Tenneco cites several cases in support of its position. Most of those cases stand for the well established rule that notice to an agent constitutes notice to the principal. <em>Central Airlines, Inc. v. Kahle, </em>419 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1387\">*1387</page-number>S.W.2d 873, 876 (Tex.Civ.App.1967) (service of process); <em>Pyramid Drilling Co. v. Howell, </em>173 S.W.2d 250, 252 (Tex.Civ.App.1943) (formation of corporation); <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v. San Diego State Bank, </em>155 S.W.2d 411 (Tex.Civ.App. 1941) (administration of guardianship). If Tenneco had notified Kern Oil\u2019s accounting department that it was changing the price of the crude oil, those cases would control. Instead, Tenneco unilaterally altered the price without notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-5\">Tenneco also cites <em>United States v. T.I.M.E. </em>\u2014 D.C, <em>Inc., </em>381 F.Supp. 730, 738-39 (W.D.Va.1974), in which the court held that a corporation could be held criminally responsible for the collective knowledge of its employees. The corporation had a duty to insure that its drivers obeyed a federal regulation. Various employees had notice of facts that, taken together, revealed that the drivers were violating the regulation. The holding that the corporation was charged with knowledge of the violations was thus based on the corporation\u2019s legal duty to prevent the violations. Such a duty is not present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-6\">Tenneco relies heavily on <em>Preston Farm &amp; Ranch Supply, Inc. v. Bio-Zyme Enterprises, </em>625 S.W.2d 295 (Tex.1981). The issue in <em>Preston Farm </em>was whether a buyer had agreed to pay a service charge for late payments on certain debts. The buyer admitted at trial that he agreed initially to the service charges to his account until he found out that too much interest was being charged. <em>Id. </em>at 298. Moreover, the bookkeeper was authorized by the buyer to make any payments required by the seller\u2019s invoices, which included the service charge provision. The invoices sent by the seller to the buyer\u2019s bookkeeper included a column conspicuously stamped \u201cservice charge.\u201d The court held that the bookkeeper\u2019s knowledge of the service charge was imputed to the buyer. <em>Id. </em>at 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-9\"><em>Preston Farm </em>is distinguishable from the present case. In contrast with <em>Preston Farm, </em>Kern Oil\u2019s management never expressly agreed to any change in the contract price. Furthermore, because Tenneco\u2019s invoices stated that the charges were \u201cper contract of May 19, 1977,\u201d Kern Oil\u2019s accounting department did not even know that Tenneco was changing the price. There was no knowledge of any change in price to be imputed to Kern Oil\u2019s senior management. Unlike the bookkeeper in <em>Preston Farm, </em>Kern Oil\u2019s accounting department paid the invoices under a mistake of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-10\">D. <em>Estoppel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1467-11\">Tenneco argues that Kern Oil is es-topped from seeking restitution because Tenneco relied on Kern\u2019s payments. Specifically, Tenneco asserts that it would have cancelled the Kern Oil contract if it had known that it could charge only the upper tier price. Detrimental reliance is an affirmative defense. <em>See Tomlinson v. Lackey, </em>555 S.W.2d 810, 813 (Tex.Civ.App. 1977); Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(c). Accordingly, the burden of proof was on Tenneco. <em>See Jones v. Taber, </em>648 F.2d 1201, 1203 (9th Cir.1981); <em>Insurance Co. of North America v. McCleave, </em>462 F.2d 587, 588 (3d Cir.1972). Tenneco failed to produce evidence showing that it would have cancelled the contract if it knew that the price was limited to the upper tier price. The district court\u2019s finding that Tenneco failed to establish detrimental reliance was not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1388\">*1388</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-4\">\n<em>Dependent Covenants</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-5\">Under the contract, Kern Oil and Tenneco were obligated to sell each other 3,000 barrels of crude oil per day at the lower tier price. The purpose of this provision was to save transportation costs: Kern Oil purchased California oil from Tenneco and Tenneco purchased West Texas Oil from Kern Oil. Sales of crude oil by Tenneco in excess of 3,000 barrels per day were at the upper tier price. Kern Oil was unable to sell Tenneco 3,000 barrels per day on a consistent basis. Tenneco asserts that Kern thus breached the contract. Tenneco argues that the covenants in the contract were dependent, so that Kern Oil\u2019s breach bars recovery from Tenneco. The record reveals, however, that Tenneco waived any breach by Kern Oil. While Tenneco could have cancelled the contract, it instead continued shipping oil to Kern Oil \u201cper contract dated May 19, 1977.\u201d Accordingly, Tenneco cannot assert Kern\u2019s nonperformance in defense of its own breach. <em>See Mandril v. Kasishke, </em>620 S.W.2d 238, 245 (Tex.Civ.App.1981); <em>cf. </em>Tex.Bus. &amp; Com.Code Ann. \u00a7 2.612(c) (stating that a breached installment contract is reinstated \u201cif [the aggrieved party] accepts a nonconforming installment without seasonably notifying of cancellation or if he brings an action with respect only to past installments or demands performance as to future installments\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-7\">\n<em>Attorneys\u2019 Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ATEN\">A. <em>Availability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1468-8\">In a diversity case, the availability of attorneys\u2019 fees is governed by state law. <em>Diamond v. John Martin Co., </em>753 F.2d 1465, 1467 (9th Cir.1985). The relevant Texas statute states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1468-9\">Any person, corporation, partnership, or other legal entity having a valid claim against a person or corporation ... founded on oral or written contracts, may present the same to such persons or corporation or to any duly authorized agent thereof; and if, at the expiration of 30 days thereafter, payment for the just amount owing has not been tendered, the claimant may, if represented by an attorney, also recover, in addition to his claim and costs, a reasonable amount as attorney\u2019s fees____ This Act shall be liberally construed to promote its underlying purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1468-14\">Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 2226.</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-15\">Tenneco argues that attorneys\u2019 fees were not available because Kern Oil failed to plead entitlement to attorneys\u2019 fees. Tenneco is incorrect. The pretrial order listed the availability of attorneys' fees as a contested issue of law and stated that it superseded the pleadings. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(e) (\u201cThis [pretrial] order shall control the subsequent course of the action unless modified by a subsequent order.\u201d). Without objection by Tenneco, Kern Oil introduced evidence showing that the claim had been presented to Tenneco in accordance with Article 2226. Accordingly, the attorneys\u2019 fee issue was properly raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-16\">B. <em>Calculations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1468-17\">Tenneco argues that the district court\u2019s findings were inadequate under the standards of this court for the setting of attorneys\u2019 fee awards. <em>See Sealy, Inc. v. Easy Living, Inc., </em>743 F.2d 1378, 1385 (9th Cir. 1984); <em>Kerr v. Screen Extras Guild, Inc., </em>526 F.2d 67, 70 (9th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 951, 96 S.Ct. 1726, 48 L.Ed.2d 195 (1976). Tenneco is incorrect. Article 2226 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1468-18\">The usual and customary fees ... shall be presumed to be reasonable, but such presumption may be rebutted by competent evidence. In a proceeding before the court, ... the court may in its discretion take judicial notice of the usual and customary fees in such matters and of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1389\">*1389</page-number>the contents of the case file without receiving further evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1469-5\">Accordingly, the standards set forth in <em>Kerr </em>do not apply under Texas law. The extensive documentation submitted by Kern Oil supports Judge Real\u2019s determination. Accordingly, the record does not reveal an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-7\">\n<em>Dismissal of Count IV</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AqL6\">Tenneco sought a dismissal of Count IV under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2), which states: \u201c[After the filing of an answer], an action shall not be dismissed at the plaintiff\u2019s instance save upon order of the court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper____ Unless otherwise specified in the order, a dismissal under this paragraph is without prejudice.\u201d The district court denied Tenneco\u2019s motion. When Tenneco refused to go forward, the district court dismissed the action under Rule 41(b), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1469-10\">For failure of the plaintiff to prosecute ..., a defendant may move for dismissal of an action or of any claim against him____ If the court renders judgment on the merits against the plaintiff, the court shall make findings as provided in Rule 52(a). Unless the court in its order otherwise specifies, a dismissal under this subdivision ... operates as an adjudication on the merits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1469-13\">The district court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of the dismissal. <em>See Industrial Building Materials, Inc. v. Interchemical Corp., </em>437 F.2d 1336, 1339 (9th Cir.1970). Tenneco argues that the district court erred by refusing to dismiss without prejudice under Rule 41(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-14\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"AbIE\">\u201cThe Ninth Circuit has long held that the decision to grant a voluntary dismissal under Rule 41(a)(2) is addressed to the sound discretion of the District Court, and its order will not be reversed unless the District Court has abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Hamilton v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>679 F.2d 143, 145 (9th Cir.1982); <em>see Purer &amp; Co. v. Aktiebolaget Addo, </em>410 F.2d 871, 879 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 834, 90 S.Ct. 90, 24 L.Ed.2d 84 (1969). When the plaintiff takes a dismissal with prejudice under Rule 41(b) to challenge the denial of a dismissal without prejudice under Rule 41(a)(2), the plaintiff proceeds \u201cat its peril.\u201d <em>Blue Mountain Construction Co. v. Werner, </em>270 F.2d 305, 307 (9th Cir.1959), <em>cert. denied, </em>361 U.S. 931, 80 S.Ct. 371, 4 L.Ed.2d 354 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-16\">B. <em>Forum Shopping</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1469-17\">The district court found that \u201cTenneco\u2019s repeated requests to be allowed to dismiss Count IV without prejudice were made for the purpose of avoiding Judge Marshall and this Court and having the same claim heard by Judge Waters; thus, they constitute impermissible forum shopping.\u201d Tenneco argues that the district court was wrong. Count IV involves the failure of Kern Oil to supply crude oil to Tenneco. The cases pending before Judge Waters involve other issues related to the supply of crude oil under the May 19, 1977 contract. Tenneco asserts that its sole motivation in seeking a voluntary dismissal was to consolidate all of the \u201csupply\u201d cases. The flaw in Tenneco\u2019s argument is that Count IV was a compulsory counterclaim in the \u201cprice\u201d case before Judges Marshall and Real. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 13(a). If Judge Marshall had dismissed Count IV without prejudice, the final judgment entered by Judge Real would have barred the litigation of the issues raised in Count IV. <em>See Baker v. Gold Seal Liquors, Inc., </em>417 U.S. 467, 469 n. 1, 94 S.Ct. 2504, 2506 n. 1, 41 L.Ed.2d 243 (1974); <em>Sams v. Beech Aircraft Corp., </em>625 F.2d 273, 276 n. 4 (9th Cir.1980). Accordingly, Tenneco\u2019s justification for seeking a voluntary dismissal was baseless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-18\">The circumstances of this case support the district court\u2019s finding that Tenneco was forum shopping. Tenneco states that Judge Waters had come close to granting summary judgment for Tenneco in a relat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1390\">*1390</page-number>ed action. Judge Marshall, on the other hand, granted summary judgment for Kern Oil on Count IV. Tenneco did not request a voluntary dismissal until <em>after </em>the granting of summary judgment. When Judge Marshall informed the parties that the case would be transferred to another judge for trial, Tenneco unsuccessfully sought permission to delay filing a motion for reconsideration of the summary judgment until the new judge was named. After Judge Real entered judgment for Kern Oil in the price case, Tenneco refused to try Count IV before Judge Real. Tenneco\u2019s filings emphasize Tenneco\u2019s desire to litigate Count IV before Judge Waters. In light of these circumstances, the district court was justified in finding that Tenneco was forum shopping.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-4\">Tenneco also asserts that Judge Real scheduled the trial of Count IV so quickly that Tenneco could not have been prepared. It is true that Judge Real denied Tenneco\u2019s request for a continuance. We note, however, that Tenneco has not appealed that ruling. While lack of time to prepare could justify a continuance, it does not justify a voluntary dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-5\">C. <em>Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay8\">Conclusion of Law No. 2 states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1470-6\">This Court does not have jurisdiction to overrule Judge Marshall\u2019s Order denying Tenneco\u2019s motion for \u201cnon-suit,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>voluntary dismissal without prejudice, of Count IV. Tenneco\u2019s <em>ex parte </em>application to this Court for voluntary dismissal without prejudice of Count IV constitutes an impermissible \u201chorizontal appeal\u201d of Judge Marshall\u2019s decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1470-7\">The district court was incorrect. While it is true that district courts do not normally overrule each other after a case is transferred, that rule is prudential, rather than jurisdictional. <em>See, e.g., Wilson v. Ohio River Co., </em>236 F.Supp. 96, 98 (S.D.W.Va. 1964), <em>aff'd, </em>375 F.2d 775 (4th Cir.1967). As a result, Judge Real had jurisdiction to review Judge Marshall\u2019s order. Nevertheless, Judge Marshall\u2019s ruling was entitled to deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-8\">D. <em>Prejudice to Kern Oil</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1470-9\">The district court considered the prejudice to Kern Oil in Finding of Fact No. 25:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai0N\">Kern would be prejudiced by a voluntary dismissal of Count IV without prejudice because of, <em>inter alia, </em>the extensive discovery taken in this case, the burden of duplicative discovery in the cases before Judge Waters, and its intensive preparation for trial on August 20, and the fact that Count IV arising out of the contracts before the court in the first trial make Count IV a compulsory counterclaim in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1470-10\">The district court\u2019s findings are supported by the record, although the extent of the prejudice to Kern Oil is questionable. <em>Cf. Hamilton, </em>679 F.2d at 145 (holding that the defendant had not established sufficient prejudice from the granting of a voluntary dismissal \u201cmerely by asserting that it had begun trial preparations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-11\">E. <em>Summary</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1470-12\">It is apparent from the record that the handling of the various actions between Tenneco and Kern Oil was less than ideal. It would have been appropriate to consolidate the various actions under Fed.R. Civ.P. 42(a). Nevertheless, Tenneco had little justification for refusing to try Count IV before Judge Real. In light of Judge Real\u2019s findings of fact, we conclude that the dismissal of Count IV did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-13\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-14\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-15\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Arn\">. Kern Oil is successor in interest to Kern County Refinery, Inc., which was dissolved in 1982.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1462-8\">. Kern Oil characterizes this action as a suit for breach of contract. It is apparent, however, that Tenneco never actually breached the contract. As a result, this action is properly characterized as a suit for restitution of overpayments. <em>See </em>3 G. Palmer, <em>The Law of Restitution </em>\u00a7 14.8 (1978); Levmore, <em>Explaining Restitution, </em>71 Va. L.Rev. 65, 92-95 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1464-10\">. Tenneco challenges the district court\u2019s finding on two grounds. First, Tenneco argues that the district court incorrectly assumed that the \u201cupper tier price\u201d was defined in the regulations. This argument misstates the district court\u2019s findings. The district court did not find that \"upper tier price\u201d meant \u201cupper tier ceiling price.\u201d Instead, the district court correctly found that the \u201cupper tier price\u201d was the price at which crude oil subject to the \"upper tier ceiling price\" was sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-11\">Second, Tenneco argues that \u201cin 1980, there existed two prices for oil still defined as upper tier \u2014 a lower restricted price for oil still subject to controls and a higher unrestricted price for oil released from controls.\u201d This argument is incorrect. \u201cNew\" crude oil and \"upper tier crude oil\u201d are not synonymous. It is true that two prices existed for \"new\u201d crude oil: the \"upper tier price\u201d and the \"uncontrolled price.\u201d For any particular field, however, only one \"upper tier price\u201d existed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1464-17\">. Tenneco makes the following assertion: \u201cNo extrinsic evidence was considered. The district court excluded all such evidence \u2014 including evidence of course of dealing, usage of trade, and course of performance \u2014 because it found the term 'upper tier price\u2019 unambiguous.\u201d While Tenneco's relies heavily on that premise, in fact it is false. Initially, it is apparent that the district court relied on trade usage evidence in determining the meaning of \u201cupper tier price.\u201d Moreover, the record reveals that the district court admitted a substantial amount of extrinsic evidence. Conclusion of Law No. 5 states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-18\">As the May 19, 1977 agreement was intended by the parties to be a final and complete expression of the agreement, and as the parties\u2019 intent as to price is clear from the four corners of the contract, <em>as well as from the testimony of those who negotiated and drafted the agreement, </em>extrinsic evidence is not admissible to contradict its express price terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1385\">*1385</page-number>(emphasis added). The district court evidently concluded that the bulk of the extrinsic evidence introduced by Tenneco contradicted the express terms of the contract. Under section 2-208(2), such evidence is inadmissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1465-7\">. During oral argument before us, counsel for Tenneco conceded that the parties did not contemplate the effect of deregulation during the negotiation of the contract in 1977.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1465-8\">. Tenneco argues that the price variations were not actually negotiated. At the very least, however, Kern Oil\u2019s management was formally notified of the price change. By acquiescing in the price variations, Kern Oil\u2019s management effectively authorized a modification of the contract. <em>See </em>Tex.Bus. &amp; Com.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2.201(c)(3), 2.209(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1465-16\">. In 1980, Tenneco charged Kern Oil the uncontrolled price for shipments of \"heavy\" crude oil. Tenneco attempted to introduce that fact into evidence, arguing that Kern Oil\u2019s failure to object to the charge for heavy crude oil established a course of performance. The district court properly excluded the evidence as irrelevant. The fact that Kern Oil decided not to seek restitution of a particular overpayment does not establish a course of performance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1467-7\">. Tenneco argues, however, that the district court erred by excluding evidence that would have shown detrimental reliance. Initially, Tenneco notes that the district court excluded testimony regarding the ultimate decision to terminate the contract in late August 1980. The record contains no indication that the witness would have testified that Tenneco would have cancelled the contract earlier if it had known that the price was limited. Tenneco also notes that the district court excluded testimony showing that a particular witness would have been willing to pay the uncontrolled price for Tenneco\u2019s crude oil. Tenneco asserts that this shows the existence of willing buyers. In fact, the excluded testimony was cumulative. The record contains substantial evidence regarding the market price for various types of crude oil. A market price is the price that willing buyers will pay and that willing sellers will accept. As a result, the market price data in the record shows the existence of willing buyers. In any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1388\">*1388</page-number>event, the existence of willing buyers does not prove that Tenneco would have cancelled the contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
