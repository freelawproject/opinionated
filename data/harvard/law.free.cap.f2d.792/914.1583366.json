That property is now in the possession of the United States Customs Service. The district court issued a writ of mandamus directing the Commissioner of Customs to release the property in question to Marcos\u2019 agents. It explained its reasons in a thorough, detailed, and careful opinion in which it analyzed and discussed a number of serious, important legal questions. Subsequently, the district court denied a stay of its order. Again it prepared a thorough, detailed, and careful written explanation of its reasons. 632 F.Supp. 30. The Commissioner of Customs appealed from the writ of mandamus and filed an emergency motion seeking a stay of that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">As we have mentioned, the petition filed by the Commissioner raises a number of serious and complex legal questions. The issues presented on appeal are substantial and of public importance. There is a clear public interest in their proper resolution. In addition, the balance of hardships in this case strongly favors the granting of a stay pending appeal: if a stay is granted, the status quo will be maintained and there will be no danger of dissipation of the assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">The emergency motion of the Commissioner of Customs for a stay pending appeal is GRANTED. <em>(See Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission v. National Football League, </em>634 F.2d 1197 (9th Cir. 1980); <em>Lopez v. Heckler, </em>713 F.2d 1432 (9th Cir.), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>463 U.S. 1328, 104 S.Ct. 10, 77 L.Ed.2d 1431 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">The appeal is ordered expedited.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
