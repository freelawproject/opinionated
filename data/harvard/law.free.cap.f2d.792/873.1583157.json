On December 27, 1984, prior to filing his petition for review, Fayazi-Azad filed a motion to reopen his deportation proceedings. The BIA has not yet adjudicated Fayazi-Azad\u2019s motion to reopen. Where a petitioner elects to file a motion to reopen <em>before </em>seeking judicial review, the \u201cotherwise appealable final order becomes no longer appealable in this court until the motion is denied or the proceedings have been effectively terminated.\u201d <em>Hyun Joon Chung v. INS, </em>720 F.2d 1471, 1474 (9th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>467 U.S. 1216, 104 S.Ct. 2659, 81 L.Ed.2d 366 (1984). Because the time for filing a petition for judicial review on the underlying order does not begin to run until the agency acts upon the motion to reopen, it is not necessary for a petitioner to file a protective appeal from the BIA\u2019s original decision in order to preserve the issues raised therein. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">The petition is DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">In order to afford Fayazi-Azad the opportunity to seek a stay of deportation from the BIA pending resolution of his motion to reopen, we stay our mandate for 30 days. <em>See Bu Roe v. INS, </em>771 F.2d 1328, 1335 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
