Because of the defendant\u2019s state conviction, the district court revoked the probationary sentence it had imposed. Although recognizing the split among the courts of appeals on this issue, we conclude that district courts have authority to revoke probation even before it commences. Accordingly, we will affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Defendant pleaded guilty to three counts of firearms violations, 18 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d) and (h), and received the following sentences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-9\">Count III, ten year confinement \u2014 suspended, defendant to serve six months in jail, probation for a period of five years to commence on release from confinement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-10\">Count II, ten years confinement, execution suspended, probation for five years concurrent with that imposed on Count III.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-11\">Count I, two years confinement, execution suspended, probation for two years concurrent with Count III.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">The guilty plea was conditional,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the district judge permitted defendant to remain on bail pending appeal of the denial of a suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-13\">At the sentencing hearing on November 24, 1984, the district judge told defendant, \u201cif you go out and have your probation revoked, you could be put in jail for ten years. So that is going to be hanging over you ... and I hope as a deterrent, to cause you to reflect and pause before you get into any more trouble.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-14\">After referring to a complaint by the defendant\u2019s former girlfriend, the judge cautioned that should the woman be assaulted, \u201cyou are going to go to federal prison for a long time, like ten years or how long they keep you.\u201d Commenting on the relevancy of the Bail Reform Act, the court warned that it might be applicable to defendant: if so, \u201cit could be that you would have a revocation of your probation. Understand? Now we don\u2019t know for sure but it could be, you could go as long as ten years in prison____ lam putting it on the record so you won\u2019t be surprised.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-20\">The judge continued, \u201clet\u2019s suppose in the middle of next year, [defendant] goes out and commits a crime, this gentleman here, Mr. Veatch, he commits a crime in July of 1985. Now I have a hearing, I revoke his probation, he goes into jail for ten years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-21\">Despite his declaration of reform, defendant did not even wait until July of 1985, but on December 27, 1984 participated in the kidnapping and violent rape of a woman.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He was arrested by state authorities soon afterward and has remained in state custody. On January 29, 1985, the government moved to revoke the defendant\u2019s bail and probation. The district court directed that a hearing would be held on release of defendant by state authorities or after a state conviction, whichever occurred earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-22\">On August 13, 1985, agreeing that the district court\u2019s ruling on the suppression motion was proper, this court affirmed the conviction on the firearms charges. On August 30, 1985, the state court sentenced defendant to a prison term on the rape charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-23\">While a petition for certiorari from the affirmance of the federal conviction was pending in the Supreme Court, the district court conducted a hearing on the motion for revocation of probation. On November 14, 1985, probation was revoked, and the court imposed a ten year term of imprisonment, consecutive to the state sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Defendant has appealed, contending that he was not allowed to speak in mitigation of sentence and that he was denied the right of allocution. We find the record does not support either of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Defendant maintains further that since he had not yet begun serving his sentence, the district court lacked authorization to revoke probation. He relies on <em>United States v. Dick, </em>773 F.2d 937 (7th Cir.1985), which so held. In response, the government cites <em>United States v. Ross, </em>503 F.2d 940 (5th Cir.1974), and other cases that upheld a district court\u2019s power to revoke probation before defendant commenced serving a sentence of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The court\u2019s power to impose probation is conferred by the Federal Probation Act, presently codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3651 <em>et seg. </em>Section 3651 provides that a court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AO\">\u201cwhen satisfied that the ends of justice and the best interest of the public as well as the defendant will be served thereby, may suspend the imposition or execution of sentence and place the defendant on probation for such period and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems best. * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">\u201cThe court may revoke or modify any condition of probation, or may change the period of probation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">Section 3653 states, \u201cAt any time within the probation period, ... the court may issue a warrant\u201d for the probationer's arrest. After a hearing, the court \u201cmay revoke the probation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">In <em>Affronti v. United States, </em>350 U.S. 79, 83, 76 S.Ct. 171, 173, 100 L.Ed. 62 (1955), the Supreme Court held that to \u201cavoid interference with the parole and clemency powers vested in the Executive Branch,\u201d a district court could not grant or modify probation once a defendant had begun to serve a period of incarceration. In <em>United States v. Murray, </em>275 U.S. 347, 48 S.Ct. 146, 72 L.Ed. 309 (1928), the Court concluded that \u201cA more reasonable construction [of the Probation Act] is to reconcile the provisions for probation, parole and executive clemency, making them as little of a repetition as we can.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357, 48 S.Ct. at 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\"><em>Burns v. United States, </em>287 U.S. 216, 220-21, 53 S.Ct. 154, 155-56, 77 L.Ed.2d 266 (1932), made clear that in general a narrow construction of the Act was not desirable. As the Court noted, \u201cTo accomplish the purpose of the statute, an exceptional degree of flexibility in administration is essential.\u201d In modifying or revoking probation, the question is \u201cwhether the court is satisfied that its action will sub-serve the ends of justice and the best interests of both the public and the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\"><em>Affronti </em>restricted the trial judge\u2019s discretion to revoke probation when it might conflict with the executive's prerogatives. However, the Supreme Court has not addressed the district court\u2019s authority to revoke probation when an additional offense has been committed after imposition of sentence but before incarceration has begun.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">That issue was resolved in <em>United States v. Ross, </em>503 F.2d 940, 943 (5th Cir.1974), where the court of appeals concluded, \u201cSound policy requires that courts should be able to revoke probation for a defendant\u2019s offense committed before the sentence commences; an immediate return to criminal activity is more reprehensible than one which occurs at a later date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-14\">In <em>United States v. Dozier, </em>707 F.2d 862 (5th Cir.1983), the court followed <em>Ross </em>and affirmed a revocation of probation based on criminal conduct of the defendant while his conviction was on appeal. <em>See also United States v. Cartwright, </em>696 F.2d 344 (5th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>524 F.2d 77 (5th Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-15\">The <em>Ross </em>rationale, however, has been held inapplicable when the illegal act advanced as a basis for revocation occurred while the defendant was on parole from a prison sentence on another count in the same underlying indictment. <em>United States v. Wright, </em>744 F.2d 1127 (5th Cir. 1984). In <em>Wright, </em>the court concluded that because of the potential conflict between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>judicial and executive power during parole, <em>Affronti </em>acted as a limitation on <em>Ross.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Other courts of appeals have agreed with the Fifth Circuit approach. In <em>United States v. Jurgens, </em>626 F.2d 142 (9th Cir. 1980), the court cited <em>Ross, </em>noting that when the sentencing judge has been misled through fraudulent concealment by the defendant, probation may be revoked. <em>United States v. Wickenhauser, </em>710 F.2d 486, 487 (8th Cir.1983), phrased the rule as follows: \u201cprobation may be revoked before the term of probation has commenced based upon new information or a change of circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The \u201cfraud on the court\u201d exception is based on the premise that the sentencing judge would not have granted probation had he been aware of facts which the defendant had concealed. In that situation, a number of cases have determined that probation may be revoked after it has begun, even though the illegal acts occurred before sentencing. <em>See United States v. Torrez-Flores, </em>624 F.2d 776 (7th Cir.1980); <em>Trueblood Longknife v. United States, </em>381 F.2d 17 (9th Cir.1967). Those cases also illustrate the point that the power to revoke has not been dependent on acts that took place during the probation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Not until <em>United States v. Dick, </em>773 F.2d 937 (7th Cir.1985), did a court of appeals hold that incidents occurring before the actual service of a sentence could not support a probation revocation. In <em>Dick, </em>probation was revoked because of a crime the defendant committed while free on bail pending appeal. The court of appeals construed \u00a7 3653 of the Probation Act as providing the sole source of authority for a district court\u2019s recission of probation. As the court read it, that section limits revocation authority to only those events which happened \u201cduring the period of probation.\u201d The <em>Dick </em>court thus differed with <em>Ross\u2019 </em>interpretation of the Probation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\"><em>Dick\u2019s </em>reasoning is based on a literal reading of the statute and has superficial appeal, but we are persuaded that <em>Ross </em>more accurately reflects congressional intent and the thrust of the legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">Section 3651 states that \u201cthe court may revoke or modify any condition of probation, or may change the period of probation.\u201d No time limitation is imposed on those powers. That language is subject to two interpretations \u2014 that the court has the power to revoke probation entirely, or that the court\u2019s authority is limited to the revocation of conditions of probation. In referring to that clause in another context, the Supreme Court in <em>Bums </em>commented, \u201cThere is no suggestion in the statute that the scope of the discretion conferred for the purpose of making the grant is narrowed in providing for its modification or revocation.\u201d 287 U.S. at 221, 53 S.Ct. at 156. In a second reference, the Court said, \u201cNo criteria for modification or revocation are suggested which are in addition to, or different from, those which pertain to the original grant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Hence, the Supreme Court\u2019s reading of the statute in <em>Bums </em>is broader than <em>Dick\u2019s </em>and is more aligned with <em>Ross.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-13\">The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3565, effective November 1, 1986, supports the <em>Ross </em>holding. That statute provides that \u201cIf the defendant violates a condition of probation <em>at any time </em>prior to the expiration or termination of the term of probation,\u201d the court may revoke the sentence of probation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (emphasis added). The legislative history does not reveal the reason for the change of language in the current Act, but it deserves mention that the new legislation is consistent with <em>Ross. </em>Because the 1984 statute preceded <em>Dick, </em>that case could not have precipitated a change in statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-14\">We are persuaded that <em>Ross </em>is the correct interpretation of the Probation Act of 1948 because that holding is consistent with the general purposes of the statute. In <em>Roberts v. United States, </em>320 U.S. 264, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>64 S.Ct. 113, 88 L.Ed. 41 (1983), the Court commented that the primary purpose of probation is to afford an offender an opportunity for rehabilitation,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-4\">\u201cwithout institutional confinement under the tutelage of a probation official and under the continuing power of the court to impose institutional punishment for his original offense in the event that he abuse this opportunity. To accomplish this basic purpose Congress vested wide discretion in the courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 272, 64 S.Ct. at 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">To read the statute as narrowly as did <em>Dick </em>would frustrate the intent of the Act and would deprive the courts of the authority to revoke probation when an offender has committed another criminal act while the original conviction is on appeal. The need for the power to revoke is perhaps more acute when the additional offense occurs so soon after imposition of a sentence than it would be when the infraction occurs years later. In addition, during the period when the defendant is at liberty pending appeal, the concerns that influenced <em>Affronti </em>do not exist. In that interval, there is no conflict between the court\u2019s authority and the executive's responsibility for confinement or clemency.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Furthermore, granting the power to revoke probation permits the correction of a sentence based on an erroneous assumption that defendant would likely benefit from leniency. A defendant\u2019s display of recidivous tendencies demonstrates that he is unworthy of the opportunity for rehabilitation. In that setting, revocation of probation as well as imposition of a sentence consistent with the original offense is fully justified. The reasoning which supports revocation after probation has begun loses none of its force when the defendant\u2019s additional infraction takes place while he is on bond pending disposition of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">We hold, therefore, that a district court may revoke probation if a defendant violates the conditions of probation in the period between the date of sentencing and the date of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">There is no inequity in affirming the district court\u2019s order in the case at hand. At the time of sentencing, the district judge told defendant bluntly and forthrightly that if he violated any of the conditions, his probation could be revoked. Indeed, the judge highlighted a scenario where, if defendant committed a crime within several months following sentencing, his probation would be revoked and he would go to jail for ten years. A more explicit warning can hardly be imagined.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">The order of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b133-15\">. <em>See United States v.
