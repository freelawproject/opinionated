KENNEDY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b672-24\">This appeal primarily raises the question whether plaintiff-appellant, W. Christian Riedel, can maintain an action for alleged violations of Ohio securities law against defendant-appellee, Bancam, S.A. (\u201cBan-cam\u201d), a Mexican bank that the Government of Mexico has nationalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-25\">This action arose when the Government of Mexico promulgated currency exchange control regulations on August 13, 1982 and subsequently nationalized privately-owned Mexican banks on September 1, 1982. In January 1981, Riedel, a resident of the State of Ohio, asked Unibanco, S.A. (\u201cUnibanco\u201d), a Mexican bank, to transfer $100,-000 to Banca Metropolitana, S.A. (\u201cBamesa\u201d), another Mexican bank and a predeces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>sor of Bancam, so that Riedel could purchase a dollar-denominated certificate of deposit from Bamesa. On January 6,1981, Unibanco sent Bamesa a $100,000 check. On that same date, Bamesa issued to Riedel a $100,000 \u201cCertificado de Deposito a Plazo No. 32919\u201d (Certificate of Term Deposit No. 32919) maturing on July 5, 1981 and bearing interest payable monthly at the rate of 20.8857 percent per annum. Dealing with the Mexico City offices of Bamesa or Bancam, Riedel renewed the original certificate on three occasions. On July 6,1981, Bamesa issued \u201cCertificado de Deposito a Plazo No. 42217\u201d containing a January 5, 1982 maturity date and 22.9426 percent per annum interest rate. On January 1, 1982, Bamesa and another Mexican bank merged, forming Bancam. On January 5, 1982, Bancam, using Bamesa forms, sent Riedel \u201cDeposito de Dolares en Administraci\u00f3n a Plazo Fijo con Tasa Fija No. 68734\u201d (Custody of Dollars Deposited at Fixed Rate for Fixed Period No. 68734) bearing a 18.5914 percent per annum interest rate and maturing on July 5, 1982. On July 6, 1982, Riedel renewed the certificate for the last time and Bancam sent Riedel \u201cDeposito de Dolares en Administraci\u00f3n a Plazo Fijo con Tasa Fija No. 077996\u201d acknowledging an interest rate of 20.1737 percent per annum and a new maturity date of January 20, 1983. Neither Bamesa nor Bancam registered any of the certificates of deposit with either the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Ohio Division of Securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">On August 13, 1982, the Government of Mexico issued rules governing the payment of bank deposits denominated in foreign currency which prohibited Mexican banks from using dollars to repay the holders of dollar-denominated certificates of deposit. The rules required Mexican banks to pay principal and interest on dollar-denominated deposits in pesos, at a rate of exchange substantially below the financial market exchange rate, rather than in dollars. On September 1, 1982, the Government of Mexico nationalized all privately-owned Mexican banks. Consequently, Ban-cam, like every other banking institution in Mexico, became wholly-owned by the Government of Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">At maturity of the final renewal of the certificate of deposit, Bancam sent appellant a check in repayment of his certificate of deposit in the amount of 7,434,000 pesos in accordance with the exchange rate of 74.34 pesos to the dollar, the current legal exchange rate. Since the financial market exchange rate was approximately 149.5 pesos to the dollar, Riedel could only convert the 7,434,000 pesos to $53,276.63. Nevertheless, Riedel cashed the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">On January 19,1984, Riedel brought this action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio alleging violations of federal and Ohio securities laws. Riedel further alleged \u201cbreach of contract, denial of rightful possession of property to owner, nondisclosure of potential exposure to damage for property on loan to Defendant, obstruction of justice, [and] coercion.\u201d On June 7, 1984, Bancam filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on five grounds. Initially, Bancam argued that section 4(a) of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (\u201cFSIA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 94-583, 90 Stat. 2892, codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604, precluded the District Court from asserting personal or subject matter jurisdiction over the action. Second, Ban-cam argued that the \u201cact of state doctrine\u201d and the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (\u201cFund Agreement\u201d) required dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which the District Court could grant relief because Riedel based the action solely on the Government of Mexico\u2019s actions in issuing and enforcing currency exchange rules which required banks to repay dollar-denominated certificates of deposit in pesos. Third, Bancam contended that the complaint failed to state a cause of action because the certificates of deposit were not \u201csecurities.\u201d Fourth, Bancam argued that the statute of limitations had expired on the federal securities claims. Finally, Bancam argued that it did not receive proper service of process under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1608(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Riedel did not respond to the motion to dismiss. On September 28, 1984, the District Court held that Riedel could not sustain an action under the Securities Act of 1933 because the certificates of deposits were not \u201csecurities.\u201d In addition, the District Court, apparently referring to the \u201cact of state doctrine,\u201d stated that it \u201cmust respect the absolute right of the Mexican government to regulate the banks within its borders.\u201d On October 9, 1984, Riedel filed a motion for a new trial arguing that the District Court had misapplied the law to the facts alleged in the complaint and had failed to address the breach of contract and the Ohio securities law claims. On June 10,1985, the District Court denied the motion for a new trial. The District Court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the Ohio securities law and breach of contract claims. The District Court stated that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 \u201cdoes not permit a citizen of this state to sue a foreign government or agency thereof, in a federal district court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">This appeal raises three questions: (1) Whether the FSIA gives the District Court subject matter jurisdiction over Riedel\u2019s claims for breach of contract and violations of Ohio Revised Code (\u201cORC\u201d) Chapter 1707 (\u201cOhio securities law\u201d); (2) Whether the \u201cact of state doctrine\" bars Riedel\u2019s claims against a Mexican bank that the Government of Mexico has nationalized; and (3) Whether a certificate of deposit issued by a Mexican bank qualifies as a \u201csecurity\u201d under ORC \u00a7 1707.01(B). For the reasons stated below, we hold that the District Court may have had subject matter jurisdiction over Riedel\u2019s claims. We also hold that although the \u201cact of state doctrine\u201d bars Riedel\u2019s breach of contract claim, it does not bar his Ohio securities law claim. Finally, we hold that a certificate of deposit issued by a Mexican bank falls within the definition of \u201csecurity\u201d in ORC \u00a7 1707.01(B). Accordingly, we affirm the portion of the District Court\u2019s order denying Riedel\u2019s motion for a new trial on the breach of contract claim, reverse the portion of the District Court\u2019s order denying Riedel\u2019s motion for a new trial on the Ohio securities law claim, and remand the Ohio securities law claim to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">In this appeal, Riedel does not challenge the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the certificates of deposit that Bancam issued are not \u201csecurities\u201d under federal securities law. Instead, Riedel argues that the \u201cact of state doctrine\u201d does not bar his breach of contract and Ohio securities law claims. The District Court, however, did not refer to the \u201cact of state doctrine\u201d in denying Riedel\u2019s motion for a new trial. In addition to holding, as a matter of law, that the certificate of deposit involved in this case was not a \u201csecurity\u201d under federal securities law, the District Court ruled that it did not have jurisdiction over Riedel\u2019s breach of contract and Ohio securities law claims.\u2019 The District Court concluded that: \u201cDiversity jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 1332, does not permit a citizen of this state to sue a foreign government or agency thereof, in a federal district court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">We agree that the District Court did not have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 over the breach of contract and Ohio securities law claims. Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(4)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> confers original jurisdiction on the district courts over civil actions between a foreign state, as plaintiff, and a citizen of a State. Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(4), however, does not apply to suits between a citizen of a State and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>foreign state, as defendant. A \u201cforeign state,\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(a), \u201cincludes a political subdivision of a foreign state or an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state____\u201d Since the Government of Mexico nationalized Bancam on September 1, 1982, Bancam qualifies as an \u201cagency or instrumentality of a foreign state\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(b)(2). Therefore, this action involves an Ohio citizen and a \u201cforeign state,\u201d as a defendant. Consequently, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(4) does not apply. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court properly concluded that it did not have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 over the breach of contract and Ohio securities law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">We conclude, however, that the District Court may have had jurisdiction over the breach of contract and Ohio securities law claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ordinarily entitles foreign states to immunity from federal jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(2) creates a \u201ccommercial activity\u201d exception to this immunity. Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(2) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-6\">A foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the United States or of the States in any case ... in which the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the United States by the foreign state; or upon an act performed in the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere; or upon an act outside the territory of the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Accordingly, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(2) applies only when a foreign state\u2019s \u201ccommercial activity\u201d has the required jurisdictional nexus with the United States. <em>See, e.g., Callejo v. Bancomer, S.A., </em>764 F.2d 1101, 1107 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-12\">In <em>Callejo v. Bancomer, S.A., supra, </em>a case arising from Mexico\u2019s promulgation of currency exchange regulations and nationalization of privately-owned Mexican banks, the Callejos brought suit against Bancomer alleging breach of contract and violations of federal and Texas securities laws. The district court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction concluding that Ban-comer was immune from suit under the FSIA. Although the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal on other grounds, the Fifth Circuit concluded that: \u201cThe activities of Bancomer that are the basis of the Callejos\u2019 complaint \u2014 the sale of the certificates of deposit and the subsequent payments in pesos rather than dollars \u2014 were commercial in nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1109 (footnote omitted). We agree and hold that the sale of the certificates of deposit in this case was a \u201ccommercial activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-13\">A \u201ccommercial activity\u201d has the jurisdictional nexus with the United States necessary to invoke the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(2) exception when either (1) the foreign state carries on the commercial activity in the United States; (2) the foreign state, in connection with the foreign state\u2019s commercial activity elsewhere, performs an act in the United States; or (3) the foreign state, in connection with the foreign state\u2019s commercial activity elsewhere, performs an act outside the territory of the United States which causes a direct effect in the United States. In <em>Callejo v. Bancomer, S.A., supra, </em>the Fifth Circuit concluded that Ban-comer\u2019s commercial activities had \u201cdirect effects in the United States\u201d under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>third jurisdictional connection. <em>Id. </em>at 1110. Similarly, this action arises from Bancam\u2019s commercial activities which may have had a direct effect in the United States. Alternatively, Bancam\u2019s commercial activities may have been \u201ccarried on in the United States.\u201d Since the District Court did not make factual findings on these issues, we do not decide whether or not Bancam\u2019s commercial activities had the required jurisdictional nexus with the United States. We hold, however, that by virtue of the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(2) exception, the District Court may have had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(a) to consider Riedel\u2019s breach of contract and Ohio securities law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Bancam argues that the \u201cact of state doctrine\u201d precluded the District Court from addressing Riedel\u2019s claims. The \u201cact of state doctrine\u201d precludes courts in this country from questioning the validity and effect of a sovereign act of a foreign nation performed in its own territory. In <em>Under-hill v. Hernandez, </em>168 U.S. 250, 252, 18 S.Ct. 83, 84, 42 L.Ed. 456 (1897), the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">Every sovereign State is bound to respect the independence of every other sovereign State, and the courts of one country will not sit in judgment on the acts of the government of another done within its own territory. Redress of grievances by reason of such acts must be obtained through the means open to be availed of by sovereign powers as between themselves.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Under the \u201cact of state doctrine,\u201d courts exercise jurisdiction but prudentially \u201cdecline to decide the merits of the case if in doing so we would need to judge the validity of the public acts of a sovereign state performed within its own territory.\u201d 764 F.2d at 1113. <em>See also, e.g., Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, </em>376 U.S. 398, 421-24, 84 S.Ct. 923, 936-38, 11 L.Ed.2d 804 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">In <em>Callejo v. Bancomer, S.A., supra, </em>the Fifth Circuit concluded that the \u201cact of state doctrine\u201d precluded the court from inquiring into the validity of Mexico\u2019s currency exchange control regulations. The Callejos argued that the \u201cact of state doctrine\u201d did not apply for three reasons: (1) the Government of Mexico\u2019s promulgation of the currency exchange control regulations fell within the \u201ccommercial activity exception\u201d to the doctrine; (2) since the regulations violated the Fund Agreement, the \u201ctreaty exception\u201d to the doctrine applied; and (3) the currency exchange control regulations did not apply because the situs of the certificates of deposits was in Texas rather than in Mexico. In a very thorough and lengthy opinion, the Fifth Circuit rejected all three arguments. In a footnote, however, the Fifth Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOl\">In their revised complaint, the Callejos alleged violations of \u00a7 12(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 771(1) (1982), and \u00a7 33A.(1) of the Texas Securities Act, Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 581-33A.(1), as well as breach of contract. We agree with the Callejos that these securities claims are not barred by the act of state doctrine, since they are based on Bancomer\u2019s initial failure to register the certificates of deposit, not on Ban-comer\u2019s later breach of the certificates by complying with Mexico\u2019s exchange control regulations____ We dismiss these claims, however, on the ground that the certificates of deposit sold by Bancomer were not \u201csecurities\u201d within the meaning of the federal and Texas securities laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 1125 n. 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-13\">We adopt the reasoning of the Fifth Circuit in <em>Callejo v. Bancomer, S.A., supra, </em>regarding the \u201cact of state doctrine.\u201d Consequently, we hold that the \u201cact of state doctrine\u201d precludes the District Court from addressing Riedel\u2019s breach of contract claim. Accordingly, we affirm the portion of the District Court\u2019s order denying Riedel\u2019s motion for a new trial on the breach of contract claim. The \u201cact of state doctrine,\u201d however, does not bar the Ohio securities law claim. Riedel bases that claim on Bancam\u2019s failure to register the certificate of deposit with the Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Division of Securities and not on Bancam\u2019s failure to repay dollars at the certificate\u2019s maturity.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">As previously stated, Riedel does not challenge the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the certificates of deposit are not \u201csecurities\u201d under federal securities law. In <em>Marine Bank v. Weaver, </em>455 U.S. 551, 102 S.Ct. 1220, 71 L.Ed.2d 409 (1982), the Supreme Court held that a certificate of deposit issued by a bank in the United States was not a security for the purposes of the Securities Exchange Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Wolf v. Banco Nacional de Mexico, S.A., </em>739 F.2d 1458 (9th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 784, 83 L.Ed.2d 778 (1985), the Ninth Circuit held that a certificate of deposit that a Mexican bank issued to a United States resident through interstate commerce was not a \u201csecurity\u201d under the federal securities laws. Nevertheless, Riedel argues that the certificates of deposit that Bancam issued are \u201csecurities\u201d under ORC \u00a7 1707.01(B).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Bancam argues that Riedel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>did not state a claim under the Ohio securities laws because certificates of deposit are not \u201csecurities\" under Ohio law.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Under the broadly drafted ORC \u00a7 1707.01(B), a certificate of deposit falls within the definition of \u201csecurity.\u201d ORC \u00a7 1707.01(B) covers \u201cevidences of indebtedness\u201d and \u201cany instrument evidencing a promise or an agreement to pay money____\u201d Furthermore, in Ohio Att\u2019y Gen. Opinion No. 33-652, the Attorney General of the State of Ohio, while interpreting Ohio General Code \u00a7 8624-2(2), a predecessor of ORC \u00a7 1707.01(B), concluded that \u201c[c]laims against closed Ohio banks evidenced by passbooks or other instruments are securities within the meaning of the term as used in the Ohio Securities Act.\u201d Earlier in that opinion, the Ohio Attorney General stated that \u201cthere can be little doubt but that obligations of a bank evidenced by passbooks or other instruments are securities within the meaning of the Ohio Securities Act.\u201d Although the fact pattern in the opinion of the Ohio Attorney General essentially involved claims in bankruptcy against a closed bank and this Court is not bound by opinions of the Ohio Attorney General, ORC \u00a7 1707.01(B)\u2019s broad language indicates that certificates of deposit are \u201csecurities\u201d under Ohio securities law.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">ORC \u00a7 1707.43 provides that a purchaser may void a sale made in violation of ORC Chapter 1707. ORC \u00a7 1707.07 requires registration by description, qualification, or coordination before a person may sell \u201csecurities\u201d in Ohio. ORC \u00a7 1707.02(C), however, creates the following exemption from the registration provisions of ORC \u00a7\u00a7 1707.08-1707.11:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-7\">Any security issued by and representing an interest in or an obligation of a state or nationally chartered bank or credit union, or a governmental corporation or agency created by or under the laws of the United States or of Canada is exempt, if it is under the supervision of or subject to regulation by the government or state under whose laws it was organized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">Although the certificate of deposit involved in this case would qualify as exempt under a facial reading of this section because the certificate was \u201cissued by ... a state or nationally chartered bank,\u201d ORC \u00a7 1707.-01(0) defines a \u201cbank\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhyZ\">any bank, trust company, building and loan association, or savings association incorporated or organized under the laws of the United States or of any state thereof, or of Canada or of any province thereof, and subject to regulation or supervision by such country, state, or province.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">Since Bancam was not \u201cincorporated or organized under the laws of the United States or of any state thereof, or of Canada or of any province thereof,\u201d Bancam is not a \u201cnationally chartered bank\u201d under ORC \u00a7 1707.02(C). Consequently, Bancam does not qualify for the ORC \u00a7 1707.02(C) exemption. We reject Bancam\u2019s contention that the certificates of deposit are not \u201csecurities\u201d under ORC \u00a7 1707.01(B). Accordingly, we reverse the portion of the District Court\u2019s order denying Riedel\u2019s motion for a new trial on the Ohio securities law claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-13\">Since the District Court may have had subject matter jurisdiction, we remand the Ohio securities law claim for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We also note that even if the District Court concludes that it has subject matter jurisdiction, Bancam has also argued that the District Court does not have personal jurisdiction. Assuming that the District Court decides that it has subject matter jurisdiction under the FSIA, the District Court will also have to make findings of fact to determine whether Bancam has sufficient \u201ccontacts\u201d with the United States to satisfy due process. Furthermore, Bancam alleges that Ohio securities law does not apply because the circumstances giving rise to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>this action occurred in Mexico. Bancam claims that \u201c[a]ny contact with Ohio was merely incidental as a result of Riedel\u2019s residence in Ohio.\u201d Brief of Defendant-Appellee at 22 n. 17. Accordingly, the District Court may have to decide whether Ohio securities law applies in the circumstances of this case. Finally, assuming that Ohio securities law required Bancam to register the certificates of deposit with the Ohio Division of Securities, the District Court must determine whether such a requirement impermissibly burdens foreign commerce because Congress has not required the registration of certificates of deposit sold by Mexican banks since certificates of deposit are not \u201csecurities\u201d under the federal securities laws. Consequently, we remand the Ohio securities law claim to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the portion of the District Court\u2019s order denying Riedel\u2019s motion for a new trial on the breach of contract claim, reverse the portion of the District Court\u2019s order denying Riedel\u2019s motion for a new trial on the Ohio securities law claim, and remand the Ohio securities law claim for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b674-5\">.
