He was in the custody of the Colorado Department of Corrections in January, 1982, when he filed a civil rights action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 seeking to obtain what he considered necessary medical treatment for gender dysphoria. The matter went to trial on January 4, 1983, was continued the following day, and the case was ultimately \u201cdeemed closed\u201d on January 16,1984, without judicial resolution. On November 26, 1984, plaintiff was awarded $20,910.05 for attorney\u2019s fees and costs, 596 F.Supp. 1532.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\">Defendants-appellants (defendants) appeal the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs, arguing that plaintiff is not entitled to such award because he is not a \u201cprevailing party\u201d as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Their alternative argument is that the award must be reduced because it is excessive. Because we hold that plaintiff is not a prevailing party, defendants\u2019 alternative argument is not addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\">II. <em>The Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1040-6\">Plaintiff entered the Colorado Department of Corrections in 1978 for auto theft and escape. Upon his request, plaintiff was transferred to the Utah State Penitentiary in March, 1980, but was returned to the Colorado prison system in August, 1980. Beginning in September, 1980, he was placed voluntarily in protective custody because of his feminine characteristics and because he was known by the prison population as a \u201csnitch\u201d or informant. He remained in protective custody for the remainder of his term in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-7\">Throughout the remainder of 1980, plaintiff engaged in various forms of mutilation of his sex organs. He requested to be treated with estrogen, a female hormone, but this request was denied. A program of counseling by psychologists and psychiatrists was provided, and plaintiff was advised of the dangers of estrogen treatment. After continued attempts at self-mutilation, plaintiff\u2019s testicles became severely injured and were removed surgically by a physician at the Colorado State Hospital in July, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-11\">In August, 1981, Dr. Dennis Kleinsasser, Director of Health Services for the Department of Corrections, informed plaintiff that the Department\u2019s medical staff had studied his request for estrogen and concluded that such treatment would not be warranted because of the dangers involved and because estrogen treatment was but one aspect of an overall plan of treatment which could not be conducted in a prison setting. Thereafter, plaintiff was examined by Dr. Kathleen K. Graze, an endocrinologist, Dr. John D. Glismann, a psychiatrist, and Dr. Robert N. Alsever, an endocrinologist. Drs. Graze and Glismann recommended estrogen treatment, but Dr. Al-sever advised against such treatment. On January 7, 1982, plaintiff filed his civil rights suit. In April, 1982, Dr. Robert McGowan, Director of Medical Services for the Department of Corrections, informed plaintiff that the medical staff determined that the appropriate medical treatment would include testosterone replacement therapy and mental health treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-12\">Also in April, 1982, the Department of Corrections issued its \u201cInterim Policy Regarding Sexual Reassignment\u201d which precluded \u201csexual reassignment evaluation and treatment for gender dysphoria.\u201d A \u201cTranssexual Policy Development Workshop\u201d was conducted in January, 1983, which resulted in a change in the Department\u2019s policy to permit \u201cthe full benefit of mental health services and therapies offered by the Department of Corrections.\u201d <em>Scope of Services for Treatment of Transsexualism, </em>Colorado Department of Corrections Interim Rule 405-14 (Feb. 18, 1983). Dr. Kleinsasser testified that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>new policy would not preclude estrogen therapy. Record at vol. VII, 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-4\">The case went to trial on January 4, 1983, but was continued the following day on plaintiff\u2019s motion in order to await the Department of Corrections\u2019 establishment of a policy for the treatment of transsexuals. The court issued an interim order which permitted plaintiff to receive low dosages of estrogen. After continued estrogen therapy, plaintiff developed breast tissue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">In June, 1983, Carlos Baca, assistant superintendent at Colorado\u2019s Centenial Correctional Facility, wrote to the chairman of the Parole Board requesting that plaintiff be paroled to his second sentence so that he would be eligible for commutation of sentence. Mr. Baca pursued this matter because he believed plaintiff to present a difficult management problem. On June 20, 1983, plaintiff made another attempt at self-mutilation of the genital area. On June 25, 1983, plaintiff was paroled, and the Governor of Colorado commuted his sentence on August 30, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-6\">On January 16, 1984, an order was entered deeming the case closed. Plaintiff moved for attorney\u2019s fees and expenses on February 27, 1984, and in November, 1984, his motion was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-7\">III. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1041-8\">A district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees generally is subject to an abuse of discretion standard of review on appeal. <em>E.g., J. &amp; J. Anderson, Inc. v. Town of Erie, </em>767 F.2d 1469, 1472 (10th Cir.1985). Thus, the underlying factual findings are reversible only if clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Fed. R.Civ.P. 52(a). Nevertheless, any statutory interpretation or other legal analysis which provides the basis for the award is reviewable <em>de novo. See generally </em>5A J. Moore and J. Lucas, Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 52.03[2] (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-13\">The Supreme Court has noted the vexatious nature of the distinction between questions of fact and questions of law. <em>Baumgartner v. United States, </em>322 U.S. 665, 671, 64 S.Ct. 1240, 1243, 88 L.Ed. 1525 (1944). Mixed questions of law and fact are even more troubling for standard of review purposes. A mixed question is present when the facts are admitted or established and the law is undisputed; the sole issue is whether the law applied to the facts satisfies the statutory standard. <em>Pullman-Standard v. Swint, </em>456 U.S. 273, 289, n. 19, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 1790, n. 19, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982). Where the mixed question involves primarily a factual inquiry, the clearly erroneous standard is appropriate. If, however, the mixed question primarily involves the consideration of legal principles, then a <em>de novo </em>review by the appellate court is appropriate. <em>See, e.g., United States v. McConney, </em>728 F.2d 1195, 1199-1205 (9th Cir.1984) (en banc) (holding that the mixed question of exigent circumstance is reviewable <em>de novo </em>as a question of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-14\">Most appellate courts that have reviewed a district court\u2019s determination of the \u201cprevailing party\u201d issue have independently considered the totality of the circumstances they found in the record. <em>E.g., Gurule v. Wilson, </em>635 F.2d 782, 791 (10th Cir.1980), as amended, 649 F.2d 754 (1981); <em>J. &amp; J. Anderson, Inc. v. Town of Erie, </em>767 F.2d 1469 (10th Cir.1985); <em>Hennigan v. Ouachita Parish School Bd., </em>749 F.2d 1148 (5th Cir.1985); <em>Institutionalized Juveniles v. Sec. of Pub. Wei, </em>758 F.2d 897, 910-17 (3d Cir.1985); <em>Miami Herald Pub. Co. v. City of Hallandale, </em>742 F.2d 590 (11th Cir. 1984). <em>But see Posada v. Lamb County, Texas, </em>716 F.2d 1066, 1072 n. 7 (5th Cir. 1983). Although most appellate courts conduct a <em>de novo </em>review when presented with the \u201cprevailing party\u201d issue, the standard of review is rarely stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>As already noted, a plaintiff must be a \u201cprevailing party\u201d to recover an attorney\u2019s fee under \u00a7 1988. A plaintiff may prevail in the absence of a judicial determination or full litigation. <em>Maher v. Gagne, </em>448 U.S. 122, 129, 100 S.Ct. 2570, 2574, 65 L.Ed.2d 653 (1980). The test for determining whether a plaintiff is a prevailing party when there has been no adjudication was recently set forth in <em>J. &amp; J. Anderson, </em>767 F.2d at 1475, and contains two elements which must be satisfied. The plaintiff must demonstrate that his lawsuit is linked causally to the relief obtained, i.e. the suit must be a \u201csubstantial factor or a significant catalyst\u201d in prompting the defendants to act or cease their behavior. He must also demonstrate that the defendant\u2019s conduct in response to the lawsuit was required by the Constitution or federal law, i.e. the defendant\u2019s actions must be legally required.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1042-4\">The first element primarily involves a factual inquiry: whether the lawsuit caused the defendant to act. The trial court is in the best position to evaluate this issue because it has dealt with the parties and can evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the case. If the \u201cprevailing party\u201d issue turns on this first element, then the appellate court should apply the clearly erroneous standard of review. The second element primarily requires legal analysis, although the facts certainly bear on the outcome. Because this second element stresses legal analysis, if the \u201cprevailing party\u201d issue is resolved by whether a defendant\u2019s actions are legally required, then <em>de novo </em>review is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-5\">IV. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1042-6\">In this case, it is evident from the Second Amended Complaint that plaintiff sought to compel the defendants to provide him with adequate health care services, a safe living environment, \u201cappropriate classification and placement decisions,\u201d and protect his rights to privacy, \u201cpersonality and existence as a transsexual in the female gender.\u201d The district court found plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit to have a \u201ccatalytic effect ... in obtaining treatment and release.\u201d The court\u2019s interim order allowing plaintiff to take low levels of female hormones was found to be the result of plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit. The court also determined that plaintiff\u2019s release was caused by the lawsuit because the hormone treatments led to the development of breast tissue which created a management problem at the prison which, in turn, led to plaintiff\u2019s release. The district court, however, did not address whether these results were required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-10\">The district court\u2019s conclusion that the lawsuit is causally linked to the relief obtained is tenuous. Although plaintiff was permitted to obtain low levels of female hormones through the court\u2019s interim order, it is unclear whether that treatment would have continued as a result of judicial intervention because it was never determined whether such treatment was a serious medical necessity. The Department of Corrections amended its policy to permit hormone treatment, but such policy changes were being studied prior to plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit. Additionally, it is apparent from the record that plaintiff\u2019s management problems were not due solely to his breast development, but were caused by his repeated attempts at self-mutilation. Thus, the link between the breast development as a result of the hormone treatment required by the interim order and plaintiff\u2019s ultimate release from prison is extremely weak. Giving due deference to the district court\u2019s findings and applying the clearly erroneous standard, we are convinced that the court erred in finding a link between the lawsuit and the results obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-11\">An independent review of the record also leads to the conclusion that defendant\u2019s conduct was not legally required. There can be no question that the State of Colora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>do was not required by law to release plaintiff from prison. We also are unable to conclude that federal law requires prison officials to administer female hormones to a transsexual inmate. The eighth amendment protects prison inmates from \u201cdeliberate indifference to serious medical needs.\u201d <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104, 97 S.Ct. 285, 291, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). To establish entitlement to female hormone treatment pursuant to the eighth amendment, plaintiff was required to prove that withholding such treatment would have constituted \u201cdeliberate indifference to serious medical needs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It was established that some form of therapy was necessary after plaintiff\u2019s castration and he was offered testosterone replacement by Dr. Robert McGowan of the Department of Corrections. Although Dr. John Glismann, a psychiatrist, and Dr. Kathleen Graze, an endocrinologist, recommended estrogen therapy, Dr. Robert Alsever, an endocrinologist, Dr. Dennis Kleinsasser, Director of Medical Services for the Department of Corrections, and the Department of Corrections medical staff disagreed. The record reflects the controversial nature of such therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">It is apparent from the record that there were a variety of options available for the treatment of plaintiff\u2019s psychological and physical medical conditions. It was never established, however, that failing to treat plaintiff with estrogen would constitute deliberate indifference to a serious medical need. While the medical community may disagree among themselves as to the best form of treatment for plaintiff\u2019s condition, the Department of Corrections made an informed judgment as to the appropriate form of treatment and did not deliberately ignore plaintiff\u2019s medical needs. The medical decision not to give plaintiff estrogen until further study does not represent cruel and unusual punishment. This case, like <em>Estelle, </em>does not present a situation where there was a total failure to give medical attention. At most, plaintiff might have made a case for negligence or medical malpractice, but he could not have established a constitutional violation. <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. at 105-06, 97 S.Ct. at 291-92; <em>Daniels v. Galbreath, </em>668 F.2d 477, 482 (10th Cir.1982). <em>See generally Davidson v. Cannon, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 668, 88 L.Ed.2d 677 (1986). Defendants\u2019 actions, therefore, were not required by the Constitution or federal law, and plaintiff cannot be considered a prevailing party within the meaning of \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-9\">V. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1043-10\">Plaintiff has failed to satisfy either prong of the \u201cprevailing party\u201d test. The lawsuit was not causally linked to the relief obtained and, based on the record in this case, defendants\u2019 conduct was not legally required. Because plaintiff cannot be considered a prevailing party within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, he is not entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-11\">The district court\u2019s order awarding appellee costs and attorney\u2019s fees is reversed and remanded to the district court with instructions to vacate the order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1039-25\">. Plaintiffs name was changed from Ralph Spencer to Shauna Christine Supre in 1980.

This statute provides, in pertinent part, as follows: \"In any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of section ... 1983 ..., the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019 s fee as part of the costs.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1041-9\">. The Supreme Court has defined that standard as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1041-11\">A finding is \"clearly erroneous\" when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1041-16\"><em>United States v.

This two-part test is thoroughly explained in the concurrence. I agree completely with the analysis contained therein.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1043-12\">SETH, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AHbP\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-13\">I concur in the opinion by Judge Baldock, but add some emphasis on the position of this circuit expressed in two previous opinions. Thus we held in <em>Operating Engineers Local Union No. 3 v. Bohn, </em>737 F.2d 860 (10th Cir.), after a reference to the \u201ctest\u201d in <em>Nadeau v. Helgemoe, </em>581 F.2d 275 (1st Cir.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-14\">\u201cUnder this test, a plaintiff who brings an action alleging a civil rights violation, but who does not receive a judgment on the merits is still a prevailing party for section 1988 purposes if he makes two showings. First, plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit must be causally linked to the securing of the relief obtained. Second, the defendant\u2019s conduct in response to the lawsuit must be required by law. <em>Id. </em>at 281.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1043-15\">In my view, by <em>Operating Engineers Local Union No. 3 v. Bohn, </em>737 F.2d 860 (10th Cir.), and by <em>J &amp; J Anderson, Inc. v. Town of Erie, </em>767 F.2d 1469 (10th Cir.), we have adopted <em>Nadeau </em>and both the therein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>described causal connection requirement and the requirement that defendants\u2019 conduct be required by law. The court in <em>Nadeau </em>as to the second element, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-4\">\u201cEven if plaintiffs can establish that their suit was causally related to the defendants\u2019 actions which improved their condition, this is only half of their battle. The test they must pass is legal as well as factual. If it has been judicially determined that defendants\u2019 conduct, however beneficial it may be to plaintiffs\u2019 interests, is not required by law, then defendants must be held to have acted gratuitously and plaintiffs have not prevailed in a legal sense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">The two elements of <em>Nadeau </em>were thus approved by this circuit. The term \u201cgratuitous conduct\u201d acquired a definition by our cases (as well as by <em>Nadeau </em>as an action not required by law. In <em>J &amp; J Anderson </em>we held that regardless of the result of the lawsuit it must be determined whether the suit \u201cas a matter of law, involved the vindication of rights secured to the plaintiff by the Constitution.\u201d We there quoted from <em>Williams v. Leatherbury, </em>672 F.2d 549 (5th Cir.), as to the causal connection requirement and then significantly emphasized the following from <em>Leatherbury, </em>\u201cand that defendant\u2019s conduct was required by law, i.e., not a wholly gratuitous response to an action that in itself was frivolous or groundless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-6\">The emphasis in the <em>Leatherbury </em>quotation in <em>J &amp; J Anderson </em>puts together the two requirements and the second \u2014 as required by law \u2014 not gratuitous \u2014 as an independent requirement. We have gone down the road a long way with the two requirements and, in my view, <em>Operating Engineers </em>and <em>J &amp; J Anderson </em>have to control.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-9\">With the elements in place the plaintiff here must fail because the dispute originated as to the validity of a particular treatment requested by the plaintiff, and resisted by the prison.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-10\">It was thus like several cases wherein we have considered such disputes as to the proper medical treatment. This as a matter of law did not involve a vindication of rights secured by the Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1044-11\">The prison did not fully agree to the prisoner\u2019s demands but did administer some estrogen, but the medical dispute was not really resolved. The results or consequences of the estrogen, which were apparently not fully anticipated, did in any event require the release of the plaintiff from prison in that it raised the management problem to an impossible level. The release was not the relief sought by the prisoner but appears to have been the only solution. The attorney for the plaintiff performed a service to all concerned and in a professional manner, but unfortunately I see no category in which to place it other than as a <em>pro bono </em>service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-12\">I so agree with the opinion by Judge Baldock.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1044-13\">SEYMOUR, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aq7Z\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-14\">I respectfully dissent. Shauna Supre may be considered a prevailing party for purposes of recovering attorneys fees: (1) if her action is causally linked to attaining some of the benefits sought in bringing suit, and (2) if her original legal claim was not unfounded.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Nadeau v. Helgemoe, </em>581 F.2d 275, 281 (1st Cir.1978). In reversing the district court\u2019s fee award, the majority has misapplied the first prong of the prevailing party test and misapprehended the second. In my view, Supre has met the test for recovery of attorneys fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1045-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number><em>J &amp; J Anderson, Inc. v. Town of Erie, </em>767 F.2d 1469 (10th Cir.1985), relied on by the majority, affirms that this circuit follows <em>Nadeau. See id. </em>at 1472. Although <em>J &amp; J Anderson </em>suggests that a defendant\u2019s remedial conduct must be required by law, <em>see id. </em>at 1475, the majority has viewed this language in a vacuum. We further explained in <em>J &amp; J Anderson </em>that a plaintiff need show only that the defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201c \u2018not a wholly gratuitous response to an action that in itself was frivolous or groundless.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Williams v. Leatherbury, </em>672 F.2d 549, 551 (5th Cir.1982)). We then demonstrated that the plaintiffs there could not conceivably have prevailed. <em>See id. </em>at 1475-78; <em>accord Operating Engineers Local Union No. 3 v. Bohn, </em>737 F.2d 860, 863 (10th Cir.1980).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Nadeau\u2019s </em>formulation therefore represents the law in this circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">The Fifth Circuit recently clarified the <em>Nadeau </em>test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-6\">\u201c[W]e hold that a plaintiff who achieves the goal sought in a civil rights suit by voluntary action of the defendant prevails within the meaning of the Act if she demonstrates that the suit caused the defendant to act, unless the defendant proves that the plaintiff\u2019s claim had no colorable merit and the defendant made the change gratuitously for reasons unrelated to the potential merit of the suit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AD_\"><em>Hennigan v. Ouachita Parish School Board, </em>749 F.2d 1148, 1149 (5th Cir.1985). An overwhelming majority of the circuits have endorsed these standards, and no court before today has held in favor of more stringent criteria. <em>See id. </em>at 1151-52 &amp; n. 15 (reviewing cases). The majority in this case has warped what the Supreme Court has approved as a \u201cgenerous formulation,\u201d <em>see Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1939, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983) (citing <em>Nadeau, </em>581 F.2d at 278-79), into a gauntlet to be run by this civil rights plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-11\">In holding that Supre is not entitled to attorneys fees, the majority has erred in imposing its own view of the evidence regarding whether this action secured significant benefits. <em>See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1512, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985). Supre\u2019s lawsuit focused upon what constituted medically necessary treatment for gender dysphoria in her case. The district court specifically found that this action prompted the Department of Corrections (the Department) to relax its rigid treatment policy and to allow Supre estrogen therapy on a continuing basis. The court concluded that the Department would not have acted both promptly and favorably without the impetus of this vigorously prosecuted action. <em>See </em>rec., vol. VII, at 65-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-12\">The record amply supports this conclusion. Supre first requested estrogen in August 1980. After promising a response within one month, prison officials repeatedly delayed without explanation. Supre became desperate: as a male-to-female transsexual, she viewed herself as a woman trapped in a man\u2019s body. She attempted suicide once and mutilated herself several times in efforts at self-emasculation. After a final attempt resulted in the surgical removal of Supre\u2019s testicles, the Department at last addressed her year-old plea and rejected it. This delay clearly supports an inference that the Department would not unilaterally have confronted the task of developing a new treatment policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-13\">The district court found an additional fact significant: immediately after the court ordered a continuance of this case, the Department\u2019s panel of experts met for the first time and the Department revised its original policy. <em>See Supre v. Ricketts, </em>596 F.Supp. 1532, 1534-35 (D.Colo.1984); <em>see also United Handicap Federation v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number><em>Andre, </em>622 F.2d 342, 347 (8th Cir.1980) (chronology of events \u201can important factor\u201d in inferring existence of causal connection). The court\u2019s order provided for individual attention to Supre\u2019s case by the panel, and strongly implied that one of her treating physicians should be included in its deliberations. The fulfillment of these conditions reinforces the likelihood of a link between Supre\u2019s lawsuit and the panel\u2019s ultimate recommendations. In light of these facts, I would defer to the district court\u2019s markedly superior position from which to assess the influence of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">The court also found that the case precipitated Supre\u2019s release, which apparently offered the only feasible alternative for needed care. Daniel Grove, who participated in making the necessary decisions, testified that Supre was released in part because the prison could not provide the medical treatment and accommodations she required. Grove also testified that Supre presented a management problem for prison officials. The district court noted that the availability of estrogen due to this lawsuit caused Supre to develop female breasts, which made her difficult to house in an all-male facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">The majority concedes the existence of this causal connection, but asserts that Supre in fact posed a management problem because of her attempts at self-emasculation. This argument ignores the fact that the prison did not recommend parole until immediately after Supre began receiving estrogen, which was long after the most extreme incidents of self-mutilation had occurred. <em>See Andre, </em>622 F.2d at 347. The district court did hear testimony supporting the majority\u2019s position, but apparently chose to discount it in light of other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">Such credibility determinations are entitled to great deference on appeal, <em>see Anderson, </em>105 S.Ct. at 1512-13, and the majority has offered no convincing reason for disturbing those made in this case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-7\">\u201cIf the district court\u2019s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently. Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1046-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 1512. In my view, the record in this case clearly supports a finding that this action has generated significant results in terms of both treatment and release.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-11\">In requiring Supre to prove that the Department\u2019s change in treatment policy was required by law, the majority has improperly converted <em>Nadeau\u2019s </em>modest requirement that a plaintiff\u2019s action not be unfounded into an onerous and unprecedented demand that she win her case outright. The Supreme Court has admonished that \u201c[a] request for attorney\u2019s fees should not result in a second major litigation.\u201d <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 437, 103 S.Ct. at 1941. Surely Congress did not intend that a settling plaintiff be required to prove her whole case in order to recover such fees. <em>Nadeau </em>established that a plaintiff should be considered the prevailing party in a case terminated without trial unless her original legal claim could be deemed frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless. <em>See </em>581 F.2d at 281. In my view, the record in this case reveals a complicated fact pattern which supports a claim of \u201cdeliberate indifference to serious medical needs.\u201d <em>See Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97,104, 97 S.Ct. 285, 291, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-12\">This case presents more than a straightforward professional disagreement over the proper course of treatment for gender dysphoria. The issue is decidedly not whether estrogen therapy is always required in such cases, but whether the failure to provide it under the circumstances of this case presented a nonfrivolous constitutional claim. Even assuming that the Department developed a general policy for gender dysphoria which was constitutionally adequate, prison officials nonetheless ignored a pressing medical need of Supre as an individual. She was no ordinary trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>sexual, but one driven to acts of self-emasculation. Prison officials put off her pleas for estrogen even though she mutilated herself repeatedly and attempted suicide. Such a failure to act raises an inference of deliberate indifference, whatever the proper course of treatment. As Dr. Graze testified, \u201c[t]here was knowledge of several attempts at mutilation, and ... I was shocked that estrogen had not been given.\u201d Rec., vol. IV, at 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-4\">The Department\u2019s original treatment policy failed to respond to Supre\u2019s aberrant, self-destructive behavior, as did Dr. Alsever\u2019s conclusion that estrogen was not medically compelled in cases of gender dysphoria. As the district court summarized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvOv\">\u201cThe official response of the defendants to the mutilations, castration, doctors\u2019 diagnosis and recommendations, and plaintiff\u2019s requests for female hormones was a written policy statement dated April, 1982, which concluded that treatment for gender dysphoria and evaluation of sexual reassignment could not be provided in a penal setting.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\"><em>Supre, </em>596 F.Supp. at 1534. Although prison officials have opined that Supre\u2019s conduct was calculated and manipulative, a charge she denies, this record contains no proof that prison physicians ever addressed whether her self-mutilation might have been symptomatic and in need of treatment. Cf<em>. Lee v. McManus, </em>543 F.Supp. 386, 390-92 (D.Kan.1982) (preliminary injunction issued when physicians disagreed over necessary treatment and prison physician had ignored plaintiff\u2019s case). Perhaps the Department could have shown at trial that its medical staff did not merely promulgate a gender dysphoria treatment policy and apply it woodenly to Supre\u2019s case. On this record, however, the question remains unresolved. Supre\u2019s original claim was plainly not unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">Having concluded that Supre should be considered a prevailing party, I would uphold the amount of attorneys fees awarded as reasonable in light of the results obtained, <em>see Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 435, 103 S.Ct. at 1940. As the district court suggested, plaintiff\u2019s counsel deserves every penny for rescuing his client from conditions which might well have amounted to cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-9\">I would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1044-7\">. I choose the female pronouns \"she\u201d and \"her\u201d as a matter of courtesy to Shauna Supre. The trial judge adopted this practice, and counsel for the Department of Corrections has sometimes acknowledged Supre in female terms as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1044-8\">. Notwithstanding my view of the merits, I agree with much of the analysis contained in Part III of the majority opinion. In particular, I agree that the clearly erroneous standard of review applies to mixed questions involving primarily a factual inquiry, while <em>de novo </em>review is appropriate when considerations of law predominate. As the majority recognizes, this distinction applies when the facts are established or admitted. A district court\u2019s findings with regard to any underlying issues of historical fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>remain subject to review under the clearly erroneous standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1045-8\">. Like <em>J &amp; J Anderson, Bohn </em>purports to follow <em>Nadeau </em>but states that a defendant's conduct must be required by law. <em>See Til </em>F.2d at 863. Unlike <em>J &amp; J Anderson, </em>the court provides no explanation for the apparent contradiction. Because the plaintiffs claims were patently unfounded, <em>see id., </em>the court\u2019s particular choice of words should be viewed as inadvertent or, alternatively, as dictum.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
