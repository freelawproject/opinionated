At the time the action was filed, both Texas and California courts had rendered custody decrees involving the minor children of the parties. This conflict was recently resolved by the Texas Supreme Court when it dismissed an application for writ or error from the intermediate appellate ruling of the Fourth District Court of Appeals that the Texas courts lacked jurisdiction under the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act of 1980, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1738A because Texas was not the \u201chome state\u201d of the children on the date of Cathy Cook\u2019s amended divorce petition. The Texas appellate court further found that the California courts did have jurisdiction over this matter because California was the home state of the children \u201cwithin six months before the date of the commencement of the proceedings\u201d and Robert Cook \u201ccontinues to live in such state.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(C)(2)(A)(ii). As a result, the Texas court ruled the California custody determination was entitled to full faith and credit under the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act. As a result of this Texas determination, the case before us is now moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-19\">Robert Cook requests attorney\u2019s fees on the ground that the appeal was frivolous even though he concedes he knew that the Texas Supreme Court had dismissed the writ on April 2, 1986. Robert Cook says he did not inform this Court of this fact in order to \u201cavoid rocking the boat.\u201d We decline his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-20\">The district court is directed to vacate its order so it will spawn no consequences. The appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
