(NL Industries) appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of its motion to dismiss Kaplan\u2019s action for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. This appeal concerns the pleading requirements of a private cause of action under section 107(a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCHA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b977-16\">Kaplan\u2019s complaint alleges that Kaplan is the court-appointed receiver for 2222 Ltd. (the partnership), a California limited partnership that owns a parcel of real property in San Francisco (the parcel). The partnership acquired the parcel in February 1980 for the purpose of developing a condominium project. It later learned that the parcel was severely contaminated with deposits of various hazardous substances. State and local officials, acting pursuant to California hazardous waste control and water quality laws and other state and local statutes, regulations, and ordinances, have required Kaplan, as receiver for the partnership, to expend approximately $1,200,-000 in detecting, identifying, controlling, and disposing of these hazardous substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-17\">From approximately 1933 to 1971, NL Industries owned the parcel and operated on it facilities for the production of paint, varnish, shellac, lacquer, and related products. From before 1900 until 1933, two corporations owned, controlled, and directed by NL Industries owned the parcel and conducted similar production operations. During these two periods, NL Industries and the two corporations owned by it deposited the hazardous substances that contaminate the parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-18\">Kaplan sued NL Industries in district court under CERCLA \u00a7 107(a), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a), to recover the partnership\u2019s costs of responding to the hazardous substances. The district court issued an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>denying NL Industries\u2019 motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The district court certified its order for immediate appeal, and we granted permission to appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of NL Industries\u2019 motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>See Guillory v. County of Orange, </em>731 F.2d 1379, 1381 (9th Cir.1984). We must accept all material allegations in the complaint as true and construe them in the light most favorable to Kaplan. <em>North Star International v. Arizona Corporation Commission, </em>720 F.2d 578, 580 (9th Cir.1983). Dismissal is warranted only if it appears to a certainty that Kaplan would be entitled to no relief under any state of facts that could be proved. <em>Halet v. Wend Investment Co., </em>672 F.2d 1305, 1309 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-6\">Section 107(a) of CERCLA states in part: Notwithstanding any other provision or rule of law, and subject only to the defenses set forth in subsection (b) of this section\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-7\">(2) any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of, ... shall be liable for\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-9\">(A) all costs of removal or remedial action incurred by the United States Government or a State not inconsistent with the national contingency plan; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-10\">(B) any other necessary costs of response incurred by any other person consistent with the national contingency plan____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b978-12\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a)(2)(A), (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-13\">Section 107(a)(2)(B) expressly creates a private cause of action for damages. <em>Wickland Oil Terminals v. Asarco, Inc., </em>792 F.2d 887, 890 (9th Cir.1986) <em>(Wickland). </em>Pursuant to this section, Kaplan has alleged that NL Industries owned the parcel at the time that hazardous substances were deposited on it, and that Kaplan has incurred \u201cnecessary costs of response ... consistent with the national contingency plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b978-15\">NL Industries offers three arguments in support of its motion to dismiss. First, it contends that a private party cannot incur response costs in a manner \u201cconsistent with the national contingency plan\u201d unless it acts pursuant to a cleanup program approved by a \u201clead agency,\u201d as defined in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.6 (1985). We agree with NL Industries that we should look to the national contingency plan that was in effect at the time that Kaplan allegedly incurred response costs, <em>see </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 300.1-.86 (1985), rather than to the current version, <em>see </em>50 Fed.Reg. 47,950-79 (1985). We have, however, already addressed and rejected the precise argument that NL Industries makes, <em>see Wickland, </em>792 F.2d at 891-92, and need not consider it further.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-16\">Second, NL Industries argues that Kaplan\u2019s response costs cannot be deemed \u201cnecessary\u201d since no lead agency approved the cleanup. NL Industries roots this argument entirely in provisions of the national contingency plan. <em>See, e.g., </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.64(a), (c) (1985). It therefore is simply a relabeling of NL Industries\u2019 first argument, and we reject it on the same basis. Kaplan has alleged that he was required by state and local agencies to incur the response costs that he seeks to recover from NL Industries. We find this allegation sufficient to support a claim that the incurrence of response costs was \u201cnecessary\u201d under section 107(a)(2)(B) of CERCLA. We express no view as to whether response costs not required by state and local agencies may also be \u201cnecessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b978-17\">Third, NL Industries contends that Kaplan did not incur response costs \u201cconsistent with the national contingency plan\u201d since it failed to report promptly the existence of a release of hazardous substances to the National Response Center, as required by 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.63(b) (1985). We have held, however, that <em>consistency </em>with the national contingency plan does not ne<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>cessitate <em>strict compliance </em>with its provisions. <em>Wickland, </em>792 F.2d at 891-92. The apparent purpose of the requirement that releases be reported promptly to the National Response Center is to facilitate the development by a lead agency of a coordinated governmental response. Since we have held in <em>Wickland </em>that private parties may incur costs consistent with the national contingency plan without acting pursuant to a cleanup program approved by a lead agency, it would make little sense for us to bar private party recovery under section 107(a) of CERCLA on the basis of failure to comply with 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.68(b) (1985). Therefore, we hold that noncompliance with this section does not alone render the incurrence of response costs inconsistent with the national contingency plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
