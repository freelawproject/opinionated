HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1441-5\">Gary Terrell, a public employee, was fired when his secret diary, which was critical of his supervisor, f\u00e9ll into the supervisor\u2019s hands. We hold that Terrell, if he \u201cspoke\u201d in the diary at all, spoke only as an employee and not as a citizen. Under <em>Connick v. Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138,103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983), he was not engaged in speech \u201cupon matters of public concern\u201d and was therefore not insulated by the first amendment from being fired for keeping the diary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-7\">In response to an anonymous complaint that appeared to come from an unhappy employee, the Director of Police for the University of Texas System conducted an investigation of the University\u2019s Houston Department in January 1981. The gist of the anonymous complaint was that Charles Price, the Houston Chief of University Police, did not have adequate control over a group of supervisors headed by Captain Gary Terrell and that these supervisors were guilty of harassment and favoritism in their relations with lower-level employees. On February 2, the Director filed a report concluding that there were serious management problems and indicating that the allegations in the anonymous complaint appeared to be true. Chief Price was given six months to cure the deficiencies and was told to file monthly status reports with the Director\u2019s office. In the wake of these minatory events, Chief Price relieved Captain Terrell of his patrol duties, assigned him to an office near the Chief\u2019s own office, and directed him to revise the department\u2019s policy and procedures manual.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-8\">On June 9, Chief Price received an anonymous letter accompanied by photocopies of pages from a small spiral-bound notepad. The notes, which were in Terrell\u2019s handwriting, showed that the author had been scrutinizing the chief\u2019s job performanee; indeed, many of the incidents recorded in the notepad reflected unfavorably on Price. On June 25, Chief Price called Terrell into his office to discuss a number of problems. In the course of the discussion, the chief asked Terrell whether he had been keeping files on him. Terrell denied it, and the chief said that he didn\u2019t feel he could trust him. Price asked for Terrell\u2019s resignation, Terrell refused, and the chief fired him. A few days later, according to one witness, Terrell was offered a hearing, but he replied \u201cthat that wouldn\u2019t be necessary; that he wasn\u2019t interested in our kangaroo courts ... and he would see us in court, a real court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-11\">True to his word, Terrell filed suit in federal court against the University of Texas System Police, the Houston Department, the Director of the System Police, and Chief Price. Terrell alleged that his discharge violated his free speech and due process rights under the first and fourteenth amendments; he asked for declaratory and injunctive relief as well as damages. After the usual procedural maneuvering, the case was tried to a jury. Responding to detailed special interrogatories, the jury found for the defendants on all issues except one. After being instructed that three\u2019 matters dealt with in the photocopied notepad (Chief Price\u2019s policy of mandatory overtime; the need for supervisory training; and the need to conduct exit interviews with employees who resigned) were issues of \u201cpublic concern\u201d protected by the first amendment, the jury determined that Terrell\u2019s exercise of protected first amendment rights was a substantial or motivating factor in the decision to terminate him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-12\">The jury determined that Terrell had suffered no damages, and the district court declined to award declaratory or injunctive relief. Judgment was entered for the defendants, and Terrell appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-14\">Although Terrell raises three issues on appeal, only one of them requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>extended discussion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He contends that the trial court erred in failing to use the jury\u2019s single finding in his favor \u2014 that he was terminated because of his first amendment activities \u2014 as the basis for an award of declaratory and injunctive relief. The defendants respond that the trial court misinterpreted <em>Connick v. Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983), and that it was error to instruct the jury that the comments in the notepad were addressed to matters of \u201cpublic concern\u201d for purposes of the appropriate first amendment analysis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree with the defendents, and we accordingly affirm the judgment of the district court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1442-4\">Assuming, without deciding, that an employee\u2019s personal notebook or diary can be considered first amendment \u201cspeech\u201d even though the contents come to light completely without the employee\u2019s knowledge or consent, we hold that Terrell\u2019s constitutional claim is barred by <em>Connick v. Myers. </em>In <em>Connick, </em>the Supreme Court held \u201cthat when a public employee speaks not <em>as a citizen </em>upon matters of public concern, but instead <em>as an employee </em>upon matters only of personal interest, absent the most unusual circumstances, a federal court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the wisdom of a personnel decision taken by a public agency allegedly in reaction to the employee\u2019s behavior.\u201d 103 S.Ct. at 1690 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). In determining whether a particular speech or writing addressed \u201ca matter of public concern,\u201d we must decide whether the plaintiff was \u201cdeprived of fundamental rights by virtue of working for the government.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because almost anything that occurs within a public agency <em>could </em>be of concern to the public, we do not focus on the inherent interest or importance of the matters discussed by the employee. Rather, our task is to decide whether the speech at issue in a particular case was made primarily in the plaintiff\u2019s role as citizen or primarily in his role as employee.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In making this determination, the mere fact that the topic of the employee\u2019s speech was one in which the public might or would have had a great interest is of little moment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1442-12\">In the light of these principles, it is plain that Gary Terrell\u2019s personal notebook cannot serve as the basis for a claim that he was fired for exercising his first amendment rights. He made no effort to commu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>nicate the contents of the notebook to the public, and the evidence does not suggest that he would have had any occasion to do so. The notes in question were made at a time when the Houston Department was already under investigation by the Director of the University System Police. That investigation, which was undertaken without any intervention from outside the government, had already suggested that Terrell himself was a leading cause of serious problems in the Houston Department. To whatever extent Terrell\u2019s notes suggested either that Chief Price had been guilty of mistakes or that Terrell was contemplating revelations that would be embarrassing to his supervisor, such suggestions were a wholly intragovernmental concern at the time Terrell was fired.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The conclusion is inescapable: Terrell was not terminated for speaking \u201cas a citizen upon matters of public concern.\u201d <em>Connick, </em>103 S.Ct. at 1690, or for \u201cspeak[ing] out as a citizen on a matter of general concern, <em>not tied to a personal employment dispute,\u201d id. </em>at 1691 n. 8 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1442-5\">. Terrell raises a qualified immunity issue that disappears in the light of our holding on the first amendment question. He also contends that the jury should not have believed the witness who testified that Terrell declined an offer of a post-termination hearing. The witness\u2019s testimony was sufficient to support a finding that Terrell waived whatever due process right he might have had to a hearing. <em>See Davis v. Vandiver, </em>494 F.2d 830, 832 (5th Cir.1974) (post-termination hearing is sufficient to satisfy due process requirements); <em>Bueno </em>v. <em>City of Donna, 714 </em>F.2d 484, 492-93 (5th Cir.1983) (waiver may be found where a person knowingly fails to take advantage of an actually existing opportunity for a hearing). The record does not show that the witness was lying, and this court does not review credibility choices made by juries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1442-6\">. Whether Terrell\u2019s speech was addressed to a matter of \u201cpublic concern\" is a legal question that the trial judge properly removed from the jury\u2019s consideration. On appeal, we make an independent review of the whole record in order to determine whether the district court properly resolved the question. <em>See Connick. </em>103 S.Ct. at 1690 &amp; n. 7, 1692 n. 10. <em>Cf. McPherson v. Rankin, </em>786 F.2d 1233, 1237 (5th Cir. 1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1442-13\">. When the judgment of the district court is correct, it may be affirmed on appeal for reasons other than those given or relied on below. <em>O\u2019Malley v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>776 F.2d 494, 499 n. 1 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1442-14\">. <em>Connick, </em>103 S.Ct. at 1690; <em>see also id. </em>(Constitution \"does not require a grant of immunity for employee grievances not afforded by the First Amendment to those who do not work for the State.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1442-15\">. <em>See id. </em>at 1691 (\"To presume that all matters which transpire within a government office are of public concern would mean that virtually every remark \u2014 and certainly every criticism directed at a public official \u2014 would plant the seed of a constitutional case.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1442-16\">. <em>See id. </em>at 1691 n. 8 (a writing \"not otherwise <em>of </em>public concern does not attain that status because its subject matter could, in different circumstances, have been the topic of a communication to the public that might be of general interest.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1443-26\">. This lawsuit did not call for a determination of whether Terrell deserved to be fired or whether Chief Price terminated him for self-serving purposes.
