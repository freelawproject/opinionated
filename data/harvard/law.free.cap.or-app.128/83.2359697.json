J.</author>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Defendant appeals from consecutive sentences imposed on his convictions of eight offenses in two separate cases. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">On June 4,1992, defendant was indicted for a series of offenses that he committed on May 27,1992 (the first case). Two months later, he was indicted for a series of offenses committed on May 18, 1992 (the second case). Under ORS 132.560(1) and (2),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the state moved to consolidate the cases. The court granted the motion but, after the court heard and denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, defendant waived jury in the first case and the trial court found defendant guilty on stipulated facts. A jury then convicted defendant in the second case.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The prosecutor then requested separate sentencing hearings. The trial court granted the motion over defendant\u2019s objection. In the first case, the court made departure findings and imposed a 260-month departure sentence on defendant\u2019s conviction for rape in the first degree, the \u201cprimary\u201d offense. It then imposed consecutive sentences on the remaining convictions for a total of 476 months. Two days later, the court sentenced defendant in the second case, imposing a 144-month departure sentence on defendant\u2019s conviction for burglary in the first degree, the \u201cprimary\u201d offense, and consecutive sentences on the other convictions for a total of 198 months. The court then ruled that the sentences in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>second case were to be served consecutive to those imposed in the first case.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Defendant argues that the sentences in the two cases are governed by the \u201c200/400 percent\u201d rule in OAR 253-12-020 and OAR 253-08-007. He argues that, under <em>State v. Miller, </em>317 Or 297, 855 P2d 1093 (1993), those rules do not apply if the sentences are imposed in separate sentencings for separate criminal episodes, but the rules do apply if the sentences arise from the same criminal episode.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">ORS 131.505(4) defines \u201ccriminal episode\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">\u201ccontinuous and uninterrupted conduct that establishes at least one offense and is so joined in time, place and circumstances that such conduct is directed to the accomplishment of a single criminal objective.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Defendant\u2019s convictions here did not arise from continuous and uninterrupted conduct. He contends, however, that by moving to join the two cases for trial, \u201cthe state implicity conceded that the 400 percent rule would apply at sentencing.\u201d His position is that <em>Miller </em>holds that OAR 253-12-020 implicitly incorporates ORS 132.560, the joinder statute, and that the 1989 amendments to ORS 132.560 expanded the grounds for joinder beyond requiring that the offenses arise out of the same act. He argues that those amendments are incorporated into ORS 132.560 under ORS 174.060,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, therefore, under <em>Miller, </em>OAR 253-12-020 applies to his cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">The state argues that the fact that the trial court consolidated the cases here does not determine when the limitations on consecutive sentences in OAR 253-12-020 apply. It contends that the record shows that the cases involved different criminal episodes and that the state\u2019s motion to consolidate did not allege that the offenses were part of the same act or transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>In <em>Miller, </em>the state argued that the limits of OAR 253-12-020 applied only to offenses arising from a single criminal episode because, when the rule was proposed, promulgated and adopted, only criminal acts arising from a single episode could be joined in one indictment under ORS 132.560(1). 317 Or at 303. In accepting the state\u2019s position, the Supreme Court noted that the legislature considered and adopted the expanded joinder bill in the same session as the guidelines, that it was aware of the relationship of the two bills but \u201cdid not alter the 200 percent rule to apply it to sentencing on separate criminal episodes.\u201d 317 Or at 305. We do not agree with defendant that that discussion in <em>Miller </em>stands for the proposition that joinder for purposes of an indictment determines the limitations of consecutive sentences. The court expressly held that \u201c[tjhe 200 percent rule does not apply to sentences derived from different criminal episodes.\u201d 317 Or at 306. Defendant\u2019s sentences here derived from different criminal episodes. The court did not err in imposing consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b117-7\"> ORS 132.560 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-8\">\u201c(1) A charging instrument must charge but one offense, and in one form only, except that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-9\">\u201c(a) Where the offense may be committed by the use of different means, the charging instrument may allege the means in the alternative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-10\">\u201c(b) Two or more offenses may be charged in the same charging instrument in a separate county for each offense if the offenses charged are alleged to have been committed by the same person or persons and are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-11\">\u201c(A) Of the same or similar character;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-12\">\u201c(B) Based on the same act or transaction; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-13\">\u201c(C) Based on two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-14\">\u201c(2) If two or more charging instruments are found in circumstances described in subsection (l)(b) of this section, the court may order them to be consolidated.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b118-9\"> ORS 174.060 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-10\">\u201cWhen one statute refers to another, either by general or by specific reference or designation, the reference shall extend to and include, in addition to the statute to which reference was made, amendments thereto and statutes enacted expressly in lieu thereof unless a contrary intent is expressed specifically or unless the amendment to, or statute enacted in lieu of, the statute referred to is substantially different in the nature of its essential provisions from what the statute to which reference was made was when the statute making the reference was enacted.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
