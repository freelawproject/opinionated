Swallow, on May 19, 1862, entered into the marriage contract, the substance of which is stated above; that the executors were ready to pay all moneys and perform all things provided to be paid or performed in the contract; that the defendant had presented to the Probate Court a petition for an allowance out of the estate of the deceased, and claimed dower and her distributive share of the estate, in violation of the antenuptial contract. The prayer of the bill, was that the antenuptial contract might be enforced inequity, and that the defendant might be enjoined from prosecuting her petition, or claiming dower, or any other right in the estate of the deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-6\">The answer admitted that she signed the antenuptial contract, which was dated May 19, 1862, and that she was married to said Ellis Blackinton, May 21, 1862, and alleged that at that time her age was 64, and his 80. That May 20, 1862, he offered the antenuptial contract to her for her signature, saying he had put only $100 into it; that she then objected to signing it; \u201c that thereupon he said that he wanted her to place confidence in him, for the instrument was all right, and that if she would sign it that night, that as soon as they were married, he would make ample provision for her support, as long as she should live, and that she should never have cause to regret that she signed it; \u201d '\"hat thereupon,, relying upon him that he would comply with his promise, she signed the contract; but that though often requested to make the promised provision, he died without having made any other provision for her than was set out in the contract; that the agreement to make further, and adequate provision, after the marriage, for her support for life, in case she should survive him, was the principal of \u201c the other considerations not expressed \u201d referred to in the contract, and was an essential consideration for the mak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>mg of ifc by her, and was never performed by him. She admitted that she had filed a petition for an allowance, and that she intended to claim dower.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-5\">Two issues were, in that suit, submitted to the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-6\">1. \u201c Was one of the \u2018 other considerations understood between the parties \u2019 (and referred to in the marriage contract in question, but not expressed \u2019 therein, a promise by said Ellis Blackinton to make, after the marriage, further and adequate provision for the maintenance of the said Alice S., for life, after the decease of the said Ellis, in the event of her surviving him ? \u201d To this the jury answered, \u201c Yes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-7\">2. \u201c Was the execution of the marriage agreement on the part of the said Alice S. Blackinton, the defendant, procured and brought about by fraud and misrepresentation practised upon the defendant by the said Ellis Blackinton ? \u201d To this the jury answered, \u201c No.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-8\">The court thereupon ordered the bill to be dismissed, and the plaintiffs appealed. Upon the appeal the order was affirmed, and the following entry was made, \u201c and now it is ordered that the bill be dismissed with costs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-9\">The plaintiffs contended in this suit that the facts that the defendant had obtained a decree of the Court of Probate for an allowance to her, as widow, from the estate, and had brought an action for its recovery, and had brought a writ of dower, and filed a petition for the setting off to her of a homestead, all of which things were admitted, constituted a breach of the contract, and entitled the plaintiffs to a verdict, but the court ruled otherwise. The plaintiffs offered to prove that they, as executors, had offered ';o perform everything specified to be done on their part in the contract; but the court rejected the evidence, and ruled and instructed the jury that the rights, if any, which the executors had under the contract, must be enforced in equity ; that the finding and decree in the suit in equity were conclusive : and that there was no evidence in the case to warrant them in finding a verdict for the plaintiffs. The jury returned a verdict for the defendant, and the plaintiffs alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number><em>G.

Rutlin, 2 Exch. 665 ; <em>Beere </em>v. Fleming, 13 Irish C.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKc\">The issues raised by the pleadings in the suit in equity between the parties to the present action were, 1st, whether one of the considerations, referred to but not expressed in the antenuptial contract, was a promise of the husband to make, after the marriage, further and adequate provision for the maintenance of the wife, in the event of her surviving him ; 2d, whether the execution of the antenuptial contract by the wife was procured by fraud and misrepresentation of the husband. Those issues were submitted by the court to the jury in that case. The jury answered the second issue in favor of the plaintiffs, and the first in favor of the defendant. The record of that suit shows that the court thereupon, without a hearing upon any other question, entered a final decree dismissing the bill, with costs, and that that decree was not expressed to be without prejudice to an action at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">The necessary conclusion is, that the adjudication of that case proceeded upon the ground that the husband had made, and had not performed, such a promise. The final decree in the suit in equity is therefore conclusive evidence of that fact in the present action. <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>Winsor, </em>1 Gray, 299, 301. <em>Foote </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>Ib. 412. <em>Durant </em>v. <em>Essex Co. </em>8 Allen, 103. <em>Same </em>v. <em>Same, </em>7 Wall. 107. <em>Foster </em>v. <em>The Richard Busteed, </em>100 Mass. 409, 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The agreement of the wife not to claim any share in the husband\u2019s estate was manifestly intended to be dependent upon his agreement to make provision for her; and he having failed to perform his agreement by any instrument executed in his lifetime, his representatives cannot maintain an action against the wife, for asserting the rights which the law gives her, in the absence of any such agreement, after his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>As this point is decisive of the case, it is unnecessary to consider whether the wife under any circumstances can be sued at law upon a contract of this character. See <em>Blackinton </em>v. <em>Black</em>inton, 110 Mass, <em>461; Jenkins </em>v. <em>Holt, </em>109 Mass. 261, and cases there cited. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
