There was never any division of the road into sections, nor any point in Princeton fixed upon as the termination of the first section and the commencement of the second and third sections, except as here stated ; but more money was expended on the construction of the road between the Worcester terminus and the point of division in Princeton, than was subscribed for the first section, including the plaintiff\u2019s subscription; the balance being obtained by loans and by general subscriptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-5\">The third section has never been built or located, and no stock has ever been subscribed for it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-6\">At the date of this first assessment, more than two thousand shares had been subscribed for the first and second sections; but less than eight thousand shares in all have ever been subscribed for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-7\">At the date of the first assessment no part of the stock had been paid in, and no work had been done on the road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-8\">Upon these facts judgment was to be entered for the plaintiff for the whole or any part of said assessments, or for the defendant, as the court should determine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-9\">The court entered judgment for the defendant, and the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b99-10\"><em>W.

The by-laws made by the stockholders, May 19, 1847, fixing the number of the shares at seven thousand, and the by-laws made by the same body, August 3, 1851; reducing the number to six thousand, were void. The number- of shares was never lawfully determined until the vote of the directors passed January 4, 1870, by which the number was fixed at eight thousand. Angell &amp; Ames on Corp. \u00a7 343. The whole number of shares fixed by the directors having never been subscribed for, the directors had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>no authority to make the assessments. <em>Salem Mill Dam Co. </em>v. <em>Ropes, </em>6 Pick. 23; <em>S.

The original divisions upon the location fixed in 1848 were never adopted by the directors or the company, after the act of 1853. <em>Agricultural Branch Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Winchester, </em>13 Allen, 29. If the right to build one section by itself required the corporation to raise a separate capital stock for that section only, it has failed to divide its road into sections. If the capital subscribed in performance of this condition was general capital, it had no right to make assessments on the \u201c shares subscribed on both sections \u201d alone, not including those Subscribed as part of the general stock of the road.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-7\">The subscription to the stock of the road made by the contractor was not a lawful contract under Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>63, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8. The law requires an actual cash payment. The twenty per cent, is to be \u201c actually paid into its treasury.\u201d Section 8 prohibits the issue of stock for less than the par value, \u201c to be actually paid in on each share.\u201d The contractor pays for his stock in road building or in the profits of road building. The substance of the transaction is not affected by the form of a subscription or assessment. The assessments on the defendant\u2019s stock are not equal assessments within the meaning of Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>63, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-8\">By the terms of the subscription paper, no action can be maintained for the assessments unless the shares are first sold by the directors and a less sum than the amount assessed is realized from the sale. <em>Lexington &amp; West Cambridge Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Chandler, </em>13 Met. 311.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b100-9\">Morton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6A\">The original charter authorized the plaintiff to build a road from Worcester through Princeton to Barre, and also a road from Princeton to Gardner. It provided that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>capital stock should not exceed ten thousand shares, the number to be determined from time to time by the directors, and that no assessment should be laid thereon greater in the whole than $100 on each share. St. 1847, <em>c. </em>276. By the act of 1853, <em>c. </em>336, \u00a7 2, it is provided that the corporation may \u201c construct their road by sections ; \u201d the first section to extend from Worcester to Princeton ; the second from Princeton to Gardner, and the third from Princeton to Barre; and that \u201c after it has commenced the construction of the first section,\u201d it \u201c may construct either or both of the second and third sections, or so much of the third section as it may think proper, subject to the provisions hereinafter contained as to capital stock.\u201d The fifth section provides that the corporation may commence the construction of the first section whenever two thousand shares of the capital named in the act of incorporation shall have been subscribed for by responsible parties, and twenty per cent, on such shares paid in and a certificate thereof filed with the secretary of the Commonwealth; and that it may \u201c also commence the construction of either the second or third sections of its railroad, whenever two thousand shares of said stock (additional) shall have been subscribed for such section, and twenty per cent, paid thereon and a certificate thereof filed as hereinbefore provided.\u201d No further change was made in the plaintiff\u2019s charter before the defendant subscribed, except that from time to time laws were passed extending the time allowed for constructing the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">1. The defendant contends that he is not liable under his subscription until the directors have fixed the number of shares and such shares have been subscribed for ; and relies upon <em>Salem Mill Dam Corporation </em>v. Ropes, 6 Pick. 23, and the later cases to the same effect cited by him. But the provisions of the charter above cited take this case out of the principle of those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The provision, that the corporation may commence the construction of the first section when two thousand shares are subscribed, by implication gives the corporation the right to assess the shares when they reach the number thus fixed. The defendant subscribed with reference to this provision and assented to it. His promise to pay assessments, therefore, was upon the condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>tion that he would pay when two thousand shares were subscribed according to the charter and the terms of the subscription paper. If this condition has been fulfilled he is liable on his contract, and the question whether the number of shares was legally fixed, before the assessments were laid is immaterial for the purposes of this case. This point was substantially decided in <em>Lexington &amp; West Cambridge Railroad Co. </em>v. Chandler, 13 Met. 311. See also <em>Penobscot &amp; Kennebec Railroad Co. </em>v. Bartlett, 12 Gray, 244. It appears by the agreed facts that, before the first assessment was laid, more than two thousand shares had been subscribed for each of the first and second sections, and it follows that the corporation had a right to lay and collect assessments, upon the stock subscribed for by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">2. The defendant contends that he is released from his liability to pay the assessments upon his stock by the contract made by the corporation with Cooke &amp; Co. By this contract Cooke <em>&amp; </em>Co. agreed to build the first and second sections of the road, it being stipulated that ten per cent, of the amount to be paid them should be paid in the capital stock of the corporation at its par value.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">At the time of executing the contract Cooke &amp; Co. subscribed for a number of shares equal to said ten per cent., divided between the first and second sections. This contract was made after the first assessment had been laid, and after two thousand shares had been subscribed for - each of the first and second sections, and therefore after the liability of the defendant according to the conditions of his promise, had become fixed. The stock subscribed for by Cooke &amp; Co. was not needed to make up. the number of two thousand shares required to be taken before assessments could be made. The case thus differs from <em>Troy &amp; Greenfield Railroad Co. </em>v. Newton, 8 Gray, 596, as also in the fact that the subscription of Cooke &amp; Co. appears to have been an absolute subscription for the stock at par. The contract with Cooke &amp; Co. was made in good faith and was fully performed by them ; there is nothing to show that all the assessments were not duly made on the stock subscribed for by them; if such assessments were paid by offsetting a debt due by the company for building the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>road, it was to all purposes equivalent to a cash payment. It did not vitiate any condition upon which the defendant agreed to take his stock, in no way injured him, and would not invalidate his previous subscription.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">3. The objection that the road was not divided into sections, as contemplated by the subscription paper, cannot be sustained. The corporation in its original location filed in 1848 divided the road into \u201c divisions,\u201d and in the contract with Cooke &amp; Co. and the other acts of the corporation, these divisions were recognized and acted upon as the sections by which the road was to be built under the act of 1853. The road was in fact built by these divisions. The fact that in the relocation filed in 1871, after all the assessments sued for had been made, the corporation neglected to indicate any point in Princeton as the end of the first section, was at most a formal irregularity, which could not defeat the liability of the defendant to pay his assessments according to his promise. It violated no condition upon which the promise was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">4. The defendant further contends that by the terms of the subscription paper no action can be maintained for the assessments unless the shares are first sold by the directors and a less sum than the amount assessed is realized from the sale. But such are not the terms of the subscription paper. It contains an express promise to pay all the assessments to the amount of one hundred dollars per share. The additional clause authorizing the directors to sell the stock in case of neglect to pay assessments, and promising to pay the deficiency if the stock sells for less than one hundred dollars per share, does not affect the first express promise, but gives the directors the alternative to sue upon the promise or proceed under the statute and sell the stock and recover of the subscribers the deficiency. <em>City Hotel </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>6 Gray, 586. The result of the whole case is that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover all of the assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiffs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
