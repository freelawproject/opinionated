Based on immunity, the city manager and city councilmen (Defendants) \u2014 but not the City of Atlanta \u2014 filed motions to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. Defendants appeal the district court\u2019s denial of these motions. We dismiss the appeal, in part, and reverse and remand, in part,</p>\n<p id=\"A-h\">j</p>\n<p id=\"b141-22\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b141-23\">In April 1989, Atlanta promoted Jackson, a black male, to the position of Fire Chief in the Atlanta Fire Department (Department). In December 1992, Jackson was terminated by Jim Long, the city manager. In explanation, Long cited animosity, low morale, and disharmony within the Department. Additionally, Long cited Jackson\u2019s refusal to allow a subordinate to use the Department\u2019s vehicle that is assigned to the Fire Chief. Jackson, the only black department head in Atlanta, thought that racial prejudice might have motivated his termination and requested a hearing before the Atlanta City Council (Council). After hearing his complaints in executive session, the Council announced that it had voted not to reinstate Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-24\">Jackson then filed the instant suit in federal district court, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>causes of action for racial discrimination under both Title VII and \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Jackson does not dispute that these two federal claims arise out of identical fact situations and identical allegations of racial discrimination. On both claims, the Defendants filed motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim or, in the alternative, for a summary judgment of dismissal. With respect to the \u00a7 1983 claim, these motions were based on qualified immunity. The district court denied all motions, stating that (1) Jackson had stated claims under both Title VII and \u00a7 1983, and (2) the existence of genuine issues of fact precluded summary judgment on both claims. The Defendants timely filed this interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">A. JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Before addressing the substantive issues in this appeal, we examine the basis for our jurisdiction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On appeal, the Defendants challenge two aspects of the district court\u2019s order; First, they urge that the Title VII claims against them should have been dismissed, through either Rule 12(b)(6) or summary judgment. In like manner, they contend that the \u00a7 1983 claims against them should have been dismissed, through either Rule 12(b)(6) or summary judgment based on qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Generally, we do not have interlocutory jurisdiction over the denial of either a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment, as such pretrial orders are not \u201cfinal decisions\u201d for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Denials of motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment in the Title VII context are non-final pretrial orders. Consequently, in this interlocutory appeal, we do not have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s order denying the Defendants\u2019 pretrial motions to dismiss or for summary judgment in Jackson\u2019s Title VII claims. We neither express nor imply an opinion on the merits of Jackson\u2019s Title VII claims; we simply dismiss the Title VII facet of this appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction and remand these claims for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-14\">Jackson\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims are another matter altogether. In <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201ca district court\u2019s denial of a claim of qualified immunity, to the extent that it turns on an issue of law, is an appealable \u2018final decision\u2019 within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Recently, in <em>Johnson v. Jones,</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court made clear that our interlocutory jurisdiction under <em>Mitchell </em>begins and ends with the \u201cpurely legal\u201d aspects of quali fied immunity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court reiterated the dichotomy in the grounds for denying a motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity: \u201c(a) a determination about pre-existing \u2018clearly established\u2019 law, or (b) a\u2019determination about \u2018genuine\u2019 issues of fact for trial.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Court then held that we have jurisdiction over the former, a purely-law-based denial of qualified immunity, but that we have no jurisdiction over the latter, a genuine-issue-of-fact-based denial of qualified immunity.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It follows that when we determine that a district court\u2019s order denying qualified immunity turns on \u201cpurely legal\u201d grounds, we have jurisdiction to review it; but, when the district court\u2019s denial turns on the existence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>factual dispute, we have no jurisdiction and must dismiss the appeal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">B. When \u00a7 1983 and Title VII Meet</p>\n<p id=\"AV_\">Asserting a \u201cpurely legal\u201d error, the Defendants contend that allegations of discriminatory treatment in connection with public employment that form the basis of a Title VII claim cannot form the basis of a second, separate claim under \u00a7 1983 as well. We agree. In <em>Irby v. </em>Sullivan,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we held that a violation of Title VII cannot also support a \u00a7 1983 suit.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Section 1983 does not create any substantive rights; it creates only a remedy for the violation of a substantive federal right.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, \u00a7 1983 is not available when \u201cthe governing statute provides an exclusive remedy for violations of its terms.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The governing statute, Title VII in this case, provides Jackson\u2019s exclusive remedy.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Congress intended for Title VII \u2014 with its own substantive requirements, procedural rules, and remedies \u2014 to be the exclusive means by which an employee may pursue a discrimination claim. Allowing a plaintiff to state a discrimination claim under \u00a7 1983 as well would enable him to sidestep the detailed and specific provisions of Title VII.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In denying Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Jackson\u2019s Title VII claims under Rule 12(b)(6), the district court necessarily determined that Jackson\u2019s allegations of racial discrimination are sufficient to establish a clear violation of Title VII and thus a clear deprivation of a federal right. Consequently, \u00a7 1983 is not available to Jackson for either alternative or additional relief. As Jackson thus has no access to a remedy under \u00a7 1983, it follows that he may not assert such a claim. Thus, Jackson\u2019s putative \u00a7 1983 claims, arising as they do from precisely the same allegedly discriminatory acts as do his Title VII claims, should have been dismissed. Accordingly, we remand Jackson\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims against the Defendants to the district court with the instruction to dismiss them.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">C. OtheR Alleged Errors</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">The Defendants urge an additional error which has now been rendered moot by our holding in the preceding paragraph. We refer to the Defendants\u2019 insistence that, in addition to qualified immunity, they are entitled to absolute legislative immunity. It is well established that immunity, be it absolute or qualified, is an affirmative defense available to public officials sued under \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As we remand Jackson\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims with instructions for their dismissal, the Defendants no longer need the shelter of absolute immunity. Accordingly, we dismiss as moot all appellate issues arising from the Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>dants\u2019 assertion of the affirmative defense of absolute immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-19\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b144-20\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b144-21\">For the forgoing reasons, the Defendants\u2019 interlocutory appeal of the district court\u2019s refusal to dismiss Jackson\u2019s Title VII claims are DISMISSED for want of jurisdiction. The same fate is appropriate for Defendants\u2019 defense of absolute immunity, albeit on grounds of mootness. The district court\u2019s order denying Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Jackson\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims, however, is REVERSED and REMANDED with instructions to dismiss such claims against the Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-22\">DISMISSED in part; REVERSED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-17\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b141-18\">. Jackson also asserted supplemental state law claims for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. As this is an interlocutory appeal of an immunity defense to a \u00a7 1983 claim, we have no jurisdiction over those issues at this early juncture in the litigation. <em>See Tamez v.
