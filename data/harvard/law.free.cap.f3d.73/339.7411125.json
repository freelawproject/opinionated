AppeEant asserted in a letter to AppeEee, dated May 28, 1993, that AppeEee was an employer subject to withdrawal EabEity under Section 3(5) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.CA. \u00a7\u00a7 1001-1461 (West 1985 &amp; Supp.1995), and demanded payment of such withdrawal EabEity. AppeEee filed an action seeking declaratory judgment that it was not subject to withdrawal EabEity on grounds that it was not an \u201cemployer\u201d within the meaning of ERISA as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act (\u201cMPPAA\u201d), 29 U.S.CA. \u00a7\u00a7 1381-1453 (West 1985 &amp; Supp.1995). AppeEant answered and counterclaimed to collect Appel-lee\u2019s aEeged withdrawal EabEity. Both sides moved for summary judgment, and the district court granted summary judgment in favor of AppeEee.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-17\">This appeal presents a straightforward question of law: whether AppeEee is an \u201cemployer\u201d for purposes of ERISA, as amended by the MPPAA, even though AppeEee is not contractuaEy obEgated to contribute to AppeEant.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-18\">AppeEant argues essentiaEy that because AppeEee bears some of the haEmarks of a common law \u201cemployer,\u201d AppeEee should be considered an \u201cemployer\u201d under the MPPAA. The definition of \u201cemployer,\u201d however, is a matter of federal law. <em>See Carriers Containers Council v. Mobile S.S. Ass\u2019n, </em>896 F.2d 1330, 1343 (11th Cir.1990). In <em>Carriers Containers, </em>this Court adopted the \u201ccontributing obEgor\u201d test for determining whether an entity is an \u201cemployer\u201d under the MPPAA. A \u201ccontributing obEgor\u201d is one who is \u201cobEgated to contribute to a plan for the benefit of a plan\u2019s participants.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-19\">We are persuaded by the Eighth Circuit\u2019s appEcation of the \u201ccontributing obEgor\u201d test under circumstances nearly identical to this case. <em>See Seaway Port Authority of Duluth v. Duluth-Swperior ILA Marine Ass\u2019n Restated Pension Plan, </em>920 F.2d 503 (8th Cir.1990). In <em>Seaway, </em>the Eighth Circuit held that a party must be contractuaEy bound to make pension contributions in order to be an \u201cemployer\u201d under MPPAA. <em>Id. </em>at 509. We beEeve that this is the best reading of <em>Carriers Containers </em>and is consistent with the treatment that other Circuits have given to withdrawal EabEity under ERISA as amended by MPPAA</p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Accordingly, we conclude that this appeal is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
