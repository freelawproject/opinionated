A loan for the specific purpose of paying off a lien on land creates no equity of subrogation in favor of him who loans the money to remove the lien. <em>(Wooldridge </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>69 Mo. 669; <em>Price </em>v. <em>Courtney, </em>87 Mo. 395; 56 Am. Rep. 453.) Since the Richards mortgage, and without knowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>his alleged secret equities, respondents changed their position. To permit the subrogation would work them a great injustice. As the doctrine of subrogation is purely an equitable one, it will be denied where it would work an injustice to the rights of others. <em>(Cassidy </em>v. <em>Keely, </em>13 Phila. 112; <em>Keely </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>93 Pa.

His contention is, that by virtue of his agreement with Bunnel and the payment and discharge of the St. Sure mortgage, he was subrogated to all the rights of St. Sure, and that the lien which was superior to the lien of the judgment, though changed in form, still subsists.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">It will be observed that there is no averment of fraud, accident, or mistake, or of any real or colorable necessity on the part of plaintiff to pay the St. Sure mortgage, in order to protect his own interests. Plaintiff was a mere volunteer party to the transaction. It is not claimed that Griffith &amp; Stose had any notice of the agreement between plaintiff and Bunnel, or of the fact that plaintiff paid off the St. Sure mortgage with money procured from Bunnel. At the time they purchased the land, the St. Sure mortgage was satisfied and canceled of record. Before they were informed of the facts upon which appellant relies for subrogation, they changed their position. They purchased the property in good faith, for a valuable consideration, without notice of appellant\u2019s claim that there was a lien superior to their judgment lien. We cannot say whether they would have paid $316.60, or any other sum, for the property if they had known of plaintiff\u2019s claim, but it is sufficient to say, they did change their position before they had' any notice of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">We think the learned judge of the court below, in reviewing the authorities, correctly held that this case falls within the principle discussed and applied in <em>Persons </em>v. <em>Shaeffer, </em>65 Cal. 79. It was there held that a lien will be kept alive, under some circumstances, in favor of one who has paid the lien-holder, although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>latter has satisfied and discharged it of record; but that where the equity is a latent one, the lien will not be kept alive to the prejudice of a subsequent <em>bona fide </em>purchaser.

Jur., p. 102, sec, 658.)</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Harrison, J., and Garoutte, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
