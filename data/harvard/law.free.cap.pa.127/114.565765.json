Brice, against John F. Blymyer. Tbe plea was payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-10\">At the trial on February 18,1888, before Baer, P. J., there was a verdict for tbe defendant and judgment thereon, followed by a writ of error to No. 30 July Term 1888, Sup. Ct., wherein the judgment was reversed, and a venire facias de novo awarded: Colvin v. Blymyer, 121 Pa. 582.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-11\">At the second trial on November 26, 1888, the plaintiff put in evidence tbe mortgage and bond of John F. Blymyer to John EL Brice, dated December 26, 1879, for $5,000, assigned on September 20, 1880, to William Colvin, with credits, and rested. The following facts were tlien made to appear:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-12\">In September, 1879, certain real estate was advertised to be sold at sheriff\u2019s sale which JolmF. Blymyer wished to purchase. To enable him to make the purchase, John TI. Brice agreed to loan him $5,000, to be secured by bond and mortgage upon tbe land when he had obtained the title. For this loan Brice was to receive a bonus of $300. The sheriff\u2019s sale was made and the property knocked down to Blymyer. To obtain the sheriff\u2019s deed, it was then arranged that Blymyer should give his jugment note to Brice, who would advance tbe money and enter judgment on the'note, as a temporary arrangement until the bond and mortgage could be prepared and delivered, wlien the judgment was to be satisfied. The judgment note for $5,000 was executed and delivered by Blymyer to Brice on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>September 22, 1879, the whole of the $5,000 paid by Brice to the sheriff, and on September 24,1879,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> judgment was entered on the note to No. 26 November Term 1889.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-5\">On December 19, 1879, Brice called upon Blymyer for the bonus to be paid for the loan of the $5,000, when Blymyer not having the money, gave to Brice a judgment note for $300, payable January 1, 1880, $100; February 1, 1880, $100; March 1, 1880, $100. Judgment was not entered on this note, but it was paid off by Blymyer as follows: December 23, 1879, $100; January 30, 1880, $100; March 1, 1880, $100.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-6\">On December 26, 1879, to carry out the arrangement originally made, Blymyer executed in favor of Brice a new bond for $5,000, and a mortgage securing it upon the property purchased at sheriff\u2019s sale. This bond and mortgage were delivered to Brice on January 12, 1880, and recorded the same day. On January 13th, the judgment for $5,000 entered to No. 26 November Term 1879 was marked as follows: \u201cJanuary 13, 1880. This judgment satisfied by mortgage given to me January 12, 1880. John H. Brice.\u201d On September 20, 1880, Brice assigned the bond and mortgage to William Colvin, the plaintiff in this suit, who purchased without inquiry of the mortgagor. Blymyer paid to Colvin the debt and interest upon the bond and mortgage, less credit claimed for the payments made on the note of December 19, 1879, for $300.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-7\">The court, Baer, P. J., charged the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-8\">The plaintiff in this suit seeks to recover a balance due on a judgment, amounting at this time, as he claims, to $185.92.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-9\">This case was tried before, and then the controversy was as to three payments of $100 each, which had not been allowed. We directed the jury then to give credit for those three pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>ments, because, though they were called a bonus, they were in reality money paid as usury. The Supreme Court affirmed us as to this being usury, but they say we erred in allowing $300 instead of $200, inasmuch as the first $100 paid, though usury, could not be set off as a payment in this judgment. But as to this, the counsel for the defendant holds that the Supreme Court were led into error by a misprint in the paper books, and now contends that he is entitled to have a credit for the $100 excluded by the Supreme Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-5\">From the opinion of that court an error does appear. It was assumed by that court that the original judgment for $5,000 was entered on December' 24, 1879, and that the $100, now contended for, was paid the day before the entry; whereas in point of fact the judgment was entered three months earlier, namely, on September 24,1879, and before the $100 were paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-6\">We need not inquire whether the court above based its ruling upon the fact there appearing, the payment of the $100 before the entry of the judgment, or on the apparent fact that it was paid before the judgment was marked satisfied, because we are not a court of error, but that court is. They can supervise our rulings; we cannot supervise theirs. [Therefore, as they held that this court should have instructed the jury that the defendant was only entitled to a credit for two payments made, namely, one on January 30, 1880, and one on March 1, 1880, of $100 each, we must and now do instruct you that the defendant is only entitled to credit for the two payments of $100 each, which were made, respectively, on January 30, 1880, and on March 1, 1880 ; and that, after applying these credits to the amount appearing due after all the undisputed credits have been allowed, the plaintiff will be entitled to a verdict \u25a0for such sum as remains unpaid, interest being computed until this day.] 1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-7\">[A calculation is made which shows a balance of $185.92. The plaintiff\u2019s calculation seems to be correct, on the basis of this charge, and your verdict must, therefore, be for the plaintiff for the amount found to be unpaid, which is $185.92.] 8</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-8\">If the Supreme Court assumed facts which were erroneous, and if it affected their ruling, the defendant will have a standing in that court, on motion for a modification of its decree, though he may lose his case here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for $185.92.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-5\">A rule for a new trial having been discharged, judgment was entered on the verdict, when the defendant took this writ, assigning for error:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-6\">1, 2.

The correction of this error places the $100 paid December 23, 1879, upon the same footing as the succeeding payments of $100 each, made January 30 and March 1, 1880, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">All of these three payments were made after judgment had been confessed on the original bond; and, as the $300 note, given as a bonus, must be treated as a device to evade the usury laws, these payments upon it must be treated as payments upon the original debt. The bond and mortgage were given for the same debt as the judgment; the transaction was a mere change of securities for the same loan, and the law will apply the payments of usurious interest as payments upon the principal. Had this error of counsel, or of the printer, as the case may be, been called to our attention, we would have modified our opinion, and entered a judgment in accordance with the real facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-14\">The judgment is reversed, and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b142-15\"> Plaintiff in error, in that case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
