Fair against the First National Bank of Warren, the plaintiff filed bis statement of claim, setting forth that tbe defendant bank bad held a judgment for $625, entered in the Court of Common Pleas of Warren county, against Frank O\u2019Connor and Edward Reid; tliat this judgment was given to secure six notes, aggregating $625, which said bank had discounted for O\u2019Connor and Reid, and it was a lien upon a certain tract of land in said county; tliat subsequent to its entry tbe plaintiff purchased said land from O\u2019Connor and Reid, and paid the full purchase price thereof, iii ignorance of tbe existence of this lien ; that before the issuing of the execution mentioned below, O\u2019Connor and Reid had paid to the bank \u201c $300, which was to apply'on the said judgment,\u201d paying off three of the notes to secure which the judgment was given, \u201c and which should have been credited on said judgment, as of the dates the same were paid,\u201d but that no credit was ever entered on tbe judgment for said $300 ; that subsequently an execution was issued on said judgment and tbe land purchased by Fair from O\u2019Connor and Reid was levied on and sold as the property of the latter; that at the time of the sale there remained due to the bank upon the judgment, as debt and interest, the sum of $335 only, but the bank received from tbe sheriff the sum of $461.35, tbe balance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>of proceeds of sale after paying costs, of which balance the sum of $126.35 belonged to the plaintiff Fair, \u201c who was the owner of said land, subject to what was justly due on said judgment; \u201d that no claim for this was made at the time by plaintiff, because he was unaware that anything had been paid on the judgment, but, as soon as he learned of the payment of the $300 above mentioned, he demanded of the bank the sum of $126.35, and interest thereon, payment of which was refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-5\">An affidavit of defence made by the cashier of the defendant bank and filed, averred that the money paid to the defendant by the sheriff, and claimed by the plaintiff, \u201c was made by the said sheriff upon lawful process, issued from this court against Frank O\u2019Connor and Edward Reid for that purpose, and paid to the defendant by the said sheriff; that the said money was received by the said defendant upon the indebtedness to it from said O\u2019Connor and Reid, and that the same did not pay all their indebtedness to said bank, but there was still a balance due it from them, which has been paid since by indorsers.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-6\">A rule taken for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, was made absolute, November 17, 1888, Brown, P. J., delivering the opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-7\">The defendant had a judgment against O\u2019Connor and Reid. After the entry of the judgment the plaintiff purchased from O\u2019Connor and Reid certain real estate on which defendant\u2019s judgment was a lien, but in ignorance of that fact he paid the full amount of the purchase money. The defendant issued execution on its judgment, by virtue of which said real estate was sold, and the proceeds paid to defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-8\">The plaintiff alleges that at the time of the sheriff\u2019s sale he did not know that anything had been paid on defendant\u2019s judgment against O\u2019Connor and Reid, and hence did not make any demand on the sheriff for the amount of the proceeds of sale belonging to him; that afterwards he learned that O\u2019Connor and Reid had paid the defendant on its judgment the sum of $300 which had not been credited; that of the proceeds of the sale of the said real estate the defendant received the sum of $461.35, when it was only entitled to $335; that for the dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>ference of $126.35 he made demand on defendant for payment which was refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-5\">The statement of plaintiff\u2019s claim sets forth in substance the facts recited, and the affidavit does not deny them. It does not deny the allegation in plaintiff\u2019s statement that the defendant had received from the proceeds of the sheriff\u2019s sale 1126.35 more than was due on its judgment, but asserts that the money was received on the indebtedness to it of O\u2019Connor and Reid, and that it did not pay all their indebtedness, \u201c but there was still a balance due it from them, which has been since paid by indorsers.\u201d We think the affidavit is insufficient, and the rule to show cause why judgment should be entered against defendant is made absolute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-6\">Judgment having been entered in favor of the plaintiff for $159.62, the defendant took this writ, specifying that the court erred:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-7\">1. In entering judgment against the defendant for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-8\">2. In holding that the plaintiff could recover upon the cause of action set forth in his statement.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b351-9\"><em>Mr. D. I. Ball </em>(with him <em>Mr. C. C. </em>Thompson), for the plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-10\">There are three reasons why the judgment should be reversed : (1) The money sued for was collected by process of law and applied on the indebtedness of the bank against the parties as whose property the money was made and paid over, without any fraud, and therefore it cannot be recovered back: Federal Ins. Co. v. Robinson, 82 Pa. 359 ; Herring v. Adams, 5 W. &amp; S. 461 ; Mann\u2019s App., 1 Pa. 29 ; Boas v. Updegrove, 5 Pa. 516. (2) Even if recoverable, the money must be sued for by the sheriff who paid it, and not by this plaintiff: Longenecker v. Zeigler, 1 W. 252 ; Finnel v. Brew, 81 Pa. 365. (3) The justice had no jurisdiction. There being neither privity nor contractual relation between the bank and Mr. Fair, his rights against it, if he have any, do not arise from contract, and liis remedy is case, of which the justice does not have jurisdiction: Schaffer v. McNamee, 13 S. &amp; R. 44 ; Zeigler v. Gram, 13 S. &amp; R. 103. It is due to the court below to say that this question of jurisdiction was overlooked there.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number><em>Mr. Geo. H. Higgins </em>(with, him <em>Mr. O. C. Allen), </em>for the defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-5\">1. The cases cited by the defendant to sustain his first proposition are not like the case at bar. They are cases in which the rights of the parties had been adjudicated and where the rights of third persons had not intervened. Fair was guilty of no laches. The bank knew that Fair had bought this land and paid full value for it, for this is not denied in the affidavit of defence. It purposely refrained from entering the proper credits on the judgment, proceeded to enforce it as if all unpaid, and under it took Fair\u2019s money. On what principles of justice, honesty and fair dealing is it to be allowed to keep it ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-6\">2. The proposition that the action must be in the sheriff\u2019s name is not supported by the eases cited for the bank. On the contrary, Longenecker v. Zeigler decides that the action may be brought by the person entitled to receive the money. Fair does not occupy the same position that O\u2019Connor and Reid would, for the reason that they knew, and he did not, that the $300 had been paid on the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-7\">3. Assumpsit for money had and received is the proper remedy in such a case as this : Longenecker v. Zeigler, 1 W. 252 ; McDonald v. Todd, 1 Gr. 17 ; Miller v. Ord, 2 Binn. 382 ; Barr v. Craig, 2 Dall. 151 ; Haldane v. Duche, 2 Dall. 176. It is based upon an implied contract, needing no privity other than the fact of one person\u2019s having money which ex aequo et bono belongs to another: 1 Bouv. Law Diet. 356; Moses v. Macferlan, 2 Burr. 1008 ; Ex parte Ford, 16 Q. B. D. 307. A justice of the peace has jurisdiction of such a cause of action: Act of March 20, 1810, 5 Sm. L. 161.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"A2G\">Mr. Justice Geeen:</author>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">Upon-the facts set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s statement and defendant\u2019s affidavit of defence, we are of opinion that the plaintiff is not entitled to judgment. The plaintiff\u2019s statement does not aver that the defendant knew that Fair had bought the land of O\u2019Connor and Reid and paid the full value of it, and therefore he has no right to the inference of Such a fact from the omission of the defendant to deny it. As the affidavit of defence avers that the money was received by the bank upon the indebtedness to it from O\u2019Connor and Reid, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>it was not sufficient to pay all of said indebtedness, and that the balance of the indebtedness was subsequently paid by indorsers of O\u2019Connor and Reid, it is difficult if not impossible to discover any element of mala lides on the part of the bank in receiving and retaining the whole amount of the money paid to them by the sheriff. The bank held a judgment against O\u2019Connor and Reid for $625, to secure the payment of notes to that amount. Three hundred dollars, being for three of the notes, had been paid to the bank by O\u2019Connor and Reid. The plaintiff\u2019s statement alleges that the $300 \u201c was to apply on the said judgment,\u201d but it does not allege that the hank had agreed to so apply it, or that O\u2019Connor and Reid had made any such application of it, when the money was paid. Without such an averment the statement that the $300 \u201cwas to apply on the said judgment \u201d is nothing more than the expression of the affiant\u2019s opinion to that effect. The same is true of the allegation that the amount \u201c should have been credited on said judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The case then is, that, without any averment of a special application of the money paid to the extinguishment of the judgment pro tanto, by either of the parties to the judgment, the plaintiff in the judgment having issued execution thereon and sold the real estate of the defendants therein, the sheriff voluntarily paid to the plaintiff, out of the proceeds in his hands, a sum sufficient to satisfy the judgment as it stood of record. This amount was in excess of the amount which would have been due, if the $300 paid by the defendants in tbe judgment previously, had been credited on the judgment when paid, or at any time after, but was not enough to pay the whole amount of the indebtedness due by tbe defendants to tbe plaintiff. Clearly, as between the defendants and the hank, the latter had the legal, as well as the moral, right to retain the whole amount of the money received, for it would he no more than a debtor to the defendants for the amount of the excess, and this indebtedness it would have a right to apply to the remaining indebtedness due by the defendants to the bank. Indeed it would be a grave question whether the bank might not be required to make such application by tbe indorsers of tlie other-paper beld by tbe bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">This being so, bow does it become unconscionable for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>bank to retain tbe money? The defendants in the judgment owed it to the bank, and so far as appears on the record of this case they make no objection to this action of the bank. If the bank owed no duty to return the <em>money </em>to the defendants in the judgment, how do they owe such a duty to Fair, who claims title to the land under the defendants ? He was a voluntary purchaser from the defendants. The judgment of the bank was at that time a lien on the property purchased, ostensibly for its whole amount, and Fair took the title with full record notice of the judgment for its whole amount. The bank owed him no duty of information. If he failed to know of the judgment, it was his own fault for which he cannot hold the bank resjionsible in any manner whatever. He had ample opportunity to intervene and assert any rights he may have had as a purchaser before the sheriff\u2019s sale, but he did not see fit to do so. He allowed the sale to proceed and the purchase-money to be paid over to the bank without objection, and after all this has been done and the bank has simply received money made by lawful process of execution, and which as against its judgment debtors, the defendants in the execution, it had a perfect right to retain, he brings an action against the bank to recover for himself the money so received. We know of no principle of law or morals upon which a recovery can be had in such circumstances,' and we are referred to no authority which has ever sanctioned it.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Judgment reversed, and procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
