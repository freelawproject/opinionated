From a decree dismissing the bill, the petitioner appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Miss Marburg, out of her own means, bought life insurance annuities which yield $24,000 a year. In addition to this she is the beneficiary of three trusts, including one here involved, which give her an income of $7,000 a year. The one with which we are concerned brings in at the present about $1,900 a year. It is conceded that all of her personal requirements are gratified. But Miss Marburg is very generous; she gives eight persons fifty dollars a month each, and indulges in many other benefactions, such as furnishing dental and medical services for elderly, needy, people. Her only reason for demanding the principal is that she wishes to increase her immediate income so as to extend the range of her benefactions. The trustee has not yielded to the petitioner\u2019s importunities for the reason that it is not its conception of her brother\u2019s, the donor\u2019s, intention. If he had wanted her to have money merely to spend, he could or may be would have given it to her directly. Instead he gave the fund to a trustee with power \u201c* * * to pay her from time to time such portion or portions of the principal as it may in its discretion, deem beneficial to her.\u201d The donor named as trustee one on whose discretion the power should be exercised, and he did not name this or any other court to advise the trustee or direct its course. Unless there has been a clear abuse of power or neglect of duty by the trustee, a subversion of the will of the donor, or a violation of the trust, courts should not and will not interfere, and thus sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>stitute their will for that of the donor or the trustee. <em>Baer v. Kahn, </em>131 Md. 17, 26, 101 A. 596, and cases there cited; <em>Stein v. Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>127 Md. 206, 217, 96 A. 349; 3 <em>Bogert on Trusts and Trustees, </em>sec. 560; 4 <em>Bogert on Trusts and Trustees, </em>p. 2344, sec. 811; 26 <em>R. C. L. </em>1373.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">We do not find in this record anything that would justify a court\u2019s interference, such as there was in <em>Pole v. Pietsch, </em>61 Md. 570, where the rule was stated as here, but it was held that the trustees had grossly neglected to perform the duty imposed on them by a testator; even though the power was discretionary. But the facts in that case are so dissimilar to those in this record, as to give the conclusion there no value as a precedent here.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The result may be a disappointment to the petitioner, but her brother left the way open for her to do as she wished with the corpus through the power of appointment, and if she fails to exercise it, it will go to some worthy charity anyhow.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
