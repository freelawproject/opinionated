Although the trial judge found invalid the search warrant under which the police purported to conduct their search, he nevertheless held that these items were admissible against petitioner because his mother had consented to the search and, in the alternative, because petitioner lacked standing to challenge the search and seizure. The first ground advanced by the trial court for denying the suppression motion is appropriate for reconsideration in light of the Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Bumper </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>391 U. S. 543 (1968). The second ground plainly is inconsistent with the Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jeffers, </em>342 U. S. 48 (1951), where it was held that the Fourth Amendment protects \u201ceffects\u201d as well as \u201chouses\u201d and that the defendant \u201cunquestionably had standing to object\u201d to the warrantless seizure of narcotics which he had left in his aunts\u2019 hotel room. I would grant cer-tiorari in this case to consider the apparent conflict between the decision below and the decisions of this Court in <em>Jeffers </em>and <em>Bumper.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
