In dispute is whether the Comptroller may cause the sheriff to execute upon a Montgomery County liquor license. We hold that the Comptroller may cause a writ of execution to be issued to enforce a State tax lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">On June 22, 1994, the Comptroller filed with the Clerk of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County a notice of lien of judgment for unpaid sales and use taxes, withholding taxes, interest, and penalties against the Washington Restaurant Group, Inc. (WRG).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Comptroller then requested that the Clerk of the Court issue a writ of execution instructing the Sheriff to seize the Class B, Beer and Wine, liquor license, No. BBW054, and all monies found at the address of WRG. The Clerk issued the writ, and on August 3,1994, the Sheriff levied upon the liquor license and $300.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>On August 11, 1994, WRG filed a motion to release the liquor license from levy. Neither party requested a hearing. The circuit court ordered that the license be released from levy. The Comptroller then appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. Prior to review by the intermediate appellate court, we granted a writ of certiorari on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">In its motion for release before the circuit court, WRG raised three issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">[1]. The license is not property subject to a Writ of Execution, nor may it be sold in satisfaction of the judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-7\">[2]. Individuals who are not parties to these proceedings have an interest in the license as licensees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-8\">[3]. The enforcement of a tax lien by the issuance of a Writ of Execution pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-641 is improper and not in compliance with Section 13-810 of the Tax-General Article, which governs the enforcement of such liens by judicial proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">The circuit court granted the motion without stating any rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">In this appeal, the Comptroller asks the Court to address the first and last of these grounds for release of the property. WRG, in its brief as appellee, raises Issue 2, involving joinder of the necessary parties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">We shall hold that the Comptroller may enforce a State tax lien through a writ of execution. We shall remand the cause, however, for further proceedings to determine whether a Montgomery County liquor license is subject to a writ of execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">WRG contends that the Tax-General Article provides the exclusive procedure for the enforcement of a tax lien and that this procedure does not include the issuance of a writ of execution. Maryland Code (1988, 1994 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 13-810 of the Tax-General Article.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> WRG claims that a writ of execution is a superfluous and improper procedure for enforcing a tax lien because a tax lien, once filed, \u201cis <em>ipso facto </em>a judgment and an execution on the judgment.\u201d It concludes that the issuance of a writ of execution is an unnecessary act.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">The Comptroller\u2019s position is that the language of \u00a7 13-810, in conjunction with the legislative history, authorizes the use of a writ of execution as a mechanism to enforce a tax lien. The Comptroller contends that \u00a7 13-810 neither explicitly nor implicitly prohibits the use of a writ of execution. The Comptroller also points out that the execution process was not intended to establish the Comptroller\u2019s lien. Under \u00a7 13-806(a), the lien \u201carises on the date of notice that the tax is due\u201d and, once filed under \u00a7 13-807, \u201chas the full force and effect of a judgment lien\u201d under \u00a7 13-808.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">We agree with the Comptroller that \u00a7 13-810 does not prohibit the issuance of a writ of execution to enforce a tax lien. Nothing within the language of \u00a7 13-810 suggests that it establishes an exclusive method for enforcing a tax lien. No statute, rule, or case, either explicitly or implicitly, prohibits enforcement of a tax lien through a writ of execution. We note that the. purpose of enforcing a tax lien is to collect a tax debt, i.e. to turn a tax lien into cash. Similarly, the proper use of a writ of execution is to enforce the collection of a debt. <em>Myers Co. v. Banking &amp; Trust Co., </em>170 Md. 198, 201, 183 A. 543, 544 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Section 13-810 was enacted as part of the Tax-General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Article. 1988 Maryland Laws ch. 2, \u00a7 1, at 562-64.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 13-810(a) provides that if a tax lien is not satisfied on or before the fifteenth day after notice of the lien is filed, recorded and indexed, the Comptroller <em>\u201cmay bring an action </em>to enforce the hen\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-4\">(a) <em>Initiation of </em>proceedings.\u2014If a tax lien is not satisfied or released on or before the 15th day after the notice of the lien is filed, recorded, and indexed under \u00a7 13-807 of this subtitle, a qualified attorney who is a regular salaried employee of the Comptroller or, at the request of the tax collector, the Attorney General may bring an action in a court of the State to enforce the lien.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALD\">In enacting \u00a7 13-810(a), the General Assembly altered the language used in the first sentence of Article 81, \u00a7 322(4) of the Revenue and Taxes Code, the precursor statute to the Tax-General Article, which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-5\"><em>Civil Procedure by attachment, garnishment, execution, </em>etc.\u2014In any case where a notice of lien has been filed by the Comptroller and indexed, ... and the full amount of the lien and judgment is not paid the State within fifteen (15) days after filing, the Attorney General, at the request of the Comptroller, or any qualified attorney who is a regular salaried employee of the Comptroller\u2019s office shall <em>file a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number><em>civil proceeding by way of attachment, execution, or otherwise </em>in any of the courts of this State ... to enforce the lien and judgment thereon of the State for tax, interest, penalty, delinquent fee and costs upon any property and rights to property, real or personal, owned by the delinquent taxpayer....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Maryland Code (1957, 1980 Repl.Vol.) Art. 81, \u00a7 322(4) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">In comparing these two provisions, we note that the General Assembly used the phrase \u201cbring an action\u201d in \u00a7 13-810(a), whereas in Article 81, \u00a7 322(4) it used the phrase \u201cfile a civil proceeding by way of ... execution.\u201d We do not believe that the change was intended to be substantive. This leads us to conclude that the statutory authorization to \u201cbring an action\u201d includes the authority to use a writ of execution to enforce a tax lien. .</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">The legislative history of \u00a7 13-810 supports this conclusion. The Revisor\u2019s Note to \u00a7 13-810 states that the language substitution was for purposes of \u201cclarity and brevity\u201d and was not meant to be a change in substance. <em>See </em>1988 Maryland Laws ch. 2, \u00a7 1, at 563. This Note reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">In subsection (a) of this section, Ch. 2, Acts of 1988, substituted the authority to \u201cbring an action\u201d for the former power to \u201cfile a civil proceeding by way of attachment, execution or otherwise ... or ... proceed by way of an equitable proceeding,\u201d <em>for clarity and brevity.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">Maryland Code (1988, 1994 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 13-810, Special Revisor\u2019s Note, of the Tax-General Article (emphasis added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Section 322(4) of Article 81 expressly permitted the use of a writ of execution to enforce a tax lien. In enacting \u00a7 13-810, the General Assembly intended to continue the prior practice for enforcing State tax liens provided in Article 81, \u00a7 322(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">Moreover, this holding comports with the general principle that we will construe the tax laws so as to provide the Comptroller with alternative methods for collecting taxes. <em>See Lomax v. Comptroller, </em>323 Md. 419, 424, 593 A.2d 1099, 1102 (1991) (\u201cIt is the policy of the law to insure the collection of all taxes, and whenever it is possible on any theory to do so the courts will construe the statutes to accomplish that result.\u201d); <em>Surratts Assoc. v. Prince Geo\u2019s Co., </em>286 Md. 555, 566, 408 A.2d 1323, 1329 (1979) (holding that the General Assembly intended to provide the tax collecting authorities with alternative methods for collecting taxes). Construing \u00a7 13-810 to permit the issuance of a writ of execution would enhance the Comptroller\u2019s ability to enforce a tax lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the authority given to the Comptroller to \u201cbring an action\u201d under \u00a7 13-810(a) includes the authority to cause a writ of execution to be issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">WRG also argues, on two grounds, that a liquor license is not property subject to a writ of execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">WRG first asserts that a liquor license is not property under Article 2B of the Maryland Code and, therefore, is not subject to execution. Section 10-501 of Article 2B provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-10\">(a) <em>License not </em>property.\u2014Licenses issued under provisions of this article shall not be regarded as property or as conferring any property rights. All such licenses shall be subject to suspension, restriction or revocation and to all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>rules and regulations that may be adopted as herein provided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Maryland Code (1957, 1994 Repl.Vol.) Art. 2B, \u00a7 10-501(a). We rejected this argument in <em>Dodds v. Shamer, </em>339 Md. 540, 663 A.2d 1318 (1995). There we held that a liquor license is property subject to execution except where exempted by statute. No statute exempts a liquor license from execution in Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">WRG also contends that a Montgomery County liquor license is not subject to a writ of execution under the Montgomery County Code. Section 3.9(f) of Appendix D expressly provides that \u201cliquor licenses are not for sale in Montgomery County.\u201d Montgomery County Code Appendix D, \u00a7 3.9(f) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Neither party has addressed the threshold question of whether this \u201cno-sale\u201d provision is valid. The viability of this provision is called into question by \u00a7 10-503(a)(2) of Article 2B of the Maryland Code, which specifically permits the sale of a liquor license by a license holder, its receiver or trustee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADK\">Any holder of a license under this article, including a receiver or trustee for the benefit of creditors, may be permitted to transfer the holder\u2019s place of business to some other location <em>or sell or assign the license </em>and transfer the holder\u2019s stock in trade to another person----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">Maryland Code (1957, 1994 Repl.Vol.) Art. 2B, \u00a7 10-503(a)(2) (emphasis added); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 10-503(q) (stating that the \u201cprovisions of subsection (a) ... apply in Montgomery County\u201d). We recently have said, \u201cA local government ordinance which conflicts with a public general law enacted by the General Assembly is preempted and thus is invalid.\u201d <em>Coalition v. Annapolis Lodge, </em>333 Md. 359, 379, 635 A.2d 412, 422 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">Because this threshold question was not raised before the circuit court, we shall not reach it, and consequently we cannot address the other contentions raised by the parties. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>ingly, we shall remand this matter to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The circuit court may invite the Montgomery County Board of Liquor License Commissioners to intervene in the proceedings as an interested party or file a brief as an amicus curiae.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED.

Maryland Code (1988, 1994 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 13-807 of the Tax-General Article provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-11\">(a) Filing notice of tax lien.\u2014A tax collector may file a notice of tax lien with the clerk of the circuit court for the county where the property that is subject to the lien is located.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b739-12\">.

Section 13-810 was originally enacted as \u00a7 13-811. 1988 Maryland Laws ch. 2, \u00a7 1 at 562-64. Later, the General Assembly repealed the original \u00a7 13-810 and subsection (e) of \u00a7 13-811 and renumbered the remaining subsections (a)-(d) as \u00a7 13-810. 1988 Maryland Laws ch. 569, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, at 3971 (codified as amended at Maryland Code (1988, 1994 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 13-810 of the Tax-General Article).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b741-7\">. It is important to note that an action to enforce a tax lien under \u00a7 13\u2014 810 is fundamentally different than an action to collect delinquent taxes under \u00a7\u00a7 13-815 through 13-818 of the Tax-General Article. These latter sections provide alternative mechanisms for collecting taxes. The Comptroller, however, has the choice to proceed on the one hand under \u00a7 13-816 (bring an action) or \u00a7 13-817 (attachment) without first filing a tax lien or, on the other hand under \u00a7 13-810 or \u00a7 13-811 (wage lien) after filing a tax lien under \u00a7 13-807. As we held in <em>Surratts Assoc. v. Prince Geo's County, </em>286 Md. 555, 566, 408 A.2d 1323, 1329 (1979), the General Assembly intended to provide the tax collecting authorities with alternative methods for collecting taxes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b742-9\">. 1988 Maryland Laws ch. 2, \u00a7 1, at 633, states that for some provisions of the Tax-General Article, special revisor's notes replace the original revisor\u2019s notes for provisions of the Act that were changed by 1988 legislation. The change from Revisor\u2019s notes to Special Revisor\u2019s notes was designed to avoid confusion. The original \u00a7 13-811 that became \u00a7 13-810 had a Revisor\u2019s Note for which a Special Revisor's Note was substituted.
