In 1988, that vehicle was involved in an accident. The car sustained damage to its right rear fender and passenger side door as well as a crack in the fiberglass near the passenger seat. The fiberglass damage worsened with continued use of the car. As a result, water began to leak into the passenger compartment. In 1991 Morris decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>to have the accident damage repaired and then to have further body restoration and mechanical work done on the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">In June of 1991, Morris was referred to Mark Gregory, trading as \u201cMark of Distinction, Quality Restorations.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She showed him a 1965 photograph of her automobile and requested an estimate of the cost of restoring the body of the car to its appearance in that photograph. She also advised Gregory that she and her husband, David Morris, only wanted to spend $3500.00 for the work. Gregory orally estimated that the restoration could be done for $3500.00, but he refused to put that estimate in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">According to his testimony, Gregory explained that he could only do the work on a time and material basis. Both David and Susan Morris testified, however, that an oral agreement was reached with Gregory that his charge for the body restoration would not exceed $3500.00. In September of 1991 the Morrises delivered the automobile to Gregory\u2019s shop and with his permission dismantled it in an effort to reduce the cost of the restoration. They also provided Gregory with most of the parts which Gregory would use in performing his work.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Gregory further testified that after the paint was stripped from the vehicle, he discovered that the fiberglass damage was more extensive than was originally known. Gregory testified that he notified Morris that there would be additional charges. On the other hand, Morris testified that Gregory only mentioned that the stripping process had caused some pinholes in the fiberglass that needed to be filled, and that no mention was made of any additional charges. Furthermore, she testified that had she been informed that the cost of the work was going to exceed $6000.00, she would not have authorized Gregory to proceed with the work. At no time did Gregory offer the petitioner an estimate, or notice of her right to an estimate, prior to beginning work on the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Gregory worked on the vehicle from January to March of 1992. He then presented the petitioner with bills totaling $6155.65, and threatened to sell the vehicle if the bills were not paid. Because of that threat, the petitioner paid the bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Morris then sued Gregory in the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Baltimore County. One of the counts in her complaint sought damages and reasonable counsel fees for an alleged unfair or deceptive practice under the Consumer Protection Act (the CPA), Md.Code (1975, 1990 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 13-101 to 13-501 of the Commercial Law Article, because Gregory performed the work on the petitioner\u2019s automobile without first informing her that she had the right to a written estimate of the cost of the body work he would perform or furnishing her with such an estimate as required by ARFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The trial judge held that as a matter of law ARFA did not apply to persons performing automobile body work and granted judgment for Gregory on the CPA count. Morris was awarded a judgment on another count, unrelated to the issue we resolve in the instant case, in the amount of $487.50. Morris appealed to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">After reviewing the record of the trial and hearing argument of counsel, the circuit court judge ruled that ARFA generally applied to automotive body work, but that it did not apply to restorations of antique automobiles. The circuit court judge issued an opinion and order on August 18, 1994, affirming the district court judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Morris appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. As the judgment of the circuit court appealed from was entered in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction in reviewing the decision of a district court, that appeal was improper. Accordingly, the intermediate appellate court pursuant to Md.Code (1974, 1994 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-302(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article and Md. Rule 8-132 transferred the case to this Court. Thereafter, Morris filed a supplemental petition for certiorari in this Court which was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">ARFA was enacted by Chapter 695 of the Acts of 1974. Before the Commercial Law Article was enacted, it was codified as Md.Code (1957, 1969 Repl.Vol., 1974 Cum.Supp.), Art. 83, \u00a7\u00a7 50 to 52. The present codification of ARFA provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">\u201c\u00a7 14-1001.

We disagree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">Section 14-1002(a) provides, in pertinent part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">\u201c(1) Before beginning any repair work on a motor vehicle for which a customer is charged more than $50, an <em>automotive repair facility </em>shall give the customer on his request a written statement which contains:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-8\">(i) The estimated completion date; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-9\">(ii) The estimated price for labor and parts necessary to complete the work\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">A violation of ARFA is a violation of the CPA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The issue in the instant case, therefore, is whether Gregory is an \u201cautomotive repair facility\u201d such that his failure to provide the petitioner with an estimate, under \u00a7 14-1002, would be a violation of the CPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">Section 14-1001(b) provides that \u201c \u2018[a]utomotive repair facility\u2019 means any person who diagnoses or corrects malfunctions of a motor vehicle for financial profit.\u201d A malfunction is \u201can instance of malfunctioning[.]\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1367 (unabridged 1981). To malfunction is \u201cto function badly or imperfectly: fail to operate in the normal or usual manner ... (the parachute <em>[malfunction\\ed, </em>opening too late)[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Morris\u2019s motor vehicle was functioning badly because its body was leaking. She took the car to Gregory who diagnosed and corrected that malfunction. Gregory performed those services on the car, not out of the goodness of his heart, but to make a financial profit. Gregory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>was, therefore, by unambiguous statutory definition, an \u201cautomotive repair facility.\u201d We find no basis for distinguishing motor work and body work, as the District Court did, for purposes of this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Alternatively, Gregory asserts that the work done to Morris\u2019s car was restoration, not repair, and that restoration work is not covered by the estimate requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 14-1002 and 14-1008 even if general body work is. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the work done to the petitioner\u2019s car <em>was </em>restoration, we see no reason to draw a distinction, in this context, between repair and restoration. The Legislature did not expressly provide for such an exception in ARFA, and we find no evidence of any intent to do so. We have said that \u201ca court may not as a general rule surmise a legislative intention contrary to the plain language of a statute or insert exceptions not made by the legislature.\u201d <em>Coleman v. State, </em>281 Md. 538, 546, 380 A.2d 49, 54 (1977). We will not transgress that rule in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Furthermore, we note that in <em>Schreiber v. Kelsey, </em>62 Cal. App.3d Supp. 45, 133 Cal.Rptr. 508 (1976), a case with facts similar to the facts of the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Appellate Department of the Superior Court of California, Los Angeles County, considered and rejected the argument that, under California law,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> no estimate was required when the work performed was restoration rather than repair. That court found that there was \u201cno evidence that the work done ..., although labeled \u2018restoration\u2019 in [the] brief, was anything other than automotive repair[,]\u201d but that \u201ceven if the work performed ... were restoration, rather than repair, it is not expressly exempted from the provisions of [California\u2019s law requiring estimates].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50, 133 Cal.Rptr. at 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Therefore, in summary, we hold that a person providing automotive body work for financial profit is included within the ambit of \u201cautomotive repair facility\u201d as defined by \u00a7 14-1001(b). A body work customer is, therefore, entitled to an estimate under \u00a7 14-1002. Furthermore, the restoration of an antique ear is not distinguishable, for purposes of ARFA, from body work on any other vehicle, as the Legislature has not provided such an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY REVERSED AS TO PETITIONER\u2019S CONSUMER PROTECTION CLAIM; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF MARYLAND FOR A NEW TRIAL ON THE CONSUMER PROTECTION CLAIM CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE RESPONDENTS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b262-14\">.
