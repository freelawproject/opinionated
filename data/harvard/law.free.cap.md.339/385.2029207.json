Did the trial court\u2019s variation of the modified Allen<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> charge coerce the jury, which had announced it was hopelessly deadlocked, into returning a guilty verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>2. Did the trial court err in permitting improper prosecutorial closing argument?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">3. Did the trial court err in admitting evidence that, on prior occasions, the alleged victim had exercised \u201cproper firearms discipline\u201d?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">We shall reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. Contrary to those courts, we are of the opinion that reversible error was committed when the State informed the jury, in its rebuttal closing argument, that it could recommend mercy to the trial court. We do not reach, therefore, the other two issues raised by the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Ryan Johnson, the victim, was an off-duty Prince George\u2019s County police officer. The incident during the course of which he was killed occurred while Johnson was working on his car outside of a friend\u2019s home. Although dressed in civilian clothing, and, as indicated, off-duty, Johnson was armed with his service revolver. Petitioner was a passenger in an automobile driven by his co-defendant, Harry Mayo. Mayo drove past Johnson, made a U-turn, and returned to where Johnson was standing. Petitioner got out of the car carrying a handgun in his crotch area and approached Johnson. The two men exchanged words. During the exchange, Johnson pulled out his service revolver and shot the petitioner in the lower abdomen. The petitioner returned fire, mortally wounding Johnson. The petitioner was taken to a District of Columbia hospital, where he underwent surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">The petitioner was charged with first degree felony murder, attempted robbery with a deadly weapon and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or a crime of violence. The State\u2019s theory was that the petitioner\u2019s purpose in approaching Johnson was robbery. It adduced testimony to that effect from a detective who interviewed the petitioner hours after the surgery and from the petitioner\u2019s co-defendant, Mayo. For his part, the petitioner maintained that he approached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Johnson to offer assistance with his disabled vehicle and that he returned Johnson\u2019s gunfire only in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">In its rebuttal closing argument to the jury, the State argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">[Defense counsel] made it very clear to you what kind of sentence [the appellant] is facing if you find him guilty, and you shouldn\u2019t be swayed by that in rendering your verdict because that\u2019s for the judge to do. But before all of you, or those of you who are concerned, who are concerned that perhaps the punishment may be too harsh because this young man did lead a good life up until April 16, because perhaps he made that decision because he was foolish, there is something that you can do, and that is, if you find him guilty, as I suggest to you the evidence when you look at it in the totality of the circumstances, when you weigh the credibility of the different individuals, I suggest it does establish that he was trying to rob the officer, no other explanation, and that is supported by the evidence, and you can recommend to the Court that the Court have mercy on the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">THE COURT: That\u2019s a matter of law that they can, Maryland law allows it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-9\">Objection overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: So if you have concerns about what may happen to him after you have done your duty, you may relay that to the Court and ask the Court to have mercy when imposing the sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">The petitioner believes that this ruling was error. Consequently, it was one of the issues he raised on his appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which, he maintained, required reversal of his conviction. The intermediate appellate court, in an unreported opinion, agreed with the petitioner that the ruling was error. It held, however, that the error was harmless. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-12\">The State refrained from suggesting either probation or a suspended sentence as possibilities; and the comment con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>cerning a recommendation of leniency was a correct, albeit incomplete, statement of the law. Appellant has not convinced us that the trial judge\u2019s error contributed in any way to the jury\u2019s verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">We issued a writ of certiorari at the petitioner\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">This Court recently addressed Maryland Rule 4\u2014327(f)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and concluded that it was not a proper subject of jury instructions. <em>Chambers v. State, </em>337 Md. 44, 47, 650 A.2d 727, 728 (1994).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In that case, after the close of all of the evidence, but before the jury had begun deliberations, the petitioner asked the court to instruct the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-9\">Members of the Jury, you have found the Defendant guilty. I am going to ask you to return to your jury room and decide whether or not the Court should show mercy to the Defendant in sentencing. When you have reached a deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>sion, either yes or no, on whether the Court should show mercy upon the Defendant in sentencing please knock on the door, the bailiff will escort you back to your seats and the Clerk will ask the Foreperson for your answer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 46, 650 A.2d at 728. The trial court refused to give the requested instruction and the petitioner preserved the point. Having been unsuccessful in the Court of Special Appeals, he sought certiorari, which we granted \u201cto consider whether Maryland Rule 4\u2014827(f) requires a trial court, upon request, to instruct the jury that it may recommend that the court show mercy to a criminal defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 45, 650 A.2d at 727 (footnote omitted). Answering that question in the negative, the Court held</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">that juries should not be instructed that they may return a recommendation of mercy. If the jury returns such a recommendation, it is not a part of the verdict, it is not binding on the trial court, and it should receive such weight as the trial judge deems appropriate after consideration of the evidence presented at trial, as well as additional information which may be presented at sentencing. If during the course of deliberation the jury inquires whether they may return a verdict with a recommendation of mercy, leniency, clemency, or the like, the court should respond that they may do so, but that their recommendation is not binding upon the court. Furthermore, they should be advised that it is within the sole discretion of the court to determine the appropriate sentence in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 47, 650 A.2d at 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">The Court explained its holding in two ways. First, recognizing the interrelationship between Rules 4-325(c) and 4-327(f), it rejected the notion that Rule 4\u2014327(f) is \u201cthe applicable law\u201d and thus creates a \u201cright\u201d in the defendant to require that a mercy recommendation instruction be given.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 48, 650 A.2d at 728-29. This was so, the Court said because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>only purpose of Rule 4\u2014327(f) was to restate the common law in the form of a rule, <em>ie., </em>to \u201crecognize the right of a jury to append to its verdict a recommendation of mercy,\u201d but not to imbue a defendant with \u201ca \u2018right\u2019 to require an instruction informing them of this prerogative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49, 650 A.2d at 729. The Court also viewed the giving of a mercy instruction as being \u201cdangerously misguided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 650 A.2d at 730. It opined that \u201csuch an instruction has enormous potential to compromise the jurors\u2019 evaluation under the reasonable doubt standard, to inject emotion into the deliberative process, and to introduce the consideration of punishment into the guilt or innocence stage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 650 A.2d at 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">With regard to the former rationale, the court explained that a mercy instruction \u201cmight entice the- jury to relieve the State of its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt; the jury, in an effort to compromise, might instead find a defendant guilty under a lesser standard, under the belief that the court will be merciful in sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 650 A.2d at 730-31. The concurring opinion recognized the same danger: \u201c[B]y being given a recommendation of mercy instruction, the jury acquires knowledge that may induce it, or members of it, to abdicate responsibility to resolve the case on the basis of reasonable doubt in favor of reliance on the trial court to ameliorate that abdication through the exercise of its sentencing prerogative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 58, 650 A.2d at 734 (Bell, J., concurring). The concern about giving a jury instruction with the potential adversely to impact the jury\u2019s legitimate and exclusive function has been expressed in our cases. <em>See Johnson v. State, </em>325 Md. 511, 518-19, 601 A.2d 1093, 1096 (1992); <em>Doering v. State, </em>313 Md. 384, 408-09, 545 A.2d 1281, 1293-94 (1988); <em>Shoemaker v. State, </em>228 Md. 462, 469, 180 A.2d 682, 685 (1962); <em>La Guardia v. State, </em>190 Md. 450, 460, 58 A.2d 913, 918 (1948). <em>See also Tripp v. State, </em>36 Md.App. 459, 484, 374 A.2d 384, 398, <em>cert. denied, </em>281 Md. 745 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The first case to reach this Court which required us to focus on the issue this case presents was <em>Shoemaker v. State, supra. </em>Although a capital case, which necessarily presents different considerations because it is the jury that is the sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>authority, <em>see Doering v. State, supra, </em>313 Md. at 410, 545 A.2d at 1294 (\u201cWe conclude that the basic rationale of <em>Shoemaker, </em>entirely correct in its own setting, is not directly applicable to proceedings involving determination of sentence by a jury.\u201d), the posture in which the case reached us is extremely informative and instructive on the issue <em>sub judice. </em>The issue as presented in that case concerned the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the defendant\u2019s possibility of parole. Having conveyed to the jury that it was not seeking the death penalty, the prosecutor suggested the \u201cpossible release on parole after, or perhaps even before, the defendant, if convicted, should have served one-third of whatever term of imprisonment might be imposed, and the obligation of the Parole Board to consider his eligibility for parole after he had served one-third of the term.\u201d <em>Shoemaker, </em>228 Md. at 468, 180 A.2d at 685. While pointing out that one reason for finding the possibility of parole argument to be reversible error was that it was not based upon evidence, the Court was of the view that \u201c[t]he chief vice of the reference in this case to the possibility of parole is that it suggested to the jury that it might in part shift its responsibility for a finding of the defendant\u2019s guilt to some other body,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 469, 180 A.2d at 685; that \u201cthe natural tendency and effect of the statements about parole was to suggest to the members of the jury that they might resolve any question about the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt with the thought that, even if they made a mistake, no great harm would be done since he might soon be paroled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469, 180 A.2d at 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">In <em>Johnson, </em>in response to. the defense counsel\u2019s argument urging the jury to be sure of its verdict inasmuch as it would be too late for a juror to change his or her verdict after the jury\u2019s verdict had been established as unanimous, the prosecutor, in rebuttal closing argument commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">Let me just tell you ladies and gentlemen a couple of things that bothered me about what my learned friend has said. She said that when you go back there and come up with a verdict you can\u2019t change your minds, make sure, make sure. She wants to elevate reasonable doubt more than it is in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>your minds. Well, let me tell you ladies and gentlemen, if your verdict is not guilty you can\u2019t change it. If it is guilty it is reviewed by the appellate\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">And the rights of the appeal go all the way up to the Supreme Court. So what she is telling you, saying that to you, she is not being quite honest to you. She wants to elevate that reasonable doubt in your mind which is what her job is to make it harder for you all to find him guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">325 Md. at 513, 601 A.2d at 1093-94. The defendant\u2019s objections to that argument were overruled by the trial judge. This Court held that \u201c[t]he rationale of <em>Shoemaker </em>with respect to a reference to parole is equally applicable to the reference to the right of appeal here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 519, 601 A.2d at 1096. <em>See also Poole v. State, </em>290 Md. 114, 125, 428 A.2d 434, 440 (1981), viewing as improper \u201cany comment by counsel in their arguments to the jury concerning appellate review____ [as] they tend to encourage the jury to believe that it can shift part of its responsibility to another body\u201d and <em>Doering v. State </em>holding \u201cthat where ... the defendant in a capital sentencing proceeding seeks to place before the jury [as a mitigating circumstance] relevant and competent information concerning his eligibility for parole in the event a life sentence is imposed, that request should be granted.\u201d 313 Md. at 412, 545 A.2d at 1295.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">In light of <em>Chambers, </em>it must be obvious that, notwithstanding that this case involves jury argument while <em>Chambers </em>involved a jury instruction, the State\u2019s rebuttal closing argument in this case was improper unless it could be characterized as \u201cnothing more than a reasonable reply to the arguments made by defense counsel.\u201d That argument was made by the State to the Court of Special Appeals, which rejected it, and it has renewed it before us. The intermediate appellate court expressed an inability \u201cto confirm from the record the State\u2019s position that defense counsel alluded to appellant\u2019s proposed sentence.\u201d Slip op. at 18. We have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>conducted an independent review of the record. We too share the conclusion of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">To be sure, the petitioner\u2019s attorney, in closing argument, stressed the petitioner\u2019s accomplishments in his young life and commented on \u201call of the good things about him,\u201d including that he was a mentor to other kids, an outstanding student, and an \u201cAmerican dream\u201d with academic and athletic abilities that enabled him to obtain scholarships. It is also true that defense counsel commented upon and recounted the testimony of the numerous character witnesses who testified on the petitioner\u2019s behalf. Yes, the petitioner\u2019s attorney asked the jury to reflect upon what he had said and reminded it that the petitioner \u201cwas supposed to be on a campus now.\u201d He also asked the jury to \u201cthink about [the petitioner\u2019s] future\u201d and \u201clet [the petitioner] know what life will be for him in the future.\u201d Those comments were all aimed at a legitimate purpose. Comments about the petitioner\u2019s character were directed at urging the jury to find him not guilty of attempted robbery. The petitioner\u2019s counsel argued, in short, that a reasonable doubt on that issue was created by the petitioner\u2019s character. That too was the purpose for the recounting of the character witnesses\u2019 testimony. Those comments relative to the jury reflecting upon the petitioner\u2019s future were made in the context of defense counsel\u2019s contention that a fair appraisal of the evidence, using common sense, would result in there being reasonable doubt, which, in turn, would result in the petitioner\u2019s acquittal and his being able to get on with his life. Of course, it was the petitioner\u2019s position that he was not guilty inasmuch as he killed the police in self-defense. Nevertheless, the petitioner\u2019s counsel\u2019s argument was a legitimate one and, contrary to the State\u2019s argument, was in no way intended to cause the jury to feel sympathy toward the petitioner by focusing their attention on the personal effect that a guilty verdict would have on the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Furthermore, viewed in light of the trial court\u2019s ruling on the petitioner\u2019s objection, as it must be, the prosecutor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>rebuttal closing argument did not constitute an accurate statement of the law. The jury was not told that a recommendation, if made, would not constitute a part of the verdict or be binding on the court, as the rule specifically provides. In that sense, the argument was misleading, the necessary inference being to ascribe a significance to the recommendation that the rule did not contemplate it to have. As the petitioner points out, \u201c[i]f anything, [the argument and the court\u2019s ruling] elevated the impact of a recommendation of mercy to a higher level of dignity than is justified by the actual state of the law.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s brief at 15-16. Nor is the State\u2019s argument persuasive that the use of the term \u201crecommendation\u201d is sufficient to convey to the jury that what they communicated to the trial court is non-binding. The rule itself constitutes a clear rebuttal to that argument: it specifically and expressly provides that the jury\u2019s recommendation \u201cis not part of the verdict and is not binding upon the court.\u201d The inclusion of that sentence recognizes the ambiguity of the rule\u2019s first sentence with respect to the effect on the court of a jury recommendation of mercy.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Alternatively, the State embraces the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding that the trial court\u2019s error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. It argues that because the record reflects that, the jury\u2019s verdict was unqualified by any recommendation of mercy or, for that matter, any indication of concern for another possible disposition, the record actually disproves that the rebuttal comments of the prosecutor could have affected the verdict in this case. The State also relies heavily on the trial court\u2019s instructions as to how the jury was to evaluate the evidence and the role of arguments of counsel in that evaluation. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">The test of harmless error is whether \u201ca reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict.\u201d <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976). We made clear in <em>Johnson, </em>that harmless error analysis, as applied in <em>Dorsey, </em>applied equally to arguments of counsel to the jury as to evidentiary rulings. 325 Md. at 521, 601 A.2d at 1097-98. Indeed, this Court made clear that <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 326 A.2d 707 (1974), addressing the limits of argument by counsel to the jury, and <em>Dorsey </em>\u201care consistent in the philosophy prompting them, comparable in the rationale underlying them, and similar in the test set out in them. Both are concerned primarily with error and the prejudice arising therefrom.\u201d 325 Md. at 521, 601 A.2d at 1098.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">The State\u2019s rebuttal closing argument interjected into the deliberation process as an acceptable component, the concept of mercy. The jury earlier had been told, in the court\u2019s instruction, that it ought not consider emotion or other like factors in reaching its verdict. By overruling the petitioner\u2019s objection to the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal closing argument, the court could be viewed as countermanding that instruction and thus permitting the jury to take mercy into account during the deliberations. While the argument focused on the jury\u2019s right to make a recommendation to the trial court for sentencing purposes, once mercy has been interjected in the case, its impact cannot be measured adequately. Thus, while it is true that the jury did not make a recommendation that the trial court show mercy to the defendant, it is not at all clear what, if any, role the prosecutor\u2019s argument played in the jury\u2019s deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Certainly there is nothing in the record that indicates, one way or another, whether one or more jurors were affected by the argument or that the possibility of a recommendation of mercy was involved in resolving the jury\u2019s heretofore deadlocked posture. Nor is there anything in the record to suggest that, notwithstanding its lack of a recommendation that it do so, the jury was not relying on the trial court to show the petitioner mercy. It is just as logical that a court could show mercy without a recommendation as it is that a court would show mercy only with a recommendation. We are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>not at all sure that, on this record, the jury did not \u201cin an effort to compromise, ... find [the] defendant guilty under a lesser standard, under the belief that the court will be merciful in sentencing.\u201d <em>Chambers, </em>337 Md. at 52, 650 A.2d at 730-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">In sum, since, on our own independent review of the record, we are unable to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, we hold that the error was not harmless. Accordingly, the petitioner is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT REVERSED.

State, </em>293 Md. 97, 109, 442 A.2d 550, 556 (1982)), this Court, by promulgating Rule 4-327(f), gave juries the right to recommend mercy, a right without any substance unless the jury is made aware that it has that right. 337 Md. at 59, 650 A.2d at 734. Those judges would have held, therefore, \"that a defendant\u2019s request that the jury be instructed that if the defendant is found guilty then a recommendation of mercy may be made to the judge,\u201d should be honored. <em>Id. </em>at 59-60, 650 A.2d at 734-35. They concurred in the result because the instruction the defendant proposed did not accurately state the applicable law in that it failed to address the issue before the Court, anticipated a decision that the jury may or may not have reached, and was potentially misleading. <em>Id. </em>at 55, 650 A.2d at 732.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b461-9\">.
