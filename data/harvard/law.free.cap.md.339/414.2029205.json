The trial court permitted the plaintiff to amend to conform the amount claimed to the verdict, and the trial court later denied the defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration of that grant of leave to amend. In order to unravel the contentions of the parties we must consider when final judgment was entered, the scope of review, and the power of a circuit court to enter judgment in the amount of a verdict that exceeds the ad damnum clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">Appellee, April Cardascia (Plaintiff), sued appellant, Thomas Richard Falcinelli (Defendant), in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County alleging personal injuries suffered in an automobile accident. The complaint consisted of a single count. Its \u201cdemand for judgment for relief sought\u201d was damages of $100,000. Maryland Rule 2-305. Plaintiff requested a jury trial. Approximately eighteen months later Plaintiff changed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">The case came on for trial on the original complaint. The jury, by special interrogatories, returned a verdict in favor of Plaintiff, awarding $3,987.08 for reimbursement of medical expenses, $1,200 for reimbursement of lost wages, and $200,-000 in noneconomic damages. No objection was made to the verdict prior to discharge of the jury. On the day the verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>was returned, February 24, 1994, the clerk noted the verdict on the docket, and the clerk further made the following docket entry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">\u201cJUDGMENT ENTERED BY VERDICT IN FAVOR OF THE PLAINTIFF APRIL CARDASCIA AGAINST THE DEFENDANT THOMAS RICHARD FALCINELLI IN THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF TWO HUNDRED FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN DOLLARS AND EIGHT CENTS ($205,187.08) AND COSTS.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Within ten days of February 24, Defendant moved in the alternative for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for a new trial, or for a remittitur. In support of a judgment nw. v. Defendant argued insufficient evidence of primary negligence and of causation and that there was contributory negligence as a matter of law. In support of a new trial or remittitur Defendant argued that the verdict was excessive, saying in part that \u201c[i]t may be that the Plaintiff would agree inasmuch as the figure of $100,000 was penned in her Complaint.\u201d After arguing that Plaintiffs symptoms were largely attributable to a preexisting condition, Defendant\u2019s memorandum concluded: \u201cFailing all else, a substantial remittitur of far more than $105,187.08 should be ordered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Plaintiff filed a memorandum in response to these motions in which she reviewed the evidence. In addition, Plaintiff filed a motion for leave to amend her complaint, together with a proposed amended complaint which changed the original complaint only by increasing the ad damnum to $205,187.08. The motion averred that, after filing the original complaint and while her symptoms continued unabated, Plaintiff was found to have \u201ca permanent partial disability of ten percent (10%) based on the A.M.A. Guidelines for permanent disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>In support of the request for leave Plaintiff cited authority reflecting, in other contexts, the liberal approach to leave to amend, as well as Md.Rule 2-341. In relevant part Md.Rule 2-341 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">\u201cAMENDMENT OF PLEADINGS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbY1\">\u201c(a) Prior to 15 Days of Trial Date.\u2014A party may file an amendment to a pleading at any time prior to 15 days of a scheduled trial date____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">\u201c(b) Within 15 Days of Trial Date and Thereafter.\u2014 Within 15 days of a scheduled trial date or after trial has commenced, a party may file an amendment to a pleading only by written consent of the adverse party or by leave of court.

Errors or defects in a pleading not corrected by an amendment shall be disregarded unless they affect the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">Defendant responded to the motion for leave to amend by asserting that \u201c[t]here is no allowance for the amending of the ad damnum clause to a Complaint after a trial on the merits by Rule of Court. Nor is such permitted through case law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">By Orders of April 29, 1994 the court disposed of all pending motions. Defendant\u2019s motions were denied, and Plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend was granted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Within ten days of April 29 the Defendant, on May 9, moved for reconsideration of the denial of his motion for judgment nw. v., or for new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>trial, or for remittitur, and for reconsideration of the grant of leave to amend. The court denied the motion for reconsideration on May 24. Defendant noted his appeal to the Court of Special Appeals on June 22, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Prior to consideration of the matter by the Court of Special Appeals, this Court on its own motion issued the writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">An overview of the parties\u2019 contentions perhaps can best be achieved by a point and counterpoint presentation. Defendant, citing Maryland cases dating back to <em>Harris v. Jaffray, </em>3 H. &amp; J. 543 (1811), contends that where the verdict exceeds the ad damnum the defendant, on timely application to the trial court, is entitled as a matter of law to a remittitur down to the ad damnum. Plaintiffs answer is that the cases relied upon by Defendant were decided prior to the revision of the Maryland Rules of Procedure effective July 1, 1984, but that Md.Rule 2-341 removed any end limit on when amendments may be made while an action is in a circuit court, if leave of court is obtained. The immediate predecessor of Rule 2-341, former Md.Rule 320, dealt with the time for amendment in section c. It provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">\u201c1. Before Trial\u2014Trial Before Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">\u201cIn a case heard or tried before the court without a jury, any amendment may be made at any time before a final judgment or decree is entered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\">\u201c2. Trial Before Jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-10\">\u201cIn a case tried before a jury, an amendment may be made at any time before the jury retires to make up its verdict.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">Plaintiff submits that Md.Rule 2-341, by omitting any time limit, thus permits a post-verdict amendment, with leave of court. Accordingly, Plaintiff says that th\u00e9 Maryland cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>relied upon by Defendant are irrelevant because the present rule controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Defendant\u2019s reply is that mere silence in the present rule should not be construed to permit post-verdict amendments, even with leave of court. He argues that so substantial a change would be set forth expressly. As evidence that no authorization for post-verdict ad damnum amendments was intended, Defendant points to one of the appeals rules, Md. Rule 8-604(c)(2). It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\"><em>\u201cExcessive Amount of </em>Judgment.\u2014A judgment will not be reversed because it is for a larger amount than claimed in the complaint if the plaintiff files in the appellate court a release of the excess.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Present Rule 8\u2014604(c)(2) is substantially former Rule 873.b, which antedated the 1984 revision of Title 2 of the Maryland Rules. As Defendant sees it, the recognition in former Rule 873.b, and the continued recognition in Rule 8-604(c)(2), of the need for a plaintiff to remit any excess of a verdict over the ad damnum demonstrates that the trial court in the instant matter was obliged to order a remittitur of the excess.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">The rejoinder by Plaintiff is that Rule 8-604(c)(2) has no application to this case. Here, Plaintiff amended the ad damnum in the circuit court before the order for appeal was noted, so that the record on appeal presents a verdict, judgment, and ad damnum conforming with each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">Plaintiff further contends that the order for appeal in this case operates only as to the denial of Defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Plaintiff submits that final judgment was entered April 29 when the circuit court denied Defendant\u2019s motions filed under Rules 2-532 and 2-533. The time for noting an appeal following the entry of that judgment expired without Defendant\u2019s having filed any notice of appeal. Defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration, Plaintiff submits, is a motion under Rule 2-535(a) and, pursuant to Rule 8-202(c), it does not stay the time for noting an appeal from the final, appealable judgment of April 29. Thus, the appeal is limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>to the denial of the motion for reconsideration, and review is limited to whether discretion was abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">Defendant on the other hand submits that the foregoing, ordinary analysis does not apply in this case. He contends that the grant of leave to amend altered the legal effect of the verdict and increased the judgment from $100,000 to $205,-187.08. Citing <em>B &amp; K Rentals &amp; Sales Co., Inc. v. Universal Leaf Tobacco Co., </em>319 Md. 127, 571 A.2d 1213 (1990), Defendant asserts that he filed his motion within ten days of the change in the judgment and that he had thirty days from the denial of that motion within which to appeal the change erroneously and adversely made in the judgment. Consequently, Defendant asserts that our review is for error in authorizing by amendment a post-verdict increase in the judgment and that the review is not limited to whether denial of the motion for reconsideration was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Seemingly, the logical starting point is to determine the scope of review. That question turns on whether <em>B &amp; K Rentals </em>applies to the instant matter. In <em>B &amp; K Rentals, </em>a property damage negligence case, the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for $123,252, and judgment was entered accordingly. Md.Rule 2-601(a). The defendant timely moved for judgment nw. v. which was granted, and judgment was entered in favor of the defendant for costs. <em>B &amp; K Rentals, </em>319 Md. at 128-29, 571 A.2d at 1214. Within ten days thereafter, the plaintiff moved to reconsider the grant of judgment nw. v. <em>Id. </em>That motion was denied, and the plaintiff noted an appeal within thirty days from that denial. <em>Id. </em>at 129, 571 A.2d at 1214. This Court held that the motion, labeled as one for \u201creconsideration,\u201d operated as a motion to alter or amend a judgment under Rule 2-534, because the judgment was \u201cbased on a court decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 131, 571 A.2d at 1215. When a timely motion is filed pursuant to Rule 2-534, Rule 8-202(c) provides that the notice of appeal shall be filed within thirty days after the denial or disposition of the motion. <em>Id. </em>at 132, 571 A.2d at 1215; Md.Rule 8-202(c). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Consequently, when the Rule 2-534 motion was denied that order became a \u201c \u2018judgment\u2019 [and] ... was the only final appealable judgment in the case.\u201d <em>B &amp; K Rentals, </em>319 Md. at 132, 571 A.2d at 1216 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">In the instant case judgment was entered February 24, 1994, based on the jury verdict, when the clerk entered a judgment in the amount of $205,187.08 on the docket. Md. Rule 2-601(b). Defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>B &amp; K Rentals </em>in effect seeks to treat that judgment as severable. Defendant views the judgment on February 24 as legally effective only for $100,000 and views the order of April 29, 1994 as a new judgment for an additional $105,187.08. If the $105,187.08 portion of the judgment did not spring into being until April 29, 1994 by virtue of the amendment to the ad damnum, then the leave to amend operated like the grant of a judgment nw. v. for Plaintiff, strengthening the analogy to <em>B &amp; K Rentals.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Defendant\u2019s contention is contrary to the docket entries, while the analysis in <em>B &amp; K Rentals </em>was consistent with docket entries. \u201cUpon a general verdict of a jury ... the clerk shall forthwith enter the judgment....\u201d Rule 2-601(a). \u201cThe clerk shall enter a judgment by making a record of it ... on a docket ... and shall record the actual date of the entry.\u201d Rule. 2-601(b). Defendant\u2019s analysis requires rejecting part of what facially appears from the docketed judgment of April 29 by applying a perceived rule of law based on a comparison of the docketed judgment with the ad damnum of the complaint. But the Rules generally confine the determination of whether there is a final judgment to the face of the docket. <em>See Estep v. Georgetown Leather Design, </em>320 Md. 277, 577 A.2d 78 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">Thus, the question arises whether the ad damnum clause, as a matter of substantive law, so limits the extent of a jury\u2019s verdict that a judgment, entered by the clerk pursuant to a rule regulating only procedure, is ineffective as to any excess in the judgment over the ad damnum.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">Clearly, the amount claimed in the ad damnum clause in this case did not affect the fundamental jurisdiction of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to render a judgment for $205,187.08 in a tort case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Circuit courts in Maryland are courts of general jurisdiction. On the other hand, Defendant is quite correct in asserting that Maryland case law has uniformly treated the ad damnum as a limitation on recovery. The problem is discerning the nature of the limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">As recently as <em>Scher v. Altomare, </em>278 Md. 440, 365 A.2d 41 (1976), this Court stated: \u201cOf course, the recovery, if any, by the plaintiff cannot exceed in nature or amount either the damage proved or the sum claimed in the <em>ad damnum, </em>whichever is the lesser.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 442, 365 A.2d at 42. <em>Scher </em>involved a claim for breach of contract. This Court held that dismissal of the action on limitations grounds was erroneous, and remanded for further proceedings. Thus, the quoted statement was dicta, but this Court obviously considered the proposition to be so clear as not to require any citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The opinion in <em>Finch v. Mishler, </em>100 Md. 458, 59 A. 1009 (1905), reflects that in the Court of Appeals the plaintiff had released $32 of a judgment, the amount by which it exceeded the ad damnum. <em>Id. </em>at 462, 59 A. at 1010. That plaintiff was acting pursuant to a statutory predecessor of Rule 8-604(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">The plaintiff in <em>Attrill v. Patterson, </em>58 Md. 226 (1882), remitted in the trial court the amount by which the verdict exceeded the ad damnum. On the defendant\u2019s appeal the judgment was reversed and a new trial ordered, because of misdirection of the jury. This Court thought \u201cit proper to say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>that the action of the [trial] court, in requiring the plaintiff to remit so much of the verdict as was in excess of the damages laid in the declaration, was in entire conformity with the law, practice and decisions of the State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 260-61. The Court cited to Md.Code (1860), Art. 29, \u00a7 39, a statutory predecessor of Rule 8-604(c)(2), to <em>Harris v. Jaffray, </em>3 H. &amp; J. 543 (1811), discussed in Part III, <em>infra, </em>and to \u201cPoe\u2019s Pl. &amp; Pr. 422.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">In a case decided by the Court of Special Appeals the plaintiff had obtained a verdict for $15,000 in compensatory damages although the declaration sought only $10,000 in compensatory damages. <em>Carl M. Freeman Assocs., Inc. v. Murray, </em>18 Md.App. 419, 306 A.2d 548, <em>cert. denied, </em>269 Md. 756 (1973). The defendant, however, did not raise the issue in the trial court, or by brief or argument on appeal. The Court of Special Appeals concluded that it was precluded from considering the question. <em>Id. </em>at 420 n. 3, 306 A.2d at 550 n. 3. The court did say, however, that \u201c[i]t has long been the law of this State that if a plaintiff recovers a verdict in excess of the damages laid in the declaration a remittitur by the trial court is proper.\u201d <em>Id. See also Baltimore City Lodge No. 3 of the Fraternal Order of Police, Inc. v. Mantegna, </em>61 Md.App. 694, 697, 487 A.2d 1252, 1253, <em>cert. denied, </em>303 Md. 295, 493 A.2d 349 (1985) (stating, in dicta, \u201cthat a plaintiff may not recover damages in an amount greater than that claimed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The rule that damages assessed may not exceed damages claimed is quite old. In the earliest decision in this Court, <em>Harris v. Jaffray, </em>3 H. &amp; J. at 546, counsel for the defendant cited, <em>inter alia, Cheveley v. Morris, 2 </em>W.Blk.Rep. 1300, 96 Eng.Rep. 762 (Exchq.Ch.1779), and <em>Wray v. Lister, 2 </em>Stra. 1110, 93 Eng.Rep. 1064 (K.B.1739). Both cases apply the rule, but neither states its underlying reason. Both cases refer to decisions in Yelverton\u2019s Reports of cases decided in King\u2019s Bench during the reign of James I.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number><em>Persival v. Spencer, </em>Yelv. 46, 80 Eng.Rep. 33 (K.B.1605), was an action on the case in which the plaintiff had claimed \u00a310 in the Court of Northampton and had recovered judgment for \u00a313.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">\u201c[T]his judgment was reversed for this reason in the King\u2019s Bench for the plaintiff is in law taken to have the best knowledge of his own damage, and he shall never recover more than what he declares for; but if after such verdict the plaintiff had released all the damages, but those for which he declared, and then had judgment, that had been good.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQQ\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\"><em>Vale v. Egles, </em>Yelv. 70, 80 Eng.Rep. 49 (K.B.1606), held that costs were not part of damages for purposes of the limitation on recovery. The report further states: \u201c[Ojtherwise it is a true rule, that the plaintiff shall not recover more in damages than according to his declaration; for the plaintiff is by the law taken to be the best conusant of his own damage, and so are the books to be understood.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">If the historic reason continues to be the reason for the rule, then it is one of the reasons assigned in the instant case by Defendant to support his motion for a new trial. That reason was considered and rejected by the circuit court before entering the judgment of April 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Theoretically a verdict in excess of the amount \u201claid in the declaration\u201d and the amount claimed might be brought into conformity by raising the ad damnum as well as by reducing the verdict. But, from 1785 through at least June 30, 1984, when former Rule 320 was replaced by Rule 2-341, post-verdict amendments were not part of Maryland practice. Section IV of Chapter 80 of the Acts of 1785, which otherwise conferred full power and authority on the courts of law to allow amendments, limited the exercise of the power to permit amendments to those sought to be made before verdict.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>In any event the historical fact that a remittitur has been considered appropriate as to the excess of a verdict over the ad damnum does not demonstrate any substantive invalidity in a judgment that includes that excess. <em>Sullivan v. Jordan, </em>310 Mass. 12, 36 N.E.2d 387 (1941), bears on the point. The issue was whether a garnishment action against the automobile liability insurer of the judgment debtor had been brought within the governing one year period of limitations. <em>Id. </em>at 14, 36 N.E.2d at 388. The insurer contended that the period began on the expiration of the time for appeal following a finding assessing damages against the insured in the underlying motor tort case. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff contended that the limitations period began to run when the plaintiff filed a waiver of the excess of the damages over the ad damnum and the clerk entered a judgment in the amount of the ad damnum. <em>Id. </em>Concluding that the earlier date triggered limitations, the court gave the following analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">\u201cThere is no suggestion that the assessment of damages was due to accident or mistake or that a judgment following that finding was not the judgment that the court intended to render. Such a judgment was erroneous in that it did not conform to the amount claimed in the writ, but the defect resulted from an error committed by the court while acting within its jurisdiction, rather than from a finding that the court was without power to make. Accordingly, it has been held that a judgment in excess of the ad damnum is not void but voidable. The defect could have easily been corrected by an amendment to the writ, increasing the ad damnum. No such step was taken. A judgment which at the most is only voidable stands until it is modified, vacated or set aside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>in direct proceedings brought in some one of the various methods provided by law to accomplish the purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 16, 36 N.E.2d at 389 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">We hold that the ad damnum does not inherently limit the power of the jury to render a verdict and does not inherently limit the power of the court to enter a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">Nor does Rule 8-604(c)(2) prevent the circuit court\u2019s judgment of April 29, 1994 from being a judgment for $205,-187.08. The statutory predecessor to Rule 8-604(c)(2) is a response to <em>Harris v. Jaffray, </em>3 H. &amp; J. 543, an action in trover, begun in the General Court in 1796, and claiming \u00a35,000 \u201ccurrent money.\u201d Upon abolition of the General Court the case was transferred to the Baltimore County Court where it was tried during the October 1807 Term resulting in a jury verdict for $14,560.40 \u201ccurrent money.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 544-45. The defendant appealed to this Court. During the pendency of the appeal, at the December 1809 Term, the plaintiff moved in this Court that the defendant \u201cshow cause why the [plaintiff] should not be permitted to release so much of the damages, assessed by the jury ... as exceeds the amount of damages laid in the declaration, and to amend the record by entering the judgment for the said amount of damages so laid in the declaration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 545. At the June 1811 Term the defendant opposed the rule, contending that there was error in the judgment and it must be reversed. The plaintiff countered by reliance on a statute, Chapter 153 of the Acts of 1809.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">At the December 1811 Term the Court discharged the rule. The Court held that the Act of 1809 did not permit a plaintiff to do more in the Court of Appeals than could be done in the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at 547. In the trial court the plaintiff, after verdict and before judgment, could release the excess. <em>Id. </em>at 546-47. In the trial court, if an excess judgment were rendered on the verdict, the plaintiff could tender a remittitur during the same term of court, and the trial court could \u201center <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>a judgment for the amount of the damages charged in the declaration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 547. \u201cBut if a judgment is entered upon the verdict, no release, or other act of the plaintiff, tan give validity to that judgment, but on an appeal or writ of error, it must be reversed....\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Chapter 161 of the Acts of 1811, passed January 4, 1812, changed the procedure from the rule applied in <em>Harris v. Jaffray. </em>Section 3 of the enactment permitted the plaintiff to amend the record on appeal by entering a release of the excess, and \u00a7 4 of the enactment authorized the Court of Appeals to modify the judgment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Although <em>Harris v. Jaffray </em>speaks of \u201ca release of parcel of a verdict\u201d as \u201cnot having the effect in law to give validity to a vicious judgment for the whole,\u201d 3 H. &amp; J. at 547, it is clear that under modern practice any error underlying a judgment for an amount that exceeds the ad damnum is not an error which the appellate court is obliged to note on its own initiative. That is effectively a holding of <em>Carl M. Freeman Assocs., Inc., </em>18 Md.App. 419, 306 A.2d 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The point is also discussed in 2 J.P. Poe, <em>Pleading &amp; Practice in Courts of Common Law </em>\u00a7 191, at 141 &amp; n. 34 (5th ed. (Tiffany) 1925). At least as early as the Rules Respecting Appeals adopted October 13,1869 it was provided that \u201c[i]n no case shall the Court of Appeals decide any point or question which does not plainly appear by the record to have been tried and decided by the court below....\u201d Rule 4, 29 Md. xviii. Old Rule 4 (now Rule 8-131(a)) was also Md.Code (1924), Art. 5, \u00a7 10. In that same Code, Chapter 161, \u00a7 3 of the Acts of 1811 was Art. 5, \u00a7 21. Poe describes the procedure in Art. 5, \u00a7 21 as \u201cthe old practice under the Act of 1811....\u201d Poe, \u00a7 191 n. 34. He further states that \u201cunder [Code (1924), Art. 5, \u00a7 10] such an amendment is not necessary now, if the point was not made in the court below, for the Court of Appeals by that section is precluded from deciding \u2018any point which does not plainly appear by the record to have been tried and decided by the court below.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. See also </em>H. Ginsberg <em>&amp; </em>I. Ginsberg, <em>Pleading at Law in Maryland, </em>at 103 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">In the matter <em>sub judice </em>we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that Rule 2-341 does not provide for the grant of leave to amend after a verdict has been returned. We further assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that the circuit court erred in granting leave to amend in the case before us so that, whatever the nature might be of the defect in a verdict or judgment exceeding the ad damnum, the defect was not cured by amendment in this case. But, in light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>of all of the foregoing, it is clear that the assumed defect is procedural only and that it did not prevent the judgment of April 29, 1994 from being a final, appealable judgment in the full amount of the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Defendant did not timely appeal the judgment of April 29. That judgment, particularly by denying Defendant\u2019s request for remittitur and by granting leave to amend, rejected Defendant\u2019s legal contention that the judgment on the verdict could not stand in an amount exceeding the ad damnum. Instead of noting an appeal from the final judgment and seeking direct appellate review of what we assume was an error of law by the trial court, Defendant resubmitted the same arguments to the trial court in support of the motion for reconsideration. Thus the appeal here is from the denial of the motion for reconsideration, and review is limited to whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion. <em>See Grimberg v. Marth, </em>338 Md. 546, 659 A.2d 1287 (1995); <em>Anthony v. Clark, </em>335 Md. 579, 644 A.2d 1070 (1994); <em>Burtoff v. Burtoff, </em>321 Md. 631, 584 A.2d 63 (1991); <em>Lancaster v. Gardiner, </em>225 Md. 260, 170 A.2d 181, <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U.S. 836, 82 S.Ct. 63, 7 L.Ed.2d 37 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Defendant has not included in the record extract any of the testimony bearing on the amount of damages. There is no evidence that Defendant was prejudiced in fact, <em>e.g., </em>in relation to the limits on motor vehicle liability coverage, as a result of the circuit court\u2019s determination not to reduce the verdict to the ad damnum in the original complaint. Defendant\u2019s argument in this Court rests entirely on the proposition that a remittitur was required as a matter of law. In that connection the words of Judge J. Dudley Digges, speaking for this Court in <em>Hardy v. Metts, </em>282 Md. 1, 381 A.2d 683 (1978), are completely applicable here.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">\u201c[T]he exercise of this discretion will not be disturbed unless clearly shown to have been abused. <em>Lancaster v. Gardiner, supra </em>at 268-69[, 170 A.2d at] [185]. This is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>particularly true where, as here, the dispute between the infant appellant and the decedent\u2019s widow was decided by the trial court on the merits rather than being terminated through the entry of a judgment by default for want of an appearance by the defendant. Although this Court has not before had occasion to state the principle in this context, we now hold that when the trial court denies a Rule 625(a) preenrollment request to revise a final judgment rendered on the merits, if that judgment was based solely on a question of law an appellate court will not ordinarily disturb the trial court\u2019s discretionary decision not to reopen the matter; an appeal from the primary judgment itself is the proper method for testing in an appellate court the correctness of such a legal ruling. To reach any other conclusion would have the effect of permitting, if not two appeals, a delayed appeal of the original legal issue decided by the trial court, a result both undesirable and unintended by the rule. Appellant took no appeal from the primary judgment which was entered and \u2018it cannot [now] obtain a review of it under the guise of seeking a review of the exercise of judicial discretion in refusing to set it aside.\u2019 <em>S. &amp; G. Realty v. Woodmoor Realty, </em>255 Md. 684, 692-93, 259 A.2d 281, 285 (1969).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 6, 381 A.2d at 686-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY CO UNTY AFFIRMED.
