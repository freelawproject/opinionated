Taylor, correctional officers serving at Eastern Correctional Institution, were assigned to the visiting room. Taylor saw an inmate receive some chewing gum, which is contraband, from a visitor. Taylor called the inmate aside and ordered him to dispose of the gum. The inmate threw the gum, using an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>overhand motion, into the waste basket. Taylor again called the inmate aside and asked if he had an \u201cattitude.\u201d Taylor then took the inmate to another room and told him that the gum was contraband and that, because he received the gum, his visiting privileges could be cancelled for six months. Taylor informed Lieutenant Vanessa Ward about the contraband and she, in turn, notified Captain Timothy McNeil, who approved terminating the inmate\u2019s visit. Ward directed Taylor and Howard to strip search the inmate and then return him to his cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">Taylor and Howard took the inmate to a search room. While there, the inmate touched a patch on Taylor\u2019s sleeve. Taylor responded by pushing the inmate twice against the wall. Howard watched as this happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Ward recalled that she heard the inmate yelling for help and then saw Taylor and Howard leave the room grinning. She inquired of them what had happened and they both responded, \u201cThe inmate is crazy.\u201d Taylor and Howard did not fully complete the strip search, although the inmate had removed his clothes.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Ward went into the search room, and the inmate told her that he had been assaulted. Before Ward entered the room, Taylor and Howard neither informed her that they had not completed the strip search nor that the inmate had assaulted Taylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Ward later attempted to inform Taylor of the inmate\u2019s allegation of assault. Taylor, however, interrupted her and walked away. He was then relieved of his post. Subsequently, in Ward\u2019s office, Ward informed Taylor of the inmate\u2019s allegation and \u201ccounseled\u201d him for his previous insubordination.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Taylor and Howard submitted official reports concerning the incident, in which they failed to mention that the strip search was not fully completed and that Taylor pushed the inmate against the wall. Taylor wrote two Notices of Infraction, charging the inmate with insolence, possession of contraband, disobeying a direct order, and assault. At an adjust<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>ment hearing concerning these charges, on July 24, 1991, the inmate was found guilty of insolence and possession of contraband, but not guilty of assault and disobeying a direct order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">On July 26, 1991, Security Chief Ralph Logan held suspension hearings for Howard and Taylor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The hearings, held separately, focused on the officers\u2019 failure to properly perform a strip search, failure to secure the inmate after the inmate had allegedly assaulted Taylor, and failure to warn Lieutenant Ward that the inmate had been assaultive before she entered the strip search room. Both officers were suspended for three days for a second category infraction described as \u201c[ijnattentiveness or negligence in the performance of duty by an employee directly responsible for the custody of inmates.\u201d DCR 50-2.III.E.2.a.19. Specifically, Logan found that the officers had violated DCR 50-2.II.J., which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\">\u201cAn employee of the Agency shall be responsible for his/her own actions as well as the proper performance of his/her duties. An employee shall perform his/her duties in a manner which will maintain the highest standards of efficiency in carrying out the functions and objectives of the Agency in accordance with established policies and procedures. Unsatisfactory performance may be demonstrated by a lack of knowledge, unwillingness or inability to perform assigned tasks, failure to conform to work standards established for the member\u2019s rank, grade, or position, or failure to take appropriate action to ensure compliance with Agency regulations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">At the hearing, Lieutenant Ward, in the course of relating the general sequence of events, mentioned the inmate\u2019s allegation of assault. The record, however, does not reflect any attempt to substantiate or investigate the allegation at that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>time. Rather, it reveals that on the day before the hearings, Warden Taylor referred the incident to the Investigative Unit, where the case was assigned to Corporal Harry Edwards of the Maryland State Police.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Edwards began his investigation on July 26, 1991, by speaking to Howard and attending Howard\u2019s suspension hearing. Also on that day, he interviewed the inmate concerning the incident. On July 29, along with Chief Logan and Sergeant Cynthia Komenda from the Maryland State Police, Edwards again interviewed the inmate, who repeated his account of the incident without discrepancies.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">After the interview, Edwards conferred with Logan, who had spoken to Taylor, Howard, Ward and some other witnesses. Logan told Edwards that he believed the inmate\u2019s account of the incident. Also on July 29, Edwards discovered that Taylor had made a sworn application for a criminal summons to be issued for the inmate.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">On July 30, Edwards interviewed Ward and received her version of the events. On that day, he interviewed Lieutenant J. Gumpman. On August 1, he interviewed the inmate\u2019s daughter, who had been visiting her father when the incident occurred. On August 5, he interviewed Captain McNeil and two prisoners who were in the visiting room at the time of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">According to Edwards, the entire investigation was completed by August 15,1991. He concluded that Taylor had committed the assault and battery and had filed false reports. He also concluded that Howard witnessed the assault and battery, yet failed to properly report it and failed to truthfully answer questions about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">On November 15, 1991, Edwards forwarded a typed copy of the report to his commander for review. He testified that this report was delayed because his time was consumed with other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>investigations. On January 17, 1992, the report was forwarded to Warden Taylor, on February 20, 1992, to Assistant Commissioner Mazzone, and on April 30, 1992 back to Warden Taylor. Both Warden Taylor and Assistant Commissioner Mazzone determined that the findings in the report should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Charges for removal were filed against both Howard and Taylor on June 9, 1992. Howard was charged with violating the department\u2019s rules on performance of duties, personal conduct, prevention of disorders, breach of security, false reports, and attitude towards inmates.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He was also charged with violating COMAR 06.01.01.47, paragraphs D, E, L and M, which state that the following are sufficient causes for removal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">\u201cD. That the employee has violated any lawful official regulation or order or failed to obey any lawful and reasonable direction given by his superior officer when the violation or failure to obey amounts to insubordination or serious breach of discipline which may reasonably be expected to result in a lower morale in the organization or to result in loss or injury to the State or the public;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">E. That the employee has been wantonly offensive in his conduct toward fellow employees, wards of the State, or the public;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">L. That the employee has willfully made a false official statement or report;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\">M. That the employee has been guilty of conduct such as to bring the classified service into public disrepute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">In addition to the violations with which Howard was charged, Taylor was charged with violating the department\u2019s rule on the use of force and COMAR 06.01.01.47, paragraph B, which establishes as sufficient cause for removal \u201c[t]hat the employee has been wantonly careless or negligent in the performance of his duty or has used unwarrantable or excessive force in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>treatment of public charges, fellow employees, or other persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">Howard and Taylor appealed the charges for removal to the Office of Administrative Hearings. The appeals were consolidated for a hearing on July 21 and July 28 of 1992 before an ALJ. The ALJ found the facts, outlined above, concerning the incident and concluded that the charges for removal should be sustained against both Howard and Taylor. He also considered and rejected arguments from the officers that the charges were barred by double jeopardy and that the charges should be dismissed because of the delay between the incident and the filing of the charges. On February 3, 1993, a designee of the Secretary of Personnel adopted the proposals of the ALJ and ordered that Howard and Taylor be separated from their positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The officers filed actions for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Somerset County. The cases were consolidated for a hearing on March 22, 1994. The judge ruled that the Agency\u2019s removal of the officers violated double jeopardy principles. He also concluded that the removals were defective because the investigation had grossly exceeded the 90-day period provided for in the regulations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, he reversed the decisions of the Secretary of Personnel. The Agency appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. While the cases were pending there, we granted certiorari to consider the issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">Howard and Taylor assert that the Agency has both suspended and removed them for the same incident. They maintain that the Agency\u2019s actions are contrary to a principle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>they call \u201cadministrative double jeopardy,\u201d which they have extrapolated from the principle of administrative law that an agency cannot act arbitrarily and capriciously.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">While in their brief to this Court Howard and Taylor have abandoned the argument that the Agency violated principles of constitutional double jeopardy, we will nevertheless discuss the viability of that argument because it formed the basis for one of the circuit court\u2019s two holdings. The court stated that the suspension \u201cwas a penalty, the purpose of the penalty to change the job performance of the employees, but a penalty to accomplish that result nonetheless.\u201d It characterized the removal as \u201can additional penalty imposed in addition to one that had been imposed back very shortly after the incident occurred.\u201d The court then concluded: \u201c[I]t appears to be a double jeopardy situation involved in state employment service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">In <em>Ward v. Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, </em>339 Md. 343, 663 A.2d 66 (1995) [No. 10, September Term, 1995, filed August 21, 1995], consolidated for argument with the present cases, we discussed <em>U.S. v. Halper, </em>490 U.S. 435, 440, 109 S.Ct. 1892, 1897, 104 L.Ed.2d 487 (1989), in which the United States Supreme Court decided that the Double Jeopardy Clause protects against multiple punishments even if the punishment is labeled \u201ccivil.\u201d The Court stated that \u201cthe determination whether a given civil sanction constitutes punishment in the relevant sense requires a particularized assessment of the penalty imposed and the purposes that the penalty may fairly be said to serve.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 448, 109 S.Ct. at 1901. The Court determined that if the purpose of the penalty is retribution or deterrence, it is punishment, but, if the purpose of the penalty is remedial, it is not punishment. Applying this test in <em>Ward, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">\u201c[T]he disciplinary sanctions imposed under regulation 50-2 are remedial in nature, not punitive. The Division of Correction, like any employer, must maintain control over its employees. To this end, the Division has established standards of conduct and published them to its employees. The standards would have no meaning, force or effect if there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>were no penalty for their violation. Thus, the Division has established a system of progressive discipline. Common sense dictates that this discipline is imposed to ensure that employees adhere to the established standards of conduct. Indeed, the forward to the regulation states that \u201cdiscipline shall be progressive in nature and, in combination with specific training, shall aim at correcting inappropriate employee behavior.\u201d Because the discipline is not imposed for the purpose of punishment, the principles of double jeopardy simply do not apply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">339 Md. at 350, 663 A.2d 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Howard and Taylor argue that it is inherently arbitrary and capricious for the Agency to suspend and remove an officer based on the same incident. We need not reach this issue, however, because they were not suspended and removed for the same incident. As we see it, the charges for removal were based on facts that were different, and entirely more serious, than the facts upon which the suspensions were based. Thus the Agency\u2019s decision to file charges for removal against the officers was not arbitrary and capricious. As the record discloses, the suspension hearing concerned the officers\u2019 failure to properly secure and search the inmate, as well as their failure to warn Lieutenant Ward that the inmate was potentially violent. In contrast, the investigation that led to the removal of the officers focused on the much more serious allegations of assault, battery, and false reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Howard and Taylor argue that the removal decision was arbitrary because all the evidence concerning the assault and false reports was available at the time of the suspension hearings and no new evidence was discovered after that time. Their argument ignores the fact that the investigation into the more serious matters began on the same day as the suspension hearings, July 26,1991, and continued through August 15, 1991, the majority of it occurring after the hearings. During this time, Edwards was able to collect and evaluate information concerning the incident. The officers\u2019 argument fails to take into account the time needed for such collection and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>evaluation of information. Taken to its logical end, the argument would require the Agency to either forego the suspensions entirely or \u201crush to judgment\u201d on the removal decisions. A decision to remove a classified employee is a serious matter that should be done only after adequate investigation and deliberation. It is unreasonable to believe that such a decision could have been made, in these cases, between July 24 when the warden was informed of the incident and July 25 when the suspension hearings occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">On the other hand, requiring the Agency to forego the suspensions would unnecessarily interfere with the its proper discipline of its employees. The warden must begin any disciplinary suspension within two days of the time he learns of the incident. COMAR 06.01.01.46.A. He could not wait, in this case, for a full report from the Investigative Unit to take action on the less severe infractions that he knew the officers had committed. Therefore, it was not unreasonable for the warden to impose suspensions for those infractions, while at the same time referring the incident to the Investigative Unit and eventually imposing more severe discipline for more serious infractions not considered at the suspension hearings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">As an alternate ground for his decision, the circuit court judge ruled that the removal of the officers must be reversed because the investigation took too long\u2014in his words, a \u201cgross violation of the 90 day investigatory period.\u201d He was referring to the Division of Correction\u2019s regulation that lists, as a responsibility of the investigative unit, to \u201c[ejnsure internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>investigations are completed within 90 days of receipt or first knowledge of the allegation or incident.\u201d DCR 50-2.VI.A.2.d. His understanding, however, of this provision\u2014as a time limit for the institution of charges\u2014is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">When interpreting regulations, we \u201cgenerally employ the same rules applicable to the interpretation of statutes.\u201d <em>Chesapeake v. Comptroller, </em>331 Md. 428, 440, 628 A.2d 234 (1993). The primary goal of statutory construction is to determine and effectuate the Legislature\u2019s intention. <em>E.g., Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 660 A.2d 423 (1995); <em>Baltimore v. Cassidy, </em>338 Md. 88, 93, 656 A.2d 757 (1995). The words of the provision are the primary indicator of legislative intent. <em>Tidewater/Havre de Grace, Inc. v. Mayor of Havre de Grace, </em>337 Md. 338, 345, 653 A.2d 468 (1995). In examining the words, however, we must look at the entire statutory scheme, not just the individual provision. <em>Outmezguine v. State, </em>335 Md. 20, 41, 641 A.2d 870 (1994). We must also consider the purpose of the statute. <em>Blaine v. Blaine, </em>336 Md. 49, 69, 646 A.2d 413 (1994). Moreover, \u201cwe seek to avoid constructions that are illogical, unreasonable, or inconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Frost v. State, </em>336 Md. 125, 137, 647 A.2d 106 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Applying these principles to the regulation containing the 90 day provision, we conclude that it does not create a fixed time frame in which the warden must file charges for removal. The language of the regulation clearly indicates that it is not the decision to file charges for removal that must be completed in 90 days; rather it is the \u201cinternal investigation\u201d that must be completed. Indeed, the regulation is not even directed at the entity responsible for filing charges for removal; while charges for removal are filed by the appointing authority\u2014the warden in this case\u2014the investigation is conducted by the investigative unit, which is directly responsible to the Commissioner of Correction, not to the warden. Moreover, the regulation does not make the 90 days a mandatory directive; rather, the regulation simply lists it, among other things, as a \u201cresponsibility\u201d of the investigative unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>The standard under which we must judge the actions of the Agency, therefore, is not whether it rigidly adhered to a time frame, but whether it acted arbitrarily and capriciously. While the ten month period between the incident and charges for removal was less than ideal, it did not make the Agency\u2019s decision to remove the officers arbitrary and capricious. The record reveals that the decision was the product of careful deliberation by the warden and the assistant commissioner and was based on a thorough investigation by the Investigative Unit involving numerous witnesses. While the handling of the case was somewhat delayed, it progressed steadily through the system, being considered first by the Investigative Unit, thereafter by the warden, and finally by the assistant commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Moreover, the record does not reflect any prejudice to the officers that was caused by the delay. They were not suspended pending the investigation. They have not pointed to any witnesses whose memory has faded or who has become unavailable. They argue, without citing specific examples, that they have been prejudiced because witnesses\u2019 memories have faded and evidence has become stale. Ten and a half months, however, is not an extraordinary length of time to preserve evidence. Indeed, the general statute of limitations for misdemeanors, including battery, is a full year.
