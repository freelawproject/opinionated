We shall hold that civil <em>in rem </em>forfeitures are subject to an excessive fines analysis. Therefore, we shall reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">George Joseph Aravanis, the appellant, and his wife took title to a farm, including a house, located at 5341 Shelltown Road in Westover, Somerset County, Maryland, as tenants by the entireties, on December 31, 1971. They occupied the property while raising their children until they separated and Mrs. Aravanis moved out. Aravanis continued to occupy the property until they were divorced in 1988. Thereafter, in 1991, a part of the property was sold. The appellant obtained sole title to that portion remaining after the sale. At the same time, he acquired approximately $16,000.00 as his share of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>proceeds of the sale. He used part of that amount to purchase marijuana for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">A search of the appellant\u2019s property was conducted pursuant to a search and seizure warrant<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on July 2, 1991. As a result of that search, approximately two pounds of marijuana were seized from a gas barbecue grill located outside the house. Paraphernalia, <em>ie. </em>items commonly used in the drug trade for weighing and packaging drugs, <em>see </em>Maryland Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 286(a)(4), consisting of sandwich baggies, found in a bedroom bureau drawer, and a set of triple beam scales were also seized. Forty-two marijuana plants, ranging in height from five to six feet, were discovered about 150-200 yards north of the residence, but adjacent thereto. The trial court did not consider these plants as evidence supporting forfeiture since the plants apparently were not located on the appellant\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The appellant pled guilty to one count of possession of a controlled dangerous substance in sufficient quantity to indicate an intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense pursuant to Article 27, \u00a7 286.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He was sentenced to five years impris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>onment, three and one-half years of which were suspended.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thereafter, the appellee filed a petition to forfeit Aravanis\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">At the forfeiture trial, the appellee relied upon the application and affidavit for the search and seizure warrant, detailing two controlled buys from the appellant\u2019s property, the return showing that <em>2lk </em>pounds of marijuana and drug paraphernalia were discovered on the property, and the appellant\u2019s guilty plea to possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Appearing <em>pro se, </em>the appellant maintained that the appellee failed to establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that (1) he acquired the real property in question during the period he was violating \u00a7 286 and (2) there was no other source for the acquisition of the property, as required by \u00a7 <em>297(l)</em>.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>other hand, the appellee argued that the forfeiture was controlled by \u00a7 297(m).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It maintained that \u00a7 297(l) applies only when there are questions as to ownership, and legislative presumptions thereof. It is inapplicable in this case, the appellee asserts, because there is no doubt that the appellant owned the property in question. The trial court agreed. Stating, \u201cthere is no doubt that Aravanis owns the real property in question,\u201d it determined that subsection (1) was inapplicable as it is \u201cdirected towards establishing an ownership in property for which there is no tangible evidence of ownership, <em>e.g., </em>a deed, motor vehicle title or a bill of sale.\u201d Memorandum Opinion and Order at 5.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>The appellant maintained that he had lived on his property for over twenty years, but had dealt drugs for only two months. Therefore, he argued that forfeiture of his property was excessive: the \u201cpenalty is far beyond the ... crime\u201d and \u201cfor this state or this country to take a man\u2019s home ... for a few months of illegal activity, is not right.\u201d Maintaining that forfeiture was punishment, the appellee argued that it was intended to be harsh. Neither it nor the appellant presented any other evidence concerning the value of either the subject property or of the marijuana seized or as to any other factor bearing on the fairness of the forfeiture. Concluding that \u201c[t]here is no question that the real property at Shelltown Road was used in connection with the distributing and dispensing of marijuana,\u201d the court believed that it had no discretion to do anything except order forfeiture. It reasoned that its \u201conly responsibilities are to determine if any statutory exceptions apply ... and whether there has been an adherence to due process....\u201d Opinion and Order of the Court at 9. The court found no exceptions applied and that due process had been met. In doing so, the court acknowledged the harshness of the forfeiture, particularly the subject one, as it relates to the appellant. Nevertheless, it was satisfied that it was justified in light of the legislative intent of Maryland\u2019s drug statutes, including \u00a7 297. The court pointed out that the latter statute was another \u201cenforcement tool in [the State\u2019s] arsenal against the spread of controlled dangerous substances,\u201d Order and Opinion of the Court at 7, a \u201c \u2018part of [the State\u2019s] \u201cfull court press\u201d against the illicit drug traffic.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ewachiw v. Director of Finance of Baltimore City, </em>70 Md.App. 58, 60, 519 A.2d 1327, 1328 (1987). The constitutional issue this appeal presents was not expressly addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>The appellant appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. We granted certiorari on our own motion prior to that court considering it.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The appellant challenges the forfeiture in this case as an excessive f\u00edne under both the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 25 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. For the former proposition, he relies on <em>Austin v. United States, </em>_ U.S._, 113 S.Ct. 2801, 125 L.Ed.2d 488 (1993), in which the United States Supreme Court held that the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment applies to <em>in rem </em>civil forfeitures ordered pursuant to a punitive federal forfeiture statute. Because he maintains that it is binding on the several states, through the Fourteenth Amendment, necessarily, civil forfeitures imposed pursuant to punitive state forfeiture statutes, such as \u00a7 297, are also subject to that clause\u2019s limitations. Moreover, he asserts, Article 25 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, is in <em>para materia </em>with the Eighth Amendment and, thus, must be interpreted co-extensively with it. As such, the appellant contends that, even if this Court were to determine that the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment is inapplicable, the Excessive Fines clause in Article 25 is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">At issue in <em>Austin </em>was \u201cwhether the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment applies to forfeitures of property under 21 USC \u00a7\u00a7 881(a)(4) and (a)(7).\u201d _ U.S. at _, 113 S.Ct. at 2803, 125 L.Ed.2d at 494. To resolve that issue, the Court perceived the question to be \u201cnot, as the United States would have it, whether forfeiture under \u00a7\u00a7 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) is civil or criminal, but rather whether it is punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at _, 113 S.Ct. at 2806, 125 L.Ed.2d at 497. This formulation of the issue was compelled by the purpose of the Eighth Amendment in general and the Excessive Fines Clause in particular. Relying on <em>Browning-Ferris </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number><em>Industries v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., </em>492 U.S. 257, 109 S.Ct. 2909, 106 L.Ed.2d 219 (1989), the Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-4\">The purpose of the Eighth Amendment, putting the Bail Clause to one side, was to limit the government\u2019s power to punish.... The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause is self-evidently concerned with punishment. The Excessive Fines Clause limits the Government\u2019s power to extract payments, whether in cash or in kind, <em>\u201cas punishment </em>for some offense.\u201d (Citation omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">_ U.S. at _, 113 S.Ct. at 2805, 125 L.Ed.2d at 497 (quoting <em>Browning-Ferris, </em>492 U.S. at 265, 109 S.Ct. at 2915, 106 L.Ed.2d at 232).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">The Court held that \u00a7\u00a7 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) are punitive. It was led to that conclusion by four factors: (1) \u201cforfeiture generally and statutory <em>in rem </em>forfeitures in particular, historically have been understood, at least in part, as punishment,\u201d _ U.S. at _, 113 S.Ct. at 2810, 125 L.Ed.2d at 503; (2) both \u00a7 881(a)(4) and \u00a7 881(a)(7) contain an \u201cinnocent owner\u201d defense or exemption, which, because it \u201creveals a ... congressional intent to punish only those involved in drug trafficking,\u201d <em>id. </em>at _, 113 S.Ct. at 2811, 125 L.Ed.2d at 504, \u201cserve[s] to focus the provisions on the culpability of the owner in a way that makes them look more like punishment, not less,\u201d <em>id. </em>at _, 113 S.Ct. at 2810, 125 L.Ed.2d at 503; (3) Congress chose to tie forfeiture under \u00a7\u00a7 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) directly to the commission of drug offenses, by permitting forfeiture of a vehicle or real property on the basis of its use or intended use to facilitate either the transportation of drugs or the commission of a drug related crime punishable by more than one year\u2019s imprisonment, <em>id. </em>at _, 113 S.Ct. at 2811, 125 L.Ed.2d at 504; and (4) the forfeiture statute\u2019s legislative history, which reveals Congress\u2019 admission \u201cthat the traditional criminal sanctions of fine and imprisonment are inadequate to deter or punish the enormously profitable trade in dangerous drugs\u201d and its belief that real property forfeiture is \u201ca powerful deterrent,\u201d raises the inference that those sections are punitive. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>The <em>Austin </em>court rejected the government\u2019s argument that the subject forfeiture provisions were remedial in two respects. While acknowledging that the forfeiture of contraband is remedial because it removes dangerous or illegal items from society, _ U.S. at _, 113 S.Ct. at 2811, 125 L.Ed.2d at 504-05, citing <em>United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, </em>465 U.S. 354, 364, 104 S.Ct. 1099, 1105, 79 L.Ed.2d 361, 369-70 (1984), the Court refused to characterize a mobile home and auto body shop, the property seized in that case, as \u201cinstruments\u201d of the drug trade. <em>Id. </em>It noted, in that regard, that \u201cthere is nothing even remotely criminal in possessing, [them],\u201d <em>id. </em>_ U.S. at _, 113 S.Ct. at 2811, 125 L.Ed.2d at 505 (quoting <em>One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania, </em>380 U.S. 693, 699, 85 S.Ct. 1246, 1250, 14 L.Ed.2d 170, 174 (1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">The Court similarly was unimpressed by the government\u2019s argument that the forfeited items compensated the government for its expenditures for law enforcement activity and \u201con societal problems such as urban blight, drug addition, and other health concerns resulting from the drug trade.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As to that, the Court was of the view that, given \u201cthe dramatic variations in the value of conveyances and real property forfeitable under \u00a7\u00a7 881(a)(4) and (a)(7),\u201d <em>id., </em>\u201cthe \u2018forfeiture of property ... [is] a penalty that has absolutely no correlation to any damages sustained by society or to the cost of enforcing the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>_ U.S. at _, 113 S.Ct. at 2812, 125 L.Ed.2d at 505 (quoting <em>United States v. Ward, </em>448 U.S. 242, 254, 100 S.Ct. 2636, 2644, 65 L.Ed.2d 742, 753 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">Section 297 is, like \u00a7 881, a civil <em>in rem </em>forfeiture statute, <em>see 1986 Mercedes Benz 560 CE v. State, </em>334 Md. 264, 273, 638 A.2d 1164, 1168 (1994), of the type that \u201chistorically [has] been understood, at least in part, as punishment.\u201d <em>See Austin, </em>_ U.S. at _, 113 S.Ct. at 2810, 125 L.Ed.2d at 503. Moreover, the applicable provisions are similar to the provisions construed in <em>Austin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-13\">Section 297(b)(9) subjects to forfeiture \u201c[i]n the manner provided under subsection (1) and (m) of this section, all real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>property.\u201d Section 297(c) defines property not subject to forfeiture. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-4\">Property or an interest in property described under subsections (b)(4), (9) and (10) of this section may not be forfeited if the owner establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the violation of this subheading was done without the owner\u2019s actual knowledge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">In <em>1986 Mercedes Benz, 560 CE, supra, </em>construing subsection (l), the provisions of which we characterized as clear and unambiguous, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\">It is rebuttably presumed that property which a person owns or in which he or she has an ownership interest constitutes proceeds and, hence, is subject to forfeiture, whenever the State, by clear and convincing evidence proves that: (1) the person has committed one or more of several enumerated controlled dangerous substances offenses; (2) the person acquired the property during the period in which, or within a reasonable time after, the violation or violations occurred; and (3) the violation was the only likely source of the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 278-79, 638 A.2d at 1171. Subsection (m) references certain drug activity, engagement in which subjects property used therewith to forfeiture. Among the drug activity proscribed is possession of a controlled dangerous substance in sufficient quantity to reasonably indicate under all circumstances an intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance. <em>See </em>\u00a7 286(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">The applicable forfeiture provision in this case is \u00a7 297(m). Because \u00a7 297(c) references subsection (b)(9), which in turn refers to subsection (m), the exemptions contained in subsection (c), are also applicable to subsection (m). Thus, \u00a7 297(m), like \u00a7\u00a7 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) of the federal statute, contains an innocent owner exemption. That, in addition to knowledge, the federal statute refers to the consent or willful blindness of the owner does not require or suggest a different result. <em>See United States v. One Parcel of Real Estate at 6640 Southwest 48th Street, </em>831 F.Supp. 1578, 1585 (S.D.Fla.1993); <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number><em>States v. 2901 Southwest 118th Court, </em>683 F.Supp. 783, 788 (S.D.Fla.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">Furthermore, forfeiture in the case of subsection (m) is tied, as in the federal statute, to various drug offenses, including, as applicable herein, the possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance. Finally, the legislative history of \u00a7 297 in general, <em>State v. One 1984 Toyota Truck, </em>311 Md. 171, 177, 533 A.2d 659, 661-62 (1987); <em>Pr. George\u2019s Co. v. One 1969 Opel, </em>267 Md. 491, 495, 298 A.2d 168, 170 (1973) and subsection (m),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in particular, Floor Report on Senate Bill 419 at 1, reveals a purpose, like that of the federal forfeiture statute, to \u201cdeter crime by creating civil procedures governing the forfeiture of property and proceeds derived from enumerated CDS offenses, or used to commit or facilitate these crimes.\u201d That history also indicates that the Legislature, like Congress, intended forfeiture to be \u201ca powerful prosecutorial tool for stopping CDS offenders and depriving them of the huge profits reaped from their illegal activities.\u201d Floor Report at 4. Therefore, the construction of the federal statute is persuasive as to the meaning of the Maryland statute. <em>See Allen v. State, </em>91 Md.App. 775, 783, 605 A.2d 994, 998, <em>cert. denied, </em>328 Md. 92, 612 A.2d 1315 (1992). It is also relevant that the State and the trial court held that the purpose of the Maryland forfeiture statute is, at least in part, punitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Accordingly, it follows that \u00a7 297, and in particular subsection (m) is, like \u00a7\u00a7 881(a)(4) and (a)(7), a punitive statute, the purpose of which is to require \u201cdirect payment to a sovereign as punishment for some offense.\u201d <em>Browning-Ferris, </em>492 U.S. at 265, 109 S.Ct. at 2915, 106 L.Ed.2d at 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The appellant argues that the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment is applicable to the forfei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>ture <em>sub judice. </em>We do not reach that issue, however, because we hold that the excessive fines provision of Article 25 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights applies.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Article 25 is, textually and historically, substantially identical to the Eighth Amendment. Indeed, both of them were taken virtually verbatim from the English Bill of Rights of 1689. <em>Walker v. State, </em>53 Md.App. 171, 183, 452 A.2d 1234, 1240 (1982), citing <em>Phipps v. State, </em>39 Md.App. 206, 211, 385 A.2d 90, 93-4 (1978). Thus, it is well settled in this State that Article 25 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights is <em>in para materia </em>with the Eighth Amendment. <em>See Minor v. State, </em>313 Md. 573, 589 n. 4, 546 A.2d 1028, 1035 n. 4 (1988) (Eldridge, J. concurring). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>Indeed, the excessive fines provision of Article 25 was one of eight such provisions which served as a model for the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment. <em>See Browning-Ferris, </em>492 U.S. at 264 n. 5, 109 S.Ct. at 2915 n. 5, 106 L.Ed.2d at 231 n. 5. Thus, the excessive fines provision of Article 25 should be interpreted co-extensively with the excessive fines provision of the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The <em>Austin </em>court declined Austin\u2019s invitation \u201cto establish a multi-factor test for determining whether a forfeiture is constitutionally \u2018excessive.\u2019 \u201d _ U.S. at _, 113 S.Ct. at 2813, 125 L.Ed.2d at 505. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-8\">Although the Court of Appeals opined \u201cthat the government is exacting too high a penalty in relation to the offense committed, ... it had no occasion to consider what factors should inform such a decision because it thought it was foreclosed from engaging in the inquiry. Prudence dictates that we allow the lower courts to consider that question in the first instance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-9\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). The Court pointed out, however, that it did not \u201crule out the possibility that the connection between the property and the offense may be relevant, but our decision today in no way limits the Court of Appeals from considering other factors in determining whether the forfeiture of Austin\u2019s property was excessive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at _ n. 15, 113 S.Ct. at 2812 n. 15, 125 L.Ed.2d at 505 n. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-12\">The latter comment was in response to Justice Scalia\u2019s concurring opinion proffering an instrumentality test as the proper standard by which the excessiveness of fines must be judged under the Eighth Amendment. Agreeing that the forfeiture in that case \u201cworks as a fine\u201d and, thus, raises the excessiveness issue, Justice Scalia stated his belief that \u201cthe excessiveness analysis must be different from that applicable to monetary fines and, perhaps, to <em>in personam </em>forfeitures,\u201d in which \u201cthe touchstone is the value cf the fine in relation to the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at _, 113 S.Ct. at 2814-15, 125 L.Ed.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>508. Commenting on the relevance of the offense of which the defendant is convicted to the property sought to be forfeited, Justice Scalia argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-4\">But an <em>in rem </em>forfeiture goes beyond the traditional limits that the Eighth Amendment permits if it applies to property that cannot properly be regarded as an instrumentality of the offense\u2014the building, for example, in which an isolated drug sale happens to occur. Such a confiscation would be an excessive fine. The question is not how much the confiscated property is worth but whether the confiscated property has a close enough relationship to the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">_ U.S. at _, 113 S.Ct. at 2815, 125 L.Ed.2d at 509. According to Justice Scalia, therefore, the relevant inquiry involves asking whether the relationship of the property to the offense is \u201cclose enough to render the property, under traditional standards, \u2018guilty\u2019 and hence forfeitable?\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Since the <em>Austin </em>decision, a number of courts have been faced with the task of formulating a test by which to assess whether an <em>in rem </em>forfeiture is excessive under the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment or a comparable State provision. The results have not been uniform. Some courts have adopted the instrumentality test espoused by Justice Scalia. <em>See United States v. Chandler, </em>36 F.3d 358 (4th Cir.1994);<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>One Ford Motor Vehicle VIN </em># <em>1 FACP41A8LFZ17570 v.

The court formulated a three part test for determining the excessiveness of an <em>in rem </em>forfeiture under the Eighth Amendment. That test \u201cconsiders (1) the nexus between the offense and the property and the extent of the property\u2019s role in the offense, (2) the role and culpability of the owner, and (3) the possibility of separating offending property that can readily be separated from the remainder.\u201d 36 F.3d at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Underlying the first factor is the notion \u201cthat Congress, in providing for civil forfeiture of property involved in drug offenses for which punishment exceeds one year, ... did not intend to punish or fine by a particular amount or value; instead, it intended to punish by forfeiting property at whatever value which was <em>tainted </em>by the offense. Accordingly, the constitutional limitation on the government\u2019s action must be applied to the degree and the extent of the taint, and not to the value of the property or the gravity of the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364. (Citation omitted) Given this primary focus, the court formulated additional factors to be considered \u201c(i]n measuring the strength and extent of the nexus between the property and the offense\u201d: (1) the extent to which the use of the property was deliberate and planned or merely incidental and fortuitous; (2) the property\u2019s importance to the success of the illegal activity; (3) how long the property was used and the spatial extent of its use; (4) whether the illegal use was isolated or repetitive; and (5) the purpose for acquiring, maintaining or using the property. <em>Id. </em>at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">The second factor gives recognition to the fact that the forfeiture statute is a punitive statute and that the person punished is the owner of the property. <em>Id. </em>at 364. The final factor is a pragmatic one which explores the possibility of separating the tainted property from non-implicated property, when it is readily separable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>The test developed by the <em>Chandler </em>court does not include a proportionality factor. This is so because the court rejected proportionality as an aspect of the Eighth Amendment\u2019s Excessive Fines Clause, reasoning that <em>Solem v. Helm, supra, </em>from which the proportionality analysis derives, has been undermined by <em>Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 886 (1991),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>id. </em>at 365, and that the proportionality principle, if it exists at all, in the Eighth Amendment, derives from the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause and not the Excessive Fines Clause. Id. at 365-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Although by no means representative of this class of case\u2014 as we have seen, there are a variety of multi-factor tests, using a variety of proportionality <em>factors\u20146625 Zumirez Drive </em>is both instructive and persuasive. In that case, the court developed a three-factor test for determining whether a forfeiture violates the Excessive Fines Clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-6\">(1) the inherent gravity of the offense compared with the harshness of the penalty; (2) whether the property was an integral part of the commission of the crime; and (3) whether the criminal activity involving the defendant property was extensive in terms of time and/or spatial use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AU5\">845 F.Supp. at 732 (footnote omitted). No single factor was deemed to be dispositive. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Although the first factor was derived from <em>Solem, supra, </em>the court made clear why it is appropriately applied in the excessive fines context, because \u201c[t]he word \u2018excessive\u2019 in the Excessive Fines Clause implicitly prohibits those fines that exceed the crime alleged.\u201d <em>Id. See also 9638 Chicago Heights, </em>27 F.3d at 330 (after pointing out the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Court\u2019s refusal to adopt the instrumentality test, finding it \u201cinadequate because it conflates the Eighth Amendment excessive fine analysis with the section 881(a)(7) nexus requirement.\u201d); <em>United States v. R.R. </em># <em>1, Box 224, </em>14 F.3d at 873 (noting that majority did not adopt Justice Scalia\u2019s proposed test and warning against \u201cconflating the Eight Amendment inquiry with section 881(a)(7)\u2019s nexus requirement\u201d); <em>One 1990 Ford Ranger, </em>876 F.Supp. at 1287 (\u201ca forfeiture can only be \u2018excessive\u2019 if it is compared to something else\u201d). Addressing when this factor is applicable, the court asserted that the conduct for which the forfeiture penalty is imposed may range from conviction for the criminal act underlying the forfeiture to acquittal of those acts and that the focus should be on the claimant\u2019s or owner\u2019s conduct. 845 F.Supp. at 733. In that regard, it said, an owner who has been acquitted has engaged in behavior less grave than one who has never been charged, which is, in turn, less grave than that of one who has been charged and convicted of the criminal conduct. Id. The court explained that not only must the owner\u2019s culpability be considered in connection with the gravity prong, but it also must be considered, along with the monetary and intangible value of the property forfeited, in evaluating the harshness of the penalty imposed. Id. at 733-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">The second factor is the instrumentality test. Derived from the Scalia concurring opinion, its focus is on whether the property was an integral part of the commission of the crime. Id. at 734. Unlike Justice Scalia, however, included in the analysis is an assessment of the culpability of the property owner and the property; according to the court, that is a necessary aspect of excessive fines analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 733-34. Concluding that the <em>Austin </em>court majority held that civil forfeiture punishes, at least in part, the claimant for offensive conduct and, thus, at least implicitly, recognized the appropriateness of analyzing whether the fine is excessive in comparison with the claimant\u2019s conduct, the court, also focusing on Justice Scalia\u2019s statement of the relevant inquiry: \u201cthe relationship of the property to the offense,\u201d <em>see Austin, </em>_ U.S. at _, 113 S.Ct. at 2815, 125 L.Ed.2d at 509 (Scalia, J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>concurring), rejects Justice Scalia\u2019s apparent disregard of the role of the owner in causing the forfeiture. It points out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4A\">[T]he use of the word \u201coffense\u201d in the phrase \u201crelationship of the property to the offense\u201d implies that an offense or at least offensive conduct has occurred, giving rise to the civil forfeiture. Since the claimant is the person punished for the offense, and since an offense cannot occur without some human participation, it would be illogical not to consider relevant the extent of the claimant\u2019s involvement in the offense. By addressing both the claimant\u2019s and the property\u2019s relationship to the offensive conduct, the Court believes that its multifactor test accurately determines whether the punishment imposed by a civil forfeiture violates the Excessive Fines Clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">845 F.Supp. at 734 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The final factor looks at the extent to which the property was used in the criminal activity. \u201cUnder this factor, the Court looks not only at whether the defendant property was an integral part of the criminal activity, but whether the defendant property played an extensive or pervasive role in the commission of the crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">The requirements of the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment and, hence, of Article 25 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, mandate that recognition and effect be given to the use of the word \u201cexcessive\u201d in that clause and to the <em>Austin </em>court\u2019s holding that a civil forfeiture is punishment. In order that a forfeiture constitutes punishment, it must necessarily have as its object, in addition to the property itself, some person. Notwithstanding the argument made by Justice Scalia and the cases adopting it, logically that person is the owner of the property. It is appropriate, therefore, that the owner\u2019s culpability with respect to the underlying criminal activity be considered. While the relationship of the property to the offense is, as most courts recognize, a relevant and important factor, it is not, as the <em>Austin </em>court recognized, the only factor. But that is precisely what the instrumentality test, considered alone, does\u2014\u201cit conflates the Eighth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>ment excessive fines analysis with the \u00a7 881(a)(7) nexus requirement.\u201d <em>9638 Chicago Heights, </em>27 F.3d at 330. The Excessive Fines Clause requires more.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that resolution of a claim that a forfeiture of property violates the constitutional prohibition against imposition of excessive fines necessarily requires consideration of not only those factors involved in \u201cinstrumentality\u201d test, but also factors of proportionality that compare the gravity of the offense or offenses involving the property and the extent of involvement of the owner with the enormity of the loss to the owner occasioned by the forfeiture. Thus, while the several factors set forth in <em>U.S. v. Chandler, supra, </em>36 F.3d at 365, provide a sound basis for evaluating the relationship between the property and the illegal activity, the enormity of the loss to the owner, the gravity, scope, and duration of the illegal activity, and the degree of the owner\u2019s culpability also must be considered.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Proportionality, as that term is used here, does not include the necessity to compare forfeiture laws or practices of other jurisdictions\u2014it means simply that there must be a comparison of the extent of the loss to the relevant factors involved, including the gravity and extent of the illegal activity, the nexus between that conduct and the subject property, and the extent of involvement of the owner\u2014all to determine whether the \u201cfine\u201d is out of all reasonable proportion to the relevant factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">It would be premature for us to propose, by this opinion, a precise formula or laundry list of factors to fit every case that will come before the courts. We can at this juncture only paint with a rather broad brush, identifying the required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>areas of consideration and the non-exclusive list of factors we have discussed, leaving to the trial judges in the first instance the weighing of factors appropriate to each individual case.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR SOMERSET COUNTY VACATED.

We note, as did the appellant in argument, that although the Supreme Court has never decided whether the excessive fines provision of the Eighth Amendment is applicable to the several states, at least one Justice of the Supreme Court sees no reasonable basis for treating it differently than the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause or the Excessive Bail Clause. <em>See Browning-Ferris Industries v. Kelco Disposal Inc., </em>492 U.S. 257, 284, 109 S.Ct. 2909, 2925, 106 L.Ed.2d 219, 244 (O'Connor, J. concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\"since <em>Robinson [v.

I see no reason to distinguish one Clause of the Eighth Amendment from another for purposes of incorporation, and would hold that the Excessive Fines Clause also applies to the States.\u201d). Indeed, this Court, in <em>Randall Book Corp. v.

It ultimately concluded that \"the cumulative punishments did not mount up to an excessive fine or to cruel or unusual punishment within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the Attorney General in an <em>amicus curia </em>brief filed in the <em>Austin </em>case expressed belief that \"[t]here is little doubt that the Eighth Amendment prohibition against ... excessive fines ... would apply to the states.\u201d Finally, a number of States, <em>albeit </em>without analysis, have applied the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment in resolving challenges to forfeitures under state forfeiture statutes. <em>See e.g., Pickard v.

Borromeo, </em>1 F.3d 219, 221 (4th Cir.1993). That inquiry, as <em>U.S. v. Chandler, </em>36 F.3d 358 (4th Cir.1994) attests, is no longer the appropriate one in that circuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b729-4\">. The court reversed the district court decision in <em>United States v. 9638 Chicago Heights, </em>831 F.Supp. 736 (E.D.Mo.1993), which had applied the <em>Scalia </em>instrumentality test as the sole factor informing forfeiture.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b729-5\">. Prior to the decision in <em>United States v. 18755 North Bay Road, </em>13 F.3d 1493 (11th Cir.1994), the district court had adopted the instrumentality test as the sole measure of excessiveness. <em>United States v. 427 &amp; 429 Hall Street, </em>842 F.Supp. 1421 (M.D.Ala.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b730-5\">. The test addresses proportionality within the context of a Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause analysis. It is multi-factored. Under the first factor, the court determines whether the property is substantially used for illegal purposes. If it is, then the total value of the drugs involved in the underlying criminal activity is compared to the total value of the properly subject to forfeiture. Forfeiture is presumptively excessive if the value of the latter is disproportionate to the value of the former. That presumption may be rebutted, however, by the government\u2019s \"cost of investigation and detection, as well as other costs and damages attributable to the criminal misconduct of the claimant.\u201d <em>United States v. 38 Whalers Cove Drive, </em>954 F.2d 29, 37 (2nd Cir.1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b732-8\">. In support of this proposition, the <em>Chandler </em>court pointed out that, in <em>Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991), two justices flatly rejected the proportionality principle as a part of the Eighth Amendment, <em>id. </em>at 964-66, 111 S.Ct. at 2686, 115 L.Ed.2d at 846, and that three others would limit the scope of <em>Solem v. Helm, </em>463 U.S. 277, 103 S.Ct. 3001, 77 L.Ed.2d 637 (1983), by holding that the Eighth Amendment \"forbids only extreme sentences that are \u2018grossly disproportionate\u2019 to the crime,\u201d rather than requiring strict proportionality between the crime and the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1000, 111 S.Ct. at 2705, 115 L.Ed.2d at 869.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b735-6\">. Proof of the relevant factors in a forfeiture case is not limited to a particular offense charged. Proof of the duration and extent of the course of criminal activity and its nexus to the property may be appropriate, and the State may well wish to show the extent of profit to the owner from this course of conduct because that fact bears on the question of how much the owner actually loses by the forfeiture. Profits from the illegal activity may be shown by direct evidence, or indirectly through a showing of net worth of the owner and the absence of other known or demonstrable sources of income.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b736-6\">. The State argues that the Maryland General Assembly has already considered, and decided, the proportionality issue; hence, there is no occasion for this Court to do so again. It offers as reasons for that conclusion the fact that \u00a7 297(m)(1)(ii) limits forfeiture eligibility to property involved in certain \"serious\u201d crimes, while the federal statute did not. We reject that argument. Both the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment and the comparable clause in Article 25 address \"excessive fines imposed,\u201d in the case of Maryland, \" \u2018by the courts of law.' \u201d Consequently, the clause protects, more clearly in the case of Maryland, against fines actually \"imposed\u201d by a court, rather than those considered and either adopted or rejected by a legislature. See <em>Idaho v. Real Property Located in Minidoka County, supra. </em>In that case, a similar argument was made to the Supreme Court of Idaho, with respect to a provision in the State forfeiture statute, which provided, \u201cthe size of the property forfeited shall not be unfairly disproportionate to the size of the property actually used in violation of the provisions of this section.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383. Recognizing that the legislature did address the excessive fines issue in the statute, the court also rejected the argument that the statute was not subject to excessive fines analysis. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-7\">The fact that the statute purports to limit the size of property which could be taken does not preclude the possibility that the property actually taken could constitute an excessive fine under the Eighth Amendment. Subsection (e) cannot shield the forfeiture from Eighth Amendment review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">885 P.2d at 383-84.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
