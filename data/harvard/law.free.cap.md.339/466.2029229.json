We hold that the trial judge erred in admitting such testimony. We further find that the admission of the testimony was not harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">This case arises out of the 1993 conviction of Richard Lee Hutchins (Hutchins) for theft of an automobile valued over $300. Testimony at trial established that, on October 24,1992, in an attempt to sell the vehicle, Scott Hanson (Hanson) parked his 1986 Nissan Maxima on a grassy strip across from the Paris Oaks Shopping Center in Calvert County.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hanson placed a \u201cfor sale\u201d sign on the vehicle. Hanson left the car at that location for about four days, stopping on the way home from work each night and driving the car back to his home. On the morning of October 29, 1992, Hanson stopped to pick up some personal items he had left in the trunk of the car and to remove some papers from the glove compartment. At that time, the license plates were on the front and rear of the automobile and both the emergency brake and the car\u2019s alarm system were working properly. On his way home, Hanson saw that the car was missing. Hanson then returned home and notified the Sheriff\u2019s Department that the car had been stolen. The car was later located and recovered by the District of Columbia police. When the car was recovered, the license plates had been removed and placed in the trunk, the brake cable had been broken, and the alarm system was damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The State produced evidence indicating that on October 28 and 29, 1992, Hutchins had contacted Sherbert\u2019s Towing Inc. (Sherbert\u2019s) by phone, identifying himself as Richard Johnson, and requested that they pick up a 1986 Nissan Maxima at the Paris Oaks Shopping Center. Hutchins asked Sherbert\u2019s to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>tow the car to his place of business, Richard\u2019s Auto Sales, located on Marlboro Pike, where he would meet the tow truck driver. He informed Sherbert\u2019s that the brake was off and the wheels were straight, so they did not need the keys to the car to tow it. After meeting the tow truck operator at Richard\u2019s Auto Sales on Marlboro Pike, Hutchins had the driver follow him and tow the car to a lot in Washington, D.C. where the car was ultimately recovered. Hutchins paid the tow truck operator with a check that was later returned due to insufficient funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">In his defense, Hutchins admitted that he had had the ear towed, but argued that he had purchased the car from a man named Chris Joblonski (Joblonski).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hutchins stated that he operated Richard\u2019s Auto Sales and also sold cars at the D.C. lot where the car was recovered. He testified that he was at Paris Oaks Shopping Center when he noticed the Nissan parked nearby. He saw Joblonski showing the ear so he approached Joblonski about purchasing it. Hutchins testified that Joblonski had a key to the vehicle and that Joblonski indicated that the vehicle had been purchased by his company, Day\u2019s Auto Sales, at a police auction. Hutchins later met Joblonski at the Paris Oaks Shopping Center and exchanged $3,000 for the car. At that \u2022 time, Hutchins alleged that Joblonski gave him the keys to the automobile as well as paperwork concerning the automobile, which included: (1) a notarized document purportedly issued by the Arlington County, Virginia Police Department stating that vehicle # 91 04 16 094, a 1986 Nissan Maxima 4-door with VIN number JN1HU1158GT131413 was sold for $3,000 to Day\u2019s Auto Sales; (2) a Maryland dealer\u2019s Bill of Sale; (3) a Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration Notice of Exclusion or Modification of Implied Warranty; and (4) Joblonski\u2019s business card indicating that he worked for Day\u2019s Auto Sales. Although required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>by law, the paperwork did not contain the vehicle\u2019s mileage. Hutchins\u2019s counsel conceded that the paperwork turned out to be fake, but argued that Hutchins did not realize that at the time and he therefore believed he had entered into a valid business transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Hutchins testified that he discovered the car was missing when he attempted to show his business partner the vehicle and found that it was no longer on the lot. When he saw that the car was gone, he went to the D.C. Police Station, where he learned that it had been confiscated and that there was a Calvert County warrant out for his arrest. Hutchins then turned himself in to the Calvert County police, presenting the paperwork that he alleged represented the sale of the car to him by Joblonski.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Following the close of the defense case, the State called two expert witnesses in rebuttal, Melvin Richards (Richards) of Colonial Auction Services and Fred Hardin (Hardin), President of Marlow Motors. Richards, an auctioneer, was accepted by the court as an \u201cexpert auctioneer which includes the buying and selling of automobiles.\u201d The State proffered that Richards would testify that in his opinion the documents produced by Hutchins as evidence of the sale of the vehicle were not authentic. Hardin was called to testify as an \u201cexpert as to the sales of autos between dealers.\u201d Defense counsel objected to the expert testimony stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">\u201cI have filed a motion that if they were going to use any kind of expert witness, I\u2019m required to\u2014the State is required to give me who the expert witnesses are and proffer on what they\u2019re supposed to testify to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">i}: i{: ^ sis</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\">I had given the State copies of my documentation. The first time that I found out that they supposedly had an expert witness was fifteen minutes ago from the State\u2019s Attorney. I\u2019m clearly completely unprepared after receiving nothing despite my request to\u2014if they\u2019re going to have an expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>testimony, I want to know who the experts are and what they\u2019re going to testify to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">jjc <em>% </em>}js # #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">[W]e have no chance of bringing in our own experts, no knowledge of what [the expert] has already told the State\u2019s Attorney or one of the State\u2019s Attorney agents. And this is the most unfair situation that I can imagine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">The State argued that the experts were on call and that it could not have anticipated whether it was going to call the experts to testify until it knew whether the defendant would testify. The trial judge admitted the expert testimony, finding that although disclosure of the expert would be required if the State was to use the expert in its case in chief, it was not required when the expert is called in rebuttal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">\u201c[The State doesn\u2019t] know whether the Defendant is ever going to testify. If the Defendant comes in and testifies, then I think the answer is that they would have a right to bring somebody in and try to rebut that particular testimony, particularly in a specialized field.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">Richards and Hardin each testified that they had sold automobiles to Hutchins in the past and that they had never heard of Day\u2019s Auto Sales. They also testified that Maryland law prohibits dealers from selling automobiles outside of their lots other than at authorized areas and Richards testified that the law requires that the odometer reading be listed on the documents that Hutchins had produced as evidence of the sale of the automobile. They both further stated that the exclusion of implied warranty form produced by Hutchins is not filled out in transactions between dealers. Richards also introduced documentation indicating that a 1979 Dodge two door with the same reference number 910416094 as that on the documentation provided by Hutchins was sold at auction by Arlington County. Additionally, during Hardin\u2019s testimony, the State produced a document Hardin had obtained which indicated that a company named C &amp; S Auto Sales, for which Hutchins had worked, had purchased another automobile with the reference number 910416094 from Arlington County. Richards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>also testified as to how one can get a key made for a car if one does not have the keys. During the testimony of these expert witnesses, defense counsel complained that he had not previously been shown any of the exhibits used by the experts during their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">At the close of the State\u2019s rebuttal case, defense counsel sought a suspension of the proceedings for one or two weeks so that he could rebut the testimony of Hardin and Richards. The court denied this request as well as a request by the defense for a judgment of acquittal. The trial judge then rendered a verdict of guilty against Hutchins.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Hutchins appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed the trial judge. <em>See Hutchins v. State, </em>101 Md.App. 640, 647 A.2d 1271 (1994). The intermediate appellate court held that the State was required to disclose to the defense the substance of the conclusions made by the experts whom the State had consulted. <em>Hutchins, </em>101 Md.App. at 650, 647 A.2d at 1277. The court nonetheless held that the error in failing to make this disclosure was harmless, because the expert testimony consisted of factual testimony which supported Hutchins\u2019s own concession that the paperwork he had produced was not authentic. <em>Hutchins, </em>101 Md.App. at 651-52, 647 A.2d at 1277. The court also held that a continuance was not required because \u201cthere was no reason whatsoever to believe that a continuance would turn up Joblonski or any other witnesses whose testimony would impeach the testimony presented by the State\u2019s rebuttal -witnesses.\u201d <em>Hutchins, </em>101 Md.App. at 652, 647 A.2d at 1277. Hutchins petitioned for a writ of certiorari which we granted to determine whether the trial judge erred in permitting the expert testimony and, if so, whether such an error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Maryland Rule 4-263(b) sets forth the information that the State\u2019s Attorney must provide to a criminal defendant upon request. Under Md.Rule 4-263(b)(1), the State must \u201c[djisclose to the defendant the name and address of each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>person then known whom the State intends to call as a witness at the hearing or trial to prove its case in chief or to rebut alibi testimony.\u201d Maryland Rule 4-263(b)(4) requires the State to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">\u201cProduce and permit the defendant to inspect and copy all written reports or statements made in connection with the action by each expert consulted by the State, including the results of any physical or mental examination, scientific test, experiment, or comparison, and furnish the defendant with the substance of any such oral report and conclusion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axb0\">The purpose of this discovery rule is to \u201cassist the defendant in preparing his defense, and to protect him from surprise.\u201d <em>Mayson v. State, </em>238 Md. 283, 287, 208 A.2d 599, 602 (1965) (discussing Md.Rule 728, a precursor to Md.Rule 4-263).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">In the instant case, the trial judge appeared to refer only to Md.Rule 4-263(b)(1) and held that, because the experts were called as rebuttal witnesses rather than in the State\u2019s case in chief, the State was not obligated to disclose the experts to the defendant. We do not agree with the trial judge\u2019s interpretation of the requirements of Md.Rule 4-263. We agree that because Richards and Hardin did not testify in the State\u2019s case in chief, the State was not required to disclose these witnesses to Hutchins under Maryland Rule 4-263(b)(1). Nevertheless, whether or not Richards and Hardin testified in the State\u2019s case in chief or in rebuttal, the State was required to disclose their names and written conclusions or statements to Hutchins under Md.Rule 4\u2014263(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">In <em>Hoey v. State, </em>311 Md. 473, 536 A.2d 622 (1988), this Court considered the disclosure requirements set forth under Md.Rule 4\u2014263(b)(1) and (b)(4). In <em>Hoey, </em>the State, in an effort to rebut the defendant\u2019s assertion of lack of criminal responsibility, called as an expert a psychiatrist who had treated the defendant. Defense counsel objected to the introduction of this testimony, arguing that the State had not disclosed its intention to call the psychiatrist as an expert witness. We held that disclosure of the psychiatrist\u2019s testimony was not required under either Md.Rule 4\u2014263(b)(1) or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>(b)(4). <em>Hoey, </em>311 Md. at 488-89, 536 A.2d at 629. Addressing the required disclosure under Md.Rule 4\u2014263(b)(1), we noted that the psychiatrist\u2019s testimony was neither part of the State\u2019s case in chief, nor an attempt to rebut alibi testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgC-\">\u201cRule 4-263(b)(1) requires the State\u2019s Attorney to disclose (1) witnesses in its case in chief, and (2) witnesses in rebuttal of alibi testimony.... [T]he State\u2019s case in chief in a criminal prosecution consists of proving each element of a criminal offense. The State is not required to show that the defendant is criminally responsible. Instead, criminal responsibility is an issue to be raised in the defendant\u2019s case in chief. As such, any witness offered by the State to explain or disprove the defendant\u2019s evidence on criminal responsibility is, by definition, a rebuttal witness. Thus, because [the psychiatrist] did not testify in the State\u2019s case in chief or in rebuttal regarding an alibi, Rule 4-263(b)(1) did not require the State to disclose [the psychiatrist\u2019s] name to Hoey\u2019s defense counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-7\"><em>Hoey, </em>311 Md. at 488-89, 536 A.2d at 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Analyzing the necessary disclosure under Md.Rule 4-263(b)(4), we found that disclosure was only required of experts <em>consulted </em>by the State. <em>Hoey, </em>311 Md. at 489, 536 A.2d at 629. We held that the psychiatrist had not been consulted by the State because the psychiatrist \u201cdid not conduct any tests on Hoey at the request of the State\u2019s Attorney. Rather, all tests conducted by [the psychiatrist] were made as part of his duties as Hoey\u2019s treating psychiatrist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We therefore held that disclosure was not required under Md.Rule 2-463(b)(4). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">In contrast to the circumstances in <em>Hoey, </em>in the instant ease, the State clearly consulted with both Richards and Hardin. The State asked them to review the documents presented by the defendant, sought information regarding the experts\u2019 lack of familiarity with Day\u2019s Auto Sales and regarding common practices between automobile dealers, and requested documents held by both experts. Additionally, in presenting the testimony of both witnesses, the State explicit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>ly offered both Richards and Hardin as experts in their fields. Thus, both Richards and Hardin were \u201cexpert[s] consulted by the State\u201d under Md.Rule 4-263(b)(4). The State therefore had an obligation to disclose to Hutchins any written reports or statements and the substance of any oral reports and conclusions of these two experts regardless of whether or not the State expected to call Richards and Hardin to the stand to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Having determined that the State violated Md.Rule 4-263(b)(4), we must determine whether such a violation constituted harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">We initially note, as did the Court of Special Appeals, that the remedy under Md.Rule 4-263(i) for a violation of the discovery rule is within the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>See Evans v. State, </em>304 Md. 487, 500, 499 A.2d 1261, 1268 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>478 U.S. 1010, 106 S.Ct. 3310, 92 L.Ed.2d 722 (1986). In the instant case, the trial judge found as a matter of law that the State was not required to disclose the names of and conclusions of Richards and Hardin to Hutchins. The trial judge found no discovery violation and therefore exercised no discretion. As discussed above, the trial judge erred because the State did in fact violate Md.Rule 4\u2014263(b)(4) by failing to disclose any reports or statements made by the expert witnesses, Richards and Hardin. Unless such an error was harmless, we must reverse. <em>See Wilson v. State, </em>334 Md. 313, 338, 639 A.2d 125, 137 (1994); <em>Stewart v. State, </em>334 Md. 213, 228, 638 A.2d 754, 761 (1994); <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">This Court set forth the standard for evaluating harmless error in <em>Dorsey, supra. </em>We stated in <em>Dorsey:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-9\">\u201c(W]hen an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u2018harmless\u2019 and a reversal is mandat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>ed. Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of\u2014whether erroneously admitted or excluded\u2014may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.\u201d (Footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d at 678. We have applied the standard set forth in <em>Dorsey </em>in several of our recent opinions. <em>See Bhagwat v. State, </em>338 Md. 263, 282, 658 A.2d 244, 253 (1995); <em>State v. Mazzone, </em>336 Md. 379, 400, 648 A.2d 978, 988 (1994); <em>Wilson, </em>334 Md. at 338, 639 A.2d at 137; <em>Stewart, </em>334 Md. at 228, 638 A.2d at 761; <em>Evans v. State, </em>333 Md. 660, 683, 637 A.2d 117, 128-29, <em>cert. denied, </em>_ U.S._, 115 S.Ct. 109, 130 L.Ed.2d 56 (1994); <em>Beales v. State, </em>329 Md. 263, 274, 619 A.2d 105, 111 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">In the instant case, the intermediate appellate court held that the trial judge\u2019s error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and did not warrant reversal. <em>Hutchins, </em>101 Md.App. at 651, 647 A.2d at 1277. The court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">\u201cAs appellant\u2019s trial counsel pointed out in his opening statement, the documentation that would be introduced during the defendant\u2019s case was indeed \u2018bogus.\u2019 During appellant\u2019s cross examination, he conceded that, as a general rule, auto dealers do not conduct business at shopping center parking lots. He also expressed surprise that an odometer reading did not appear on any of the forms that had been introduced during his direct examination. Appellant was simply not prejudiced by opinions that were essentially consistent with his testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-10\"><em>Id. </em>The court also reasoned that not everything testified to by an expert constitutes a conclusion under Md.Rule 4-263(b)(4) and that in the instant case, \u201c[ajlmost all of the State\u2019s case in rebuttal consisted of fact testimony.\u201d <em>Hutchins, </em>101 Md.App. at 651-52, 647 A.2d at 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">Relying on the reasoning of the Court of Special Appeals, the State sets forth several arguments which it asserts support a finding that the admission of the expert rebuttal testimony and the failure of the trial judge to grant the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>requested continuance constitute harmless error. First, the State argues that the testimony of Richards and Hardin consisted of statements of fact, not opinion testimony, and that such factual testimony on the part of an expert is not required to be disclosed under Md.Rule 4\u2014263(b)(4). Second, the State argues that the \u201cfacts\u201d testified to by their rebuttal experts simply reiterated portions of Hutchins\u2019s own testimony. Finally, the State argues that in reaching his verdict, \u201c[a]t no point did the court state that it had been influenced by any opinions or conclusions expressed by the experts as to whether or not Hutchins should have known the documents from Joblonski were phony.\u201d We find these arguments unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">We note that had the trial judge recognized the State\u2019s obligation to disclose Richards and Hardin as experts and inform the defendant of their conclusions, Richards and Hardin may not have been permitted to testify at all. Regardless of the fact that much of Richards\u2019s and Hardin\u2019s testimony may have been factual, both witnesses were proffered and accepted by the trial judge as experts. The trial judge incorrectly ruled that, because Richards and Hardin were to testify in rebuttal, the State was not required to disclose the nature of Richards\u2019s and Hardin\u2019s expert opinions to Hutchins. Had the trial judge recognized that the State was in fact required under Md.Rule 4-263(b)(4) to make such a disclosure, he may have entirely excluded the testimony of Richards and Hardin.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">We do not agree with the State that the admission of the testimony was harmless in that it merely reiterated the admitted fact that Hutchins\u2019s paperwork was counterfeit. Our review of the record indicates that while Hutchins\u2019s counsel admitted in his opening statement that the paperwork was \u201cbogus,\u201d Hutchins\u2019s testimony attempted to show that Hutch-ins had been duped by Joblonski and that Hutchins had reason to believe that the paperwork was accurate. In addition to weakening Hutchins\u2019s testimony by introducing documents indicating that the vehicle identification number on the documents introduced by Hutchins actually represented an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>other car Hutchins had purchased, Richards and Hardin also may have weakened Hutchins\u2019s defense both by testifying that it was not common practice for dealers to sell cars off of their lots and by testifying that, despite their experience in the field, they had never heard of Day\u2019s Auto Sales. The testimony provided by Richards and Hardin therefore did not reiterate Hutchins\u2019s testimony, but rather, contradicted it by suggesting that Hutchins himself forged the documents by altering records for vehicles he had previously purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">We also cannot find beyond a reasonable doubt that the testimony of Richards and Hardin did not influence the trial judge\u2019s verdict. The transcript of the verdict contains several apparent references to the testimony of these experts and to documents introduced and referred to during their testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ark\">\u201cI had a little concern as we went along on it. Certainly using Sherbert\u2019s to take the car up really I think is indicative of someone who may not be guilty than someone who is guilty, because at first thought in the matter if he were taking it, he would take it up himself----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">As the testimony went on, I think that probably what may have been the case is that he didn\u2019t want to take a chance on getting it out of the county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\"><em>I have looked over the documents, and we have the </em>testimony.... The State did make some effort .. to check [Day\u2019s Auto] and see if there was a company such as that. And <em>all their testimony is that there is no Day\u2019s Auto anywhere. The people, experts in the field never heard of Day\u2019s Auto </em>anywhere____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">But <em>when you look at [Defendant\u2019s exhibit] Number 3 and [State\u2019s exhibit] Number 7, that\u2019s what\u2014certainly we had the testimony of the expert ... Colonial Sales. And they had auctions. They had no problem with the fact for the last ten years everything from Arlington, Virginia, County of Virginia went through them.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">And I agree with the State\u2019s Attorney, these others look like forgeries to me. They look like they have business dealings with C &amp; S Auto which he worked. And that\u2019s not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>direct, wasn\u2019t he directly\u2014the Defendant directly sold it. Of course, his statement is, well, somebody else forged it and it was not his. But I want to be honest with you, I don\u2019t believe anything he\u2019s saying on the basis of what I have here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">Sfc Hi SjS \u2756 #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">I just do not believe the Defendant and what he\u2019s saying, what he\u2019s testifying to. I think the State has made an excellent case on this. <em>They have even gone into some things that [defense counsel] does not feel were </em>relevant<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>because they were trying to show, I think, that there was no Day\u2019s Auto Sales and that all of this that he had put on is fabricated by him.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">It seems apparent from our independent review of the record that in reaching his verdict, the trial judge relied on the testimony of Richards and Hardin in several respects. The trial judge specifically referred to State\u2019s exhibit number seven, which was introduced by Richards in his testimony and which Hutchins\u2019s counsel argued he had never been shown prior to its introduction in court. Both Richards and Hardin also testified as to the authenticity of the documents Hutchins presented in his defense, which were marked as Defense exhibit number three. The trial judge further alluded to the testimony of the Colonial expert, being Richards, who was employed by Colonial Auction Services. Additionally, in stating that he did not believe Hutchins, the trial judge relied heavily on the testimony that there was no Day\u2019s Auto Sales.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Given this reliance on expert testimony that might not have been admitted had the trial judge ruled correctly as to the State\u2019s disclosure obligations, we cannot say beyond a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>able doubt that the trial judge\u2019s error in no way influenced his verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Because, based upon our independent review of the record, we cannot find beyond a reasonable doubt that the trial judge\u2019s error in no way influenced his verdict, we must reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CALVERT COUNTY AND TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CALVERT COUNTY FOR A NEW TRIAL.
