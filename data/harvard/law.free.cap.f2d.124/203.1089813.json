Claims 4 and 9 also contain the statement that the slurry has a \u201cdensity in excess of that of a usable slurry made with cement and water alone,\u201d and claim 10'contains the limitation that the slurry has a density of from 18 to 30 pounds per gallon.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Claims <em>2, 9, </em>and 10 read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\">\u201c2.

It is further stated in appellant\u2019s application that, in order to accomplish his purpose, appellant discovered that he could increase the density of the cement slurry by the addition of \u201cfinely divided powdered metals, * * * other finely divided, inert and insoluble materials of high density, and * * * soluble substances,\u201d and that such materials might be added to his cement slurry either singly or in combination. Some of the materials used to increase the density of appellant\u2019s cement slurry, and which are susceptible of fine subdivision so that they may be suspended in the slurry, are iron filings, barytes, various lead oxides, zinc oxide, lead concentrate, galena, zinc sulphide, copper sulphide, and other heavy substances. Appellant further states that under certain conditions, oxides of lead are not wetted by water and, therefore, do not increase the density of the cement slurry, and that, under such circumstances, a wetting agent, such as naphthenic acid, sulfonated oil, metallic soap, or the like may be used so that the finely divided lead oxide will be suspended in the cement slurry.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The patent to See relates to an \u201cImproved Composition for Covering Roofs, Pavements, and Walks, for Lining Cisterns, Damp Cellars, and Docks, for- Plastering Outside Walls, for Making Bricks and \u2022 Tiles, and for other similar uses,\u201d and discloses a composition of hydraulic cement, iron ore, turnings, borings, or filings, sand, and salt. The patentee states that his composition should be thoroughly pulverized and water added thereto until the composition \u201cforms a mortar, of the proper consistency to apply with a trowel or otherwise, as desired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">The patent to Hall relates to improvements in the manufacture of artificial stone for paving, building, or other purposes. The patentee states that he mixes Portland cement with other materials including sand, \u201ciron or steel turnings, borings, or filings, either wrought or cast, or with oxide of iron, provided it be tolerably free from earthy matter\u201d; that the iron, steel; or oxide of iron is disintegrated into small particles; that the mixture is slightly but thoroughly wetted, and is then placed in a mold and subjected to great pressure \u201cby hydraulic or other means.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">The patent to Flesheim relates to a method of bonding concrete, and discloses the idea of coating an old concrete surface, to which a new concrete structure or mass is to be bonded, with a layer of mortar composed of cement, finely divided iron particles, and an agent for expediting the oxidation of the iron particles. The bonding method is successfully performed by applying the new concrete structure or mass before the mortar has set. The patentee states that, due to oxidation, the iron particles will expand and will \u201ccompensate in a large measure [for] the shrinkage of the cement due to its drying and hardening, and so diminish its tendency to curl up and peel away from the surface to which it is applied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">The patent to Kleinlogel relates to a method of manufacturing building materials \u201cfrom a mixture of Portland cement and metallic or other hard-grained substances,\u201d and particularly mentions the importance of a \u201cdefinite proportion of the weights of the materials used in the mixture with relation to the size of the metallic parts admixed.\u201d The patentee states that his building materials possess a greater degree of hardness, are more durable, and are more impervious to water than other cementitious materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">The patent to Takata relates to an acid proof cement lining for \u201cDigesters of Sulphite Pulp,\u201d and discloses a process which, the patentee states, consists in \u201cmixing white clay, lime or calcium carbonate, infusorial earth, asbestos and boric acid or borax thoroughly and the mixture is heated in a furnace, powdered and admixed with lead oxide and the product thus obtained is applied as lining in the state of mud by kneading with sodium silicate solution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">The patent to Lindstrom relates to a cement composition for the surfacing of concrete floors, stairs, pavements, concrete tanks, and other structures, the surfaces of which are apt to deteriorate. The patentee discloses a composition in which cement is mixed with \u201can abrasive such as carborundum or iron-free corundum,\u201d sand or other aggregate and water. The patentee refers to his composition as a \u201cconcrete surfacing\u201d for floors and other surfaces which it is desjred to make water-proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-14\">The patent to Steinour relates to a Portland cement composition and a method of making the same, and discloses a composition comprising Portland cement, borate of lime, and oxy-chloride of lime. The patentee states that his composition may be in the form of a slurry, and that it is particularly adapted to the \u201ccementing off\u201d of oil. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>wells where temperatures are as high as 200\u00b0 F.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The patent to Krauss relates to a glazing composition and a method of making the same, and discloses a composition comprising a metallic soap with a dispersing agent containing an ammonium salt of an organic acid, pulverized cement materials, \u201ccoloring materials\u201d such as \u201cpigments, crystalline, amorphous, and wholly or partly colloidal silica and siliceous compounds, and inorganic substances practically insoluble in water, and not directly reacting with the cement components of the glaze.\u201d The patentee states that his dispersing agent facilitates the surface wetting of the \u201cparticles\u201d in his composition. The patentee\u2019s glazing composition is used as a coating for building materials such as bricks, tile, terra cotta, building blocks, and cement articles, \u2022 and provides such articles with a glossy surface having the characteristics of hardness, durability, and resistance to moisture. The glazing composition apparently may be in the form of a mortar, or, as stated in claim 4 of the patent, by adding an excess of ammonia, it may be in the form of a slurry.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The Primary Examiner rejected all of the composition claims now before us for consideration on the patent to See. He also rejected them as being \u201cfully met by Kleinlogel and Flesheim each of whom combine cement and metallic particles (iron). Flesheim further uses a salt, salammoniac.\u201d Claims 6, 7, and 8 were further rejected by the examiner as being fully met by the patents to Hall, Takata, or Lindstrom, \u201cwho teach combining cement and finely divided metallic compound.\u201d Claims 11, 12, and 14 were further rejected on the patent to Krauss, which discloses, according to the examiner, \u201csoluble materials * * * mixed with cement, the dispersing agent present facilitating the wetting action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The patent to Steinour, according to the Primary Examiner\u2019s statement to the Board of Appeals, was cited against the method claims which are not before us for consideration. In view of the arguments pre-' sented here by counsel for the parties, however, we deem it advisable to quote that portion of the examiner\u2019s statement where- \u2022 in he referred to the Steinour patent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">\u201cClaims 16 to 20, drawn to the one-step method are rejected as being unpatentable over the <em>other references cited against the composition claims </em>in view of Steinour who discloses the use of a cement composition for an oil well cement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-9\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-10\">\u201cSteinour further shows that the oil well cement mixtures and other cement mixtures are from the same art and no question of analogy should arise. (Italics supplied.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">The examiner further rejected appealed claim 10 on the ground that it was not supported by appellant\u2019s disclosure in that it calls for a cement slurry having \u201ca density of from 18 to 30 pounds per gallon.\u201d That ground of rejection, however, was not concurred in by the Board of Appeals, the board stating that as that claim was an original claim it could not be held to cover new matter, although the specific limitation for a cement slurry having a density of from 18 to 30 pounds per gallon was not set forth in appellant\u2019s specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">In its decision affirming the decision of the Primary Examiner, the Board of Appeals said, inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-13\">\u201c * * * It is stated in the specification that in deep wells where high pressures are encountered or in drilling through heaving shale it is necessary to use heavier mud fluids. This reduces the difference in density between the mud and the ordinary cement slurry. Appellant provides a cement slurry under such circumstances of such high density that a sufficiently great difference in density between the cement slurry and the mud fluid in the well is present to enable the cement to be placed in the desired location uncontaminated by the mud fluid. For this purpose he has added to the slurry finely divided or powdered metals and among others suggests iron oxides, barytes and various lead oxides. Under certain circumstances the lead oxides are not wetted by water and a wetting agent is employed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-14\"><em>\"It seems to us that the statement of the problem suggests the solution, at least to increase the specific gravity of the cement slurry. While it is true that the prior art does not describe such a weighted slurry, \u25a0 yet it shows that various metallic substances, some of them finely divided, have been-used in hydraulic cements for many purposes and in view of such a teaching it would not seem to be invention to weight the pumpable cement slurry in cementing oil wells as described by appellant. </em>Clearly those claims which refer to the cement slurry itself are unpatentable as they disT tinguish primarily from the references by recitation of a slurry -as against a cement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>mortar. Also the use of a wetting agent if necessary, is lacking in invention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">\u201cWe believe, therefore, that the prior art is pertinent, at least for the purpose above indicated. <em>It may be that none of these references describes a cement slurry which could be used for cementing oil wells but we are not inclined to find patentability in claims which so distinguish over the prior art. </em>(Italics not quoted.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Relative to appealed claim 4, the board stated that it was sufficiently broad to call for a cement slurry having a greater density \u201cthan that of the usual slurry made with cement and water which is clearly unpatentable, involving a matter of degree of density.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">As hereinbefore noted, claim 4 calls for a pumpable cement slurry for \u201ccementing off\u201d oil wells having incorporated therein a finely divided metal, and also contains the statement that the slurry has a density in excess of a usable slurry made with cement and water alone. Accordingly, the statement by the board that it calls merely for a pumpable cement slurry having a greater density than that of the usable cement slurries made with cement and water alone is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">It is apparent from what has been said that the prior art cited discloses, among other things, mortars or plastic masses, composed of cement, water, and finely divided metals, including iron filings, turnings, borings, and oxide of iron, for use in lining cisterns, etc., plastering outside walls, and bonding new concrete structures to old ones, and for the making of brick, tile, and other building materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">Only two of the references cited, Stein-our and Krauss, disclose a cementitious material in the form of a slurry. The patent to Krauss, as hereinbefore noted, relates to .a glazing composition for glazing building materials. The composition may vary in consistency, according to the, conditions under which it is to be applied. The inorganic and insoluble substances used in the patentee\u2019s composition are apparently used as coloring matter. The patent to Steinour discloses a cementitious composition in the form of a slurry, which, the patentee states, is particularly adapted to the \u201ccementing off\u201d of oil wells. However, the patentee\u2019s composition is composed of Portland cement, borate of lime, oxy-chloride of lime, and water. It does not contain inorganic substances for the purpose of increasing its density. The Steinour reference merely discloses what the applicant stated in his application was the prior art slurry used for the \u201ccementing off\u201d of oil and gas wells. It is evident, therefore, as held by the Board of Appeals, that none of the references discloses appellant\u2019s composition.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">As hereinbefore noted, the board stated in its decision that \u201cIt seems to us that the statement of <em>the problem </em>suggests the solution, <em>at least to increase the specific gravity of the cement slurry.\u201d </em>(Italics not quoted.) As we understand that statement, the board was of opinion that the problem confronting the art was to determine the cause for the failure of the prior art cement slurry to set properly and to \u201ccement off\u201d oil and gas wells where, as in deep wells, high pressures are encountered and \u201cheaving shale\u201d is present, and in which mud fluids heavier than those used in ordinary wells are employed, and that the \u201cstatement of the problem suggests the solution\u201d; that is, \u201cto increase the specific gravity of the cement slurry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">Stated differently, the board was of opinion that, although appellant discovered that the reason the prior art cement slurries would not properly \u201ccement off\u201d such wells was because the differences in density between the heavier mud fluids and such cement slurries were insufficient and that the \u201cspecific gravity\u201d of such cement slurries should be increased, such discovery would be obvious to one skilled in the art, and, therefore, would not involve invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-13\">The board\u2019s expression of opinion is challenged by appellant\u2019s reasons of appeal in this court, and, although it is repeatedly stated, in substance, in the brief of counsel for appellant that appellant discovered the reason for the failures in the prior art cementing operations, such statements are not questioned here by the Solicitor for the Patent Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-14\">The board also held that, in view of the references of record,.it would be obvious to one skilled in the art that sufficient differences in density between the heavier mud fluids and the prior art cement slurries could be obtained by adding to the latter finely divided metallic substances, such as those referred to in appellant\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-15\">It appears, therefore, that the board divided appellant\u2019s concept into two parts; to wit, his conception that it was necessary, for the reasons hereinbefore stated, to increase the density of the prior art cement slurries so that a greater ratio of differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>enees in density would exist between them and the heavier mud fluids, which the board held did not involve invention; and his conception of increasing the density of pumpable cement slurries by including therein finely divided or powdered metals together with a \u201cwetting agent\u201d where certain weighting materials, such as oxide of lead, are employed, which the board also held did not involve invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Upon what evidence the board relied for its holding that the first part of appellant\u2019s concept was obvious to one skilled in the art and, therefore, did not involve invention does not appear either from the board\u2019s decision or from anything else of record, as there is nothing in any of the references cited which could be considered as even remotely suggesting such concept. When appellant provided his cement slurries with finely divided or powdered metals as weighting agents and thereby increased the density of such slurries so that the proper differences in density existed between them and the heavier mud fluids his invention was complete, and, as there is nothing of record to warrant a holding that the first part of his concept was not inventive, it becomes immaterial, for the purpose of this decision, whether the second part of his inventive concept, that is, providing his pumpable cement' slurries with finely divided or powdered metals as weighting agents for the purpose of increasing their density, was or was not obvious in view of the prior art cited. See In re Earle et al., 102 F.2d 232, 26 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">That appellant\u2019s pumpable cement slurries are novel, useful, and of practical importance to the art, is not questioned. We are of opinion, therefore, that, on the record presented, such of the appealed claims as properly define appellant\u2019s pump-able cement slurries are patentable and should be allowed. Appealed claim 12, however, as hereinbefore noted, calls for \u201cA pumpable cement slurry for cementing oil wells having incorporated therein a wetting agent.\u201d It does not call for a weighting agent of any kind, and, therefore, does not, in our opinion, define appellant\u2019s invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The appeal is dismissed as to claims 16 to 20, inclusive, and the decision of the Board of Appeals is modified, being affirmed as to claim 12, and reversed as to claims 2, 3, 4, 6 to 11, inclusive, 14, and 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">BLAND and LENROOT, Associate Judges, dissent as to claims 2, 3, 4, 6 to 11, inclusive, 14 and 15.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
