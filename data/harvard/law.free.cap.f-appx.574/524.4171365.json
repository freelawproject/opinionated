His conviction was affirmed on appeal. <em>United States v. Manners, </em>384 Fed.Appx. 302 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-21\">In 2013, Siebert filed in the Northern District of Texas Dallas Division what he styled as a \u201cMotion Requesting Court to Grant Time Credits under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b),\u201d requesting that the district court reduce his sentence to account for the time he spent in home confinement. The district court concluded that \u00a7 5G1.3(b) did not apply to the facts of Siebert\u2019s case, construed the motion as arising under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 for relief under 18 U.S.C. 3585(b)(1), and denied the motion on its merits. Siebert appeals, arguing that the district court erred in failing to apply \u00a7 5G1.3(b)(l) to reduce his sentence to account for the time spent in home confinement and in construing his claim as arising under \u00a7 3585(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-22\">We do not address whether the district court should have dismissed the motion for lack of jurisdiction but instead address Siebert\u2019s substantive claim in the interest of judicial efficiency given that Siebert is not entitled to the relief he seeks. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Gutierrez, </em>835 F.2d 585, 586 (5th Cir.1988). In reviewing the denial of habeas relief, we review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law de novo and findings of fact for clear error. <em>Wilson v. Roy, </em>643 F.3d 433, 434 (5th Cir.2011). We may affirm the district court\u2019s denial of relief \u201con any ground supported by the record.\u201d <em>Scott v. Johnson, </em>227 F.3d 260, 262 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-23\">Seibert does not challenge the district court\u2019s reasons for denying him relief under \u00a7 3585(b) but appears to concede that he is not entitled to relief under \u00a7 3585(b). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>In any event, because Siebert was released on a personal recognizance bond to home confinement and was not committed to the custody of the Attorney General or subject to the Federal Bureau of Prisons control during that time, he was not in \u201cofficial detention\u201d and was not entitled to credit against his sentence for the time spent in home confinement. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3585(b); <em>Reno v. Koray, </em>515 U.S. 50, 57-65, 115 S.Ct. 2021, 132 L.Ed.2d 46 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Further, although Siebert contends that the district court had authority to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 5G1.3(b)(l), the district court did not err in concluding that \u00a7 5G1.3(b)(l) did not apply. The record does not reflect that Siebert was serving an undischarged term of imprisonment from another offense at the time he was sentenced in the instant case. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5G1.3(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b550-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
