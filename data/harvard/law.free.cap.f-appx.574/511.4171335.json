He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, in which he sought a sentence reduction pursuant to the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA) and Amendment 750 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. The district court d\u00e9nied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>motion on the ground that at sentencing, it had applied the 18:1 crack-to-powder ratio in determining Mosely\u2019s sentencing guidelines range. <em>See Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2329, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012) (\u201c[The FSA] had the effect of lowering the [previous] 100-to-1 crack-to-powder ratio to 18-to-l.\u201d). Mosely contends that (1) his 104-month term of imprisonment was based on a guidelines range that was amended by Amendment 750; (2) because the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory, the district court had the discretion to resentence him based on a 1:1 crack-to-powder ratio; and (3) the district court had the discretion to impose a \u201ccomparable reduction\u201d in light of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B), p.s., and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ]994(o).\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, and its interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">Mosely\u2019s base offense level at the time of sentencing was 28, and it was unchanged at the time he filed his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(6). Thus, the district court had no authority to reduce Mosely\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B); see <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826-27, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Because Mosely\u2019s sentencing range was not lowered, Mosely\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B) is unavailing. Further, <em>Freeman </em>is inapposite as it concerned whether a defendant who was sentenced pursuant to a binding plea agreement was barred from seeking a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Freeman, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2692-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">To the extent that Mosely argues that the district court had the discretion to resentence him based on a 1:1 crack-to-powder ratio, his argument is unpersuasive; a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding is not a full resentencing or an opportunity to challenge the original sentence. <em>See Dillon, </em>560 U.S. at 825-31, 130 S.Ct. 2683; <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238. The principles of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and its progeny do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, and a sentencing court lacks discretion to reduce a sentence further than the reduction allowed pursuant to \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>Dillon, </em>560 U.S. at 825-31, 130 S.Ct. 2683; <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 237-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b537-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
