For the reasons below, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-2\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>\n<em>a.Relief Under Rule 59(e)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\">Appellants first contend that the district court erred in denying their motion to vacate under Rule 59(e). Appellants assert that they are entitled to relief under Rule 59(e) because Appellees did not properly serve their motion to dismiss under Rule 5. Rule 5(b)(2)(C) provides that a party properly serves a motion on its opponent by \u201cmailing it to the person\u2019s last known address.\u201d Rule 5(b)(2)(C) further provides that \u201cservice is complete upon mailing.\u201d Appellees presented evidence of service under Rule 5(b)(2)(C), including (1) a declaration under the penalties of perjury stating that Appellees mailed copies of their motion to Appellants\u2019 last known address at 2009 Crestwood Drive by both certified and regular first-class mail on April 22, 2013; and (2) a photocopy of a payment receipt that reflects that Appel-lees sent certified mail to Appellants\u2019 address. The district court found that Appellees presented sufficient evidence of service in compliance with Rule 5(b)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Appellants assert that Appellees\u2019 service of their motion to dismiss did not comply with Rule 5 because Appellants did not receive the motion. Rule 5(b)(2)(C), however, provides that service by mail \u201cis complete upon mailing.\u201d <em>See Anthony v. Marion Cnty. Gen. Hosp., </em>617 F.2d 1164, 1168 n. 5 (5th Cir.1980); <em>LaBlanche v. Ahmad, </em>538 Fed.Appx. 463, 464-65 (5th Cir.2013); <em>Zamudio v. Mineta, </em>129 Fed.Appx. 79, 80 (5th Cir.2005). Even if receipt were relevant to the Rule 5(b)(2)(C) analysis, Appellants did not present any evidence in the district court, such as an affidavit or declaration, indicating that they did not receive Appellees\u2019 first class mailing. Accordingly, Appellants have not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying relief under Rule 59(e).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">\n<em>b. Relief Under Rule 60(b)(3)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Appellants next contend that the district court erred in denying their motion to vacate under Rule 60(b)(3). Rule 60(b)(3) permits relief from judgment where an opposing party has engaged in fraud, misrepresentation, or misconduct. The party seeking relief bears the burden of proving fraud or misconduct by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Hesling v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>396 F.3d 632, 641 (5th Cir.2005). Although Appellants allege that Appellees \u201clied\u201d in their declaration, Appellants did not provide clear and convincing evidence to support this allegation. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying relief under Rule 60(b)(3). <em>See id. </em>at 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">c. <em>Amendment as of Right under Rule 15(a)(1)(B)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">Finally, Appellants contend that the district court erred in denying them the opportunity to amend their complaint once as of right under Rule 15(a)(1)(B). This Rule provides that a party \u201cmay amend its pleading once as a matter of course within ... 21 days after service of a motion under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Rule 12(b).\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(1)(B). As stated above, service of a motion by mail \u201cis complete upon mailing.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 5(b)(2)(C). Appellees presented evidence that they mailed their Rule 12(b)(6) motion on April 22, 2013, in compliance with Rule 5(b)(2)(C). When Appellants sought to amend their complaint on July 22, 2013, the time to amend as of right had elapsed. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of Appellants\u2019 motion did not deny Appellants the opportunity to amend once as of right under Rule 15(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s orders are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b363-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-5\">. Appellants did not request leave of the district court to file an opposition to Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss out of time. Rather, Appellants only challenged Appellees\u2019 compliance with Rule 5. Accordingly, this court need not address whether Appellants\u2019 alleged non-receipt of Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss would have, upon motion, entitled Appellants to an extension of time to file an opposition to Appellees\u2019 motion on the ground of excusable neglect. <em>See </em>Wright &amp; Miller, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Civil </em>\u00a7 1148 (3d ed. 2014) (\"Since [Rule 5(b)(2) ] expressly directs that service is complete upon mailing, nonreceipt or nonacceptance of the papers by the person to be served generally does not affect the validity of the service of the papers, although nonreceipt of the paper may justify the court finding excusable neglect on the part of the intended recipient and permit her to ... make any appropriate response out of time.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
