We previously affirmed; however, the Supreme Court granted cer-tiorari, vacated our opinion, and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013). <em>See United States v. Ruiz-Sanchez, </em>505 Fed.Appx. 370 (5th Cir.), <em>vacated and remanded, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 60, 187 L.Ed.2d 2 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-25\">As an initial matter, the Government argues that Ruiz-Sanchez invited or waived the alleged error. We conclude that defense counsel did not invite or waive the alleged error; however, because counsel failed to object on this basis in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Arviso-Mata, </em>442 F.3d 382, 384 (5th Cir.2006). To show plain error, the appellant must show a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, 556 </em>U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1428, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If the appellant makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Ruiz-Sanchez appeals the district court\u2019s determination that a prior Illinois conviction qualified as a drug trafficking offense and the resulting imposition of a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) (2011). He argues that the Illinois statute at issue, 720 ILL. COMP. STAT. 570/401(a)(2)(D), criminalizes some kinds conduct, such as administering a controlled substance, that do not qualify as a drug trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). However, Ruiz-Sanchez has not pointed to any Illinois case applying this statute in an \u201cadministering\u201d situation. A \u201ctheoretical possibility\u201d that a statute encompasses other types of conduct that would not qualify is insufficient to avoid application of the enhancement. <em>See United States v. Carrasco-Tercero, </em>745 F.3d 192, 197-98 (5th Cir.2014). We agree with a recent unpublished decision of this court finding that any error in applying the enhancement on this basis was not clear or obvious error. <em>See United States v. Villeda-Mejia, </em>No. 13-40089, 559 Fed.Appx 387, 2014 WL 1229953 (5th Cir. Mar. 26, 2014). Ruiz-Sanchez has not shown that the district court plainly erred in applying the enhancement. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b450-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
