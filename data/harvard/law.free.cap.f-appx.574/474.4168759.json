For the reasons set forth below, the district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-18\">On June 21, 2013, the Stretchers filed a complaint against Defendant-Appellee Bank of America (\u201cBOA\u201d) challenging BOA\u2019s home equity lien on their property and right to foreclose under Article XVI, \u00a7 50(a)(6) of the Texas Constitution. BOA moved to dismiss the Stretchers\u2019 claims under Rule 12(b)(6). A magistrate judge recommended that the district court dismiss the Stretchers\u2019 claims as time-barred under Texas\u2019s four-year residual statute of limitations. <em>See </em>Tex. Civ. Prac. <em>&amp; </em>Rem.Code \u00a7 16.051. The Stretchers did not object to the report and recommendation. On November 13, 2013, the district court adopted the report and recommendation and dismissed the Stretchers\u2019 claims as time barred. The Stretchers appealed. Because the Stretchers did not object to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, we review the district court\u2019s order of dismissal for plain error. <em>See Salts v. Epps, </em>676 F.3d 468, 474 (5th Cir.2012) (citing <em>Douglass v. United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>79 F.3d 1415, 1417 (5th Cir.1996) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-19\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-20\">On appeal, the Stretchers contend that Texas\u2019s four-year residual statute of limitations does not apply to their claims under Article XVI, \u00a7 50(a)(6) of the Texas Constitution. As the Stretchers acknowledge, this challenge is foreclosed by <em>Priester v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., </em>708 F.3d 667, 673-76 (5th Cir.2013), which held that a four-year limitations period applies to \u201cconstitutional infirmities under Section 50(a)(6).\u201d <em>See also Moran v. Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC, </em>No. 13-20242, 560 Fed.Appx. 277, 279, 2014 WL 1193510, at *1-2 (5th Cir. Mar. 24, 2014). The Stretchers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>attempt to avoid dismissal by arguing that <em>Priester </em>was wrongly decided. \u201cIt is a well-settled Fifth Circuit rule of orderliness that one panel of our court may not overturn another panel\u2019s decision, absent an intervening change in the law, such as by a statutory amendment, or the Supreme Court, or our <em>en banc </em>court.\u201d <em>Jacobs v. Nat\u2019l Drug Intelligence Ctr., </em>548 F.3d 375, 378 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, we have no occasion to revisit <em>Priester </em>and the Stretchers have not demonstrated plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Because the Stretchers\u2019 challenge is controlled by <em>Priester, </em>the district court\u2019s order of dismissal is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b500-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
