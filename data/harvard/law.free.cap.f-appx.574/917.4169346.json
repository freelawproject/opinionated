We review <em>de novo </em>whether a defendant\u2019s guilty plea waives his right to appeal the denial of a motion to suppress. <em>See United States v. Patti, </em>337 F.3d 1317, 1320 &amp; n. 4 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">\u201c \u2018A defendant\u2019s [unconditional] plea of guilty, made knowingly, voluntarily, and with the benefit of competent counsel, waives all non jurisdictional defects in that defendant\u2019s court proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Pierre, </em>120 F.3d 1153, 1155 (11th Cir.1997) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>United States v. Yunis, </em>723 F.2d 795, 796 (11th Cir.1984)). A district court\u2019s erroneous refusal to suppress evidence is a non-jurisdictional defect. <em>See United States v. McCoy, </em>477 F.2d 550, 551 (5th Cir.1973) (per curiam).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-6\">A defendant who wishes to preserve appellate review of a non-jurisdictional defect while at the same time pleading guilty can do so only by entering a \u201cconditional plea\u201d in accordance with Fed.R. Crim.P. 11(a)(2). The conditional plea must be in writing and must be consented to by the court and by the government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b944-9\"><em>Pierre, </em>120 F.3d at 1155 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">Cadet does not dispute that he knowingly and voluntarily entered a guilty plea. He does not argue that he lacked the benefit of competent counsel. He does not argue that he has preserved appellate review of any non-jurisdictional issues by entering a conditional plea in accordance with Rule 11(a)(2). Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we therefore affirm on the ground that Cadet has waived any challenge to the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. We do not reach the merits of Cadet\u2019s challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b944-7\">. These appeals were administratively consolidated on November 21, 2013. They arise from two separate criminal proceedings, with separate indictments, that were consolidated into a single proceeding by the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A6j\">.
