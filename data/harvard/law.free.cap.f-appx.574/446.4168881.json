Eckles argues that he is actually innocent of the federal drug offense for which he was convicted because he did not admit the drug quantity alleged in his indictment and it was not proven to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-16\">A federal prisoner may attack the validity of his conviction in a \u00a7 2241 petition if he can meet the requirements of the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000). The prisoner bears the burden of showing that the remedy under \u00a7 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001). A prisoner\u2019s inability to meet the procedural requirements of \u00a7 2255 is insufficient to meet this burden. <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2000). Rather, a prisoner who wishes to proceed under the savings clause must establish that his claim \u201cis based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and that the claim \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-21\">Eckles cites to <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), in support of his claim of actual innocence. In <em>Alleyne, </em>the Supreme Court held that facts that increase a mandatory minimum sentence are elements of the offense and must be submitted to a jury to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by the defendant. 133 S.Ct. at 2155, 2163. That decision does not support a holding that Eckles\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court opinion indicating that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense and that his claim was foreclosed when it otherwise should have been raised. <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904; <em>Wesson v. U.S. Penitentiary Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 348 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b472-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
