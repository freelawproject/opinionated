The remand had been ordered because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>IJ had failed to address Li\u2019s request for \u201crepapering,\u201d which is the conversion of deportation proceedings, such as Li\u2019s, to removal proceedings. Li filed his petition for review on July 9, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The BIA\u2019s January 26, 2012, order was a final order of removal. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(47)(A); <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 390, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>Youssefinia v. INS, </em>784 F.2d 1254, 1258 (5th Cir.1986). A petition for review of that order had to be filed no later than 30 days after the date of issuance. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). That time limit is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Henderson ex rel. Henderson v. Shinseki, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 131 S.Ct. 1197, 1204, 179 L.Ed.2d 159 (2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Li\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s January 26, 2012, order was not filed until well after the 30-day period for seeking review had elapsed. The petition was therefore untimely. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(b)(1). Li\u2019s failure to file a petition for review within the 30-day period created a \u201cjurisdictional defect\u201d that no \u201cequitable exception can overcome.\u201d <em>Colbert v. Brennan, </em>752 F.3d 412, 2014 WL 1876519, *4 (5th Cir.2014). Li cites no statutory exception to the deadline and offers no basis on which we could conclude that the remand to seek repapering \u2014 possibly to obtain cancellation of removal from the Attorney General, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 229b(b)(l) \u2014 somehow rendered the BIA\u2019s January 26, 2012, order nonfinal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). As the petition for review of the January 26, 2012, order is untimely, we lack jurisdiction to entertain it. <em>See Henderson ex rel. Henderson, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1204; <em>Karimian-Kaklaki v. INS, </em>997 F.2d 108, 113 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">We do, however, have jurisdiction over Li\u2019s timely petition for review of the BIA\u2019s June 10, 2013, order pertaining to the IJ\u2019s denial of a continuance. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 433, 436-37 (5th Cir.2006). If, as in this case, the BIA affirms for reasons given by the IJ, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well as the BIA\u2019s. <em>See Ahmed, </em>447 F.3d at 437. We do not disturb a denial of a continuance unless there has been an abuse of discretion. <em>Cabral v. Holder, </em>632 F.3d 886, 889-90 &amp; n. 2 (5th Cir.2011). As Li does not address whether there was an abuse of discretion in denying the continuance, the BIA\u2019s ruling in that regard stands undisturbed. <em>See Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 224-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b348-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
