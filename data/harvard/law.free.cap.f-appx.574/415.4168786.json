Montoya-Gonzalez argues that the IJ and BIA erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>determining that cancellation of removal was not warranted because he had not demonstrated that his removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his children. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Our review is extremely limited in this context. In the present case our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002). Furthermore, we may only review constitutional claims and questions of law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>see Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir.2004). Here, Montoya-Gonzalez indicates that the IJ made a legal error regarding the forms of relief that might be available to him in the future. As we stated above, our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s decision. After reviewing the BIA\u2019s decision, we are persuaded that the BIA did not base its affirmation of the IJ\u2019s decision on a potential future adjustment of status. Therefore, contrary to Montoya-Gonzalez\u2019s suggestion, there is not a reviewable legal issue in this case. We lack jurisdiction to review the hardship determination on which the denial of relief was based. <em>See Rueda, </em>380 F.3d at 831 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Accordingly, Montoya-Gonzalez\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b441-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
