Mr. James wished to file a suit alleging that Judge Godbey and Magistrate Judge Kaplan violated his constitutional rights by sanctioning him. The district court determined that his suit was frivolous, denied permission to sue, and further denied Mr. James\u2019s application to proceed IFP on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-16\">By moving for IFP status, Mr. Jones is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). We agree with the district court that Mr. Jones\u2019s appeal is not in good faith. \u201cIt is well established that judges enjoy absolute immunity for judicial acts performed in judicial proceedings,\u201d <em>Mays v. Sudderth, </em>97 F.3d 107, 110 (5th Cir.1996), and Mr. Jones makes no argument that somehow judicial immunity should not apply here, <em>see, e.g., Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 356-57, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978) (noting exception to judicial immunity for acting in the \u201cclear absence of all jurisdiction\u201d). As such, because Judge Godbey and Magistrate Judge Kaplan clearly enjoy absolute immunity, Mr. Jones\u2019s suit is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-21\">Because Mr. Jones has not shown his appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits, we DENY permission for leave to proceed IFP, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See, e.g., Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
