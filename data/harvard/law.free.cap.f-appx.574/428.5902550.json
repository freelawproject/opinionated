Davison challenged his conviction for possession of a nonregistered firearm, asserting that he had registered the weapon and intimating that he was subject to an illegal search and seizure. The district court denied relief, concluding that such allegations should be presented in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and that Davison had not established that he was entitled to proceed under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e). Before this court, Davison indicates that federal prisoners are not restricted from proceeding under \u00a7 2241. He suggests that the district court improperly made factual findings that increased the statutory maximum or minimum sentence and that because he was actually innocent of his 120-month sentence, he should be allowed to proceed under \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-22\">We review the denial of relief under \u00a7 2241 de novo. <em>Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000). \u201cA \u00a7 2241 petition is not ... a substitute for a motion under \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). If a prisoner attempts to challenge his federal sentence through a \u00a7 2241 proceeding, the petition should be either dismissed or construed as arising under \u00a7 2255. <em>Pack v. Yusuff </em>218 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-23\">A federal prisoner may attack the validity of his conviction in a \u00a7 2241 petition if he can meet the requirements of the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause. <em>Kinder, </em>222 F.3d at 212. The prisoner bears the burden of showing that the remedy under \u00a7 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001). To satisfy this burden, the prisoner must establish that his claim \u201cis based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and that the claim \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>should have been raised.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Davison relies on <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), in support of this argument, but that case does not establish that Davison\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court opinion indicating that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense. <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. Additionally, Davison cites <em>McQuiggin v. Perkins, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 1924, 185 L.Ed.2d 1019 (2013), which is also unavailing to him. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b454-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
