Thompson (\u201cThompson\u201d) originally filed this action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Alabama on September 7, 2012. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406, the action was transferred to the United States District Court for the Southern District of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Mississippi (\u201cthe district court\u201d) on December 13, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">On November 1, 2013, the district court dismissed this case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. According to the district court, Thompson and one of the defendants-appellees, Terry Reeves (\u201cReeves\u201d), were both citizens of Florida when this action was filed in Alabama on September 7, 2012. The court therefore lacked diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, and no federal question was asserted under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Thompson now appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Questions of subject matter jurisdiction are reviewed de novo,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> although \u201c[f]acts expressly or impliedly found by the district court in the course of determining jurisdiction are reviewed for clear error.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cThe burden of persuasion for establishing diversity jurisdiction ... remains on the party asserting it.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A party seeking to proceed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 must establish complete diversity, which \u201crequires that all persons on one side of the controversy be citizens of different states than all persons on the other side.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Diversity jurisdiction is based on the facts at the time of filing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">The district court concluded that Thompson was a Florida citizen when this lawsuit was filed in late 2012. In particular, Thompson had filed a complaint in December 2011 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida in which Thompson alleged that he was a citizen of Florida. Additionally, Thompson testified in a deposition on March 14, 2013, that he had been \u201can associate pastor at ... one of the biggest Baptist churches in Pensacola ... for about a year [or] 14 months.\u201d Thompson also owned a motor vehicle titled in Florida, had used a Pensacola address on court filings (in another lawsuit) since December 2011, and currently has a Pensacola address. Based on the preponderance of the evidence regarding Thompson\u2019s \u201cresidence and ... intention to remain\u201d in Florida, therefore, the district court properly concluded that Thompson was a citizen of Florida in late 2012 when this action began.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">Thompson argues, however, that his citizenship should be determined based on the facts as they were on April 15, 2011, when he filed an earlier lawsuit against Reeves and the other defendants-appellees in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. It is true that the earlier lawsuit arose out of the same factual allegations as the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>case. The Arkansas lawsuit, however, was dismissed \u2014 not transferred \u2014 for improper venue under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406 on October 27, 2011. Nearly a full year passed between the dismissal of that lawsuit and the filing of the current one. Accordingly, as this and other circuit courts have held in analogous circumstances, the second complaint does not relate back to the first complaint because the second complaint was not an amendment, but rather the commencement of a separate action.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although the cases applying this rule have generally addressed issues involving limitation periods, we see no reason to apply a different rule in the context of diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">Moreover, during the intervening year\u2014 between the dismissal of the Arkansas lawsuit and the filing of the Alabama lawsuit that was ultimately transferred to the Southern District of Mississippi in this case \u2014 Thompson filed yet another lawsuit against Reeves and the other defendants-appellees based on the same facts in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida on March 15, 2012. Thompson voluntarily dismissed that action after a United States magistrate judge entered a report and recommendation concluding that Thompson and Reeves lacked diversity of citizenship under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382. \u201cThe rule in the federal courts is that the effect of a voluntary dismissal without prejudice pursuant to Rule 41(a) is to render the proceedings a nullity and leave the parties as if the action had never been brought.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The commencement and termination of the action in Florida therefore has no bearing on diversity jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">Accordingly, the district court was correct to disregard Thompson\u2019s citizenship on April 15, 2011, for the purposes of the \u201ctime of filing\u201d rule in this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Even if the parties had possessed diversity of citizenship for the purposes of those proceedings based on Thompson\u2019s citizenship in Arkansas at that time, those proceedings were concluded long before the commencement of the present action in late 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">As explained above, the district court did not err in analyzing the facts as they were in late 2012, when the present lawsuit was commenced in Alabama and transferred to the district court. Based on these facts, the district court properly concluded that Thompson and Reeves were both Florida citizens, such that diversity jurisdiction could not be sustained under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. We therefore AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b433-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
