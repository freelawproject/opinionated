This is a variance sentence because it falls outside the calculated guideline range but is not specifically authorized by any guideline. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008). Therefore, it will be upheld if it is substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The district court considered the guidelines and the factors in \u00a7 3553(a). \u201cThe record ... demonstrates the reasonableness\u201d of the sentence. <em>Brantley, </em>537 F.3d at 350. The offense of conviction was the type that Interiano-Zavala had committed before and for which he had been punished briefly without apparent deterrent effect, and his history of other crimes did not suggest that he was averse to additional criminal activity. His personal characteristics thus indicated \u201cthat a long incarceration period was required to provide just punishment, to ensure adequate deterrence, and to protect the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consequently, there is no basis for disturbing the sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>Brantley, </em>537 F.3d at 349-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
