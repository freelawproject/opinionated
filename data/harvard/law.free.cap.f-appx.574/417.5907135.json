For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-21\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b443-22\">In September 2012, HSBC sought to foreclose on the Cyperts\u2019 home in Carroll-ton, Texas.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Cyperts had refinanced their property on May 23, 2007, executing a promissory note and deed of trust for the benefit of Wells Fargo Bank N.A., now HSBC.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The. Cyperts filed this suit in state court on January 31, 2013, seeking a declaratory judgment that the deed of trust and lien were invalid because the promissory note was for more than 80% of the fair market value of the property and they were charged more than 3% in fees in violation of \u00a7 50(a) of Article XVI of the Texas Constitution. They claim that Wells Fargo must produce the original promissory note in order to foreclose on their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-23\">On October 30, 2013, the district court dismissed the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) \u201con the ground that it is barred by the Texas residual four-year statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Cypert v. USBC Bank USA Nat. Ass\u2019n, </em>3-13-CV-1032-D, 2013 WL 5822339, at *2 (N.D.Tex. Oct. 30, 2013). The district court also held that HSBC need not be the holder of the promissory note to foreclose on Plaintiffs\u2019 property. <em>Id. </em>at *2-*3. Because the district court had \u201calready afforded plaintiffs one opportunity to re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>plead,\u201d it dismissed the action with prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at *3. The Plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo\u25a0 </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).\u201d <em>Cuvillier v. Taylor, </em>503 F.3d 397, 401 (5th Cir.2007). Rule 12(b)(6) permits a party to move to dismiss if a plaintiff has failed \u201cto state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). \u201c[A] plaintiffs obligation to provide the grounds of his entitle[ment] to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do. Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). \u201cNor does a complaint suffice if it tenders \u2018naked assertion[s]\u2019 devoid of \u2018further factual enhancement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). \u201c[W]hen the allegations in a complaint, however true, could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief, this basic deficiency should ... be exposed at the point of minimum expenditure of time and money by the parties and the court.\u201d <em>Cuvillier, </em>503 F.3d at 401 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">\u201cJurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship, so we apply the laws of Texas as interpreted by Texas authorities.\u201d <em>Priester v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., </em>708 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2013) <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 196, 187 L.Ed.2d 256 (2013) (citing <em>Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 78-79, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938)). \u201cIf a lien is made in contravention of\u2019 the requirements of the Texas Constitution found in Article 16, Section 50(a), it can require a lender or holder of the note to forfeit the principal and interest if the failure is uncured. <em>Id. </em>at 673; Tex. Const. Art. XVI, \u00a7 50(a)(6)(Q)(x).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">\u201cEvery action for which there is no express limitations period, except an action for the recovery of real property, must be brought not later than four years after the day the cause of action accrues.\u201d Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code \u00a7 16.051. \u201c[T]he four-year limitations period ... applies to constitutional infirmities under Section 50(a)(6).\u201d <em>Priester, </em>708 F.3d at 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">\u201cIt is a well-settled Fifth Circuit rule of orderliness that one panel of our court may not overturn another panel\u2019s decision, absent an intervening change in the law, such as by a statutory amendment, or the Supreme Court, or our <em>en banc </em>court.\u201d <em>Jacobs v. Nat\u2019l Drug Intelligence Ctr., </em>548 F.3d 375, 378 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-13\">Both parties agree that suit was filed more than four years after the action accrued and that <em>Priester </em>is indistinguishable from this case. The Plaintiffs contend that <em>Priester </em>was wrongly decided under an <em>Erie </em>\u2014 guess analysis. But there has been no change in the law that would empower us to overturn the <em>Priester </em>decision. In fact, subsequent Texas decisions have validated Priester\u2019s reasoning, finding \u201cthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis persuasive.\u201d <em>Williams v. Wachovia Mort. Corp., </em>407 S.W.3d 391, 397 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2013, pet. denied). The Texas Supreme Court denied review of the <em>Williams </em>decision, further emphasizing that <em>Priester </em>was rightly decided. We decline to overrule <em>Priester. </em>The four-year residual limitations period continues to apply to claims of this nature, and, having failed to file within four years of the accrual of this action, the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b443-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
