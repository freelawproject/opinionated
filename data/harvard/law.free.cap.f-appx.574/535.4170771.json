As he concedes, his claims are reviewed only for plain error because they were not raised in the district court. To show plain error, Rodriguez must show that a forfeited error was \u201cclear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute\u201d and that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he does, we have the discretion to correct the error if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks, alteration, and citation omitted). To show that an error or omission has affected his substantial rights concerning his plea, he \u201cmust show a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-22\">In his brief, Rodriguez first contends that his plea was invalid because the district court failed to inquire in further detail at rearraignment about his previous expression of dissatisfaction with counsel. He offers no authority for this contention. The court adequately ascertained that Rodriguez\u2019s differences with counsel had been resolved and that Rodriguez was \u201cvery appreciative\u201d and satisfied with counsel\u2019s work on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-23\">Similarly, Rodriguez offers no support for his contention that the court should have asked and advised him about the consequences of his rejection of the Government\u2019s offer of a plea agreement. Because the record reveals nothing about the plea offer, Rodriguez\u2019s assertions are based wholly on imaginative conjecture. Indeed, any inquiry by the court about the advisability of accepting or rejecting a plea agreement would have risked violating the absolute prohibition of court participation in plea negotiations. <em>See United States v. Hemphill, </em>748 F.3d 666, 672 (5th Cir.2014). Rodriguez fails to show any error, plain or otherwise, in the acceptance of his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-24\">Finally, Rodriguez contends that his sentence was unreasonable. Although this challenge is reviewable for plain error, it fails under our typical review for reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>ableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The \u201csafety valve\u201d sentence was below the statutory minimum and within the correct revised guideline range. It is therefore presumed reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">The court gave adequate reasons for the within-guideline sentence. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456; <em>United States v. Herrera-Garduno, </em>519 F.3d 526, 531 (5th Cir.2008). By arguing that the district court should have weighed the sentencing factors differently, Rodriguez merely invites us to adopt his assessment of those factors rather than the district court\u2019s, which is contrary to the deferential review mandated by <em>Gall. See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. His mere disagreement with the propriety of the sentence does not rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010). Rodriguez shows no unreasonableness or plain error in his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b561-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
