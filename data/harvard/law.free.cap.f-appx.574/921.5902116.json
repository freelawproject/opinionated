At the time, Powell had pending in the state trial court a motion for new trial. That is, she had not yet appealed her convictions to the Georgia Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-20\">The District Court dismissed Powell\u2019s petition without prejudice for failure to exhaust state remedies. She filed a notice of appeal, and a judge of this court issued a certificate of appealability (COA) on one issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-21\">Whether the district court erred in dismissing without prejudice Powell\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition on exhaustion grounds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-22\">Section 2253(c)(2) of Title 28 of the U.S.Code, which governs appeals in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 proceedings, states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-23\">(a) In a habeas corpus proceeding ... before a district judge, the final order shall be subject to review, on appeal, by the court of appeals for the circuit in which the proceeding is held.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-24\">(c)(1) Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability, an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-25\">(A) the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a State court; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-26\">(2) A certificate of appealability may issue under paragraph (1) only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-27\">(3) The certificate of appealability under paragraph (1) shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required by paragraph (2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-28\">The COA before us does not satisfy the subsection (c)(2) and (3) requirement because even if we were to assume that Powell has a right to litigate a \u00a7 2254 petition containing unexhausted claims, such right is not provided by the U.S. Constitution. And because Powell has not yet sought to appeal her convictions to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>Georgia Supreme Court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we cannot know whether Powell\u2019s trial court denied her a right provided by the U.S. Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">In sum, because the COA does not list as an issue the denial of a federal constitutional right and because Powell cannot show that the state trial court denied her such a right, we must vacate the COA as improvidently granted and dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b948-18\">. <em>Cf. Hittson v. GDCP Warden, </em>759 F.3d 1210, 2014 WL 3513033 at *14-15 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
