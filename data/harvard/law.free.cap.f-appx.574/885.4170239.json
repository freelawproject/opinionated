U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>345 Fed.Appx. 424 (11th Cir.2009) (unpublished). The BIA granted the motion, and the IJ issued a new order denying Yang\u2019s application for asylum. The BIA affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-13\">Yang presents two arguments in support of her petitioner for review. First, the BIA erred in concluding that she failed to meet her burden of showing that she suffered past persecution on account of her \u201cother resistance\u201d to China\u2019s population control program and in relying on <em>Matter of M-F-W &amp; L-G-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 683 (BIA 2008), which held that an asylum applicant claiming persecution for acts of \u201cother resistance\u201d must show a nexus between the persecution and the \u201cother resistance,\u201d in reaching its conclusion. Second, the BIA, in not explaining why her intrauterine device (\u201cIUD\u201d) insertions did not constitute \u201caggravating circumstances,\u201d failed adequately to consider the aggregate harm she suffered as result of her acts of resistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-14\">We lack jurisdiction to entertain Yang\u2019s first argument to the extent that it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>based on <em>Matter of M-F-W &amp; L-G </em>because Yang failed to exhaust the argument administratively. <em>See </em>Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), \u00a7 242(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that we lack jurisdiction to consider issues that have not been raised before the BIA). Yang\u2019s petition for review is therefore dismissed with respect to the <em>Matter of M-F-W &amp; L-G </em>argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">The remainder of Yang\u2019s first argument is foreclosed by the \u201claw-of-the-case\u201d doctrine. That doctrine holds that an appellate court\u2019s factual findings and legal conclusions are \u201cgenerally binding in all subsequent proceedings in the same case in the trial court or on a later appeal.\u201d <em>Mega Life &amp; Health Ins. Co. v. Pieniozek, </em>585 F.3d 1399, 1405 (11th Cir.2009). The purpose of the doctrine is to \u201cbring[] an end to litigation, protect[] against agitation of settled issues, and assur[e] that lower courts obey appellate orders.\u201d <em>This That And The Other Gift And Tobacco, Inc. v. Cobb Cnty., Ga., </em>439 F.3d 1275, 1283 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\"><em>Yang, </em>which was decided on the same facts presented to the BIA, explicitly found that \u2018Tang was not persecuted for resistance to a coercive population control program.\u201d <em>Yang, </em>345 Fed.Appx. at 427. We explained that her opposition to the injections was because of her anesthesia allergy and not her opposition to the population control program and that she did not resist the two IUDs, and the insertion of the two IUDs did not constitute persecution, \u201cbecause they were intended to implement the population control program and not to punish Yang for any resistance to that program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We found, moreover, that she \u201cfailed to offer any evidence that she will be persecuted for [having a child in the United States or removing her IUD in the United States].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">The issues Yang presented to the BIA on appeal were precisely those we considered and ruled on in <em>Yang. </em>Like the court in <em>Yang, </em>the BIA found that Yang opposed the experimental injection and sterilization procedure because she was allergic to anesthesia and not because of the population control program; that she was not persecuted for removing the first IUD and having a second child in China (acts that did constitute \u201cother resistance\u201d); and that she failed to show that she would be persecuted for removing the IUD or having a child in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">The law-of-the-case doctrine does not apply if: \u201c(1) since the prior decision, \u2018new and substantially different evidence is produced, or there has been a change in the controlling authority\u2019; or (2) \u2018the prior decision was clearly erroneous and would result in a manifest injustice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>These exceptions are inapplicable here because Yang presented no \u201cnew or substantially different evidence\u201d on remand. Nor did she establish a change in the controlling authority or that our decision in <em>Yang </em>was clearly erroneous or manifestly unjust..</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">The law-of-the-case doctrine does not apply to Yang\u2019s second argument, which is that the BIA failed to provide a reasoned consideration of her appeal because it did not explain the \u201caggravating circumstances\u201d surrounding her forced IUD insertions. We find no merit in the argument. The record shows that the BIA considered the issues Yang raised on appeal and rendered a decision sufficient to enable this court to conduct meaningful appellate review. <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1374 (11th Cir.2006). The BIA was not required to address specifically each point the petitioner raised or each piece of evidence she cited. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b912-10\">. The IJ also denied Yang\u2019s applications for withholding of removal and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. However, Yang abandoned those claims on appeal. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding that issues on appeal are deemed abandoned when an appellant fails to provide argument on an issue). Yang also abandoned any argument she had regarding the BIA\u2019s determination that she did not establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
