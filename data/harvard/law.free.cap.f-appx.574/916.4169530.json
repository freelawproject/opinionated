The Thomases argue that the district court abused its discretion by failing to compare their assets to their liabilities and improperly basing the denial solely on the fact that their annual income was in excess of the amount set by the Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) 2013 Poverty Guidelines. After review of the record and consideration of the Thomases\u2019 brief, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-19\">In the case, the Thomases filed suit against various state officials, judges, law firms, and private companies, alleging racial discrimination under \u00a7 1983 and claims under state tort law. The Thom-ases\u2019 complaint was accompanied by a motion for leave to proceed IFP, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. A magistrate judge denied the IFP motion on the basis that the Thomases\u2019 collective annual income \u2014 over $35,000 \u2014 \u201cfar exceeded]\u201d the HHS Poverty Guidelines, which set the poverty threshold for a three-member household<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> at $19,530 annually. The magistrate judge did not otherwise compare the Thomases\u2019 assets to the liabilities reported in then-application. The Thomases appealed the magistrate judge\u2019s ruling to the district court, which affirmed the denial of the IFP motion. This appeal followed. We granted leave to proceed IFP on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-20\">We review the denial of a motion for leave to proceed IFP under \u00a7 1915 for an abuse of discretion. <em>Martinez v. Kristi Kleaners, Inc., </em>364 F.3d 1305, 1306 (11th Cir.2004). \u201c[Pjroceeding [IFP] is a privilege, not a right.\u201d <em>Camp v. Oliver, </em>798 F.2d 434, 437 (11th Cir.1986). A district court has wide discretion in ruling on an application for leave to proceed IFP and should grant the IFP privilege \u201csparingly\u201d in civil cases for damages. <em>Martinez, </em>364 F.3d at 1306. However, a district court cannot act arbitrarily or deny the application on erroneous grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 1306-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-21\">When assessing whether a plaintiff is indigent for purposes of \u00a7 1915, \u201c[t]he only determination to be made by the court ... is whether the statements in the affidavit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>satisfy the requirement of poverty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1307 (quotation marks omitted). An application for leave to proceed IFP \u201cneed not show that the litigant is \u2018absolutely destitute\u2019 to qualify for indigent status under \u00a7 1915.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An application \u201cwill be held sufficient if it represents that the litigant, because of his poverty, is unable to pay for the court fees and costs, and to support and provide necessities for himself and his dependents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A court may not deny an IFP motion without first comparing the applicant\u2019s assets and liabilities in order to determine whether he has satisfied the poverty requirement. <em>See id. </em>at 1307-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\">The sole reason given by the magistrate judge for the denial of the Thomases\u2019 IFP motion \u2014 that the Thomases\u2019 annual income exceeded the poverty threshold set by the HHS Poverty Guidelines \u2014 was insufficient to deny an IFP motion, because litigants need not show that they are \u201cabsolutely destitute\u201d to qualify for IFP status under \u00a7 1915. <em>See id. </em>at 1307 &amp; n. 5 (noting that the movant\u2019s income was above the poverty line but finding that her sworn statement that she was a pauper and unable to pay court costs was \u201csufficient on its face to demonstrate economic eligibility\u201d for IFP status). In their application, the Thomases swore that they were unable to pay the filing fee because of their poverty. Because this statement was sufficient on its face to allege poverty, the district court should have compared the Thomases\u2019 assets to their liabilities to determine whether they, in fact, had satisfied the poverty requirement before denying their IFP motion on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion, including, if appropriate, review for whether the Thom-ases\u2019 complaint is frivolous or fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2); <em>Martinez, </em>364 F.3d at 1308.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b942-22\">.
