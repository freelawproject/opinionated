He contends that the BIA legally erred in concluding that he failed to establish that his United States citizen children would suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship as a result of his removal to Mexico. Specifically, Hernandez-Mendez argues that the IJ and BIA failed to properly consider and cumulatively assess the age, educational needs, and health of his United States citizen children. He also argues that the BIA misinterpreted \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D) to require that the hardship apply to a single qualifying relative.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-20\">We are statutorily barred from reviewing the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s purely discretionary denial of cancellation of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Sung v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 372, 377 (5th Cir.2007). This jurisdiction-stripping provision does not preclude review of constitutional claims or questions of law. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Sung, </em>505 F.3d at 377. However, we look past an alien\u2019s framing of an issue and will decline to consider \u201can abuse of discretion argument cloaked in constitutional garb.\u201d <em>Hadwani v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 798, 801 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks, citation, and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-21\">Hernandez-Mendez\u2019s claim that the IJ and BIA failed to properly consider and cumulatively assess the age, educational needs, and health of his United States citizen children is nothing more than a disagreement with the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s weighing of the factors underlying the discretionary hardship determination. Further, the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decisions reflect that they meaningfully considered all of the relevant hardship factors and evidence, individually and cumulatively. Because Hernandez-Mendez challenges the consideration and weighing of the evidence, we lack jurisdiction over his claim that the BIA erred in dismissing his appeal of the IJ\u2019s denial of his application for cancella<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>tion of removal. <em>See Sung, </em>505 F.3d at 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\">Finally, although \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) does not preclude our review of Hernandez-Mendez\u2019s claim that the BIA misinterpreted \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D), <em>see </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), we nonetheless lack jurisdiction to consider the claim because it was not raised before the BIA. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 318-20 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Accordingly, Hernandez-Mendez\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b403-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
