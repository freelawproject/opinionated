Ramdatt argues his sentence is procedurally unreasonable. Upon review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we reject Ramdatt\u2019s argument and affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-21\">Ramdatt argues his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to explain its reasons for imposing it consecutively to the state sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (describing \u201cfailure] to adequately explain the chosen sentence\u201d as a \u201csignificant procedural error\u201d). This argument is without merit because the district court expressly stated that it had \u201cconsidered the statements of all parties, the presentence report, which contains the advisory guidelines, and the statutory factors as set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 3553(a).\u201d Ramdatt rejects this explanation as \u201ca simple <em>pro forma </em>acknowledgement of \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d but we approved a materially identical statement in <em>United States v. Alfaro-Moncada, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>607 F.3d 720, 735 (11th Cir.2010); <em>see also United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[NJothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d). The district court\u2019s explanation of the sentence it imposed was sufficient to show that it had \u201cconsidered the parties\u2019 arguments and ha[d] a reasoned basis for [its] own legal decisionmaking authority,\u201d and it is therefore sufficient for our review. <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1090 (11th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). This is particularly true given that the district court\u2019s decision was consistent with the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 preference for consecutive terms of imprisonment for sentences imposed at different times. <em>See United States v. Ballard, </em>6 F.3d 1502, 1506 (11th Cir.1993) (recognizing this preference); <em>see also Livesay, </em>525 F.3d at 1090 (\u201cGenerally, when sentencing within the advisory Guidelines range, the district court is not required to give a lengthy explanation for its sentence if the case is typical of those contemplated by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d). Neither of Ramdatt\u2019s arguments for leniency (specifically, that he desired to return to his family and that it would cost the \"United States more to imprison him for a longer time) necessitated further discussion by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that the sentence the district court imposed was not procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b903-16\">. We review the reasonableness of a sentence, including whether it is imposed consecutive to or concurrent with another sentence, for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Bonilla, </em>579 F.3d 1233, 1244-45 (11th Cir.2009). \"The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Bane, </em>720 F.3d 818, 824 (11th Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
