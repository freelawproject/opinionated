Considering the amended complaint\u2019s alleged facts, the law does not support Malcolm\u2019s claims; we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, accepting the complaint\u2019s factual allegations as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Leib v. Hillsborough Cnty. Pub. Transp. Comm\u2019n, </em>558 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir.2009). \u201c[A] complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We construe liberally a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s pleadings. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-14\">\u201c[Q]ualified immunity offers complete protection for government officials sued in their individual capacities as long as their conduct violates no clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Mathews v. Crosby, </em>480 F.3d 1265, 1269 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cFor a constitutional right to be clearly established, its contours must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that <em>what he is doing </em>violates that right.\u201d <em>Hope v. Pelzer, </em>536 U.S. 730, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 2515, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002) (emphasis added) (quotations omitted). Considering what the official was doing and when, the federal violation must have been beyond debate at the time; otherwise qualified immunity applies. <em>Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2074, 2083, 179 L.Ed.2d 1149 (2011); <em>Lane v. Franks, </em>No. 13-483, 2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>U.S. LEXIS 4302, at *25 (U.S. June 19, 2014) (applying qualified immunity, where Supreme Court concluded \u201cno doubt\u201d that Constitution protected certain conduct by plaintiff, when the federal law question was not \u201cbeyond debate\u201d at time defendant acted). \u201cWhen properly applied, [qualified immunity] protects \u2018all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>al-Kidd, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2085.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Malcolm does not dispute that he was violating Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 316.2065, which required having a visible light on his bicycle between sunset and sunrise, on the evening of his arrest. Because Defendant Officers had probable cause to believe that Malcolm was committing a traffic offense in their presence, stopping and detaining him was no Fourth Amendment violation. <em>See Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 1777, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996) (a stop is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment when police officers have probable cause to believe a person has committed a civil traffic violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Traffic stops carry with them a risk of a violent encounter, largely because evidence of a more serious crime might be uncovered. <em>See Maryland v. Wilson, </em>519 U.S. 408, 117 S.Ct. 882, 886, 137 L.Ed.2d 41 (1997). When officers conduct a lawful traffic stop (as Defendants did here), that the officers conduct a limited patdown search for weapons is not per se unlawful, but depends on the circumstances of the particular case. <em>See Arizona v. Johnson, </em>555 U.S. 323, 129 S.Ct. 781, 784, 172 L.Ed.2d 694 (2009). \u201cThe purpose of this limited search is not to discover evidence of crime, but to allow the officer to pursue his investigation without fear of violence.\u201d <em>Minnesota v. Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 366, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 2136, 124 L.Ed.2d 334 (1993). If, during the course of a lawful patdown search of a person\u2019s outer clothing, an officer \u201cfeels an object whose contour or mass makes its identity [as contraband] immediately apparent,\u201d the officer can seize the contraband without a warrant consistent with the Fourth Amendment. <em>See id. </em>at 2137.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">In his amended complaint, Malcolm broadly alleges that, during the traffic stop,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Officer Raymonvil searched him illegally. During the search, Malcolm says that Officer Raymonvil \u201creached deep into [Malcolm\u2019s] pockets and removed all of [his] personal possessions that were not visible to the naked eye,\u201d including an unspecified quantity of marijuana. Malcolm was later charged with felony possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">Construing Malcolm\u2019s factual allegations in the light most favorable to him, Malcolm has not alleged facts that demonstrate Defendants\u2019 search violated an already clearly established federal constitutional right. Defendants have contended \u2014 more important, Malcolm does not allege otherwise\u2014 that they \u201cpatted [Malcolm] down for weapons.\u201d Malcolm does say in his amended complaint that, throughout his encounter with Defendant Officers, he asked the officers repeatedly what they were doing, insisted repeatedly that he had no weapons, and \u201crefused to be illegally searched.\u201d \u201cTraffic stops are especially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>fraught with danger to police - officers.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>129 S.Ct. at 786 (quotations omitted). And given Malcolm\u2019s own selected statement of the facts, an objective'officer might reasonably suspect \u2014 in the context, including Malcolm\u2019s statements at the scene and active refusal to cooperate \u2014 that Malcolm posed a sufficient threat to the officers that would have warranted a protective patdown search. Thus, Malcolm has failed to allege facts that a patdown search by Defendants \u2014 in the context of the lawful traffic stop \u2014 constituted a federal constitutional violation that was \u201cbeyond debate\u201d at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Malcolm has also failed to allege facts that demonstrate that Defendants\u2019 conduct was inconsistent with a permissible search of Malcolm\u2019s pockets. Defendants would have been entitled to reach into Malcolm\u2019s pockets and retrieve what they could readily identify \u2014 based on pat-down search of the outside of Malcolm\u2019s clothing \u2014 as contraband. <em>See Dickerson, </em>113 S.Ct. at 2137. Thus, Malcolm\u2019s contention that Defendant Raymonvil reached deep into his pockets and removed the contents (which included a bag of marijuana), in and of itself, is not enough to allege that Defendants violated clearly the Fourth Amendment. After discovering marijuana in Malcolm\u2019s possession, Defendants had probable cause to arrest Malcolm.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Accepting Malcolm\u2019s factual allegations as true and construing them in the light most favorable to him, he has not alleged facts that, if true, show that Defendants violated a federal right that, before his arrest, was already clearly established: \u201cbeyond debate.\u201d Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. The district court dismissed properly Malcolm\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b908-11\">. Malcolm does not appeal the district court's dismissal of Defendants Charles Clark and the City of Miami.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b908-12\">. \"Because qualified immunity is 'an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability ... it is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.\u2019 \" Pear<em>son v. Callahan, </em>555 U.S. 223, 129 S.Ct. 808, 815, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009). As a result, the Supreme Court has \"repeatedly ... stressed the importance of resolving immunity questions at the earliest possible stage in litigation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b909-7\">. Malcolm alleges that the officers drew their weapons and ultimately handcuffed him during the temporary detention triggered by the lack-of-a-light-on-his-bicycle violation. The Supreme Court has written that the risk of harm to everyone involved in a traffic stop \u201cis minimized if the officers routinely exercise unquestioned command of the situation.\u201d <em>See Wilson, </em>117 S.Ct. at 886. Neither handcuffing nor an officer's drawing his weapon necessarily converts an investigative stop into a custodial arrest. <em>See United States v. Hastamorir, </em>881 F.2d 1551, 1556-57 (11th Cir.1989). Malcolm does not allege that his being held at gunpoint or his being handcuffed amounted to a full custodial arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b910-6\">. Malcolm says the marijuana charges were dropped later.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b910-7\">. In his appellate brief, Malcolm lists several issues he wants considered on appeal, including, among other things: (1) whether a violation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure occurred; (2) whether Defendants are subject to default judgment; (3) whether collateral estoppel applies; and (4) whether the district court violated his due process rights. Because Malcolm\u2019s brief, construed liberally, presents no substantive arguments about these issues, they are abandoned. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
