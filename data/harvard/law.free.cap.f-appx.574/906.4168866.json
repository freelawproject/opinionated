On appeal, Brieker argues that his above-guidelines sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. After review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Bricker\u2019s sentences but remand to the district court to correct a typographical error in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-25\">I. Procedural Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b932-26\">Brieker first contends his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to follow the appropriate steps for departing upward pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, which authorizes the district court to depart upward \u201c[i]f reliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>der-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l). Specifically, the district court did not sequentially consider whether the next highest criminal history categories were appropriate. <em>See United States v. Valdes, </em>500 F.3d 1291, 1292 n. 1 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cIf a district court finds that a defendant\u2019s criminal history is not adequately represented by the Guidelines range, and decides to engage in a departure analysis under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, the judge must first explicitly consider the <em>next </em>criminal history category and make a determination as to whether that new range is appropriate.\u201d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Bricker\u2019s arguments are unavailing. The record demonstrates the district court\u2019s above-guidelines sentence was the result of a variance pursuant to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors rather than a departure under the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Kapordelis, </em>569 F.3d 1291, 1316 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cIn determining whether the district court applied an upward departure under the Guidelines or a variance under the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we consider whether the district court cited to a specific guideline departure provision and if the court\u2019s rationale was based on its determination that the Guidelines were inadequate.\u201d). Although the district court marked \u201c4A1.3 Criminal History Inadequacy\u201d under the section \u201cReason(s) for Departure\u201d in its Statement of Reasons, the record demonstrates that the above-guidelines sentence was motivated by the court\u2019s conclusion that the Guidelines were inadequate and that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors weighed in favor of a longer sentence. <em>See id. </em>In imposing Brieker\u2019s sentence, the district court correctly calculated the guidelines range, cited and discussed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and determined that an above-guidelines sentence was appropriate in light of those factors. <em>See United States v. Irizarry, </em>458 F.3d 1208, 1211-12 (11th Cir.2006). In addition, in another section of its Statement of Reasons, the district court checked six of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as justification for imposing a sentence outside the advisory guidelines range, and expressly stated that Bricker\u2019s sentence was appropriate based on all of the statutory factors. Accordingly, we conclude Bricker\u2019s above-guidelines sentence was a variance, not a departure, and the district court therefore did not err by failing to follow the procedure for departing upward under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">II. Substantive Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">Bricker next contends his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court abused its discretion in imposing a sentence significantly above the advisory guidelines range. Relying on \u00a7 4A1.3 and the guidelines commentary, Bricker argues the presentence investigation report failed to provide reliable information about many of the prior offenses on which the district court relied in imposing his sentence, and those offenses did not justify the extent of the district court\u2019s deviation from the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">Bricker\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 4A1.3 and the accompanying commentary is misplaced because, as discussed above, the district court did not depart upward under the Guidelines. The district court, moreover, did not abuse its discretion in imposing Bricker\u2019s above-guidelines sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (\u201c[Courts of appeals must review all sentences \u2014 whether inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range \u2014 under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d). We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on the whole, justified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>the extent of the variance. <em>See id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. The district court discussed Bricker\u2019s history and characteristics, noting his history of alcohol abuse as well as his acceptance of responsibility for his conduct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a)(1). The court also pointed to Bricker\u2019s extensive criminal history and disrespect for the law, as well as the danger Bricker posed to the public. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2). As demonstrated by the presentence investigation report, Bricker\u2019s criminal history extended from the time he was 18 years old and spanned over 25 years, encompassing crimes from theft to reckless driving, burglary, possession of stolen mail, and driving under the influence. On this record, we cannot say that \u201cthe district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quotation omitted); <em>see also United States v. Early, </em>686 F.3d 1219, 1222-23 (11th Cir.2012) (concluding a defendant\u2019s above-guidelines sentence was substantively reasonable in light of the defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors). Accordingly, we affirm Bricker\u2019s 48-month total sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">III. Typographical Error in the Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">We note that the district court\u2019s written judgment contains a scrivener\u2019s error. <em>See United States v. Reeves, </em>742 F.3d 487, 507 n. 12 (11th Cir.2014) (\u201cWe may <em>sua sponte </em>raise the issue of clerical errors in a judgment and remand with instructions that the district court correct them.\u201d). Count Six of the judgment indicates Bricker was convicted of aggravated identity theft under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1028A(a)(l) and 1028(c). The judgment should be corrected to reflect that Bricker was convicted of aggravated identity theft under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Bricker\u2019s sentences but remand for the limited purpose of correcting the scrivener\u2019s error in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">AFFIRMED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
