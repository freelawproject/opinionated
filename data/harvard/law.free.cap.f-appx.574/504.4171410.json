He argues for the first time on appeal that counsel was ineffective at sentencing. Although Martinez-Lopez\u2019s plea agreement contained an appeal waiver provision, we are unable to determine whether he knowingly and voluntarily waived his appellate rights because the record on appeal does not contain the rear-raignment transcript. We pretermit consideration of the effect of the appeal waiver in this case because we would not reach the merits of the ineffective assistance claim in any event as the record is not sufficiently developed to allow us to evaluate counsel\u2019s actions. <em>See United States v. Story, </em>439 F.3d 226, 230-31 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-22\">Martinez-Lopez also argues that there is a clerical error in the judgment because it references both 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(1). <em>See </em>FED. R. CRIM. P. 36. There is no error as Martinez-Lopez was indicted for and in fact pleaded guilty to violating \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b530-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
