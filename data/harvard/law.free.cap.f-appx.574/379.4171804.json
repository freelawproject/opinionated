Sandmann, a pharmacist at the CMC Pharmacy. Davis alleged that he had a documented history of restless leg syndrome (RLS) and that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs when they denied him the prescribed drug, Mirapex, and failed to provide an alternative course of treatment. The district court dismissed Davis\u2019s claims as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), concluding they lacked merit as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-19\">As an initial matter, Davis, in his complaint and more definite statement, made very specific claims against Lithicum and Zapeda regarding the creation and implementation of policies and procedures concerning the CMC Pharmacy and their failure to intervene when he was denied Mirapex. On appeal, however, he does not expressly renew his claims against those two officials, addressing only his claims against Sandmann and Williams, and generally complaining of TDCJ pharmaceutical policies. Accordingly, Davis has abandoned his claims against Lithicum and Zapeda. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-20\">A district court may dismiss an IFP complaint as frivolous if it has no arguable basis in law or fact. <em>Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997); \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). A complaint lacks an arguable basis in law if it is based on an indisputably meritless legal theory. <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 327, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint as frivolous pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) for abuse of discretion. <em>Brewster v. Dretke, </em>587 F.3d 764, 767 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-22\">Prison officials violate the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment when they demonstrate deliberate indifference to a prisoner\u2019s serious medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>needs, resulting in unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain. <em>Wilson v. Seiter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 297, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991). A prison official acts with deliberate indifference \u201conly if he knows that inmates face a substantial risk of serious harm and disregards that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it.\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 847, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). \u201cDeliberate indifference is an extremely high standard to meet.\u201d <em>Domino v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">With regard to the claim that Sandmann was deliberately indifferent to Davis\u2019s serious medical needs by refusing to fill his prescription for Mirapex, in contravention of an outside physician\u2019s order, the uncon-troverted evidence reflects that Sandmann denied Mirapex because of its high degree of psychological side effects and because it was generally not used in the prison population. Moreover, we give \u201cgreat deference to prison administrators\u2019 judgments regarding jail security\u201d and management of prisons. <em>Oliver v. Scott, </em>276 F.3d 736, 745 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Clarke v. Stalder, </em>121 F.3d 222, 229 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Davis\u2019s claim that Williams was deliberately indifferent when she failed to appeal Sandmann\u2019s denial of Mirapex is also without merit. A prison official\u2019s failure to follow prison procedural rules does not, without more, give rise to a constitutional violation. <em>See Myers v. Klevenhagen, </em>97 F.3d 91, 94 (5th Cir.1996). Furthermore, given that the denial of Mirapex was based on its adverse psychological side effects and its contraindicated use in prison settings, Williams\u2019s discretionary decision not to appeal was both a judgment regarding medical treatment and one regarding the application of prison policies and practices designed to maintain and preserve internal order. <em>See McCord v. Maggio, </em>910 F.2d 1248, 1251 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">We also reject, as without merit, Davis\u2019s claim that Sandmann and William were deliberately indifferent for failing to prescribe an alternative course of treatment. As Davis complained of his RLS infrequently following the denial of Mirapex, he has not demonstrated that Sandmann and Williams knew that he faced a substantial risk of serious medical harm yet failed to take steps to abate that harm. <em>See Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 847, 114 S.Ct. 1970. Further, any deficiencies or delays in Davis\u2019s care fell far short of the \u201ccold hearted, casual unwillingness to investigate what can be done for a man who is obviously in desperate need of help\u201d that we have recognized as necessary to constitute deliberate indifference. <em>Fielder v. Bosshard, </em>590 F.2d 105, 108 (5th Cir.1979). In any event, the failure to prescribe an alternative course of treatment at most amounted to medical malpractice or negligence, which are insufficient to establish a constitutional violation. <em>See Gobert v. Caldwell, </em>463 F.3d 339, 346 (5th Cir.2006). The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Davis\u2019s complaint and our affirmance of the dismissal count as one strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Davis is warned that, if he accumulates three strikes, he will be barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b405-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
