Boyd saw Julius Wade, a codefendant and a cooperating government witness, during an attorney visit at the jail where both men were incarcerated. It is undisputed that Boyd told Wade to \u201cchange [Wade\u2019s] life,\u201d and Boyd allegedly then said to Wade: \u201cI got something for you for trying to rush out there to them hos.\u201d On appeal, Boyd argues that the district court erred in applying a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice based on these two statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact underlying an obstruction-of-justice enhancement for clear error, and the district court\u2019s application of the factual findings to the sentencing guidelines are reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Doe, </em>661 F.3d 550, 565 (11th Cir.2011). Under the clear-error standard, we \u201cmust affirm the district court unless review of the entire record leaves us with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. McPhee, </em>336 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). We will not reverse the district court\u2019s plausible fact findings even if we would have decided the case differently. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, we give substantial deference to a district court\u2019s credibility determinations. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-12\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice if \u201cthe defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. The enhancement is appropriate where the district court finds that the defendant \u201cthreaten[ed], intimidate[ed], or otherwise unlawfully influenced] a co-defendant, witness, or juror, directly or indirectly, or attempted] to do so.\u201d <em>Id., </em>cmt. n. 4(A). In <em>United States v. Rubio, </em>we held that an obstruction-of-justice enhancement was appropriate based on the defendant\u2019s assault on a witness after trial, rejecting Rubio\u2019s argument that because the assault occurred after trial, it could not impact the prosecution of his case. 317 F.3d 1240, 1244-45 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-13\">On appeal, Boyd argues that the district court erred in imposing the obstruction-of-justice enhancement because the government failed to meet its burden of proving that the enhancement applied through reliable and specific evidence, and failed to show that Boyd acted with the purpose of obstructing justice. Any finding that Boyd\u2019s statement to Wade \u2014 specifically, that Boyd had \u201csomething\u201d for Wade \u2014 was intended as a threat against Wade or Wade\u2019s family was based on speculation. Also, because Boyd made the statement several months after Wade had been de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>briefed and about a month after pleading guilty, Boyd\u2019s statements could not have been made in an attempt to influence Wade\u2019s testimony or to obstruct justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">In response, the government argues that Boyd did not object to the application of the obstruction-of-justice enhancement on the ground that the district court erred in construing his remarks against Wade as a threat, and instead, argued before the district court that he had not threatened Wade at all and that, even if he did, he did not do so with the intent to obstruct justice. Further, having heard the differing accounts of the encounter between Boyd and Wade, the district court found that Boyd threatened Wade in retaliation for Wade\u2019s cooperation with the government, and in light of the entire record Boyd has not shown that this determination was clear error. The obstruction-of-justice enhancement applies to the actual or attempted obstruction with respect to investigation, prosecution, or sentencing, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1., cmt. n. 4(A), and at the time Boyd confronted Wade, Boyd did not know whether Wade\u2019s testimony would be used against him at sentencing. It is irrelevant whether Boyd\u2019s statement actually obstructed justice, and the record fully supports the district court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Upon review, we And that the district court did not err in applying the obstruction-of-justice enhancement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court found that both statements were intended as threats against Wade, concluding that Wade\u2019s testimony was believable and that another witness\u2019s testimony, which indicated that Boyd did not intend to threaten Wade and that Boyd never made the second statement, was not credible. Here, there were two potentially permissible views of the evidence, and the district court\u2019s determination, after hearing both Wade\u2019s and Bradshaw\u2019s testimonies firsthand, to adopt Wade\u2019s version of events cannot be clearly erroneous. <em>See McPhee, </em>336 F.3d at 1275.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">Boyd\u2019s argument regarding the timing of his statements to Wade is also unavailing. By its plain language, the obstruction-of-justice enhancement applies to any threats made against a witness during any stage of the proceedings, including sentencing. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 &amp; cmt. n. 4(A). Although Boyd had already entered into a plea agreement with the government at the time of the comments, he had not yet been sentenced, and the threat made against Wade could still have obstructed justice by impacting Boyd\u2019s sentencing. <em>See Rubio, </em>317 F.3d at 1244-45. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b906-6\">. As a preliminary matter, Boyd adequately presented the various grounds for his objection to the obstruction-of-justice enhancement to the district court to preserve the entire claim for appeal. The government argues that Boyd failed to specifically argue that his statement to Wade was too ambiguous to constitute a threat. However, the district court\u2019s findings indicate that it clearly understood and specifically rejected Boyd\u2019s alternative position that, regardless of what was said, Boyd did not intend to threaten Wade. <em>See United States v. Siegel, </em>153 F.3d 1256, 1262-63 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that the district court\u2019s response to an objection demonstrated that it was aware of defense counsel's contention underlying the objection, such that the issue was properly preserved for appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
