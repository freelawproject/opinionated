The six firearms were described in Metts\u2019s indictment. Metts challenges the denial of his request for a special jury verdict to identify the particular firearms that he possessed. The district court ruled that there was not \u201ca requirement that that charge be given in this case.\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to instruct the jury to identify which of the six firearms Metts had in his vehicle. To convict Metts for violating section 922(g), the jury had to find that Metts was a convicted felon who was knowingly in possession of a firearm and that the firearm affected or traveled in interstate commerce. <em>See United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir.2004). Officers discovered six firearms wrapped inside a sleeping bag lying in the cargo compartment of Metts\u2019s Isuzu vehicle. Metts\u2019s \u201csimultaneous possession of several weapons constitute^] only one offense under Section 922(g).\u201d <em>United States v. Grinkiewicz, </em>873 F.2d 253, 255 (11th Cir.1989); <em>see also United States v. Bonavia, </em>927 F.2d 565, 568-69 (11th Cir.1991). A special verdict was unnecessary when the jury had to agree that Metts possessed any one of the six firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">Metts argues, for the first time, that the jury needed to identify the specific firearms to substantiate its finding that he had constructively possessed the firearms, but we disagree. The firearms were discovered together, which eliminated the possibility that Metts possessed only some of the six firearms. And Metts did not submit any evidence to suggest that someone else exercised authority over his vehicle. <em>See Wright, </em>392 F.3d at 1273. Officers found the firearms inside an Isuzu vehicle that Metts gave the officers permission to search, and a clerk in the Bryan County licensing office testified that Metts owned the Isuzu vehicle. Metts testified that he had \u201cnever seen the guns,\u201d but he did not testify that anyone else used his vehicle. Metts suggests that he did not exercise exclusive authority over the vehicle based on testimony that there were \u201cother persons on the scene,\u201d but that testimony does not support Metts\u2019s argument. An officer testified on cross-examination that \u201csome people approached\u201d Metts\u2019s property during the search and that those people were asked \u201cto step away until [the officers] were done conducting [their] business.\u201d The officer\u2019s testimony does not suggest that other people exercised control over Metts\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-13\">We AFFIRM Metts\u2019s conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
