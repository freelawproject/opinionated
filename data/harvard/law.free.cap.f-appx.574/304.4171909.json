He argues that the sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The district court considered the allocution, arguments, and presentence report and was free to conclude, as it did, that the guidelines range was inadequate in light of \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s sentencing factors. Specifically, the district court cited Leonel-Jimenez\u2019s unscored criminal history, which included a conviction for assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">The record demonstrates that the district court\u2019s decision to impose a non-guidelines sentence was based on permissible factors that advanced the objectives set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) and were justified by the facts of the case. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708-09 (5th Cir.2006). Additionally, the variance does not represent an abuse of the district court\u2019s vast sentencing discretion when considered in light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b331-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
