Whittaker challenged, relying on <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), and <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), the enhancement of his sentence pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act. The district court denied relief, concluding that such allegations should be presented in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and that Whittaker had not established that he was entitled to proceed under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e), which allows a federal prisoner to challenge his conviction under \u00a7 2241 if the remedies provided under \u00a7 2255 are \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d A petitioner seeking to establish that his \u00a7 2255 remedy was inadequate or ineffective must make a claim \u201c(i) that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 900-01 (5th Cir.2001). Both <em>Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2163, and <em>Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2282, address sentencing issues and have no effect on whether the facts of Whittaker\u2019s case would support his conviction for the substantive offense. <em>See Wesson v. U.S. Penitentiary Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 348 (5th Cir.2002). Accordingly, neither <em>Alleyne </em>nor <em>Descamps </em>is a retroactively available Supreme Court decision indieat-ing that Whittaker was convicted of a nonexistent offense. <em>See id. </em>The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b475-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
