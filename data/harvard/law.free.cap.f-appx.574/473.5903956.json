Specifically, he argues that the sentence imposed \u201coverstates his breach of trust\u201d and does not address his drug addiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-21\">To preserve the issue for further review, Sanchez, relying upon <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), argues that revocation sentences should be reviewed for \u201creasonableness.\u201d However this court reviews such sentences under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(4)\u2019s \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.2011). Revocation sentences exceeding the policy statements range but not exceeding the statutory maximum have been upheld as a matter of routine and are not plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Warren, </em>720 F.3d 321, 332-33 (5th Cir.2013). In this case, the sentencing court listened to Sanchez\u2019s arguments concerning his drug addiction but considered his criminal history, the fact that he received a below-guidelines sentence for his drug conviction, and the fact that he nevertheless, upon his release from prison, quickly violated the terms of his supervised release. A defendant\u2019s history and characteristics are proper factors for a court\u2019s consideration in imposing a revocation sentence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1); \u00a7 3583(e). Accordingly, Sanchez\u2019s revocation sentence was not plainly unreasonable. <em>See Miller, </em>634 F.3d at 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b499-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
