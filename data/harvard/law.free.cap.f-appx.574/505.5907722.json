The district court granted the Defendants\u2019 motion, and the Plaintiffs have now appealed. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b532-16\">In Jackson County, Mississippi (\u201cthe County\u201d), bail agents that have been approved to write bail bonds are maintained and displayed on a list (\u201cthe List\u201d). The Plaintiffs are bail agents that issue bail bonds through Pugh Bonding Company. They allege that the Gustas were added to the List in 2008 and that Pugh was added in 2010. After Sheriff Byrd removed the Plaintiffs from the List in February 2012, the Plaintiffs filed their complaint against the Defendants in October 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-17\">Before they are added to the List, bail agents must first be approved by satisfying certain criteria set forth in documents provided to the agents, such as the Official Agreement for Bonding Companies and Bonding Company Rules and Regulations. Once approved, bail agents must follow certain \u201cdirectives\u201d issued by Sheriff Byrd, such as not being disruptive towards employees, arrestees, or other bail agents in the Adult Detention Center (\u201cADC\u201d). Along with these documents and directives, an additional rule requires the bail agents to charge arrestees a minimum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>bond premium of ten percent of the bond. Possessing the sole authority to remove bail agents from the List, Sheriff Byrd relies on the advice of ADC employees to determine whether a bail agent should be removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">In early 2012, Sheriff Byrd received multiple complaints from both ADC employees and other bail agents that the Gustas were violating ADC rules, allegedly undercutting other bail agents by not adhering to the ten-percent bond-premium rule and being disruptive towards other bail agents. Along with these complaints, Sheriff Byrd was told that the Gustas had lost their bail agent\u2019s licenses while working for another bail bonding company. With this information before him, Sheriff Byrd decided to remove the Plaintiffs from the List.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Donald Pugh claimed that Sheriff Byrd gave no explanation for the Plaintiffs\u2019 removal from the List. Sheriff Byrd also did not respond to a letter, dated March 24, 2012, that requested an explanation for the removal. The Plaintiffs also alleged that, after reaching the County\u2019s undersheriff by telephone, they were informed that the County was not accepting any more bail agents on the List for the time being.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Later that year, the Plaintiffs filed their complaint, claiming that Sheriff Byrd, motivated by race, removed them from the List without prior notice or a hearing, in violation of their rights to due process and equal protection.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition to these constitutional claims, the Plaintiffs also alleged that Sheriff Byrd and the County tortiously interfered with the Plaintiffs\u2019 business relations, in violation of Mississippi law. The Plaintiffs sought a declaration that the Defendants\u2019 removal of the Plaintiffs from the List was in violation of the federal constitution and Mississippi law, an injunction prohibiting the Defendants from refusing to allow the Plaintiffs to underwrite or solicit bail bonds in Jackson County, and an award of attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and expenses related to the lawsuit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">The Defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that both federal and Mississippi courts have determined that the writing of bail bonds does not give rise to a property interest protected under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Defendants also contended that the Plaintiffs lacked evidentiary support for their equal protection claim and offered evidence that six out of the seventeen currently authorized bonding companies are owned by African-Americans. Lastly, the Defendants claimed that Mississippi tort law precludes intentional tort claims against municipal entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">In response to the Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the Plaintiffs asserted that the Plaintiffs and the Defendants formed a contract to write bonds in the County and that, under Mississippi law, this contract created a protected property interest. The Plaintiffs also argued that Sheriff Byrd, a white male, relied on allegedly false accusations made by white bail agents as a pretextual motivation for removing the Plaintiffs from the List. Furthermore, the Plaintiffs alleged that Sheriff Byrd removed the Plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>from the list for the same bond-payment practices that other white bondsmen utilized, evincing disparate treatment and a discriminatory intent on the part of Sheriff Byrd. The Plaintiffs reasserted their claim that the Defendants tortiously interfered with the Plaintiffs\u2019 business relations without addressing any of the Defendants\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\u201cWe review de novo a district court\u2019s award of summary judgment, applying the same standard as the district court.\u201d <em>Trinity Universal Ins. Co. v. Emp\u2019rs Mut. Cas. Co., </em>592 F.3d 687, 690 (5th Cir.2010). \u201cThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). \u201cA genuine issue of material fact exists when the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Gates v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Protective &amp; Regulatory Servs., </em>537 F.3d 404, 417 (5th Cir. 2008). When moving for summary judgment, \u201cthe burden on the moving party may be discharged by \u2018showing\u2019 \u2014 that is, pointing out to the district court \u2014 that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). After the moving party does so, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to \u201cset out the specific facts in the record showing that a genuine issue exists.\u201d <em>Kelley v. Price-Macemon, Inc., </em>992 F.2d 1408, 1413 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ab-\">I. Due Process Claim</p>\n<p id=\"ANQ\">A. Property Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The Plaintiffs contend that when Sheriff Byrd removed them from the List, they were deprived, without notice or hearing, of a constitutionally protected property interest. The Fourteenth Amendment provides that \u201c[n]o State shall ... deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. \u201cTo bring a procedural due process claim ..., a plaintiff must first identify a protected life, liberty or property interest and then prove that governmental action resulted in a deprivation of that interest.\u201d <em>Baldwin v. Daniels, </em>250 F.3d 943, 946 (5th Cir.2001). The Plaintiffs\u2019 action relies on the notion that the ability to write bail bonds is a constitutionally protectable property interest. However, both federal and Mississippi law provide that, because the Mississippi bail-bond statutes give discretion to an authorizing officer, bond writing is not a property interest protected under the Fourteenth Amendment. Therefore, the Plaintiffs\u2019 procedural due process claim cannot succeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">The relevant Mississippi bail-bond statute provides that \u201c[the sheriff] <em>may </em>take bonds, with good and sufficient sureties, of any person whom he may arrest with or without a warrant for any felony that is bailable as a matter of law.\u201d Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 19-25-67 (emphasis added); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 21-23-8. Both federal and Mississippi courts have held that the inclusion of the word \u201cmay\u201d in the statute renders it discretionary. <em>See Baldwin, </em>250 F.3d at 946 (\u201cMississippi law expressly leaves the approval of tendered bonds to the discretion of the responsible officer.\u201d (citing Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 21-23-8)); <em>Tunica Cnty. v. Hampton Co. Nat. Sur., L.L.C., </em>27 So.3d 1128, 1134 (Miss.2009) (\u201cWe find that this language confers limited discretion to the sheriff, as he <em>may </em>take bonds.\u201d (citing Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 19-25-67)); <em>see also Neuwirth v. La. State Bd. of Dentistry, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>845 F.2d 553, 557 (5th Cir.1988) (\u201cUse of the word \u2018may1 as opposed to mandatory language such as \u2018shall\u2019 has been found to indicate a legislature\u2019s intention to bestow discretion on the state agency charged to apply the statute.\u201d). \u201cDiscretionary statutes do not give rise to constitutionally protectable interests.\u201d <em>Baldwin, </em>250 F.3d at 946 (citing <em>Neuwirth, </em>845 F.2d at 557). Because authorizing officers, through the Mississippi bail-bond statute, are granted discretion in deciding whether to allow an agent to write bail bonds, Mississippi law \u201cgives rise to no constitutionally protecta-ble interests enforceable by [the Plaintiffs].\u201d <em>Neuwirth, </em>845 F.2d at 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Nevertheless, the Plaintiffs allege that the Plaintiffs and the Defendants formed an implied contractual agreement to write bonds in the County, thus giving rise to a constitutionally protected property interest in writing bonds. The Plaintiffs rely on <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972), to support their argument. In that case, the Supreme Court concluded that a professor\u2019s \u201c \u2018property\u2019 interest in employment at [a university] was created and defined by the terms of his appointment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 578, 92 S.Ct. 2701. However, in <em>Roth, </em>the professor\u2019s property interest was circumscribed by the terms of his appointment, which failed to \u201cprovide for contract renewal absent \u2018sufficient cause\u20191\u201d and \u201cmade no provision for renewal whatsoever.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the appointment \u201csecured absolutely no interest in re-employment for the next year.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Roth </em>Court further explained that for a constitutionally protected property interest to exist, a person \u201cmust have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701. In this case, the Plaintiffs have failed to offer any evidence that they had a contract with the Defendants to write bail bonds in the County. And .to the extent that the Plaintiffs seek to rely on either the Official Agreement for Bonding Companies or the Bonding Company Rules and Regulations, which set forth the criteria bail agents must satisfy in order to appear on the List, there is no evidence that either document limits the discretion Mississippi law affords Sheriff Byrd. Accordingly, the Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether they have a constitutionally protected property interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">B. Liberty Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">The Plaintiffs also argue that they have a liberty interest in their reputation and choice of occupation that was violated when Sheriff Byrd allegedly falsely accused the Plaintiffs of writing bonds without a license. Sheriff Byrd, however, did not accuse the Plaintiffs of writing bonds without a license. Rather, as his deposition testimony reveals, he explained that others had told him that the Plaintiffs had lost their license and that he factored this into his decision to remove the Plaintiffs from the List. The Plaintiffs have failed to identify any evidence in the record that Sheriff Byrd accused the Plaintiffs of writing bonds without a license or, as they allege, disseminated this accusation to anyone. Although the fact of the Plaintiffs\u2019 removal from the List may have been publicized, the Plaintiffs have failed to point to any record evidence that the reasons for the removal were also publicized. Accordingly, the Plaintiffs have also failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether they have a constitutionally protected liberty interest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>II. Equal Protection Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">To state a claim for an equal protection violation, the \u201cplaintiff must either allege that (a) a state actor intentionally discriminated against [him] because of membership in a protected class or (b) he has been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment.\u201d <em>Gibson v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Ins.-Div. of Workers\u2019 Comp., </em>700 F.3d 227, 238 (5th Cir.2012) (alteration in original) (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). With respect to the first component, the Plaintiffs alleged several instances in which the County purportedly treated them differently from \u201csimilarly situated individuals.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the Plaintiffs have met their burden of demonstrating a genuine dispute of material fact with respect to disparate treatment, they have not offered any evidence that the Defendants intended to discriminate against the Plaintiffs based on the Plaintiffs\u2019 race. Instead, the Plaintiffs contend that the alleged disparate treatment <em>is </em>evidence of discriminatory intent. This argument is conclusory and is insufficient to satisfy their burden of demonstrating a genuine issue of material fact regarding discriminatory intent and to rebut the Defendants\u2019 assertion in their motion for summary judgment that the Plaintiffs lacked evidence of discriminatory intent. <em>Clark v. Owens, </em>371 Fed.Appx. 553, 554 (5th Cir. 2010) (unpublished) (per curiam) (\u201c[C]on-clusory assertions that [one] was treated differently than other similarly situated [persons] are insufficient to state an equal protection claim.\u201d) (citing <em>Brinkmann v. Johnston, </em>793 F.2d 111, 113 (5th Cir.1986)); <em>VRV Dev. L.P. v. Mid-Continent Cas. Co., </em>630 F.3d 451, 455 (5th Cir.2011) (\u201c[A] party cannot defeat summary judgment with conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated assertions.\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that summary judgment was warranted in favor of the Defendants on the Plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">III. Tortious Interference with Business Relations Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Under the Mississippi Tort Claims Act (\u201cthe MTCA\u201d), governmental entities are immune from suit for torts committed by those entities or their employees. Miss. Code ANN. \u00a7 11-46-3. Although this immunity is waived for tort claims based on injuries caused by governmental entities or their employees in the course and scope of their employment, the waiver does not extend to injuries caused by conduct constituting, <em>inter alia, </em>malice. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 11-46-5. The Mississippi Supreme Court has held that \u201c[t]ortious interference with business relations and contracts requires proof of malice as an essential element.\u201d <em>Zumwalt v. Jones Cnty. Bd. of Supervisors, </em>19 So.3d 672, 688 (Miss.2009). \u201cTherefore, the MTCA does not apply to [tortious interference with business relations], and any legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>action against a governmental employee for these intentional torts must necessarily proceed against him or her as an individual.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The Plaintiffs have not named Sheriff Byrd in his individual capacity in this suit. Rather, they have sued him in his official capacity. When an employee of a governmental entity is sued in his or her official capacity, this \u201crepresent[s] only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent.\u201d <em>Kentucky v. Graham, </em>473 U.S. 159, 165, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985) (internal quotations marks omitted). Because the MTCA precludes tortious-inter-ferenee-with-business-relations suits against governmental entities, and no individual was named in the suit here, summary judgment in favor of the Defendants on this claim was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">IV. Liability of Jackson County</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">For Jackson County to be held liable under \u00a7 1983, there must be \u201cproof of three elements: a policymaker; an official policy; and a violation of constitutional rights whose \u2018moving force\u2019 is the policy or custom.\u201d <em>Piotrowski v. City of Houston, </em>237 F.3d 567, 578 (5th Cir.2001). Because the writing of bail bonds does not give rise to a constitutionally protected interest, the third element, violation of a constitutional right, is lacking, thus barring the County from being held liable under \u00a7 1983 for any constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b532-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b533-8\">. The Plaintiffs also claimed that Sheriff Byrd\u2019s actions abridged their privileges or immunities as citizens of the United States, as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Because the Plaintiffs have not raised their privileges-or-immunities argument on appeal, we do not discuss it further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b533-12\">. Because we affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that the Defendants are entitled to summary judgment, the Plaintiffs\u2019 claim for attorney fees fails as a matter of law. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b) (2012) (\u201d[T]he court[] ... may allow the <em>prevailing party </em>[ ] ... a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u201d in an action to enforce 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b535-6\">. For the first time on appeal, the Plaintiffs assert that they have a liberty interest that was violated when Sheriff Byrd falsely accused them of violating section 83-39-25 of the Mississippi Code, which requires bond agents to charge a ten-percent premium on all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>bonds written. \u201cOur inquiry, however, is limited to the summary judgment record and the plaintiffs may not advance on appeal new theories or raise new issues not properly before the district court to obtain reversal of the summary judgment.\u201d <em>Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1071 n. 1 (5th Cir.1994). Because the Plaintiffs did not advance this theory below, it was not properly before the district court and will not be considered on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b536-9\">. For instance, after Percy Gusta was ordered out of the ADC, A. Sonshine Bonding Company, purportedly composed entirely of white employees, was subsequently allowed to enter the ADC and write bonds, despite Sonshine\u2019s prior removal from the List. Also, the Plaintiffs claim that they were not allowed by Sheriff Byrd to use a property lien to secure a bond, a practice allegedly regularly practiced by \"white bonding companies,\u201d such as A. Sonshine and Lee Bonding Company.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
