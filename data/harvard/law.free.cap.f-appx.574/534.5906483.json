After an unsuccessful appeal and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motions, Villa moved the district court to correct a purported clerical error under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36. Villa identified two errors: (1) the Government\u2019s notice of enhancement erroneously indicated that he had two separate felony drug convictions, and (2) in an order denying \u00a7 2255 relief, the district court incorrectly stated that his sentence had been enhanced by his prior convictions. The district court denied the motion as being without merit. The district court denied leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-19\">Rule 36 provides that the district court \u201cmay at any time correct a clerical error in a judgment, order, or other part of the record, or correct an error in the record arising from oversight or omission.\u201d Fed.R. Crim.P. 36. A clerical error occurs when the court intends to do one thing, but through clerical mistake or oversight does another. <em>United States v. Buendia-Rangel, </em>553 F.3d 378, 379 (5th Cir.2008). The \u201cerrors\u201d identified by Villa are not clerical errors, and he has shown no error by the district court. His appeal is without merit. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his IFP motion is denied and his appeal is dismissed. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 5TH CIR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-20\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b560-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
