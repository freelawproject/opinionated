By the third clause he gave to his wife one-third of the net income of his estate, and the use of his household furniture, during widowhood. By the fourth clause he directed his executers to let or lease the real estate, keeping the buildings insured and in good tenantable order during his wife\u2019s widowhood; and in case he should survive her, the executors were directed after his demise, to dispose of all bis estate, both real and personal, at public or private sale, within six months after his demise, giving deeds for the real estate.

If the fee passed to the sons or heirs of Samuel Dunshee, did the share, interest and estate of John Dunshee, one of said sons and heirs in said premises, pass under the said John\u2019s will to his executors, to his widow Catherine, or to his children therein named ?</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b587-9\"><em>George S. </em>and <em>John M. Stitt, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-10\">I. Under the will of Samuel Dunshee, the executors took all his estate, real and personal, with a power to dispose of, sell the same, and convert the same into money. 1. The power of sale is expressly given in the second and fourth clauses. The second clause is a devise to the executors of his property, \u201cto be disposed of\u201d in a certain way; and by the fourth clause, after. his decease, if he should survive his wife, they are directed to sell the real1 and personal estate. And in the seventh clause the executors are directed to distribute the balance of his estate in their hands \u201c equally to\u201d his four sons. The disposition intended in the second clause is not merely to pay funeral expenses and his debts, but must be construed to mean a disposition or sale and conversion into money to pay funeral expenses, debts, to pay the legacies in the fifth and sixth clauses, and distribute and divide the balance as provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>in the seventh clause. The fourth clause is a direction to lease and withhold a sale during his wife\u2019s widowhood, if she should survive him; and if he should survive her, he directs them to sell within six months after his death. They are directed to sell within that six months. Their failure to sell within six months does not destroy their power of sale. Their power of sale is not conditioned upon its being performed within that six months. 2. The distribution provided in the seventh clause could not be , made unless the estate should be converted into money, and a balance adjusted by the addition to the balance of the bond held against John, and the note against William K. A sale was necessary in order to carry out the provisions of the will. The will of Samuel Dunshee makes a clear, absolute devise of all his property to his executors in trust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-5\">(1.) To pay debts. (2.) To pay one third of the net income to the widow during her widowhood. (3.) To pay certain legacies. (4.) To divide the balance in their hands, with the addition thereto of the bond of John, and the note of William K.; among his four sons, in the way marked out in the seventh clause. <em>(Meakings </em>v. <em>Cromwell, 5 N. Y. Rep. </em>136.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-7\">II. The will of John Dunshee gives to his wife his interest in his father\u2019s estate. The sixth clause is void, because it attempts to create a remainder, after giving his wife the whole estate, and allowing her to use and consume the same. It expressly provides that what the widow shall leave of the estate shall go to his children. This is void. (1 <em>Jarman on Wills, </em>332.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-8\">III. It must therefore follow : 1. That the executors of Samuel Dunshee\u2019s will have full power to convey the land in question ; or, 2. If they have not, his three surviving sons and the widow of John Dunshee can convey his property to the defendant, and thereby give him a good and valid title thereto.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number><em>Joseph Q. Levi, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-5\">I. On the death of Samuel Dunshee, the fee vested, notwithstanding the will, in his heirs at law. 1. The testator obviously intended to pass the fee to his executors in trust, mainly for the benefit of the widow, during her widowhood. 2. The only power of sale contained in the will is a contingent one, dependent upon an, event which never happened, viz., \u201cin case I survive her,\u201d and limited in its exercise to a stated period of time, viz., \u201c within six months after my demise,\u201d which has long since passed. Even had the power not been contingent, the failure of the executors to exercise it within the period limited by the will, is fatal, and they cannot give a good title. <em>(Richardson </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>29 <em>Barb. </em>222.) 3. No other disposition of the real estate is made. The direction in the seventh clause to distribute his estate to his sons, obviously refers to personal property, the proceeds of sales of real estate. 4. The power of sale thus being inefficient and inoperative, and no other devise made of the real estate, it passed to the heirs at law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-6\">EE. It was evidently the intention of John Dunshee, in his will, to give his wife only a life estate, and his four children therein named, a vested remainder in fee. 1. This hypothesis is consistent with the reading of every part of the will, <em>(a.) </em>In the second clause he gives her certain specific personal property. (6.) By the third clause he gives her the use and enjoyment \u201c during her life\u201d of certain other specific personal property. (e.) The fourth clause directs that upon her decease \u201c the said articles or so much as shall remain thereof, shall be divided equally among my children,\u201d by name, <em>(d.) </em>By the fifth clause he gives her all his interest in his father\u2019s estate, &amp;c., and he charges his executors, if necessary, \u201cand not detrimental to the interests of my heirs named herein, to enforce the collection of whatever may be due to me from said estate, and to dispose of the same as herein directed.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>(e.) The sixth clause proceeds: \u201c And at the decease of my said wife, I direct that said property, or the amount collected thereon, or so much thereof as shall be then remaining in the possession or under the control of my said wife, shall be divided equally among my said children,\u201d by name. (/.) The mind of the testator was evidently bent upon the ultimate possession by his children of his whole estate. If he had intended to give the whole to his wife, he would not have been so solicitous about the' equal division among his children by name; and he negatively forbids the enforcing of the collection of the very property in question, left in the, first instance to the wife, if the same should be \u201c detrimental to the interests of my heirs named herein,\u201d showing that the interests of his wife were subordinate in his mind to those of his children. 2. This intention is further manifest from the similarity of the fifth and sixth clauses (which affect the real estate) to the second, third and fourth clauses (which relate only to personal property.) The fifth clause is obviously intended to be .uniform with the third, and it is so, lacking only the important words, \u201cthe use and enjoyment during her life.\u201d The court may, and will supply these words in the second line of the fifth clause, which wotild thereby fix the extent and duration of the wife\u2019s interest in the real estate as the same words in the third clause do in the personal property. 3. This intention is still further manifest by the distinction in the will between perishable and imperishable property. <em>(a.) </em>The wife is not to have the absolute disposal of even all the personal property. (6.) The second clause gives her all the perishable personal property. (&lt;?.) Then comes a distinct clause giving her only \u201cthe use and enjoyment during her life\u201d of all the imperishable personal property, <em>(d.) </em>The words \u201c or so much as shall remain thereof,\u201d in the fourth clause, obviously refer only to the perishable property bequeathed in the second clause. (e.) The same distinction is intended to be made in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>sixth clause. 4. It is a rule in the construction of wills, particularly of those inartificially and obscurely drawn, to advert, in order to discover the intention of the testator, to his situation at the time of making the will, as to the number of his children, the different kinds of property of which he was seised, &amp;e. (6 <em>Cruise\u2019s Dig. </em>158.) Applying this rule to the case in point, what do we find ? Taking John Dunshee\u2019s will by itself, it certainly does not look like an intended will of real estate. (1.) The word <em>devise </em>is not used. (2.) The fifth and sixth clauses would read equally well for a bequest exclusively of personal property. Taking the dates, and reading the two wills together, it is evident that John Dunshee, in his own will, did not have real estate in his mind. <em>Prima facie, </em>his father had provided for an equitable conversion of all his real into personal estate, and a division of the proceeds among his sons. This division was to be made on the mother\u2019s death. She had died but a few years previous, and the real estate was wholly or partly unsold. If he had meant real estate, he would not have spoken of \u201c enforcing the collection of whatever might be due to him,\u201d or have referred to such estate as \u201cthe amount collected thereon, or so much thereof as shall be then remaining.\u201d These last words refer only to money\u2014to the proceeds of sales of his father\u2019s land\u2014not to the land itself. <em>(Lynes </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>33 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>558.) 5. An intent to exclude the heir must be clear and manifest. And that intent must be collected from the words used, and not from conjecture. It is the policy of the law, (after providing for the widow\u2019s dower,) as to the bulk of the estate, and as between the widow and the children or heirs, to favor the latter. They should not be excluded from their father\u2019s estate unless the intent so to exclude them is clear and beyond doubt. The provisions of the Eevised Statutes declaring the rights of after-born unprovided issue are an instance of this. <em>(See Willes, </em>141; 3 <em>T. R. </em>83; 2 <em>Bos. &amp; P. </em>247; 5 <em>Abb. Dig. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>\u201c <em>Will;\u201d Doe </em>v. <em>Dring, </em>2 <em>Mau. &amp; S. </em>448; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, 2 D. &amp; E. </em>209; 33 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>558, <em>supra, and cases there cited.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-5\">III. But apart from the question of intent, the will itself follows the principles herein enunciated. 1. There is no particular ambiguity; it agrees in all its parts. 2. The sixth clause should be read: \u201c And at the decease of my said wife, I direct that said property * * * shall be divided equally,\u201d &amp;c., leaving out the intermediate words, which obviously refer only to perishable or personal property. <em>(Pond </em>v. <em>Bergh, </em>10 <em>Paige, </em>140.) 3. A devise to a person in language which would ordinarily convey the whole estate, and a subsequent provision that upon a contingent event the estate thus given shall go to another person, are. not repugnant.
