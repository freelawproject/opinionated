Spell, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtV\">This charge was erroneous because it ignored the issue or question as to whether or not the emission of steam in the manner and in the volume and at the time that it was emitted, if at all, constituted negligence; if steam was emitted from the engine at such a time, or in such a manner, or in such volume, as, under the circumstances, to make the emission of the same at that time, or in that manner, or in that volume, negligence, even though the engineer or other employe did not know of the presence or perilous position of plaintiff\u2019s wife, the defendant was liable for the injuries directly and proximately resulting therefrom. Missouri, K. &amp; T. Ry. Co. of Texas v. Belew, 22 Texas Civ. App., 264; St. Louis S. W. Ry. Co. of Texas v. Moore, 107 S. W., 658; Houston &amp; T. C. Ry. Co. v. Beard, 42 Texas Civ. App., 427; Elliot on Railroads, secs. 1179f, 1264.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-5\">The charge was erroneous because it assumed that the sudden emission of the steam, if such there was, was not negligence unless the defendant\u2019s operatives actually- saw plaintiff\u2019s wife before the emission of the same; the issue as to whether or not this was negligence was raised by the pleadings and the evidence, and it was a question for the jury to determine.

It is alleged that when the train reached the crossing the engineer negligently caused steam to escape from the engine, causing a loud and unusual noise, which frightened the horse and caused it to run away, and injure Mrs. Boesch.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\u201cThe defendant plead a general denial and contributory negligence on the part of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\u201cA trial resulted in a verdict and judgment for the railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\u201cIt seems the engine passed over the crossing, going west, and stopped and then immediately began backing east. There is no controversy that the engine in crossing west made more noise than was customary and necessary in the operation of trains, but there was a sharp conflict whether the horse became frightened and ran from the sight and noise of the engine when it first reached the crossing going west, or. when it backed east at which time appellant\u2019s witnesses claim the engine emitted steam.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">\u201cUpon the question of the care devolving upon the railroad under the circumstances the court gave a special charge requested by the railroad, as follows: \u2018Notwithstanding you find and believe from the evidence that the engine of the defendant did emit steam and frighten the horse which was being driven by Mrs. Boesch at the time and place alleged in plaintiff\u2019s petition, yet, if you further believe that the engineer in charge of said engine did not see plaintiff and her companion in the buggy south of the defendant\u2019s track at \u25a0 the crossing of said track on Colorado Street in the town of Whitney as shown by the evidence, and that the fireman or other servant or employes of defendant on said engine at the said time and place did not discover the perilous position of plaintiff (wife) and the other occupants of the buggy in question, if you find their position was perilous, in time to have informed or advised the engineer in charge of such engine of their said position in time for such engineer by the use of the means at hand to have prevented the accident in question, then and in such event the plaintiff can not recover in this case and you will return a verdict for defendant.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">We think the charge a correct statement of the law but for the fact that in running west the train made \u201can unnecessary and unusual noise.\u201d To frighten a horse by necessary and usual noise of running a train, when the fact of his being frightened is not discovered by the servants of the railroad company in charge of the train is one thing. To frighten a horse by an unusual and unnecessary noise is another. It is the right of the servants of a railroad company to move their trains with the usual and necessary noises, without keeping a lookout for frightened teams along the track. It was so held in the case of Hargis v. St. Louis, A. &amp; T. Ry. Co., 75 Texas, 19. But where they undertake to make an unusual and unnecessary noise at a crossing of a public road or street, they should exercise circumspection and see that there are no teams in position to be frightened, by such unusual sounds. The charge of the court excludes this idea and for that reason the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>The opinion o\u00ed the Court of Civil Appeals lays it down that it is the duty of the servants of a railroad company to keep a lookout for frightened horses at all times along the track of the railroad, which is in conflict with the rule announced in the Hargis case above cited. For this reason we granted the writ of error, though it is a reversed and remanded case.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded with instructions to proceed in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
