W. Perkins on four promissory notes secured by mortgage given upon certain machinery, which the petition describes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-12\">\u201cOne Fo. 4 medium rusher unmounted lefthand sawmill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-13\">One 3-saw Port Huron edger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-14\">One 56-inch solid tooth saw.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-15\">One 60-ft. 12-inch 5-ply endless canvass drive belt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-16\">One 50-ft. 7-inch 4-ply cut canvass belt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-17\">One 58-inch solid tooth saw.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-18\">One black Percheron stallion, 5 yrs. old, named \u201cFegro.\u201d Weight 1900 lbs.

(Full-blood, registered, imported horse.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-32\">S. W. Perkins appeared and answered, acknowledging his indebtedness to the company and its right of foreclosure on the property named in the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-33\">John C. McGregor, A. F. Vendordose and F. Y. Grubbs were made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>defendants, it being charged that they were in possession of the property. Vendordose and Grubbs disclaimed any interest in the property, except that they were holding under a rental contract with McGregor, who claimed the property by right of purchase from Perkins. McGregor made defense in the case which was tried before the judge without a jury, and after a full hearing the judge entered judgment in favor of the company against Perkins for the amount' of the notes sued on with interest and attorney\u2019s fees, and against McGregor and the other defendants, foreclosing the lien of the mortgage upon the property described. The judgment as entered described the property as it was set out in the body of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\">After the court adjourned plaintiff called upon the clerk to issue an order of sale upon the judgment, including the property as described in the \u201cExhibit A\u201d attached to the petition, which the clerk refused to do, and thereupon the company instituted this suit for the purpose of correcting the said judgment, making the defendants in the said judgment' parties thereto\u2014the action was defended by Mc-Gregor. It was alleged in the petition that the court had actually given judgment for the foreclosure of the mortgage upon the property as described in the mortgage, but that the attorney of the company in drawing the decree to be entered by the clerk by mistake omitted a part of the articles mentioned in the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">The trial of this case was had before the judge without a jury, it being the. same judge that tried the ease in the first instance, and, upon a hearing of the parties, the court adjudged that the entry of the former judgment be corrected so as to foreclose the lien of. the mortgage upon the property described in the \u201cExhibit A\u201d attached to the petition, and it was so entered. McGregor appealed to the Court of Civil Appeals, which reversed the judgment of the trial court and rendered judgment for McGregor, denying the correction sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The trial judge made and filed the following conclusions of fact:</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">\u201c5. Upon the original Rearing herein, on the 16th day of January, A. D. 1908, the court overruled the exceptions of the defendant Mc-Gregor to plaintiff\u2019s petition and gave judgment for the plaintiff for the notes sued for, interest and attorney\u2019s fees, and for a foreclosure of its mortgage, lien on the property described in plaintiff\u2019s mortgage which was attached to and made a part of plaintiff\u2019s original petition filed in this court on the 30th day of December, A. D. 1907, as above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">\u201c6. The entry made by the court on his docket after a full hearing of the pleadings, evidence and argument of counsel on the said 16th day of January, A. D. 1908, was as follows, to wit: \u2018January 16, 1908. Parties ready for trial. Defendant McGregor\u2019s exceptions' to plaintiff\u2019s petition overruled, to which defendant McGregor excepts. This cause was heard and judgment rendered for plaintiff for amount of notes sued on, principal and interest, and ten percent on amount recovered as attorney\u2019s fees, and foreclosure of the mortgage lien on the property described, to which judgment defendant McGregor excepts.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">\u201c7. The court in said judgment of foreclosure, as actually ren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>dered by the court, intended to foreclose and did in fact foreclose plaintiff\u2019s mortgage lien on the Port Huron 26-horsepower steam traction engine complete, with belts and all fixtures and appendages belonging to the same and the water tank mounted on trucks\u2014the said engine and water tank being specifically described in the mortgage which was made a part of plaintiff\u2019s original petition and offered in evidence by the plaintiff on the said 16th day of January, A. D. 1908.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\">The Court of Civil Appeals held that the plaintiff\u2019s petition was not sufficient to authorize a judgment foreclosing the lien upon the articles enumerated in the mortgage and attached to the petition as \u201cExhibit A,\u201d which were omitted from the petition. In this we think the Honorable Court of Civil Appeals committed error. It is true that an exhibit can not be used for the purpose of setting out the cause of action upon which the plaintiff seeks to recover, but it is not correct to say that it can not aid the allegations of the petition so as to make certain that which otherwise would be indefinite in the petition. Burks v. Watson, 48 Texas, 107; Texas &amp; St. Louis Ry. Co. v. Ross, 62 Texas, 447; Milliken v. Callahan County, 69 Texas, 205. In the first case cited above the court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">\u201cThe petition does not undertake to set out the terms of this agreement, but to state the real facts relating to the sale of the land, and makes an exhibit of the agreement and conveyance, as consistent with and in explanation of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\u201cIn this mode of pleading the exhibits may perform a very important office; for the use and purpose of an exhibit is to set forth in detail that which is alleged in more general terms, or to embody in the record such facts as will, in legal effect, amount to the facts as alleged in the petition, or to aid the allegations of a petition in fixing more accurately and more definitely their import, but not to supply entirely the omission of allegations necessary to present a good cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">\u201cAn exhibit to the petition, therefore, may be said to be made in aid of or in elucidation of allegations; but it does not, by itself, constitute allegations upon which issues may be formed irrespective of the allegations made in relation to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The first case is approved in the others and neither has been overruled. In this case the allegations were sufficient to show a cause of action, the only defect in the petition being that it did not set out all of the articles embraced in the mortgage. For this purpose the \u201cExhibit A\u201d was properly considered by the trial court as a part of the petition. In the last case cited above the bond sued upon was made an exhibit to the petition which contained the allegation that each and all of the defendants bound themselves, but the name of one was omitted from the body of the petition. This court held the petition to be good, saying:</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">\u201cThe allegation then is that all and each of said defendants bound themselves, etc. The bond itself is made an exhibit to the petition, and must therefore be taken .in aid and explanation of its allegations. The name of Cutbirth appears to the bond with the other defendants, clearly showing that by the \u2018said defendants,\u2019 who were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>bound by the instrument, was meant all of those who were sued, including Cutbirth. This is the proper office of an exhibit as is declared by the rules and decision's of this court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\">It is unnecessary to decide whether at a succeeding term of a court the judge may correct the record of a judgment entered during a former term from his recollection only, for in this case the entry made by the judge on his docket as copied above very distinctly shows that the lien of the mortgage was foreclosed upon the property described. This could have referred to no other description except that which was contained in the petition, including the \u201cExhibit A,\u201d and was equivalent to saying that the foreclosure was had upon the property described in the mortgage. We are of opinion that the Honorable Court of Civil Appeals erred in holding that the court had no authority in the stated facts of this case to correct its former judgment and to enter a judgment upon its records conforming to the judgment actually pronounced by the judge. The judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals is reversed and the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">\n<em>Reversed and judgment of District Court affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
