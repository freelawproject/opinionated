The condition was to this effect: if, therefore, the said John Giles shall in all things touching his said office, conduct himself well and faithfully, as a constable ought by the laws of this State, and the United States, to do, and pay forward all moneys according to law, that may come into his hands by virtue of his said office, and all other moneys that he may be accountable for, as constable, and that without fraud and other delay, then, &amp;c. The defendants then aver that they went before the township committee to give the security required by the act of Assembly: that the bond and condition aforesaid were required and taken by the said township committee, <em>by eolor and under pretense </em>of the act of Assembly, and plead this special matter in bar, and allege the bond is void; to which the plaintiffs demur, joinder in demurrer and issue.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b120-5\"><em>Mr Ewing, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqk\">contended that this bond, being taken under the act of Assembly, the act ought to have been strictly pursued; that the township committee had, under color of law, extorted from the defendants, a bond containing a condition not required by law; that it was therefore void.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b120-6\"><em>Mr. L.

The committee, acting under the law, and by color and pretense thereof, require of him a bond, different in form and substance from that required by the law, exacting conditions to which the statute is a stranger; this bond, in my opinion, is void. The counsel for the plaintiffs, however, very truly says, that a bond may be good in part, and bad in part; and that the court will support the good, and reject the bad part. It must, however, be in those cases where the good can be separated from the bad; in this case, the good and bad are so blended and interwoven, that it is impossible to separate them. If there were a number of independent conditions, one of which was in conformity to the act, I incline to think, if the bond was voluntarily entered into, that the bad might be rejected, and the one made in conformity to the statute, supported. It makes no difference in this respect, whether the bond is taken under the statute, or at common law, unless the statute, like that of 23d Henry the 6th, contain negative words. It was on the construction of that statute, that Lord Hobebt made the observations attributed to him by Justice Twtsden \u2014 that the statute was like a tyrant \u2014 wherever it came, it made all void; but that the common [*] law was like a nursing father, that where it came, it only made void that which was bad, but preserved that which was good. The statute 23d Henry 6th, prescribes the form of bail bonds to be taken by sheriffs, and expressly enacts, that obligations taken in any other form, by color of their office, <em>shall he void. </em>Not so with the act authorizing the township committee to take bonds of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>stables; <em>yet, </em>in this case, the impossibility of separating the good from the bad, renders all void.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">By the <em>Court. </em>\u2014 Judgment for the defendants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A1r\">Cited in Comp v. <em>Allen, 7 Halst. 1, 16; Vroom </em>v. <em>Smith\u2019s Ex., 2 Gr 479.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b122-12\"> The authority for township committees to take bonds of constables, is derived from the 52d section of the act constituting courts for the trial of small causes. <em>Paterson, 323. </em>The condition of the bond required by the act is simply, \u201cfor the true and faithful performance of all the duties enjoined on him by this act,\u201d that is, the act constituting courts for the trial of small causes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b122-13\"> Vide <em>Rev. 644- </em>The form now is, \u201c shall truly and faithfully perform all the duties enjoined on him, as constable of said township.\u201d \u2014 Ed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
