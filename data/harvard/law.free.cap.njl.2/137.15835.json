First, that the action below was brought in the name of Francis Denny <em>&amp; </em>Co. Second, that no judgment was ever rendered on the part of the referees, but execution issued without judgment. The proceedings, for these reasons, were by the court set aside, and rendered null and void.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
