I take the great principle of the common law to be, that a witness cannot be compelled to answer a question, the answer to which, tends directly to dishonor and disgrace him : such is the benignity of the law. It is true, that there are in the English books some modern cases that run counter to this principle, and in accordance with the idea suggested by Col Ogden ; but as far as my recollection goes, they are modern decisions, and not law in this State; besides, in a still'later case, Lord Ellenborough hath gone directly against those cases, and adhered with great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>propriety, in my opinion, to the ancient law. There is an argument pending in the supreme court, grounded on an exception taken to my opinion on a question somewhat similar to the present, at the [305] Monmouth circuit, in October, 1804. But I shall adhere to this opinion until it is otherwise decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Question overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">A similar case was decided in the same manner at the Essex Oyer and Terminer, January, 1808.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AbkS\">Note. \u2014 Vide <em>Saund.
