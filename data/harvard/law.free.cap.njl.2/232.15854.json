The plaintiff in error, who was the plaintiff below, declared ag\u00e1inst the defendant below, on two bonds given by the defendant\u2019s testator, to which the defendant had pleaded <em>non est factwn, </em>and gave notice to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>produce on the trial of the cause, the probate of the will of the plaintiff\u2019s testator. [169] On the trial of [*] the cause, the execution of the bonds was admitted, when the defendant called on the plaintiff to produce the probate of the will of his testator \u2014 whereupon the plaintiff produced the probate of the will, made in the State of Yew York. On the insufficiency of this probate, the defendant moved for a nonsuit, on the ground that a probate, made out of the State of Yew Jersey, was wholly insufficient to enable an executor to maintain an action in the courts of this State; and the Court of Common Pleas being of that opinion, nonsuited the plaintiff. Whereupon the plaintiff took a bill of exception, and brought the present writ, and assigned this nonsuit as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b225-5\"><em>Mr. I.
