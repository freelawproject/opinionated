That even if this was to be considered as finding the defendant guilty on one of the offenses, which, however, he thought could not be, yet the judge had not designated [*] which offense the defendant was guilty of; and, therefore, a judgment could not be rendered against him for any particular or specific penalty. The court, being of that opinion, reversed the judgment.</p><p id=\"b264-4\">Other objections were urged against the judgment which it is unnecessary to enumerate.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
