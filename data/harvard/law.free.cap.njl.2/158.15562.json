On this verdict the justice rendered no judgment, but issued [*] execution. It appeared by the proceedings sent up by the justice that the real controversy between the parties was about the performance of a contract, respecting the grubbing and clearing a piece of road described in the state of demand; it was contended on the part of the plaintiff in <em>certiorari, </em>that the state of demand was insensible and insufficient; and that as no judgment had been rendered, execution could not legally be issued; and the court being of that opinion, ordered the proceedings before the justice, to be made null and void.</p><p id=\"b154-10\"><em>Read, </em>for plaintiff.</p><p label=\"1\">\n\n</p><p id=\"b154-16\"> See notes to last case. \u2014 Ed.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
