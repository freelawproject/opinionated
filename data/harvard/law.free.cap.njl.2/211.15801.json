Broad-well appealed to the common pleas, who confirmed the judgment of the justice, and now he removes the cause from the common pleas into this court. The state of demand exhibited to the justice, was for four dollars, for neglecting to work on the road two days, with a team of two horses. The judgment rendered to the justice, and confirmed by the common pleas, was as follows: \u2014 I give judgment for the plaintiff, two dollars and fifty cents debt, (being equal to two days\u2019 absence, of one horse team and plough,) and two dollars and thirty-nine cents costs. One error assigned for the reversal of this judgment was, that the act of [*] Assembly gave no such penalty as that for which judgment was rendered.</summary>\n<attorneys id=\"b204-5\"><em>Mr. Chetwood, </em>for the plaintiff in <em>certiorari,</em></attorneys>\n\n\n<opinion><p id=\"b203-16\">ON CERTIORARI.</p><p id=\"b203-17\">Judgment on a penal statute, must be on the entire penalty.</p><p id=\"Aq3F\">moved the</p><p id=\"AZ_J\">court to reverse the judgment for that cause.
