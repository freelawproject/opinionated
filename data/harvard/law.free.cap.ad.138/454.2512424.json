The plaintiff pleaded that since the discovery of the fraud he had not cohabited with the defendant. It was conceded on the record that the parties had cohabited together for six years, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>subsequent to tlieir marriage and that there was no issue, whereupon the Special Term dismissed the plaintiff because he had not pleaded facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and he appeals. I think that the Special Term erred.</p>\n<p id=\"A99\">In <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Reynolds </em>(3 Allen, 605), Bigelow, Ch. J., says that it has been contended by some writers, especially the commentators on the civil law, that chastity is a quality that lies at the foundation of the contract of marriage and constitutes, one of its essential elements,'citing Voet, 24, 2, 15, which see, and 1 Fraser\u2019s Domestic Delations, 231. Montesquieu in his Spirit of the Laws (23, 21) writes that since the time of TJlpian a freeman was forbidden to marry a woman who had led a disorderly life. - (See, too, 1 Bishop Marr., Div. &amp; Sep. \u00a7479 <em>et seq.) </em>But many decisions and many text writers have pronounced against annulment of marriage subsequent- to consummation on the ground of the false representation of the wife, previous to her marriage, that she was chaste. For examples, see <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Reynolds (supra); Carris </em>v. <em>Carris </em>(24 N. J. Eq. 516, 524); <em>Allen's Appeal </em>(99 Penn. St. 196); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(8 Oreg. 100); <em>Wier </em>v. <em>Still </em>(31 Iowa, 107); <em>Leavitt </em>v. <em>Leavitt.

Y. 472) says : \u201cWhile, then, it is true that marriage contracts are based upon considerations peculiar to themselves and that public policy is concerned with the regulation of the family relation, nevertheless, our law-considers marriage in no other light than as a civil contract. <em>(Kujek </em>v. <em>Goldman, </em>150 N. Y. 176.) The free and full consent, which is of the essence of all ordinary contracts, is expressly made by the statute necessary to the validity of the marriage contract. The minds of the parties must meet in one intention. It i-s a general rule that every misrepresentation of a material fact, made with the intention to induce another to enter into an agreement and without which he would not have done so, justifies the court in vacating the agreement. It is obvious that no one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>would obligate himself by a contract, if he knew that a material. representation, entering into the reason for his consent, was untrue., There is no valid reason for excepting the marriage contract from the general rule.\u201d And also declares, after quoting from and citing Code of Civil Procedure (\u00a7 1743, subd. 4, and \u00a7 1750) : \u201c This language is broad and warrants but the one reasonable-construction, that the fraud must be material, to that degree that, had it not been practiced, the party deceived would not have consented to the marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AG9\">I think, then, that under the authority of <em>Di Lorenzo's Case (supra) </em>the soundness of the proposition of the Special Term must be determined by answering the question whether, as matter of law such a false representation, <em>can </em>be material to that degree that, had it not been practiced, the party deceived would not have consented to the marriage. It may be said that in our civilization a man assumes that his proposed wife is chaste and that without reason he would hot pay her the insult of query as to her virtue. But I can conceive of a case where a man before consenting to a contract of marriage might -aslc such a question of the woman outright, and rely upon her. answer. Or the case at bar is an instance where the circumstances might compel some representation in explanation of them. It is quite true that such a representation is not as to the <em>essentialia </em>of the marriage contract, for previous chastity, is not a- necessary qualification for cohabitation or for the full discharge of the duties of <em>consortium. </em>But it seems to me that the question is whether such representation may not be as to a fact material to the consent of , the other party to make the contract. Cannot a m\u2019an regard chastity as an essential qualification of the woman he proposes to marry, and be unwilling to take ev\u00e9n: an Aspasia to his bed and board? In <em>Di Lorenzo's </em>case the misrepresentation was that a child .was the issue of the illicit relations of the parties. That representation could not strike at the <em>essentialia </em>of marriage, and yet the court-profiounced it material,saying: \u201cIn this case, the representation of the defendant was as to a fact, except f.or the truth of which the necessary consent of the plaintiff would not have been obtained to the marriage. It was designed to create a state of mind in the plaintiff, the operation of which would be to yield a consent to marry the defendant, in the belief that lie was rectifying a great wrong. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>The minds of the parties did not meet upon a common basis of operation. The artifice was such as to deceive \u00e1 reasonably prudent person and to appeal to his sense of honor and of duty. The plaintiff had a right to rely upon the defendant\u2019s statement of a fact, the truth of which was known to her and unknown to him, and he was under no obligation to verify a statement, to the truth of which she had pledged herself. It was a gross fraud and, upon reason,, as upon authority, I think it afforded a sufficient ground for a decree annulling the 'marriage contract.\u201d Thus we have the principle enundated that the materiality goes <em>to </em>the consent to the contract and need not strike at the capacity to make the contract and to perform it. A man is not presumed to contract for marriage simply upon the basis of physical ability of the woman for cohabitation, for <em>consortium </em>implies much more. And if a man consent to contract to marry a woman who falsely represents herself as chaste and yet marries her who has been unchaste, he may thereby be induced to agree to a contract which necessarily requires personal performance by one who is of a different <em>status </em>than he was led to believe. The bad character of the plaintiff or his or her lascivious conduct is a defense to a breach of promise action, <em>(Palmer </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>7 Wend. 142; 2 Pars. Cont. [8th ed.\u2018], bottom paging 69, citing authorities.) That author also says (p. 71): <em>\u201c </em>It has been said, also, that if a widow conceals her previous marriage, and Betrotlis herself as a virgin, this would be a fraud, and would avoid the contract. It is going quite far to consider this fact alone as constituting a fraud, but it could seldom occur but under circumstances which would probably determine the character of the concealment; and if this were fraudulent, it must of. course have the usual effect of fraud upon the contract; for if obtained by fraud, whatever that fraud may be, the contract is void.\u201d I cite this principle as bearing on the' question of materiality. Bigelow on Fraud (Vol. 1, p. 497) says: \u201c In the next place the representation must have been material ; that is, it must not only have induced the action taken, it must have been adequate to induce it by offering a motive sufficient to influence the conduct of a man of average intelligence and prudence. Still a party who, has effected his purpose through a misrepresentation cannot deny its materiality,\u201d citing case's. Parsons on Contracts (Vol. 2 [8th ed.], p. 895) writes: \u201c But, as before, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>must say that there is no positive standard by which to determine whether the.fraud- be thus material or not. .\u00a1Nor can- we give a better rule- for deciding the .question than this : if the fraud b\u00e9 such that, had' it not been practiced,'the contract would not have been made, or the transaction completed, then it is material to it; but if it be shown or made probable that the same thing would have been done by the parties, in the same way, if the fraud' had not been' practiced, it cannot be de\u00e9med material.\u201d (See, too, <em>Valton </em>v. <em>National Fund Life Assurance Co., </em>20 N. Y. 32, 37; <em>Canham </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>15 C. B. 597.) .If one would go so far as to say that a man yrould or would not be led to give or withhold consent to the contract of marriage ilpon the single consideration whether the woman, was chaste or unchaste, the answer is that it is not necessary that the false representation should be the sole inducement'. (Pom. Eq. Juris, [3d ed.], \u00a7 890; Kerr Fraud &amp; Mistake [1st Am. ed.],-74.)</p>\n<p id=\"Ae7\">I think, then, that such a misrepresentation can afford ground for the annulment of a marriage for'fraud because, as matter of law, it can be materiabupon the question of consent, which is essential to the contract of- marriage. To reach any other'conclusion is to say in effect that the fact that the woman, otherwise acceptable, is unchaste cannot be-sufficient motive for a man of average intelligence and prudence to refuse consent to marriage. This doctrine would put a Gyprian on.the marriage plane of a virgin, and makes no distinction in respect to virtue-as between a woman who had been a mistress and one who had been a wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">I cannot perceive that the question is- affected by the circumstance that the marriage was consummated; for- the sole relation, of tlie false representation, as viewed by -the law, is to the consent to contract of marriage, and the sole limitation to the action, as pointed out in <em>Di Lorenzo's Case (supra) </em>is voluntary cohabitation subs\u00e9r quent to the full knowledge of the facts. This court' must decide this question . upon- the law as. declared by our statute and as expounded by our highest court. That- court has well said in <em>Kujek </em>v. <em>Goldman </em>(150 N. Y. 182): \u201cWhile it is not agreeable to treat.a subject of sacred importance upon, this narrow basis; it is necessary to do so, for our law considers marriage in no other light than as a civil contract.\u201d My conclusion is .that the alleged false misrepresentation can be material in such \u00e1n action and, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>may be material in this action. There is nothing more to decide upon the record of this appeal. I advise that the judgment be reversed and that a new trial be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b519-5\">Thomas and High, JJ.,</author>\n<p id=\"Al1\">concurred, the former in separate memorandum ; Carr, J., read for a modification of the judgment and . affirmance, with whom Burr, J., concurred in separate memorandum.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b519-6\">Thomas, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AO0\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"A3Z\">The defendant, it must be assumed, represented that she, in the purity of wedlock, had given birth to her child, and thereby induced the plaintiff to enter into the contract of marriage. In fact, for eight years she had been the mistress of another, and in such offensive state became the mother of an illegitimate child. \u2022 Hence the plaintiff became the husband of an.unchaste woman, and the stepfather of a bastard, whereby his family life was tainted in its most intimate relations. Presumptively a man would abhor such marriage, not only on account of the personal society into which it would bring him and his offspring if such there should be, with the accompanying impairment or destruction of the sacred love and respect that justify marriage, but also on account of the obloquy and social ostracism that the connection upon exposure might entail. I can conceive of no more distressing affront to the sensibilities, nor more profound injury to the sanctity of the marriage relation; and where it is effected by actual fraudulent representation that the woman is pure and thechild legitimate, the court should not hesitate to relieve the person who has been led into the most inviolable of all personal contracts.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b519-9\">Carr, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFec\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">The plaintiff, after living with the defendant as his wife for six years, now asks that the marriage be annulled on the ground that she procured his consent th\u00e9reto by false and fraudulent representations ; that she was, at that time, the widow of one Manson, and that her child, then about six years old, was the offspring of her marriage with Manson, when in fact Manson and she, though living together, had never been married, and the child was born out of. lawful wedlock. His complaint was dismissed on the opening of thp trial on the ground that it did not set forth facts sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>constitute a cause of action. .This was the same thing as if the ..defendant had demurred ,to the complaint on that ground. The trial court granted the motion, which was nothing more than a mere nonsuit. Yet the decision filed by the court and the judgment entered thereon purported to dismiss the complaint \u201cupon the merits.\u201d On this appeal we may amend the judgment by striking but the, words \u201c upon the merits.\u201d As to the sufficiency of the complaint, the question is at once novel, so far as'our decided cases go, and in the highest degree important, so far as the common life of our people is concerned. After some study, I feel justified in saying that I know of no well-considered case in this State or in England, or in fact in any part of this country, which has held that a marriage will be annulled on the claim of one of the parties, that the other had- made false representations \u00e1s to his or her previous chastity, which induced the complaining party to enter 'into the status. There are many well-considered authorities to the contrary, of which Mr. .Justice Jenks-cites several. Were' it not for the opinion of the Court of Appeals in <em>Di Lorenzo </em>v. <em>Di Lorenzo </em>(174 N. Y. 467) there would be little room even for debate on this question. Yet, as I see that opinion, it does not affect this precise question at all. Certainly, there was nothing decided in that case which necessarily controls the case now here. That court has told us frequently enough, what all- of us well know, though at times it be forgotten, that the general expressions in its opinions must be measured by the precise facts before it. In that case there had been a trial of the issues and the jury found the following facts: The plaintiff had. been induced to marry the defendant on false representations made by her that she had given birth to a child of which the plaintiff was the father; she exhibited the child to him, which was said to have been born during his absence from the \u25a0State; believing her statements, <em>and solely far the \u00a1purpose of legitimatizing his supposed offspring, </em>he entered upon a ceremonial- marriage; he discovered thereafter that the child' in question was not only not his child, but not even his wife\u2019s child, but was ih fact a spurious child, fraudulently palmed off upon him by the woman, who had never given birth to any child. The Court- of Appeals held that these facts constituted a gross fraud upon the plaintiff, which reached to and destroyed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>very essence of his consent to the marriage, and that he was entitled to an annulment of the' marriage. Our statute (Dom. Bel. Law [Gen. Laws, chap. 48; Laws of 1896, chap. 272], \u00a7 10; since amd. by Laws of 1901, chap. 339; renum. \u00a7 5, and amd. by Laws of 1907, chap. 742, and revised into Dom. Bel. Law [Consol. Laws, chap. 14; Laws of 1909, chap. 19], \u00a7 10) declares the rule as follows: \u201cMarriage, so far as its validity in law is concerned, continues to be a civil contract, to which the consent of parties capable in law of malting a contract is essential.\u201d It will be noted that there is no attempt to define mar.riage as a civil contract except for the one specified purpose, and there-is no warrant for any larger statement. The same statute (\u00a7\u00a7 2-4, as amd. by Laws of 1907, chap. 742), which lias been revised into the present act (\u00a7\u00a7 5-7), classifies marriages as -void and voidable. While free consent is deemed essential to the inception of the relation of man and wife, the statute itself - recognizes and declares the existence of certain impediments in the way of a legal marriage which not even the free consent of the parties can overcome, and declares marriages, contracted in face of these impediments, void from the beginning. Such, for instance, are the impediments of consanguinity set forth in section 2 of the act of 1896 (as amd. by Laws of 1907, chap. 742) and in section -5 of the act of 1909. These absolute impediments are but few compared to the number which were enforced in-the ecclesiastical courts in England, and which,- to a greater or less degree, came from the provisions of the early canon law of the church. As to the marriages classified as voidable (\u00a7 4, as revised into \u00a7 7), the impediments specified are to a large extent the same as those recognized in the canon law, and which, in fact, have been recognized in every civilized system of law relating to marriage since early Boman history. Among the impediments so declared as to \u201c voidable marriages \u201d is one where either party \u201c consents to such marriage by reason of force, duress or fraud.\u201d (Dom. Bel. Law of 1896, \u00a7 4, as revised into Dom. Bel. Law of 1909, \u00a7 7.) These present statutory declarations are but re-enactments of the provisions on this subject found in the Be vised Statutes. (See 2 B. S. 138, \u00a7 1; Id. 139, \u00a7 2; rep. by Laws of 1830, chap. 320, \u00a7 24, and added by Laws of 1.887, chap. 24; 2 B. S. 139, \u00a7 3, as amd. by Laws of 1893, chap. 601; 2 B. S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>139, \u00a7\u00a7 4-6.)- The purpose of these enactments is quite clear. Though we took over our common law- and equity jurisprudence from England, we did noc take over the system of ecclesiastical courts, as we had no State church. In our changed system, w\u00e9 distributed among our civil courts the various subject-matters which fell formerly within the exclusive jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical, courts, as for instance, marriages, wills, etc, \u25a0 The statute as to marriages declared no radically new rule; it merely declared what was to be adopted and preserved from the old rules.</p>\n<p id=\"AVKM\">It is quite true that the Court of Appeals placed its decision in the <em>Di Lorenzo </em>case upon the ground that under our statutes mar-, riage is a civil contract, and must be annulled, on the complaint of the injured party, if it be entered into through fraud as to a material element of the consent. This rule, however, as before- indicated, is not different to that which applied in the ecclesiastical courts,, where marriage was deemed sacramental when entered into by baptized persons. The beginning of the relation even there was contractual, and implied free consent, for its inception. If this consent was procured by a material fraud, it was always held that the marriage could be annulled\" on proper proof. What we call \u201cfraud \u201d they call \u201cerror \u201d in regard, to matrimonial causes. We divide fraud into \u201c material \u201d and \u201cimmaterial.\u201d We consider as \u201c material \u201d that which reaches the essence of the consent of the parties. The canonists divided \u201c error \u201d into \u201c error substantialis \u201d and \u201c error accidentalis.\u201d \u201c Error substantialis \u201d was one that reached the essence of the consent and was- material to it, while \u201cerror accidentalis\u201d arose where the fraud or mistake was inci-. dental rather than material. On the question of the necessity and freedom of consent both our own law, as applied in the <em>Di Lorenzo </em>case, and the canon law are. in full harmony. At the same time neither at canon law nor heretofore in equity has a mere representation as to previous chastity been considered as \u201c material,\u201d or as producing \u201c error substantialis \u201d in the giving of the required consent for a valid marriage. -Nor do I think we should be justified in inferring from the decision of the Court of Appeals-in the <em>Di Lorenzo </em>case that it intended to declare any new rule on this question, bfor should we be swayed too much by the supposed logical deductions from the rule there declared. Law and logic should work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>together, but we know very well that they do not always keep equal \u2019step. Logie- exists independently of human habit or mode of thought, while law is but the reflection of human life and custom. Logic does not know expediency, while law seldom escapes it, for life is largely regulated by it.' The rule so frequently applied in the past, that courts will not.look behind the marriage on the question of previous chastity, rests largely upon human expediency. There is a wisdom of life, as well as a logic of law, and a working system of law must embrace both elements. The question is a delicate one, but, at the same time, a most practical one, which the world has been solving in its own way for many centuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">It should not be supposed that there is any analogy between the question here considered and the one-time rule in Roman law, quoted by Hr. Justice Jerks from Montesquieu, that an impediment to legal marriage existed as to a woman who had- led \u201c a disorderly life.\u201d The rule is found in the \u201c Fragments of Ulpian,\u201d and is taken from the \u201c Lex Julia,\u201d which was an edict of Augustus aimed at a condition of society then existing. It forbade senators, and later, free men, from marrying common prostitutes. It was directed not against a woman who had simply been unchaste, and in that sense \u201c disorderly,\u201d but against those who marketed their bodies. Even this legal impediment was not continued by Justinian in the Institutes, or Pandects, aud is not to be found in any system of jurisprudence since existing. If the rule, contended for so forcibly and so elegantly by my brother Jenks, is to find its way into our system of jurisprudence, I presume it will be necessarily of equal application regardless of sex. If so, we may well recall the opening of Pandora\u2019s box.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">For the reasons above given, I vote to modify the judgment by striking therefrom the words \u201cupon the merits,\u201d and to affirm the , judgment as so modified. \u2022 ,</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">Burr, J., concurred in separate memorandum.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-6\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b523-10\">Burr, J.';</author>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">I concur with Mr. Justice Carr. The vital question in this case is whether previous chastity is a material fact, misrepresentation as to which will justify the annulment of a consummated marriage on the ground of fraud. While it may be unfortunate that a man or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>a woman finds,.after the contract of marriage has been consummated, that the -ether' party to the relation has at some time previously been guilty ,of a lapse from virtue, that fact alone would not justify disturbing the status: which then exists in which the public as well as the parties are entitled to consideration. .(See <em>Svenson </em>v. <em>Svenson, </em>178 N. Y. 54.) The consequences of the doctrine suggested by. Mr. Justice Jehks are far reaching. The relations between parties' to a marriage contract antecedent to the contract itself are certainly relations of trust and confidence^ <em>(Page </em>v. Horne, 11 Beav. 227; <em>Cobbett </em>v. Brock, 20 id. 524.) When such relations exist, it is not enough to. keep silence with regard to facts material to the contract about to be made, or to make no false statements'respecting the same. The affirmative duty exists of making a full and complete disclosure if the contract is to be sustained. If previous chastity is a fact material to the marriage contract, 'then it is not enough that the party about to enter into that contract should refrain from making any false affirmation with regard to it; the duty would- devolve upon such person to make a full.and free disclosure with regard to previous habit of life. So far as the law regards chastity, it makes no distinction between the sexes. In the' fortim of good morals the law of personal purity is the same for the man and the woman. Unfortunately it is the common impression that man is the more frequent transgressor. If I am right in my premises, may it not be. that in many instances, when the parties have wearied of the marriage bonds, although the contract has been \u25a0 consummated and for many years and during its entire.continuance, no false step has been taken, actions to annul such marriages may be successfully maintained, notwithstanding no active deception has'. been 'practiced, solely because some youthful transgression'was not disclosed?</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">I think that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Judgment reversed' and new trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
