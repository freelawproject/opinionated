Rebecca retained Arnold, an attorney, to represent her in various matters concerning her family. Rebecca advised Arnold that her 12-year-old daughter had told her that Joseph S. Tushinsky, Rebecca\u2019s husband, the child\u2019s father, had been sexually abusing the child over a period of 5 years. Rebecca advised Arnold that \u201cin exercising his authority as her attorney,\u201d he was to \u201cdo nothing which would result in [Joseph\u2019s] being criminally prosecuted for the sexual abuse [Rebecca] believed was being imposed upon her child.\u201d Rather, Arnold was to \u201censure that [Joseph] would be psychiatrically treated and the matter would be handled in the [c]ivil [c]ourts only,\u201d in conjunction with the dissolution action Rebecca requested Arnold file on her behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Arnold, in disregard of these instructions, advised Rebecca to file a petition under the Domestic Violence Prevention Act (DVPA) (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 540 et seq.), knowing that the district attorney had \u201cno choice\u201d but to investigate the allegations, \u201cwhereas had the question of the child molestation been relegated to the civil court,\u201d in conjunction with the dissolution action, \u201cno criminal accusation would have arisen. . . .\u201d Rebecca, following Arnold\u2019s advice, filed a DVPA petition, and, thereafter, a dissolution action against Joseph.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Following an investigation of the allegations contained within the DVPA petition, the district attorney\u2019s office filed a criminal complaint against Joseph charging him with child molestation. Thereafter, the district attorney\u2019s office requested dismissal of the charges after publicly stating the case could not be successfully prosecuted due to the \u201cmanipulations\u201d of Arnold. Arnold, in his \u201czeal\u201d to bolster Rebecca\u2019s dissolution case, allowed the child to be hypnotized prior to Joseph\u2019s trial. This act, in effect, eliminated the child as a witness, since, under <em>People </em>v. <em>Shirley </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 18 [181 243, 641 P.2d 775], hypnosis-induced testimony is inadmissible. The loss of the only witness who could testify to the acts of sexual molestation caused the trial court to dismiss the criminal case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Following dismissal of the criminal complaint, Joseph filed a malicious prosecution action against Rebecca. He alleged that Rebecca\u2019s allegations of sexual molestation of the minor child by Joseph were false and that Rebecca did not \u201chonestly, reasonably, and in good faith believe [Joseph] to be guilty of the crimes charged, and knew the charges to be false.\u201d Judgment was entered against Rebecca in favor of Joseph in the amount of $6.15 million.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Following entry of judgment in the malicious prosecution case, Rebecca filed this action against Arnold. In a two-count, third amended complaint, Rebecca seeks recovery of damages for \u201cInfliction of Emotional Distress and Negligence (Legal Malpractice)\u201d and for \u201cBreach of Confidence and Trust and for the Establishment of a Constructive Trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The trial court ruled with respect to the first cause of action that there was \u201cno proximate cause\u201d between Arnold\u2019s acts and Rebecca\u2019s injuries, and that Rebecca \u201cis collaterally estopped to bring [the] cause of action.\u201d With respect to the second cause of action, the court held: \u201cThis does not make sense\u2014constructive trust of what? No cause of action is stated nor can there be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">In this appeal, Rebecca contends: (1) the element of proximate causation has been sufficiently alleged; (2) the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not apply within the context of this case; and (3) \u201c. . . the causes of action for. . . constructive trust and breach of confidence . . . are properly pleaded so as to be sufficient to withstand demurrer. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Arnold, relying primarily on <em>Weiner </em>v. <em>Mitchell, Silberberg &amp; Knupp, supra, </em>114 Cal.App.3d at page 39, contends that where it has been conclusively established in a prior action that a plaintiff in the second action was the sole proximate cause of his or her damages, the plaintiff is barred under the doctrine of collateral estoppel from relitigating that finding. In the instant case, according to Arnold, it was conclusively established in the malicious prosecution action that Rebecca, in filing false charges against Joseph, was the sole proximate cause of any damages she may have suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">In <em>Weiner, </em>a certified public accountant was indicted and convicted of securities fraud in accounting practices and making untrue statements to the Securities Exchange Commission. Following his conviction, the accountant filed a complaint against the attorneys who represented him in the investigation by the commission. He alleged causes of action in tort against the attorneys for malpractice, conspiracy, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and interference with prospective advantage, charging that his indictment was proximately caused by the attorneys\u2019 misconduct in their representation of him during the investigation by the commission. The attorneys demurred to the complaint, requesting the court to take judicial notice of facts stated in the appellate court\u2019s opinion and the judgment therein affirming the accountant\u2019s conviction of securities fraud. The court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend and, after the accountant refused to amend, dismissed his action. The <em>Weiner </em>court affirmed, holding that there was a complete lack of proximate causation between the torts alleged and the injuries the accountant allegedly suffered. The court found that the accountant was precluded by collateral estoppel from relitigating in his civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>action the proximate cause for his conviction, because that had been determined in the criminal prosecution to be the result of his guilt alone. <em>(Weiner </em>v. <em>Mitchell, Silberberg &amp; Knupp, supra, </em>114 Cal.App.3d at p. 39.)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Rebecca attempts to distinguish <em>Weiner </em>on the ground that in that case, the plaintiff, alone, committed the crime which caused him to be indicted and which led to his conviction. Thus, in the subsequent malpractice action, he was barred from asserting that \u201cbut for\u201d the attorneys\u2019 negligence in the handling of his criminal action, he would not have been convicted. By contrast, in the instant case, Rebecca argues that her conduct in leveling false charges against Joseph was allegedly \u201cthoroughly advised and was actually participated in by . . . Arnold. . . .\u201d Thus, Rebecca contends, she cannot be considered to have been the sole proximate cause of the filing of the criminal charges against Joseph. In fact, because Arnold \u201ccontrolled\u201d her actions in asserting the false charges, he must be considered to have been either \u201cthe\u201d proximate cause or \u201ca\u201d proximate cause of the filing of the criminal charges against Joseph. Rebecca\u2019s argument is not supported by either the allegations of the third amended complaint or the facts this court is entitled to judicially notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The doctrine of collateral estoppel obviates the need to relitigate issues in a second action already adjudicated in the first action. <em>(Lockwood </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 667, 671 [206 Cal.Rptr. 785].)  There are three prerequisites which must be shown before the doctrine will be applied: (1) the issue in the second action must be identical to the issue adjudicated in the first action; (2) the first action must have proceeded to a final judgment on the merits; and (3) the party against whom the collateral estoppel is to be asserted must have been a party, or in privity with a party, to the first action. <em>(Teitelbaum Furs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dominion Ins. Co., Ltd. </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 601, 603-604 [25 Cal.Rptr. 559, 375 P.2d 439].)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Rebecca concedes that the malicious prosecution action proceeded to a final judgment on the merits and that she was a party to that action. However, Rebecca asserts that the issues to be decided in this action are not identical to those adjudicated in the malicious prosecution action. She contends that the jury did not find that Rebecca\u2019s act of instituting criminal charges without probable cause was the sole proximate cause of the criminal charges being filed against Joseph. Such a conclusion, however, is not sup ported by the record in the malicious prosecution action. The jury in the malicious prosecution action was instructed, in part, as follows: \u201cIf you find that the defendant, in good faith, sought the advice of an attorney before initiating the prosecution of the criminal action against plaintiff and made a full, fair and complete disclosure to him of all the pertinent and material facts of which the defendant had knowledge tending to prove or disprove the criminal charge and thereafter the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>defendant acted upon the advice of the attorney and in the belief of plaintiff\u2019s guilt of the offense, then you must find that there was probable cause in initiating the prosecution of the criminal action against plaintiff.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\"> The jury found in the malicious prosecution action that Rebecca did not honestly and reasonably believe in the truth of the charges leveled against Joseph and that <em>she did not act under advice of attorney Arnold. </em>These issues cannot, under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, be relitigated in this action. <em>(Teitelbaum Furs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dominion Ins. Co., Ltd., supra, </em>58 Cal.2d at p. 607.)  The proximate cause of Rebecca\u2019s being subjected to the malicious prosecution action and the damages which occurred to her as a result thereof, was her conduct and her conduct alone. The cause of action against Arnold must fail because of the lack of proximate causation between his conduct and the injuries Rebecca suffered.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Given our conclusion that Rebecca was the sole proximate cause of the charges of child molestation being prosecuted against Joseph, and given the finding of the jury in the malicious prosecution case that the charges were false, the issue of whether Arnold\u2019s alleged hypnotism of the child was a proximate cause of the dismissal of the criminal charges is irrelevant. Regardless of the negligence involved, dismissal of criminal charges cannot serve as a basis for a malpractice action where the charges dismissed were false and the individual asserting both the criminal charges and the malpractice action knew the charges to be false when made.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">We note that attorneys are often faced with a seemingly irresolvable dilemma of choosing between the perceived welfare of a child and the rights of its parents. When confronted with allegations of child molestation, a parent may establish several goals, all of equal value to the family involved. The parent may assert, as does Rebecca in her complaint, that her \u201cimmediate\u201d concern is to exclude the alleged abuser from the family home in order to protect the child and to permit investigation of the charges. Often, the distraught family is adamant that it does not want the molester criminally prosecuted. Rather, the primary goal is often to protect the integrity of the family unit by dealing with the matter of sexual abuse of a child by seeking psychiatric care.  The state does not, however, view the area of sexu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>al abuse of children in the same manner. Nor does it establish the same priorities. \u201cIn the area of sexual abuse of children by adults, the law . . . has three objectives: to punish the abuser, to identify and protect his victims and to cure him in order to protect future potential victims.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stritzinger </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 505, 523 [194 Cal.Rptr. 431, 668 P.2d 738] (conc. and dis. opn. of Kaus, J.).)  Thus, an attorney\u2019s primary duty, when confronted with accusations such as those made by Rebecca against Joseph, is to act promptly to protect the child. We believe that an attorney can meet this responsibility by filing a petition for restraining orders, either in a dissolution action or under the DVPA. An attorney who files such a petition after being advised by his client that a third party, who is not a client of the attorney, has sexually abused a child, cannot be liable for any damages unless he does so with the knowledge that the facts contained within the petition are false. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11166, subd. (d), 11172, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Rebecca has apparently abandoned her appeal of the court\u2019s dismissal of her second cause of action entitled \u201cBreach of Confidence and Trust and for the Establishment of a Constructive Trust.\u201d While Rebecca generally asserts that she has stated facts sufficient to support this \u201ccause of action,\u201d she fails to provide legal argum\u00e9nt or citation of authorities in support of her conclusion. Therefore, we treat the point as waived and pass it without consideration. <em>(Henderson </em>v. <em>Security Nat. Bank </em>(1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 764, 769 [140 Cal.Rptr. 388].)  We note, however, that a constructive trust is but an equitable remedy available only to a plaintiff seeking recovery of specifically identifiable property. <em>(In re Marriage of Buford </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 74, 79 [202 Cal.Rptr. 20].) Because Rebecca has not alleged that she seeks recovery of \u201cspecific property,\u201d the court\u2019s ruling with respect to this cause of action must be allowed to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Compton, Acting P. J., and Gates, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b585-12\"> Rebecca asserts that Arnold waived his right to file a demurrer to each of the amended complaints since he filed an answer to the original complaint. However, an amended pleading constitutes an abandonment of the issues raised by the original pleading and an amended pleading is, therefore, subject to the same pleading challenges as the original.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b586-6\"> A copy of the DVPA petition is attached to the third amended complaint. Rebecca, under penalty of peijury, stated that she and Joseph were \u201cmarried and no Family Law proceeding is pending between us.\u201d Rebecca also stated that her daughter told her that she \u201cis very frightened and very upset due to what has happened to her.\u201d Rebecca further stated that she believed \u201cmy husband is sick and requires medical help and would request the Court to order a proper investigation so that he may get such help.\u201d Rebecca\u2019s \u201cimmediate request,\u201d however, was that Joseph \u201cbe ordered removed from the family residence and have no contact with any of the members of the family until an investigation is condluded and the proper authorities authorize visitation.\u201d Rebecca ended'her narrative by requesting that \u201cno criminal proceedings be instituted against my husband and that this entire matter be resolved through the civil [cjourts and the benefit of psychiatric help, which my husband can well afford.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b586-7\"> In recounting the allegations contained within Rebecca\u2019s third amended complaint, we do not mean to imply that such allegations are true. But, under settled law, we must regard them as true, however improbable they may be (to the extent they are not impeached by matters properly judicially noticed), for the purpose of passing on appeal on the validity of Arnold\u2019s demurrer to this pleading. (See <em>Weiner </em>v. <em>Mitchell, Silberberg &amp; Knupp </em>(1980) 114 Cal.App.3d 39, 44 [170 Cal.Rptr. 533]; <em>Viso </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 15, 19 [154 Cal.Rptr. 580].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b586-8\">Judgment was entered on August 6, 1984, and became final on December 27, 1984, when Rebecca abandoned her appeal from the judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b589-9\"> Pursuant to Evidence Code Section'459, at the request of respondent, we take judicial notice of selected portions of the record in the malicious prosecution action, including the jury instruction quoted.
