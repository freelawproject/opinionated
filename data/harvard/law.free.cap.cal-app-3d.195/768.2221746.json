We conclude that it does, and we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">During the marriage, appellant husband wrote and published several books, including two books on trivia: The Complete Unabridged Super Trivia Encyclopedia (1977) and The Complete Super Trivia Encyclopedia, Volume II (1981). In their 1982 divorce decree, husband and wife agreed to divide the royalties from those books equally.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">In 1984, husband filed an action in federal court against the producers of the board game, \u201cTrivial Pursuit,\u201d alleging copyright infringement claiming that certain questions used in the board game were plagiarized from husband\u2019s books. Thereafter, wife sought an order from the superior court declaring that she would be entitled to one-half of any proceeds derived from that lawsuit based upon the terms of the interlocutory decree. The trial court granted wife\u2019s request and ordered husband restrained from disbursing the proceeds of any verdict or settlement until wife\u2019s portion was accounted for. Husband now appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">\n<em>Copyright Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Preliminarily, we undertake a brief odyssey into the somewhat arcane domain of copyright law. Patent and copyright protection is rooted in our federal Constitution: \u201cThe Congress shall have power . . . [fl] To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.\u201d (U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Congress has implemented its constitutional power through enactment of a copyright statute, most recently rewritten and codified as the Copyright Act of 1976 (17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 et seq.) (Act).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>The Act provides broad protection to any creation expressed in tangible form. (\u00a7 102(a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">The Act grants to a copyright holder exclusive rights over his own work to copy, perform, display, distribute for sale, and prepare derivative works. (\u00a7 106.) Any person who infringes upon the copyright and copies, sells, or creates derivative works without permission is subject to both civil and criminal action. (\u00a7\u00a7 501, 506.) The copyright holder may grant a license to others to make use of the copyrighted work (\u00a7 201(d)) customarily in exchange for the copyright holder\u2019s right to receive royalties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">Unlike patents or trademarks, copyright protection is self-executing. No registration or prior approval is needed, and the copyright exists as soon as the work is created. (\u00a7\u00a7 102(a), 302(a).) However, registration and an affixed copyright notice are required before the owner can bring suit for copyright infringement. (\u00a7\u00a7 401, 408, 411(a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">In a suit for copyright infringement, the copyright holder may obtain injunctive relief, impoundment of the infringing materials and damages. (\u00a7\u00a7 502(a), 503, 504.) Recoverable damages include the copyright holder\u2019s actual damages plus any profits of the infringer not comprising a component of actual damages. (\u00a7 504.)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">\n<em>Copyright as Community Property</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Husband points out that under the Act a copyright in a protected work \u201cvests initially in the author or authors of the work.\u201d (\u00a7 201(a).) Thus, he argues, the copyright belongs only to the author. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Our analysis begins with the general proposition that all property acquired during marriage is community property. (Civ. Code, \u00a75110.) Thus, there seems little doubt that any artistic work created during the marriage constitutes community property. (See <em>Lorraine </em>v. <em>Lorraine </em>(1935) 8 Cal.App.2d 687, 701 [48 P.2d 48] [patent is community property]; <em>Frankenheimer </em>v. <em>Frankenheimer </em>(1964) 231 Cal.App.2d 101 [41 Cal.Rptr. 636] [no spousal interest in husband\u2019s literary property acquired after divorce]; <em>Herwig </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1952) 122 Ct.Cl. 493 [105 F.Supp. 384] [proceeds from sale of film rights to wife\u2019s book taxable to each spouse].)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">The fact that husband alone authored the trivia books is not determinative. The principles of community property law do not require joint or qualitatively equal spousal efforts or contributions in acquiring the property; it is enough that the skill and effort of one spouse expended during the marriage resulted in the creation or acquisition of a property interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">\u201cCalifornia community property law is based on a partnership model in which each spouse contributes to and shares in the prosperity of the marriage (<em>In re Marriage of Brigden </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 380, 389 [145 Cal.Rptr. 716]). The community property concept recognizes the important role of each spouse in the success of the community and places husband and wife on an equal footing with respect to property accumulated during marriage (M<em>eyer </em>v. <em>Kinzer and Wife </em>(1859) 12 Cal. 247, 251). Each spouse\u2019s effort, time and skill are community assets <em>(In re Marriage of Lopez </em>(1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 93, 105 [113 Cal.Rptr. 58]; <em>Somps </em>v. <em>Somps </em>(1967) 250 Cal.App.2d 328, 332 [58 Cal.Rptr. 304]; <em>Strohm </em>v. <em>Strohm </em>(1960) 182 Cal.App.2d 53, 62 [5 Cal.Rptr. 884]), and any benefit derived therefrom belongs to both <em>(Estate of Gold </em>(1915) 170 Cal. 621, 623 [151 P. 12]).\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Hillerman </em>(1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 334, 337-338 [167 Cal.Rptr. 240].)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">In the present case, husband conceived, wrote and published the trivia books during the marriage. Thus, the conclusion is inescapable that such literary works constituted community property. Indeed, at the time of the interlocutory decree, husband virtually conceded that the books were community property. Under the terms of the stipulated judgment (drafted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>husband\u2019s attorney), it is provided in pertinent part: \u201cThe parties agree that future royalties from the books . . . listed on the Petition, along with all reprints shall be paid equally to Petitioner and Respondent. The parties agree that the literary agent for Respondent shall be joined as a party and that the agent shall pay directly to Petitioner her one-half interest in the royalties. The parties agree that the court shall reserve jurisdiction over any issues that may subsequently arise regarding the distinction between a re-edition or complete reworking of any book which is community property.\u201d The reference in. the final sentence to \u201cany book which is community property\u201d strongly indicates the parties\u2019 understanding and agreement that the listed books, which include the trivia books, were community property.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Moreover, husband\u2019s agreement to divide the royalties manifests further acknowledgement that the books were considered to be community property. Under the community property doctrine, rents, issues and profits have the same character as the property source itself. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 5107, 5108.) In agreeing to wife\u2019s entitlement to one-half of the royalties, husband has at least tacitly conceded the community property nature of the books themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">If the artistic work is community property, then it must follow that the copyright itself obtains the same status. Under copyright legislation, a copyright is automatically acquired upon expression of the work. (\u00a7\u00a7 102(a), 302(a).) Here, husband registered the copyrights as well. Since the copyrights derived from the literary efforts, time and skill of husband during the marriage, such copyrights and related tangible benefits must be considered community property. (See 1 Nimmer on Copyright (1987) \u00a76.13[B], p. 6-37.)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Moreover, the Act expressly provides for the transfer of a copyright by contract, will \u201cor by operation of law.\u201d (\u00a7 201(d)(1).) Consequently, notwithstanding that the copyright \u201cvests <em>initially\u201d </em>in the authoring spouse (\u00a7 201(a), italics added), the copyright is automatically transferred to both spouses by operation of the California law of community property.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Of course, a copyright itself is an intangible interest separate and distinct from the tangible creative work. (\u00a7 202.) Although a copyright is \u201c \\ . . an intangible incorporeal right in the nature of a privilege or franchise . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Remick Music Corp. </em>v. <em>Interstate Hotel Co. of Nebraska </em>(D.Neb. 1944) 58 F.Supp. 523, 542, aflfd., 157 F.2d 744, cert, den., 329 U.S. 809), it is nevertheless personal property. <em>(Stuff </em>v. <em>La Budde Feed &amp; Grain Co. </em>(E.D.Wis. 1941) 42 F.Supp. 493.) And the community property doctrine encompasses <em>intangible </em>as well as tangible property. <em>(In re Marriage of Lopez </em>(1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 93, 107 [113 Cal.Rptr. 58], disapproved on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>other grounds in <em>In re Marriage of Morrison </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 437, 453 [143 Cal.Rptr. 139, 573 P.2d 41] [goodwill of professional practice]; <em>Golden </em>v. <em>Golden </em>(1969) 270 Cal.App.2d 401 [75 Cal.Rptr. 735] [same].) The fact that a copyright is intangible will not affect its community character or the community nature of any tangible benefits directly associated with the copyright.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">We are, of course, cognizant of those decisions which determined that a law school <em>education </em>acquired during the marriage is not a divisible community asset. (See <em>In re Marriage of Aufmuth </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 446, 461 [152 Cal.Rptr. 668], disapproved on another point in <em>In re Marriage of Lucas </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 808, 815 [166 Cal.Rptr. 853, 614 P.2d 285]; <em>Todd </em>v. <em>Todd </em>(1969) 272 Cal.App.2d 786, 791 [78 Cal.Rptr. 131].) In <em>In re Marriage of Aufmuth, </em>this court (Div. Four) reasoned that classification of a legal education, represented by a law degree, as a community \u201casset\u201d would run counter to settled community property principles by requiring division of attributable postdissolution earnings which, by definition, constitute the separate property of the acquiring spouse.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (89 Cal.App.3d at p. 461.)</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">We think a copyright is analytically distinguishable. A copyright <em>has </em>a present value based upon the ascertainable value of the underlying artistic work. Its value normally would not depend on the postmarital efforts of the authoring spouse but rather on the tangible benefits directly or indirectly associated with the literary product.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">In short, we conclude that a copyright on a literary work produced during the marriage is as much a divisible community asset as the underlying artistic creation itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">\n<em>Agreement To Share Copyright</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">Husband next contends that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to divide any proceeds resulting from the federal lawsuit because paragraph 8 of the interlocutory decree, which provided for equal division of the royalties, reserved jurisdiction only to resolve \u201cissues that may subsequently arise regarding the distinction between a re-edition or complete reworking of [a] book . . . .\u201d The argument is specious.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>The preprinted interlocutory judgment form contains a provision expressly reserving jurisdiction \u201cto make such other and further orders as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this judgment.\u201d The questioned order here was obviously intended to carry out the provisions of paragraph 8 of the interlocutory decree providing for equal division of royalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Husband also asserts, however, that the stipulated judgment purported to divide only the <em>royalties </em>from the books and not the copyrights as construed below. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Husband\u2019s thesis runs as follows: since a transfer of the literary property does not convey any of the statutory rights attached to the work (\u00a7 202), his agreement to share the royalties did not effect a transfer to wife of an interest in the copyrights, without which she has no colorable claim to share in any proceeds arising from infringement of the statutory right to the exclusive use of the books to prepare derivative works (\u00a7 106).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">But the argument construct fails to take into account the community nature of the copyrights. Although the stipulated judgment divided only the future book royalties and not the intangible copyrights, nonetheless, as property interests acquired during the marriage which remained undistributed under the terms of the interlocutory judgment, husband and wife would hold title to such undivided interests in the copyrights as tenants in common. <em>(See Henn </em>v. <em>Henn </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 323, 330 [161 Cal.Rptr. 502, 605 P.2d 10].) As a common owner of the copyright, wife would be entitled to share in <em>all </em>of the proceeds therefrom, including any settlement or award of damages resulting from the copyright infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">\n<em>Federal Preemption</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">Finally, husband argues that under the ultimate standard of the supremacy clause (U.S. Const., art. VI, cl. 2), California\u2019s community property laws have been effectively preempted by the federal Copyright Act. Since community property laws provide for an equal interest to both spouses in the community assets, and the Copyright Act vests ownership of the copyright in the author of the work alone, husband argues, the resulting irreconcilable conflict between state and federal law compels a conclusion that the state law is preempted. (See 1 Nimmer on Copyright, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 6.13 [A], p. 6;34.) We are not so persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">Husband\u2019s principal reliance is placed <em>on Hisquierdo </em>v. <em>Hisquierdo </em>(1979) 439 U.S. 572 [59 L.Ed.2d 1, 99 S.Ct. 802], in which the court held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>California\u2019s community property laws were in fatal conflict with the federal Railroad Retirement Act which vested ownership of railroad retirement benefits exclusively in the railroad employee spouse. (See also <em>McCarty </em>v. <em>McCarty </em>(1981) 453 U.S. 210, 224 [69 L.Ed.2d 589, 600-601, 101 S.Ct. 2728] [military retirement pay not subject to state community property laws]; <em>Free </em>v. <em>Bland </em>(1962) 369 U.S. 663, 668-669 [8 L.Ed.2d 180, 184-185, 82 S.Ct. 1089] [U.S. Savings Bonds standing in name of husband \u201cor\u201d wife not subject to state community property laws]; <em>Wissner </em>v. <em>Wissner </em>(1950) 338 U.S. 655, 658 [94 L.Ed. 424, 428, 70 S.Ct. 398] [National Service Life Insurance policy not subject to state community property laws, and proceeds belong to named beneficiary].)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">But <em>Hisquierdo </em>and the related cases invoking the preemption doctrine are readily distinguishable. In each of those cases, the ownership of federal benefits was expressly defined by Congress to be the separate property of the designated recipient. In sharp contrast, the Copyright Act expressly provides for co-ownership as well as transfer of all or part of a copyright. (\u00a7 201(a), (d).) Moreover, section 201 of the Act provides only that the copyright \u201cvests <em>initially </em>in the author\u201d (italics added); and nothing is found in the Act which either precludes the acquisition of a community property interest by a spouse, or which is otherwise inconsistent with community property law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Nor is husband\u2019s tandem reliance on the preemptive language of section 301 of the Act well placed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 301 reveals an intent by Congress to supersede only state <em>copyright </em>laws. In that regard, a state law will be preempted only if the rights granted under state law are \u201cequivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>specified by section 106 . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 301(a).) State laws granting or protecting other rights (such as breach of contract, conversion, defamation, etc.) have not been preempted. (See <em>Werlin </em>v. <em>Reader's Digest Ass'n, Inc. </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1981) 528 F.Supp. 451, 465; 1 Nimmer on Copyright, <em>op.cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 1.01[B]; Miller &amp; Davis, Intellectual Property: Patents, Trademarks, and Copyright in a Nutshell (1983) \u00a7 27.1, pp. 405-408.) Rights of ownership and division of marital property are in no way equivalent to rights within the scope of copyright under the federal Copyright Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">In summary, we conclude that the copyrights on the trivia books constituted divisible community assets. We find no inconsistency between the federal Copyright Act and California's community property law so as to invoke the preemption doctrine. Because such assets were not disposed of under the provisions of the interlocutory decree, husband and wife remain as co-owners of an undivided interest in the copyrights. Accordingly, both parties are entitled to share equally in any of the proceeds directly or indirectly related to the pending federal lawsuit for copyright infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The judgment is affirmed. Respondent to recover costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Elkington, J., and Newsom, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-13\"> During the pendency of this appeal, the federal district court ruled that husband has no claim of copyright infringement; that ruling was affirmed on appeal. <em>(Worth </em>v. <em>Selchow &amp; Righter Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1987) 827 F.2d 569.) Husband has since informed this court of his intention to pursue further appeal. In view of the pending status of the federal litigation, we have elected to reach the merits of the present appeal. Of course, should the federal opinion be affirmed without any material modification, the present lawsuit would become moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b672-11\">Unless otherwise indicated, all further section references are to the Copyright Act of 1976, title 17 of the United States Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b672-12\"> A royalty is generally defined to mean compensation given to the copyright owner for permission to use the copyrighted work.
