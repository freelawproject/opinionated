He is holding a fund and is subject to conflicting orders from the Los Angeles and Orange County Superior Courts. He seeks a writ prohibiting the Orange County Superior Court from enforcing its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">In January 1986 James Lee Casino pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit grand theft and admitted a special allegation the sums involved exceeded $25,000. He also admitted several overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plea included an agreement by the court to postpone sentencing for one year while Casino made restitution payments to petitioner for the benefit of several named victims. Whether Casino would ultimately go to prison or be placed on probation depended on how well he fulfilled the restitution agreement. Over the next several months Casino paid petitioner $110,000 out of a total of $412,500, but before he could be sentenced Casino was murdered.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>After Casino\u2019s death, real party Daubenbis secured special letters of administration from the Orange County Superior Court. He filed a petition in Orange County under Probate Code section 851.5<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>and obtained a temporary order restraining petitioner from disbursing the fund. Nevertheless, on motion of the Los Angeles District Attorney, the Los Angeles County Superior Court ordered distribution of the fund to the victims. The Los Angeles court then dismissed the criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">After the Los Angeles court\u2019s distribution order, the administrator obtained a preliminary injunction from the Orange County Superior Court continuing the restraint against disbursement to the victims and ordering petitioner to convey the funds to the administrator.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">We stayed the Orange County Superior Court order and issued an alternative writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">The issue is, which court has jurisdiction over the $110,000?</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">There appears to be no dispute concerning the original jurisdiction of the Los Angeles Superior Court. Casino was arrested and brought before the court by an information charging conspiracy, grand theft, and violations of the Corporations Code. His guilty plea was taken only after a detailed and exacting explanation of the plea agreement. Petitioner argues that because the Los Angeles court first assumed jurisdiction, it therefore has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter. He states, \u201cWhile the parties in both actions are not the same, the estate Administrator could seek relief in the Los Angeles Superior Court, which has had continuing jurisdiction over the fund since its creation, to temporarily enjoin distribution of the fund and make a determination as to ownership of the monies, thereby in effect making the estate and its beneficiaries \u2018parties\u2019 to the Los Angeles Superior Court action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">Petitioner directs us to a line of cases dealing with jurisdictional disputes between two courts. (See <em>Slinack </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1932) 216 Cal. 99, 106 [13 P.2d 670]; <em>Halpin </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 14 Cal.App.3d 530, 545 [92 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 329]; <em>Morrisette </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1965) 236 Cal.App.2d 597 [46 Cal.Rptr. 153]; <em>Cade </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1961) 191 Cal.App.2d 554 [12 Cal.Rptr. 847]; <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1946) 75 Cal.App.2d 925 [172 P.2d 84], and <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1941) 43 Cal.App.2d 181 [110 P.2d 529].) These cases recite the general rule that where two courts have concurrent jurisdiction over a class of cases, the first one to assume jurisdiction over the subject matter exercises it exclusively. If we were to follow petitioner\u2019s logic, however, the Orange County probate court\u2019s injunction might well be entitled to priority over the Los Angeles court\u2019s disbursement order.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">The above cases all deal with civil disputes pending in separate actions filed in different courts. This case involves funds paid during a criminal proceeding which has now been dismissed. The title to the fund is being questioned in a petition duly filed in a probate proceeding in another court. Only one \u201cproceeding\u201d currently exists, that being the probate action in Orange County. Therefore, the cited cases are inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Petitioner also argues the Los Angeles court had the power to make orders effectuating its prior order, despite Casino\u2019s death. Petitioner could not prevail on this point unless our court determined title. Because the issue of title has not been tried, however, it would be inappropriate for us to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">The administrator urges us to apply the rule of abatement <em>ab initio </em>to the Los Angeles court proceeding. Under that doctrine an appellant\u2019s death abates all further criminal proceedings. (Witkin, Cal. Criminal Procedure (1963) Appeal, \u00a7 720, p. 697.) He contends application of the rule would necessarily result in a finding the Los Angeles court order was made in excess of jurisdiction and hence was void. The rationale of abatement <em>ab initio </em>is discussed in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moehlenkamp </em>(7th Cir. 1977) 557 F.2d 126: \u201c[W]hen an appeal has been taken from a criminal conviction to the court of appeals and death has deprived the accused of his right to our decision, the interests of justice ordinarily require that he not stand convicted without resolution of the merits of his appeal, which is \u2018an integral part of [our] system for finally adjudicating [his] guilt or innocence.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 128, quoting from <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1956) 351 U.S. 12, 18 [100 L.Ed. 891, 899, 76 S.Ct. 585, 55 A.L.R.2d 1055].)</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">Unlike the decedent in <em>Moehlenkamp, </em>Casino died with no appeal pending. Casino was never convicted in the first place because he was never sentenced, and in criminal cases the sentence <em>is </em>the judgment. <em>(People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number><em>Thomas </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 521, 529, fn. 3 [342 P.2d 889].) Accordingly, in this case the reason for the rule does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Both petitioner and the administrator argued to this court as if we have the power to try the cause. Petitioner maintains the proper court is Los Angeles because a trust was created at the time of the original plea bargain. No, says the administrator, the funds were deposited in an escrow account and therefore belong to the estate. The confusion is understandable since each trial court treated the question of title as a foregone conclusion. The court in Los Angeles, in making its disbursement order, described the situation as follows: \u201cThe money paid into court was in no way considered as a condition of probation or restitution. . . . The defendant had no right as far as this court is concerned to that money after it was paid in. [If] If the\u2014If Mr. Casino had not paid off the full $412,000\u2014$412,500 and he\u2019d then go to prison. It would be absurd that this court would have ordered any part of this money returned to Mr. Casino. . . . ftf] The money was not an escrow account in any classic sense. It could have been held by the District Attorney in her [sic] own account, it could have been distributed at any time. It could have been immediately distributed to the victims, [if] Clearly in this court\u2019s opinion the money was being held in a constructive trust for the victims by the District Attorney; clearly Mr. Casino had no right or title to that money once it was paid over to the Deputy District Attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The Orange County court, at the hearing on the preliminary injunction, made equally strong remarks about the property belonging to the estate. The court: \u201cI think [referring to the victims] you\u2019re going to have to file creditors\u2019 claims, and I think you\u2019re going to have to take your [place] in this line with the rest of the creditors.\u201d Later the court added: \u201c[The fund] is being refunded to his estate so it\u2019s an asset of the estate. And as an asset of the estate it\u2019s available to satisfy creditors\u2019 claims. It\u2019s available to do a lot of things.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">The petition filed by the special administrator under section 851.5<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is a petition to determine title. That issue cannot be determined without a full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>evidentiary hearing, notwithstanding the actions of the respective trial courts in treating the question as a fait accompli.  The 1972 amendment to section 851.5 \u201cwas designed to abrogate the longstanding rule that the probate court lacked jurisdiction to determine adverse claims to the properties of an estate or to try the question of title to property as between a representative of the estate and strangers to the estate. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Estate of Sayles </em>(1982) 130 Cal.App.3d 275, 279 [181 Cal.Rptr. 543], and cases cited therein at p. 279. See also <em>Estate of Linnick </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 752, 760 [217 Cal.Rptr. 552] and <em>Richer </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 63 Cal.App.3d 748, 756 [134 Cal.Rptr. 52].) Thus, section 851.5 provides a procedural framework for resolution of disputes akin to this one. The statute allows for discovery and preparation time, obviously contemplating a civil trial of the disputed issue in the probate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><em>Heiser </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 276 [151 Cal.Rptr. 745], although dealing principally with a procedural shortcoming of section 851.5, is instructive. The claimant in <em>Heiser </em>sought a jury trial of a title issue, but his petition in the probate court contained no factual allegations. There is no right to jury trial in probate proceedings unless authorized by statute. <em>(Id., </em>at p.279.) Section 1230, however, has been interpreted to require jury trials of certain contested factual issues in probate cases. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The trial court in <em>Heiser </em>was unable to determine from the petition if the case raised such an issue, or whether the matter should be decided by the court. In discussing the problem created by setting a hearing date concurrently with filing the petition, thus precluding a timely jury demand, the court stated, \u201cProbate Code section 851.5 should be amended to provide for filing (by either party) of a request for trial setting after the issues are joined.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 281.) The <em>Heiser </em>court suggested that when asking for a jury trial claimants advise the court of the exact nature of the disputed claims, so the court can determine the propriety of the jury request. <em>(Ibid.) </em> <em>Heiser's </em>language makes it clear that a complete trial is required of any disputed factual questions regarding title. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 280-281.) We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Because a trial is required, and in view of the conclusionary statements of the probate court that the fund belongs to the estate, it seems appropriate to comment on the issues involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Even absent a conviction, it appears the Los Angeles court had authority to approve an agreement for restitution as a condition precedent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>to a plea bargain.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A pledge to amass full restitution during a one year sentencing delay, in exchange for the court\u2019s promise of probation, was fashioned because of Casino\u2019s previous failure to make restitution as a condition of probation. Although Penal Code section 1192.7, subdivision (a) for the most part bans plea bargaining of serious felonies (as enumerated in subdivision (c)(1)), the prohibition does not extend to grand theft. Apart from the serious felony case limitation, we find nothing in the restitution statutes to prevent a trial judge from offering certain sentencing assurances in exchange for restitution being made in advance of the sentence itself. Such an agreement would be consistent with this state\u2019s strong public policy favoring restitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Indeed, restitution for crime victims is now a California state constitutional right. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 28, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">One admittedly unusual case even approved restitution as a condition of probation although some of the money related to a count of which the defendant had been acquitted <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lent </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 481, 487-487 [124 Cal.Rptr. 905, 541 P.2d 545] [acquittal would ordinarily preclude restitution, but trial judge\u2019s \u201cbroad discretion in the sentencing process\u201d permitted restitution order on both counts where defendant convicted of one and acquitted of another]).  And as noted in <em>People </em>v. <em>Baumann </em>(1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 67 [222 Cal.Rptr. 32], the constitutional guarantee of restitution for crime victims does not \u201cpurport to limit or abrogate the judicially created right ... to restitution for losses caused by criminal activity for which the offender was not convicted. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 83.)</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Clearly, had the court told Casino to pay the victims over the next year and have them appear at his sentencing to verify payment, no complaint could now be heard. And as to the administrator\u2019s argument Casino was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>not advised he was giving up his right to the money when he paid it, a trier of fact might well decide Casino was aware at the outset the money was to go to his victims, regardless of the ultimate disposition of the case. Such an inference might be drawn from the history of Casino\u2019s prior plea, the extraordinary lengths taken by the sentencing judge to ascertain Casino\u2019s understanding of the proceeding, and the district attorney\u2019s having contacted the victims and secured from some of them consent to the arrangement. Furthermore, Casino\u2019s guilty plea and his admission of the overt acts may be sufficient to find he was a constructive trustee of sums taken from the victims. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2224.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">In summary, the issue of title remains unresolved. The only court in which a proceeding is now pending is the Orange County Superior Court, sitting in probate. It is therefore the proper court to determine the issue. Meanwhile, with title disputed, the money is not available for a family allowance or for distribution to creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Petitioner voluntarily assumed the role of trustee when he accepted the trust on behalf of the real party victims. (See Prob. Code, \u00a7 15600, subd. (a)(2).)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Having done so he \u201chas a duty to take reasonable steps under the circumstances to take and keep control of and to preserve the trust property.\u201d (Prob. Code, \u00a7 16006.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>That duty obligates him to defend the trust in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Because petitioner was unsure of his status, he has not filed objections or responsive pleadings in the section 851.5 proceeding. The section permits any interested person to request time to file a response to the petition, to initiate discovery proceedings, or to prepare otherwise for the hearing. Petitioner should be allowed sufficient time to file responsive pleadings, and the trial court should grant a reasonable continuance upon either party\u2019s request for discovery and preparation time.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>Let a writ of mandate issue directing the Orange County Superior Court to vacate the order compelling delivery of the fund to the administrator, and ordering it to conduct a trial on the issue of title.

When a question had arisen as to whether Casino was hiding assets in an effort to avoid restitution, the trial judge refused to honor the plea bargain and reset the matter for trial.
