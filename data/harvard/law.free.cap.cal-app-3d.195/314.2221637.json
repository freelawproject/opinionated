The trial court determined that an employment exception in West American\u2019s policy relieved it of any duty to defend or indemnify, but that a business pursuit exception in the California Mutual policy did not apply under the circumstances of the injury. California Mutual was therefore held to have the sole responsibility to defend and indemnify the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">California Mutual appeals, arguing that there was insufficient evidence before the trial court to find that the employment exclusion was triggered, relieving West American of its contractual duties. California Mutual also argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that its business pursuit exclusion did not apply. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">At the time of his injury the employee was engaged in voluntary social activities which did not arise out of and in the course of his employment, but which did fall within the business pursuits of the insured. The judgment is reversed. West American, rather than California Mutual, must defend and indemnify the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-13\">\n<em>Factual and Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b301-14\">John A. Clapham is a cement and masonry contractor who operates his business out of his Simi Valley home. His employees would assemble at his home at approximately 6 a.m., gather the trucks, tools and plans necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>for the day\u2019s construction jobs, and then drive to the jobsites. At the end of the workday, Clapham\u2019s employees would return to the Clapham residence before quitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Clapham had converted his garage into a den, equipped with a pool table and a refrigerator. On Fridays, which was payday, Clapham would leave the jobsite early to come home and make out his payroll. His employees would gather in the den while waiting for their pay, playing pool and dice games and drinking beer furnished by Clapham. Once paid, the employees were free to leave, and many did. Others remained to continue drinking and playing pool and dice. Clapham used this weekly gathering to foster better relations with his employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">May 18, 1984, was a typical payday. Clapham paid his employees between 3:30 and 4 p.m. Among the employees remaining after receiving their pay that day were Rafael Iriarte and Iriarte\u2019s brother, Jesus. Also present were Francisco Gamboa, a former employee of Clapham, and his brother, Ismael.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Shortly after 8 p.m., during a dice game in the den, a fight broke out between Gamboa\u2019s brother, Ismael, and Iriarte\u2019s brother, Jesus. Both Gamboa and Iriarte became involved in the fray and suffered personal injuries. Gamboa and Iriarte each filed lawsuits against Clapham, alleging, inter alia, that Clapham negligently served alcohol and failed to control the people on his premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Clapham retained counsel, filed answers to the two suits, and made demand upon California Mutual Insurance Company (Cal Mutual) and West American Insurance Company (West American) to defend and indemnify him in these actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">In 1983, Cal Mutual issued to Clapham a homeowners insurance policy covering liability for bodily injury and obligating the company to defend against a claim or suit for damages because of bodily injury. The policy specifically excludes coverage for bodily injury \u201carising out of business pursuits\u201d of Clapham.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">West American issued a comprehensive general liability insurance policy in 1983 covering Clapham\u2019s liability for bodily injury in respect to the conduct of his sole proprietorship cement and masonry business. The West American policy also includes an obligation to defend against any bodily injury suit. This policy expressly excludes coverage for \u201cbodily injury to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of his employment by the insured . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">West American filed a complaint for declaratory relief against Cal Mutual, and Cal Mutual cross-complained. Each denied an obligation to defend or indemnify Clapham in either action.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">In its statement of decision, the trial court found that, disregarding the exclusions, the policies of both West American and Cal Mutual provide coverage to Clapham against Iriarte\u2019s and Gamboa\u2019s claims, and that Gamboa\u2019s claim was covered by both policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">The court concluded that Iriarte\u2019s injury arose out of and in the course of his employment, but not out of Clapham\u2019s business pursuits. Applying these findings to the exclusion clauses of both policies, the court found (1) West American was relieved of any duty to defend and indemnify Clapham in regard to the Iriarte injury and (2) Cal Mutual had the sole responsibility to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">On appeal, Cal Mutual contends that the evidence was insufficient to support the lower court\u2019s findings. Cal Mutual argues that Iriarte was injured while drinking and gambling on Clapham\u2019s premises after work hours, not while rendering service for his employer pursuant to the terms of employment. Thus, the injuries did not arise out of and in the course of Iriarte\u2019s employment by Clapham, but they did arise out of Clapham\u2019s business pursuit. If true, the obligation to defend and indemnify Clapham would not he with Cal Mutual, but with West American.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">Alternatively, Cal Mutual argues that if Iriarte\u2019s injury did arise out of his employment, then it must necessarily also have arisen out of Clapham\u2019s business pursuit. This would result in neither insurance policy covering Clapham for the Iriarte injury. (The lower court\u2019s findings regarding the Gamboa suit were not appealed.)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">I. <em>Did Iriarte\u2019s injury arise \u201cout of and in the course of\u201d his </em>employment?</p>\n<p id=\"b303-14\">Cal Mutual correctly points out that merely because Iriarte was Clapham\u2019s employee and was on Clapham\u2019s business premises at the time of the altercation, does not establish that Iriarte was engaged in Clapham\u2019s employment when injured, or that his injuries arose out of and were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>incurred in the course of his employment. <em>(Artukovich </em>v. <em>St. Paul-Mercury Indem. Co. </em>(1957) 150 Cal.App.2d 312, 324 [310 P.2d 461]; 12 Couch on Insurance (2d ed. 1981) \u00a7 44A:68, p. 108.) \u201cEveryone who is engaged in the employment of the insured would be its employee, but not every employee is engaged in the employment of the insured all the time.\u201d <em>(Artukovich, supra, </em>at p. 324.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">This principle of law, however, does not end our inquiry. The fight resulting in Iriarte\u2019s injuries did not take place during working hours nor in the course of providing services to Clapham.  Still unanswered is the question whether at the time of the injury Iriarte was in some other manner \u201cengaged in the employment of the insured . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Cal Mutual argues that to come within the employment exclusion, the injured party must, at the time of injury, \u201cbe <em>rendering service </em>for his employer <em>pursuant to the terms of his employment\u201d and must be \u201cengaged in activities necessary and incidental to the work\u201d the employee was hired to do.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Cal Mutual cites no authority for this purported rule, and West American, in arguing that Cal Mutual\u2019s proposition is antiquated and overrestrictive, relies on workers\u2019 compensation and respondeat superior cases. We agree with the parties\u2019 implicit concession that there is no case law defining the phrase \u201carising out of and in the course of employment\u201d as it appears in private liability insurance policies. Even though this phrase appears in workers\u2019 compensation and respondeat superior law, West American\u2019s reliance on these cases is misplaced. The policies and rules of construction underlying private liability insurance law differ from those in workers\u2019 compensation and respondeat superior situations. The phrase must be interpreted in its correct context.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">A. <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">The employment exclusion clause at issue here is identical to the statutory language establishing a workers\u2019 compensation claim. In order to be compensable under workers\u2019 compensation, the injury must \u201c[arise] out of and [be] in the course of the employment. . . .\u201d (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3600; <em>State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 643, 652 [184 Cal.Rptr. 111].)  \u201cIn the course of employment\u201d generally refers to the time and place of the injury, and means that the injured must be engaged in the work he has been hired to perform, while the phrase \u201carise out of employment\u201d refers to a causal connection between the injury and the employment. <em>(State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number><em>Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>at p. 652; 2 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1987) Workers\u2019 Compensation, \u00a7 185, p. 749.)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">In <em>McCarty </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 677 [117 Cal.Rptr. 65, 527 P.2d 617], the Supreme Court construed this terminology so to award workers\u2019 compensation to the survivor of an employee who died in a car wreck after becoming intoxicated at an office Christmas party.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The court considered whether the employee\u2019s intoxication \u201carose in the course of employment,\u201d and concluded that \u201c[e]mployee social and recreational activity on the company premises, endorsed with the express or implied permission of the employer, falls within the course of employment if the \u2018activity was conceivably of some benefit to the employer . . .\u2019 [citations, fn. omitted]\u201d or otherwise was a \u201ccustomary incident of the employment relationship.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 681-682.) The <em>McCarty </em>court noted that by purchasing intoxicants with company funds and permitting after-hours drinking parties on business premises, employers benefit by fostering company camaraderie and the discussion of company business. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">The holding of <em>McCarty </em>is cast in doubt by Labor Code section 3600, subdivision (a)(9) (formerly (a)(8)), which excludes from liability under workers\u2019 compensation those injuries which \u201carise out of voluntary participation in any off-duty recreational, social, or athletic activity not . constituting part of the employee\u2019s work-related duties, <em>except where these activities are a reasonable expectancy of, or are expressly or impliedly reguired by, the employment.\u201d (Ezzy </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 252, 259 [194 Cal.Rptr. 90]; see 2 Witkin, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 783-786.) As. will be seen, the <em>McCarty </em>test survives in the realm of respondeat superior.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">B. <em>Respondeat Superior</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">The doctrine of respondeat superior holds an employer liable for torts of \u00e1n employee committed within the scope of his employment, and the rationale underlying the doctrine is, in some respects, similar to that underlying workers\u2019 compensation. <em>(Perez </em>v. <em>Van Groningen &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 962, 967 [227 Cal.Rptr. 106, 719 P.2d 676].)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">The test for determining whether an employer is vicariously liable for the torts of his employee is \u201cclosely related to the test applied in workers\u2019 compensation cases for determining whether an injury arose out of or in the course of employment.\u201d <em>(Rodgers </em>v. <em>Kemper Constr. Co. </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 608, 619 [124 Cal.Rptr. 143].) Under California law, an em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>ployer is liable for risks \u201carising out of the employment.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Perez </em>v. <em>Van Groningen &amp; Sons, Inc., supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 968.)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">In <em>Rodgers, supra, </em>the court announced two tests for determining whether a risk arises out of employment. One test is foreseeability, that is, whether \u201cin the context of the particular enterprise an employee\u2019s conduct is not so unusual or startling that it would seem unfair to include the loss resulting from it among other costs of the employer\u2019s business.\u201d <em>(Rodgers </em>v. <em>Kemper Constr. Co., supra, </em>50 Cal.App.3d at p. 619; <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Van Groningen &amp; Sons, Inc., supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 968.)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The second test <em>Rodgers </em>\u201cborrowed\u201d from <em>McCarty. </em>It states that \u201cwhere social or recreational pursuits on the employer\u2019s premises after hours are endorsed by the express or implied permission of the employer and are \u2018conceivably\u2019 of some benefit to the employer <em>or, </em>even in the absence of proof of benefit, if such activities have, become \u2018a customary incident of the employment relationship,\u2019 an employee engaged in such pursuits after hours is still acting within the scope of his employment. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Rodgers </em>v. <em>Kemper Constr. Co., supra, </em>50 Cal.App.3d at p. 620; <em>Childers </em>v. <em>Shasta Livestock Auction Yard, Inc. </em>(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 792, 804 [235 Cal.Rptr. 641].)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Even though the <em>McCarty </em>test no longer applies in construing workers\u2019 compensation liability because of Labor Code section 3600, subdivision (a)(9), it has been adopted as a test in establishing liability under respondeat superior. <em>(Childers </em>v. <em>Shasta Livestock Auction Yard, Inc., supra, </em>190 Cal.App.3d 792, 804.)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">C. <em>Private Liability Insurance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Both <em>McCarty </em>and <em>Rodgers </em>broadly construe the phrase \u201c[arise] out of or be in the course of employment.\u201d Such construction is mandated by statute or by policy. Section 3202 of the Labor Code requires that all reasonable doubts as to whether the injury arose out of employment for workers\u2019 compensation purposes are to be resolved in favor of the employee. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3202; <em>Garza </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 312, 317 [90 Cal.Rptr. 355, 475 P.2d 451].)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">As for respondeat superior, the \u201cprincipal justification\u201d for the doctrine \u201c \u2018is . . . that the employer may spread the risk through insurance and carry the cost thereof as part of his costs of doing business.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Perez </em>v. <em>Van </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number><em>Groningen &amp; Sons, Inc., supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 967 quoting <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>Long </em>(1947) 30 Cal.2d 54, 64 [181 P.2d 645].)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Different criteria apply, however, in interpreting private liability insurance policy exceptions. These exceptions should be construed narrowly so to favor the insured, in order to protect the insured\u2019s reasonable expectation of coverage. <em>(Reserve Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Pisciotta </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 800, 808 [180 Cal.Rptr. 628, 640 P.2d 764]; <em>Artukovich </em>v. <em>St. Paul-Mercury Indem. Co., supra, </em>150 Cal.App.2d at p. 324.)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">With this rule of construction in mind, the evidence here is insufficient to support the trial court\u2019s determination that the injury arose out of and in the course of Iriarte\u2019s employment. It may be true that but for Iriarte\u2019s employment he would not have been at Clapham\u2019s that night, and in that sense the injury \u201carose out of\u2019 the employment relationship. But the exclusion also requires that Iriarte be acting \u201cin the course of\u2019 his employment when injured, and this prong is not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Iriarte was not working, nor was he required to be on Clapham\u2019s premises when the injury occurred. He was free to leave, and there is no evidence that continued employment or better working conditions depended on his being at the Friday night parties. Clapham testified at trial that he gave the parties to foster good relations with his employees. This may establish that the gatherings furthered Clapham\u2019s business purposes, but not that the employee\u2019s were on the job at the time of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">An employee who is doing acts \u201cin the course of [his] employment\u201d is working. It is when the employee is working that the exclusion applies. It would be reasonable for Clapham, the insured, to expect that the employment exclusion in the West American policy not apply to an injury resulting from an argument during a Friday night game of dice. The West American employment exclusion therefore does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">II. <em>Did Iriarte\u2019s injury arise out of a \u201cBusiness Pursuit\u201d?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">The trial court found that Cal Mutual\u2019s \u201cbusiness pursuit\u201d exception did not apply to Iriarte\u2019s injury, because Clapham had a \u201cdual purpose\u201d\u2014both business and social\u2014in allowing his premises to be utilized for drinking and gambling. The court found that because the activity giving rise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>to the injury was not \u201cwholly dependent\u201d on Clapham\u2019s business pursuits, the exclusion did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">\u201cIn <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Drasin </em>(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 864, 870 [199 Cal.Rptr. 749], it is noted \u2018. . . that applicability of the business pursuit exclusion turns on the motivation for the pursuitf,] . . . the presence of the profit motive carries considerable weight, and that the business engaged in need not be the sole occupation. ... [\u00b6] Other jurisdictions have defined a business pursuit as a regular activity engaged in for the purpose of earning a profit. . . . \u201cBusiness,\u201d as defined in [California] Revenue and Taxation Code section 6013, \u201cincludes any activity engaged in by any person or caused to be engaged in by him with the object of gain, benefit, or advantage, either direct or indirect.\u201d The central theme being espoused ... is regular activity with the motivation for profit or gain.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Fire Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>Jiminez </em>(1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 437, 442-443 [229 Cal.Rptr. 83].)</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">There is no doubt that Clapham was engaged in a business pursuit when he invited his employees onto his premises and provided them with beer and recreation. A business pursuit exception is broader than an employment exception. An employer\u2019s business pursuit logically includes any activity which arises from and is in the course of an employee\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Clapham testified that his sole purpose in permitting the Friday night custom was to foster better relations with his employees. A happy work force is a benefit to any business undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Even if the Friday night gathering was partially motivated by social interests, the result would be the same. Nothing in the insurance policy requires that the business pursuit be wholly business related for the exception to apply. West American\u2019s reliance on the \u201cconcurrent causation\u201d doctrine is misapplied.  That doctrine provides for coverage when the injury is caused by a combination of an insured risk and an excluded risk. <em>(State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Partridge </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 94, 105 [109 Cal.Rptr. 811, 514 P.2d 123].) It concerns multiple causes. <em>(Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>Adams </em>(1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 712, 716 [216 Cal.Rptr. 287].)  A double social and business nature of the Friday night activities is not the same as independently operating causes of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">West American\u2019s contention that the business pursuit exception is not conspicuous within Cal Mutual\u2019s policy is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>We hold that the employment exclusion in the West American policy does not apply, and that the Cal Mutual business pursuit exception does apply. West American, and not Cal Mutual, has the responsibility to defend or indemnify Clapham in the Iriarte suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The judgment is reversed. Each party to bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Stone, P. J., and Abbe, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">On October 30, 1987, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
