This question was argued at some length after the jury had returned its verdict convicting defendant of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-7\">Defendant\u2019s prior conviction occurred in August 1982 and was for an offense committed on July 15, 1982, after the passage of Proposition 8. On the date when the prior crime was committed, section 288a defined oral copulation, and subdivision (c) of that statute provided, in pertinent part, that any person who participated in an act of oral copulation with another person who was under fourteen years of age and more than ten years younger than he, or when the act was accomplished against the victim\u2019s will by means of force, violence, duress, menace or fear, would be punished by three, six or eight years in state prison. At the sentencing hearing in this case and in written briefs filed by the parties prior to that hearing, it was agreed by all concerned that the prior conviction had resulted in defendant\u2019s being placed on probation, pursuant to a plea bargain, after pleading guilty to participating in an act of oral copulation with a child under 14 years of age and more than 10 years younger than defendant. There was no mention, in the prior charge or plea, of defendant\u2019s having used force, violence, duress, menace or fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-8\">At all times pertinent to these proceedings, section 667 provided, in pertinent part, that \u201c. . . (a) any person convicted of a serious felony who previously has been convicted of a serious felony. . . shall receive, in addition to the sentence imposed by the court for the present offense, a five-year enhancement for each such prior conviction. . . . The terms of the present offense and each enhancement shall run consecutively. Rf] (d) As used in this section \u2018serious felony\u2019 means a serious felony listed in subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-9\">Section 1192.7 also provided, at all pertinent times, that \u201c(c) As used in this section \u2018serious felony\u2019 means any of the following: . . . fl}] (6) lewd acts on a child under the age of 14 years. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>The Attorney General takes the position on appeal that a prior conviction based upon a specific plea that defendant participated in an act of oral copulation with a child under 14 years of age and more than 10 years younger than he, in violation of section 288a, subdivision (c), necessarily constituted the commission of a \u201clewd\u201d act on a child within the meaning of section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(6), and therefore required the imposition of a consecutive five-year sentence enhancement for a prior serious felony pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a). We agree and find no merit to defendant\u2019s contention on appeal that because section 288a does not specifically characterize the particular conduct to which he pleaded guilty as \u201clewd,\u201d we must give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that it was not. We have no hesitation in holding that such conduct was lewd per se. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Deletto </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 458, 475 [195 Cal.Rptr. 233], fn. 13; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cline </em>(1969) 2 Cal.App.3d 989, 996-997 [83 Cal.Rptr. 246].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">However, defendant does raise one point which has merit. He asserts that the trial court\u2019s conduct in imposing the upper term of five years for the current offense of robbery, while declining to rule that defendant\u2019s prior 1982 conviction was for a serious offense requiring a five-year enhancement, suggests, at least arguably, that the trial court was of the opinion that the appropriate prison sentence was a total term of five years. Defendant suggests, therefore, that a sentencing remand be ordered to allow for the possibility that the trial court might elect, upon motion by defendant, to strike the prior conviction for enhancement purposes. (See \u00a7 1385; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fritz </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 227, 228-229 [219 Cal.Rptr. 460, 707 P.2d 833].)
