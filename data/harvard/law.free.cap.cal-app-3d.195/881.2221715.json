Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (a)) and 1 count of oral copulation with a child under 14 years old and more than 10 years younger than him (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288a, subd. (c)). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-11\">Gutierrez was 20 years old at the time of the offenses. The victim, Olivia B., was his nine-year-old first cousin. The offenses occurred over a six-month period in 1985 at the home of Gutierrez\u2019s mother, who frequently provided child care for her niece Olivia.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>Gutierrez pleaded guilty to the four oifenses. He also admitted allegations that he had engaged in substantial sexual conduct with a victim under 11 years old, a factor normally resulting in ineligibility for probation. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203.066, subd. (a)(8).)</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The court ruled Gutierrez was ineligible for probation and sentenced him to twelve years\u2019 imprisonment, consisting of a principal six-year term and three subordinate consecutive two-year terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Penal Code section 1203.066, subdivision (a)(8), states that a child molester who \u201chas substantial sexual conduct with a victim under the age of 11 years\u201d is ineligible for probation. However, under subdivision (c) of section 1203.066, the probation ineligibility provision is not applicable if the court makes all of the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-7\">\u201c(1) The defendant is the victim\u2019s natural parent, adoptive parent, stepparent, relative, or is a member of the victim\u2019s household who has lived in the household.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-8\">\u201c(2) Imprisonment of the defendant is not in the best interest of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-9\">\u201c(3) Rehabilitation of the defendant is feasible in a recognized treatment program designed to deal with child molestation, and if the defendant is to remain in the household, a program that is specifically designed to deal with molestation within the family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-10\">\u201c(4) There is no threat of physical harm to the child victim if there is no imprisonment.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203.066, subds. (c)(l)-(4).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">The sentencing court determined Gutierrez was ineligible for probation because a psychologist\u2019s report concluded he was not a \u201crelative\u201d or \u201cmember of the victim\u2019s household\u201d within the meaning of subdivision (c)(1). The psychologist\u2019s report clearly indicated, however, that Gutierrez and Olivia were first cousins. It stated that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s mother, Amalia D[.], frequently cared for her niece, Olivia [B.], at that time age 9, with Olivia being the daughter of Mrs. D[.]\u2019s sister, Irene [B.]\u201d By any definition a first cousin is a \u201crelative.\u201d Thus the court erred when it found the factor prescribed by subdivision (c)(1) to be absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-12\">The source of the error appears to be the psychologist\u2019s report, which stated this factor was absent because Gutierrez \u201cwas not someone who had resided in the same household with the victim.\u201d The psychologist must have believed the statute limited a relative\u2019s exclusion from probation ineligibility to one \u201cwho has lived in the household.\u201d This misinterpretation is under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>standable, for subdivision (c)(1) is poorly drafted. But a commonsense reading of subdivision (c)(1) indicates that the phrase \u201cwho has lived in the household\u201d was intended to modify only the phrase \u201cmember of the victim\u2019s household,\u201d and not the words \u201cnatural parent, adoptive parent, stepparent, relative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">This interpretation is supported by the statute\u2019s history. An earlier draft of subdivision (c)(1) required residency \u201cfor a substantial period of time but not less than one continuous year, while assuming the role as parent.\u201d (Assem. J. (Aug. 10, 1981) p. 6342.) A later draft read, \u201cThe defendant is a member of the victim\u2019s immediate family including parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, brother or sister, or is a step-parent, adopted parent, or has been living in the household for a substantial period of time but not less than one continuous year, while assuming the role as a parent.\u201d (Assem. J. (Aug. 25, 1981) p. 6998.) These drafts reflect a process of determining when nonrelatives who have a close relationship with the victim should come within the exclusion from probation ineligibility, not an intent to require residency for parents and other relatives. The Legislature\u2019s ultimate selection of the concluding phrase, \u201cor is a member of the victim\u2019s household who has lived in the household,\u201d resolved this point by requiring household membership and an unspecified period of residency for nonrelatives, and in light of this history could not have been intended to require residency for relatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Our interpretation is supported by <em>People </em>v. <em>Jeffers </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 984 [239 Cal.Rptr. 886, 741 P.2d 1127], which held the requirement of household member status for nonrelatives refers to the defendant\u2019s status at the time of the offense rather than at the time of sentencing. One of the reasons given for this conclusion was that otherwise, the victim\u2019s mother and a boyfriend offender could marry before sentencing and thereby make the offender eligible for probation as a stepparent \u201ceven though he had never lived in the victim\u2019s household.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 999.)</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The error was harmless, however, for it is not reasonably probable the court would have found Gutierrez eligible for probation had it considered the remaining three factors prescribed by subdivision (c). The key question was whether imprisonment was \u201cnot in the best interest of the child.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203.066, subd. (c)(2).) It is inconceivable that the court would have found a grant of probation to be in Olivia\u2019s best interest. Gutierrez conceded he did not provide child care for the victim, and it does not appear he provided any financial support. Olivia\u2019s best interest did not require any further contact between the two; in fact, the probation report strongly recommended against it. In a presentence memorandum defense counsel\u2019s sole argument on the question of Olivia\u2019s best interest was that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>might later feel guilty for causing Gutierrez\u2019s imprisonment. This argument was unsupported by any offer of proof and was contradicted by the probation report, which indicated Olivia \u201cbecomes very upset when she accidently sees [Gutierrez] in the local market and cannot understand why he is still on the street.\u201d Gutierrez was not even a father figure to Olivia. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Jeffers, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 997.)</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Accordingly, despite the court\u2019s erroneous reasoning as to subdivision (c)(1), it is not reasonably probable the court would have found Gutierrez eligible for probation had the error not occurred. The error does not require resentencing. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Low, P. J., and Haning, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied November 16, 1987, and appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied March 2, 1988.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b779-9\">The Attorney General argues the error was harmless because the court\u2019s decision to sentence consecutively indicates it would not have granted probation had Gutierrez been eligible. This argument is flawed in that the decision to sentence consecutively is based on factors relating to the crime and the defendant (see Cal. Rules of Court, rules 421, 423, &amp; 425), whereas probation eligibility under section 1203.66 depends on harm to the victim which might result from imprisonment. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Manners </em>(1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 826, 833 [225 Cal.Rptr. 798].) If the victim\u2019s best interest calls for probation, it could be granted despite aggravating factors concerning the crime and the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
