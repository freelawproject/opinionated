J.</author>\n<p id=\"Abx\">This appeal and cross-appeal are taken from a judgment of the superior court and a portion thereof, respectively, in an election contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">In a special election held on June 11, 1985, the voters of the City of Hermosa Beach (the City) considered an initiative measure essentially authorizing the City to enter into an agreement for the development of certain City-owned property. Following the election, the city clerk\u2019s canvas resulted in defeat of the measure, 2,397 voters having voted \u201cyes,\u201d and 2,398 having voted \u201cno.\u201d Supporters of the measure requested a recount, which again resulted in defeat of the initiative, by a tally of 2,398 \u201cyes\u201d votes and 2,400 \u201cno\u201d votes.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">Plaintiff and cross-appellant Michael Escalante filed a Statement of Contest of Election (Elec. Code, \u00a7 20050),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleging that illegal votes were cast (\u00a7 20021, subd. (d)), and that the city clerk and the recount board, in conducting the recount, made errors sufficient to change the result of the election (\u00a7 20021, subd. (e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">Appellant Sheila Donahue Miller and the Hotel Referendum Committee<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> filed a cross-statement of contest of election on the same grounds, claiming the inititative measure was in fact defeated by a larger majority than that found on recount.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">Following trial, the court determined (1) the city clerk erroneously failed to count two \u201cyes\u201d votes of absentee voters who marked their punch card ballots with a pen on the chad designated \u201cyes,\u201d rather than punching out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>the chad as directed,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) the clerk properly counted as a \u201cno\u201d vote a ballot punched \u201cno\u201d with transparent adhesive tape on the reverse side holding the \u201cyes\u201d chad in place, (3) five ballots punched \u201cno\u201d that also had other chads punched out were properly counted as \u201cno\u201d votes, (4) one ballot punched \u201cyes\u201d with an additional chad punched so that it remained attached to the ballot by only one of its four arms was also properly counted, (5) two ballots with neither the \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d chads punched out, but with nearby chads punched, were properly not counted, (6) the clerk erred in counting an absentee ballot marked \u201cno\u201d by voter Margaret Davey but returned to the clerk\u2019s office by one Peter Barks, (7) the clerk properly counted the ballot of Anthony C. De Beilis, Jr., who moved from one precinct to another more than 29 days prior to the election, and mailed his new address to the Registrar of Voters well in advance of the election, but was not placed on the voting records of his new precinct until he again notified the registrar following the election, and who voted in his former precinct, and (8) the clerk acted within her discretion in refusing to count the absentee ballot of Jane R. Woods upon determining that there was a discrepancy between Woods\u2019s signature on the ballot envelope and her signature on the affidavit of voter registration, although Woods testified she did in fact sign both of these documents. The court noted that Woods also put an address of a place other than her residence on the absentee ballot envelope.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Judgment was entered accordingly, resulting in a count of 2,400 votes in favor of the ballot measure, and 2,399 against the measure, which then carried.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Each of the trial court\u2019s determinations is challenged by one or another of the parties to this appeal. Following some preliminary observations, we will consider them in the order set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">\u201cThe scope of review in an election contest is not different from other cases. Where the evidence is in conflict, this court will defer to the trial court where events at trial and demeanor of the witnesses play an important part in the decision. However, the interpretation of ballots is governed by the same rules applied to the construction of all other written instruments unless the interpretation turns on the credibility of extrinsic evidence. Accordingly, this court is not bound by an interpretation given a ballot based solely on the ballot without the aid of evidence, where there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>no conflict in the evidence, or an interpretation has been made upon incompetent evidence.\u201d <em>(Fair </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 868, 874 [172 Cal.Rptr. 379], citing <em>Keane </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 932, 939 [95 Cal.Rptr. 197, 485 P.2d 261].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">\n<em>The Trial Court Properly Ruled Valid Absentee Ballots Marked With Pen, Rather Than Punched</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Section 10339 provides: \u201cIf punchcard ballots are used for absent voting, the ballots shall be marked by pencil, or by a marking device which enables the voter to register his vote by punching or slotting the ballot card. Counting of punchcard ballots marked by pencil may be as with paper ballots, or a true duplicate copy of each ballot may be prepared using the same procedure as provided by Section 15271. Absent voter ballots so counted by the counting device.\u201d With respect to the two ballots (exhibits 1 and 2) upon which absentee voters marked their \u201cyes\u201d votes with a pen, rather than punching out the chad as directed in the voting instructions,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the trial court found there was \u201cno relevant difference\u201d between the pen markings made by the voters and the pencil markings permitted under section 10339.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Miller points to section 11, which provides that \u201cshall\u201d is mandatory and \u201cmay\u201d is permissive. Escalante and the City point out that section 10339 appears in article 3, entitled \u201cPunchcards\u201d, of chapter 3, entitled \u201cVoting Machines and Vote Tabulating Devices\u201d, of division 8, entitled \u201cBallots\u201d, of the Elections Code. \u201cPunchcard\u201d is defined in section 10332 as \u201ca tabulating card on which the voter may record his vote by punching, marking, or slotting, <em>and the word </em>\u2018punching\u2019 <em>includes marking a ballot card to record a vote.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">Chapter 2 of division 8, entitled \u201cForms of Ballots\u201d, contains section 10204 on instructions to voters, which requires that ballots contain the printed instruction: \u201cOn absent voters ballots mark a cross (+) with pen or pencil.\u201d Section 10226, also on voting instructions, also requires the printed instruction: \u201c(absentee Ballots May Be Marked With Pen and ink <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>Or Pencil.)\u201d Also pertinent is section 10326, found in article 2 of chapter 3, entitled \u201cVote Tabulating Devices\u201d: \u201cThe device for marking the ballot may be of any size, shape or form, and the impression made on the ballot may be in the form of a cross, square, circle, rectangle, or any other design that will clearly indicate the choice of the voter. Any type of ink or other substance that will clearly show the voter\u2019s choice may be used in or in conjunction with the marking device. In addition, in the case of absent voter ballots, the voters may be provided with a supply of stickers for indicating their choices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Miller urges that the sections other than 10339 are general, while section 10339, limiting the voter\u2019s choices to pencil or marking device enabling the voter to punch or slot the ballot card, is specific, and therefore controlling. She cites in support of her argument section 10200, appearing at the beginning of chapter 2, which provides: \u201cAll ballots used in all elections shall be governed by the provisions of this chapter unless otherwise specifically provided.\u201d Miller also urges that the provisions of chapter 2 by their terms apply to paper ballots, rather than the punch card ballots governed by article 3 of chapter 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Whether or not resort may be had to the provisions of chapter 2, we believe the trial court properly ruled the challenged ballots valid despite the use of the word \u201cshall\u201d in section 10339 regulating punch card ballots. In citing section 11, Miller ignores section 4: \u201cUnless the provision or the context otherwise requires, these general provisions, rules of construction, and definitions shall govern the construction of this code.\u201d In other words: \u201c \u2018 \u201cShall\u201d is mandatory and \u201cmay\u201d is permissive\u2019 unless the provisions or the context otherwise requires. (\u00a7\u00a7 11, 4; <em>Garrison </em>v. <em>Rourke </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 430, 437 .... [Overruled on another point in <em>Keane </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>4 Cal.3d 932, 939.])\u201d <em>(Fair </em>v. <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.3d 868, 876-877.)</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">Here, the trial court\u2019s construction of the direction set forth in section 10339, that punch card ballots be either punched or marked with a pencil, as not precluding marking with a pen, does not abrogate the general scheme regarding punch card voting, or undermine the secrecy, uniformity and fairness of the vote, or the integrity of the voting process. Nor are we persuaded by Miller\u2019s argument that the pen markings constitute impermissible identifying marks. \u201cThe line of cases which put aside some marks as not showing the necessary intent to identify turned on then extant section 7054, or its predecessor, which provided that no unauthorized mark shall invalidate the ballot unless \u2018 \u201cit shall appear that such mark was placed thereon by the voter for the purpose of identifying such ballot.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] [H] The just quoted portion of the statute survived the 1961 reenact<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>ment in section 17074 (Stats. 1961, ch. 23, p. 808); however, those words are omitted in the 1975 amendments. The Legislature now mandates, \u2018[n]o voter shall place any mark upon a ballot that will make that ballot identifiable.\u2019 (\u00a7 14241.) Because the act of voting itself makes the ballot identifiable the intent of the Legislature must have been that votes cast for the same candidate be done in so similar a manner that the ballots properly cast will be indistinguishable one from the other and therefore not be identifiable as having been cast by a particular voter. Furthermore, \u2018[a]ny ballot which ... is marked ... by the voter so that it can be identified by others\u2019 is not to be counted. (\u00a7 17007.) Although the critical words in section 17007 are different from those in section 17074 and its predecessors, their import is the same and the reasoning in the <em>Turner </em>case, requiring intent to identify, remains valid.\u201d <em>(Fair </em>v. <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.3d 868, 877-878, citing <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1915) 171 Cal. 600, 604 [154 P. 2].) There is nothing about the ballots here in question warranting the inference that the voters\u2019 use of pens, rather than pencils, to mark the punch cards was done for the purpose of identifying the ballots. The trial court properly counted these two \u201cyes\u201d votes.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">\n<em>The Taped Ballot Was Properly Counted</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Escalante contends the trial court should not have counted the absentee ballot voted \u201cno\u201d with the \u201cyes\u201d chad punched out and taped back in, characterizing the ballot as equivocal, spoiled, and identifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">In our view, an equivocal ballot is one from which \u201cthe choice of the voter is impossible to determine . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 17007; <em>People </em>v. <em>Campbell </em>(1902) 138 Cal. 11, 21 [70 P. 918].) Such a ballot is not countable. We have examined the challenged ballot (exhibit 3) and find nothing equivocal about it. On its face, the ballot represents a clear \u201cno\u201d vote; the \u201cyes\u201d chad is neatly secured in its place by a small piece of clear tape affixed to the back of the ballot after mistaken or accidental removal. Escalante\u2019s argument that the ballot may have been altered by a person other than the voter is purely speculative; there is nothing in the record to suggest that the ballot was not delivered to the polling place within an absentee ballot envelope bearing the voter\u2019s signature and exhibiting no signs of tampering.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">Section 14242 provides, in part: \u201cIf a voter spoils or defaces a ballot, the voter shall at once return it to the ballot clerk and receive another ballot.\u201d In the present case, the \u201cAbsent Voter Instructions\u201d accompanying absentee ballots provided: \u201cAll distinguishing marks on the ballot card are forbidden and make the ballot void. If you wrongly punch, tear or deface the ballot card, return it to the Election Official and obtain another.\u201d We believe the statutory provisions regarding spoiled ballots must be read in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>conjunction with the provisions regarding equivocal and identifiable ballots, and are plainly designed to prevent the casting of such ballots. Here, as we have stated, there is nothing equivocal about the subject ballot. Nor, under the reasoning set forth in the previous section, is the ballot identifiable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It was properly counted.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">\n<em>Voted Ballots With Additional Chads Punched Were Properly Counted</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Escalante contends the trial court erred in counting six ballots (Exhs. 5-9, 11) which had been punched on nonvote-signifying chads in addition to a proper voting square. \u201cA vote in a blank spiace does not invalidate the ballot which will be counted in other particulars. [Citations.] The punching of an unassigned number on a punchcard ballot is not a disqualifying identifiable mark in the absence of a showing of intent to make the ballot identifiable. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Fair </em>v. <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.3d 868, 880.) The trial court properly counted the challenged ballots.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">\n<em>The Trial Court Properly Refused To Count Ballots That Were Not Punched In Voting Squares</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">Miller contends the trial court erred in refusing to count two ballots (exhibits 10, 12) with chads punched below those directly opposite the word \u201cNo,\u201d in a shaded area within bold lines also enclosing the \u201cNo\u201d chads. On one of these ballots, the chad immediately below the designated chad is punched; on the other, the punched chad is the second below that designated for a \u201cno\u201d vote. There are three chads in the shaded areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">While we find the ballot design unfortunate, the \u201cAbsent Voter Instructions\u201d direct the voter to \u201c[r]ecord your vote by removing completely the cross (+) to the right of your choice.\u201d Only two chads bear crosses, one to the right of the word \u201cYes,\u201d and the other to the right of the word \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cBallots are not to be counted as to offices [or issues] as to which they are equivocal. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Fair v. Hernandez, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.3d 868, 880.) When the voter is required to punch out the cross that corresponds to his choice and he fails to do so, or punches another chad, which in the particular election is not assigned to either a candidate or an issue, he has failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>mark his ballot as required by law and the vote cannot be counted. <em>(Ibid.; Livingston </em>v. <em>Heydon </em>(1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 672 [104 Cal.Rptr. 83].) These ballots were properly excluded from the trial court\u2019s count.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">\n<em>The Court Properly Refused To Count The Davey Ballot</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Citing <em>Wilks </em>v. <em>Mouton </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 400 [229 Cal.Rptr. 1, 722 P.2d 187], Miller urges that the court erred in refusing to count the absentee ballot of Margaret Davey, which was returned to the clerk\u2019s office, at Davey\u2019s request, by Peter Barks. In <em>Wilks </em>v. <em>Mouton </em>the court considered former section 1013, which provided in part: \u201cAfter marking the ballot, the absent voter may return the ballot to the official from whom it came by mail or in person, or may return it to any member of a precinct board at any polling place within the jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">The court agreed with the appellants in that case \u201cthat section 1013 directs the voter to return the completed ballot personally if he decides not to use the mail, and that the section does not contemplate the voter\u2019s use of a third party to deliver the ballot. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 411.) However, the court characterized section 1013 as directory in nature and stated: \u201c [n] oncompliance with directory provisions of the Elections Code will not nullify a vote unless the irregularity prevented \u2018 \u201cthe fair expression of popular will\u201d \u2019 [citation] or the \u2018result of the election has been changed or rights of the voters [were] injuriously affected by the deviation.\u2019 [Citation.] The trial court\u2019s findings clearly show that neither occurred here. Under these circumstances, where there has been no fraud, tampering or coercion, departure from the technical requirements of the statute will not disenfranchise voters who had no knowledge that they had failed to comply.\u201d <em>(Wilks </em>v. <em>Mouton, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 412.)</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">In the present case, the trial court made no findings comparable to those made by the court in <em>Wilks </em>v. <em>Mouton, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>More importantly, the Legislature subsequently clarified its intent that the provisions of section 1013 be given mandatory, rather than directory, effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">In September 1986, the section was amended to read, in pertinent part: \u201cThe absent voter <em>shall </em>return the ballot to the official from whom it came by mail or in person, or may return it to any member of a precinct board at any polling place within the jurisdiction.\u201d (Stats. 1986, ch. 866, \u00a7 2, italics added.) The section was again amended, effective May 18, 1987, to read, in part: \u201cAfter marking the ballot, the absent voter shall either: (1) return the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>ballot by mail or in person to the official from whom it came or (2) return the ballot in person to any member of a precinct board at any polling place within the jurisdiction. However, an absent voter who, because of illness or other physical disability, is unable to return the ballot, may designate his or her spouse, child, parent, grandparent, grandchild, brother, or sister to return the ballot to the official from whom it came or to the precinct board at any polling place within the jurisdiction.\u201d The latter amendment was enacted for the express purposes of clarifying \u201cthe potential ambiguity contained in the August 21, 1986, decision of the California Supreme Court in Wilks v. Mouton, 42 Cal.3d 400,\u201d and declaring, inter alia, that \u201c[t]he intent of the Legislature is and always has been that the provisions of Section 1013 are mandatory and not directory in effect.\u201d (Stats. 1987, ch. 22, \u00a7 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">\u201cWhile it is true that as a general rule statutes are not to be given retroactive effect unless the intent of the Legislature cannot be otherwise satisfied [citation], an exception to the general rule is recognized in a case where the legislative amendment merely clarifies the existing law. [Citations.] The rationale of this exception is that in such an instance, in essence, no retroactive effect is given to the statute because the true meaning of the statute has been always the same. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Tyler </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 973, 976-977 [185 Cal.Rptr. 49]; <em>City of Redlands </em>v. <em>Sorensen </em>(1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 202, 211 [221 Cal.Rptr. 728].)</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">The present case falls within the exception described above. In its most recent amendment of section 1013, the Legislature expressly stated that its purpose was to clarify potential ambiguity in <em>Wilks </em>v. <em>Mouton, </em>and to declare that its intent \u201cis and always has been\u201d that section 1013 be given mandatory effect.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">\u201cThe law is well established that although construction of a statute is a judicial function, where a statute is unclear, a subsequent expression of the Legislature bearing upon the intent of the prior statute may be properly considered in determining the effect and meaning of the prior statute. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Tyler </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, </em>134 Cal.App.3d 973, 977.)</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">The trial court properly refused to count the Davey ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>\n<em>The Court Erred In Counting The De Beilis Vote</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">On April 1, 1985, Anthony De Beilis, Jr., a member of the Hermosa Beach City Council, moved from 713 Loma to 220-29th Street. According to his testimony at trial, which was believed by the trial court, De Beilis thereafter picked up affidavit of registration forms (exhibit 45) for himself and his roommate from a table outside of the City Council chamber and took them home. After completing his form, De Beilis took it to his place of employment in Inglewood and placed it in an \u201cout\u201d basket from which mail is customarily taken to a mail room, where it is picked up by postal workers. His roommate subsequently received the registrar\u2019s notification of her registration; De Beilis received no such notice. After seeing the voter\u2019s pamphlet for the election at a City Council meeting, De Beilis called the city clerk\u2019s office and was assured he would receive a pamphlet with an absentee ballot form on the back. He later called again, and was again assured that his pamphlet would be forwarded. Just prior to the election, De Beilis, who had not received the pamphlet, called the administrative assistant to the city manager who, after apparently conferring with the city clerk\u2019s office, advised De Beilis of the voting place where he ultimately cast his ballot, which was the polling place for the precinct in which his former residence was located.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Miller contends the trial court erred in ruling valid the ballot cast by De Beilis, in that he moved from the precinct in which he voted more than 28 days prior to the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">An \u201celector\u201d is \u201cany person who is a United States citizen 18 years of age or older and a resident of an election precinct at least 29 days prior to an election.\u201d (\u00a7 17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">\u201cEvery person who qualifies under Section 2 of Article II of the Constitution and who complies with the provisions of this code governing the registration of electors may vote at any election held within the territory within which he or she resides and the election is held.\u201d (\u00a7 100.)</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">\u201cA person duly registered as a voter in any precinct in California who removes therefrom within 28 days prior to an election shall, for the purpose of such election, be entitled to vote in the precinct from which the person so removed until the close of the polls on the date of such election.\u201d (\u00a7 217.)</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">A voter who moves from one precinct to another more than 28 days prior to an election must, except in exceptional circumstances (fn. 11, <em>infra), </em>vote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>in his new precinct after registering his new address by executing a new affidavit of registration (\u00a7 301) or by providing the county clerk with \u201ca notice or letter of the change of address signed by the voter as he is registered\u201d (\u00a7315) Here, contrary to the assertion of Escalante and the City, De Beilis elected to proceed under section 301, and executed a new affidavit of registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">\u201cA properly executed registration shall be deemed effective upon receipt of the affidavit by the county clerk or on the 29th day before an election to be held in the registrant\u2019s precinct if (a) the affidavit is executed on or before the 29th day prior to the election, and (b) the affidavit is received by the county clerk by mail after the 29th day and by the fourth day after the 29th day before the election.\u201d (\u00a7 301.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Section 504 requires the county clerk, upon receipt of a properly executed affidavit of registration, to send the voter notification by nonforwardable, first-class mail, address correction requested, that, among other things, he is registered to vote and must reregister whenever he moves.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">De Beilis was advised of this matter, and more, by the \u201cVoter Information\u201d section of his affidavit of registration form, which read, in part: \u201c2. In order to vote in any specific election you must be registered 29 days prior to that election. (Exception: New California residents may vote for President and Vice President if they register on or before the seventh day prior to a Presidential election.)</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">\u201c3. You should not consider yourself registered until you receive a Voter Notification Card by return mail. Your registration will become effective upon receipt by the Registrar-Recorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">\u201c4. If you do not receive a voter notification card, call telephone number (213) 725-5670.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">By his testimony, De Beilis knew that he was required to reregister or otherwise apprise election officials of his new address prior to the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>Assuming, as we must, that he executed a new affidavit well before the election and placed it in his outgoing office mail, the registration did not become effective. (\u00a7 301.) Moreover, De Beilis was on notice, due to the voter information provided him, as well as his failure to receive either a voter notification like that received by his roommate (\u00a7 504) or a voters\u2019 pamphlet for the upcoming election, that his reregistration attempt was ineffective, and he failed to take meaningful action to remedy the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">Contrary to the trial court\u2019s conclusion, there is nothing in the record to suggest that De Beilis\u2019s affidavit of registration was \u201cerroneously placed by the county clerk\u201d in his former precinct. (\u00a7 1515.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The affidavit could as well have been lost in the voter\u2019s office mail or the Post Office Department. There is no evidence that it ever reached the Post Office Department, or that it was ever delivered to the county clerk. Nor are we persuaded, as was the trial court, that the issue is irrelevant in this Citywide single-issue election.  \u201c \u2018[T]he right to express one\u2019s choice of a candidate at the polls is not unrestricted. It is subject to reasonable regulation in the interest of secrecy and uniformity of the ballot and the fairness of the vote, etc. [Citation omitted.]\u2019 [Citation.]. . . The courts have the duty to enforce the statutory scheme for the conduct of elections according to their [sic] terms and evident intention. [Citation.] \u2018[T]he legislative intent underlying a statute must be ascertained from its language; if the language is clear there can be no room for interpretation, and effect must be given to the plain meaning of the language. [Citations omitted.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Fair </em>v. <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>116 Cal.App.3d 868, 875-876.)</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Upon moving from one precinct to another more than 28 days prior to the election, De Beilis was required to either reregister (\u00a7\u00a7 301, 305, 312) or execute an address change (\u00a7315) to preserve his eligibility to vote. Having done neither, he was not properly registered to vote in either his old or new precinct. <em>(Kagan </em>v. <em>Kearney </em>(1978) 85 Cal.App.3d 1010, 1015-1016 [149 Cal.Rptr. 867].) The court erred in counting his \u201cYes\u201d vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">\n<em>The Woods Ballot Was Properly Rejected</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">The absentee ballot of Jane Woods was rejected by the clerk because the signature on the ballot envelope did not appear to match that on her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>affidavit of registration. In addition, the address appearing in the ballot envelope in the space provided for the absentee voter\u2019s residence address differed from the residence address for Woods in the registrar\u2019s records. Woods testified at trial that the signature was hers, and that she did reside at the address recorded with the registrar. She offered documentary evidence, in the form of utility bills, supporting her claim of residence, and explained that she had thought she was to place on the absentee ballot envelope the address of the place where she actually completed her ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">In the present case, the relevant statutes are sections 1009 and 1015.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">Section 1009 provides, in part: \u201cThe identification envelope shall contain the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-6\">\u201c(a) A declaration, under penalty of peijury, stating that the voter resides within the precinct in which he or she is voting and is the person whose name appears on the envelope.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-7\">\u201c(b) The signature of the voter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-8\">\u201c(c) The residence address of the voter as shown on the affidavit of registration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">Section 1015 provides, in part: \u201cUpon receipt of the absentee ballot the election official shall compare the signature on the envelope with that appearing on the affidavit of registration and, if they compare, deposit the ballot, still in the identification envelope, in a ballot container in his or her office. A variation of the signature caused by the substitution of initials for the first or middle name, or both, shall not invalidate the ballot. If the ballot is rejected because the signatures do not compare, the envelope shall not be opened and the ballot shall not be counted. The cause of the rejection shall be written on the face of the identification envelope.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">As the court stated, in <em>Wilks </em>v. <em>Mouton, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d 400, \u201csection 1015 requires only that the elections official compare the signature on the identification envelope with the signature in the affidavit of registration; a comparison of addresses is not required.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 413.)</p>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">The question before the trial court was not whether the ballot was in fact that of Woods, but rather, whether the clerk abused her discretion in rejecting the ballot based on comparison of the signatures. The trial court examined the voter\u2019s signatures as they appeared in the records and on the ballot envelope, and determined that the clerk did not abuse her discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>rejecting the ballot. We have examined the evidence, and are also persuaded the rejection was within the clerk\u2019s discretion. (Cf. <em>Wheelright </em>v. <em>County of Marin </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 448, 456 [85 Cal.Rptr. 809, 467 P.2d 537].)</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Our rejection of the De Beilis \u201cYes\u201d vote results in a count of 2,399 votes for, and 2,399 votes against, the ballot measure. The contestant, Escalante, has failed to establish precinct board errors, or illegal votes, sufficient to change the election result (\u00a7\u00a7 20021, subd. (e), 20024), and the election must be confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">The judgment is reversed. The matter is remanded to the trial court, which is directed to enter a new judgment confirming the election result.
