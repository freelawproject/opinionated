We conclude that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>Appellants Bouissiere bought a hair design business for $50,000, giving sellers and respondents Taylors their $35,000 promissory note secured by a security agreement on business furniture, fixtures and equipment. As additional note security, they gave their written \u201cAssignment of Lease as Collateral Security,\u201d encumbering their tenants\u2019 leasehold interest in the business premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">The Bouissieres paid the note down to $17,863, but then stopped paying. The Taylors sued on the promissory note, and moved for summary judgment. The Bouissieres opposed, admitting the unpaid obligation, but contending the lease assignment constituted real property security. They claimed section 726 prevented the Taylors from recovering a personal judgment before first realizing on their security. The trial court granted summary judgment, and the Bouissieres appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">Under the \u201cone action\u201d rule of section 726, whenever an obligation is secured by a deed of trust or mortgage on real property, the creditor cannot sue the debtor for personal liability until the security has been exhausted. <em>(Roseleaf Corp. </em>v. <em>Chierighino </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 35, 38 [27 Cal.Rptr. 873, 378 P.2d 97]; 1 Miller &amp; Starr, Current Law of Cal. Real Estate, Deeds of Trust and Mortgages, \u00a7 3:82.) However, the \u201cone action\u201d rule does not apply to personal property security.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the security is personal property, the creditor\u2019s right to sue for personal liability on the debt is not restricted by any obligation to look first to the security. <em>(Walker </em>v. <em>Community Bank </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 729, 735 [111 Cal.Rptr. 897, 518 P.2d 329]; Augustine &amp; Zarrow, Cal. Real Estate Law and Practice, Antideficiency Legislation, \u00a7 122.13 [4].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">Appellants argue assignment of their tenants\u2019 interest in the business lease constitutes the giving of a real property security interest within the meaning of section 726, preventing a suit for personal liability before the security is exhausted. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-8\">We have found no California case specifically holding whether a lease assignment is a security interest in real property under section 726. However, other well-settled California authority makes it clear that it is not.  It is true that a leasehold is an estate in real property, <em>(Callahan </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1935) 3 Cal.2d 110, 118 [43 P.2d 788, 101 A.L.R. 871]; <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 9 Cal.App.3d 397, 400 [88 Cal.Rptr. 352, 67 A.L.R.3d 743].) However, the tenant\u2019s estate itself is not real property or real estate; it is defined by statute as a chattel real and, as such, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>regarded as part of the tenant\u2019s personal estate governed by the rules applicable to personal property generally. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 765; <em>Dabney </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(1936) 5 Cal.2d 1, 6 [53 P.2d 962, 103 A.L.R. 822]; <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>Martin, supra; </em>4 Miller &amp; Starr, <em>supra, </em>Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 27:2.)  Therefore, the security assignment of a tenant\u2019s leasehold interest is the assignment of a security interest in a chattel real, regarded as personal property; it is not the assignment of a real property security interest within the meaning of section 726.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">Appellants miss the point in arguing that, under Civil Code section 2924, transfer of a security interest in the leasehold is deemed a mortgage. While that assertion may be true, it does not automatically follow, as appellants argue, that such a mortgage must be considered to be upon real property. By its terms, section 2924 contemplates that a mortgage may encumber either real property or personal property. Thus, the fact that the security assignment may be a form of mortgage does not disturb its classification as an interest in personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">Since we have concluded that the security assignment of a leasehold interest is not the assignment of a real property security interest under section 726, we need not reach the issue raised as to the exception to the \u201cone action\u201d rule when the encumbered property becomes valueless as security. (See 1 Miller &amp; Starr, <em>supra, </em>Deeds of Trust and Mortgages, \u00a7 3:85.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-6\">The judgment is affirmed. Respondents are entitled to costs and, as provided by the terms of the note, reasonable attorneys fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-7\">Sonenshine, Acting P.

(Cal. Mortgage and Deed of Trust Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1979) \u00a7 4.34.) However, no such disguised transaction is present here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
