(Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 2053.) The charged offense, an alternative felony/misdemeanor (in trade jargon, a \u201cwobbler\u201d), was first charged as a felony then reduced to a misdemeanor. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 17, subd. (b)(5).) The superior court issued its writ on the theory that the prosecution was time-barred under the one-year misdemeanor statute of limitations. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 802, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Petitioner argues the Legislature intended that the three-year limitations period for felonies (Pen. Code, \u00a7 801) should control all \u201cwobbler\u201d prosecutions, regardless of whether the offense is in fact reduced to a misdemeanor. We agree with petitioner and issue the writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Petitioner charged the instant offense in a felony complaint filed more than one but less than three years after the alleged violation of the statute. Prior to the preliminary hearing, the People moved to reduce the felony to a misdemeanor under Penal Code section 17, subdivision (b)(5), which provides that a \u201cwobbler\u201d may be treated as \u201ca misdemeanor for all purposes\u201d when \u201cat or before the preliminary examination . . . the magistrate determines that the offense is a misdemeanor, in which event the case shall proceed as if the defendant had been arraigned on a misdemeanor complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">The magistrate granted the motion to reduce the charge to a misdemean- or. Real party then moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the reduction required the complaint to be treated \u201cfor all purposes\u201d as a misdemean- or pleading, and thus was governed by the one-year period of limitations as held by Division One of this court in <em>Keener </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1979) 91 Cal.App.3d 213 [154 Cal.Rptr. 107]. Petitioner responded that <em>Keener </em>had been effectively overruled by the Legislature in former Penal Code section 801, subdivision (b), and the current superseding provision, section 805, subdivision (a), which petitioner contended applied the felony three-year limitations period to \u201cwobblers\u201d without regard to reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">The municipal court agreed with petitioner and denied the motion to dismiss. Real party petitioned the superior court for a writ of prohibition to restrain further prosecution. The superior court granted the writ, effectively preventing petitioner from maintaining its prosecution of real party. Petitioner seeks review from this court under the auspices of Code of Civil Procedure section 904.1, subdivision (a)(4), which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>provides for discretionary appellate review of superior court writs directed to inferior courts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Petitioner renews its argument that <em>Keener </em>has been legislatively overruled and the felony limitations period controls. This contention has merit. The <em>Keener </em>case, decided before the Penal Code\u2019s statutes of limitation were amended, concluded that section 17, subdivision (b)\u2019s phrase \u201cfor all purposes\u201d required that a reduced felony be considered a misdemeanor <em>ab initio </em>and controlled by the misdemeanor statute of limitations. (91 Cal.App.3d at pp. 215-218.) The year following <em>Keener, </em>the Legislature enacted former Penal Code section 801, subdivision (b). (Stats. 1980, ch. 1093, \u00a7 1.) The new statute, an apparent response to <em>Keener's </em>holding, provided that for an \u201coffense . . . that may be tried as a misdemeanor, pursuant to paragraphs (4) and (5) of subdivision (b) of Section 17, respectively, a complaint shall be filed within the time specified in [former] Section 800 [the three-year felony period] for such offense.\u201d Former section 801, subdivision (b) clearly provided that the felony period always apply to \u201cwobbler\u201d complaints, regardless of any reduction to misdemeanor after the filing of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">In 1984, the Legislature repealed the chapter of the Penal Code dealing with statutes of limitations (ch. 2, tit. 3, pt. 2, \u00a7 799 et seq.) and replaced it with the current provisions. (Stats. 1984, ch. 1270, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2.) Current section 805 provides that \u201cFor the purpose of determining the applicable limitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>of time pursuant to this chapter: fl[] (a) An offense is deemed punishable by the maximum punishment prescribed by statute for the offense, regardless of the punishment actually sought or imposed.\u201d The Law Revision Commission comment accompanying the 1984 amendment recites that section 805, subdivision (a) \u201ccontinues the substance of former Section 801(b) (an offense for which a misdemeanor complaint may be filed or that may be tried as a misdemeanor pursuant to Section 17(b)(4)-(5) is subject to the felony statute of limitation).\u201d (West\u2019s Ann. Pen. Code, \u00a7 805, p. 213.)</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The Legislature clearly intends that the felony statute of limitations apply to crimes defined as \u201cwobblers,\u201d without regard to reduction to misdemean- or after the filing of the complaint. Real party has presented no persuasive argument to the contrary. He contends there is an impermissible conflict between section 17, subdivision (b)\u2019s phrase \u201cfor all purposes\u201d and the provisions of section 805, subdivision (a).  The Legislature, however, is within its power to qualify general statutory language by a more specific provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Since the charged offense is subject to the felony statute of limitations, the complaint is not time-barred and the superior court should not have issued the writ of prohibition. We reach this conclusion after full briefing by the parties and after appropriate notice that we might proceed by issuing a peremptory writ in the first instance. <em>(Palma </em>v. <em>U.S. Industrial Fasteners, Inc. </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 171, 177-180 [203 Cal.Rptr. 626, 681 P.2d 893].)</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Accordingly, let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing respondent superior court to vacate its \u201cJudgment Granting Writ of Prohibition\u201d entered May 22, 1987, and to enter in its place and stead a new and different order denying real party\u2019s petition for extraordinary writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Low, P. J., and King, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied October 13, 1987, and the petition of real party in interest for review by the Supreme Court was denied January 6, 1988.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b158-6\"> Real party disputes petitioner\u2019s right of writ review, citing the line of cases which strictly limit the People\u2019s right of writ review when they have no statutory right of appeal. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Howard) (1968) 69 Cal.2d 491 [72 Cal.Rptr. 330, 446 P.2d 138]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Municipal Court (Kong) </em>(1981) 122 Cal.App.3d 176, 181 [175 Cal.Rptr. 861].) \u201cTo permit the People to resort to an extraordinary writ to review where there is no right to appeal would be to give the People the very appeal which the Legislature has denied to them. [Citation.]\u201d (Pe<em>ople </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Howard), </em>supra, 69 Cal.2d at p. 499; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Edmonds) </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 605, 608 [94 Cal.Rptr. 250, 483 P.2d 1202].) The People may obtain writ review of nonappealable orders only under rather narrow circumstances. <em>(Ibid.; </em>see <em>People </em>v. <em>Municipal Court (Kong), supra, </em>122 Cal.App.3d at pp. 181-183.)</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">This line of authority is based on the premise that courts should not expand the People\u2019s right of appellate review when the Legislature has not seen fit to do so. Logically, if the <em>Howard/Edmonds </em>rule applies when the Legislature has not authorized the People to seek appellate review by the device of appeal, the rule should not apply to delimit appellate review when the Legislature has expressly authorized the People to employ the device of extraordinary writ. Code of Civil Procedure section 904.1, subdivision (a)(4), provides that \u201can appellate court may, in its discretion, review a judgment [of a superior court] granting or denying a petition for issuance of a writ of mandamus or prohibition[,] upon petition for an extraordinary writ.\u201d The statute, on its face, is applicable to all petitions from any party to a superior court writ proceeding. Had the Legislature intended no review by the People, it would have clearly so provided; knowing that the <em>Kong </em>court had so employed the statute, the Legislature did not preclude the People\u2019s right of writ review when it amended the statute in 1983 to read in its present form.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Real party\u2019s remaining procedural objections to the petition are without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
