White appeals from a judgment entered after the trial court sustained defendants\u2019 demurrer to plaintiff\u2019s second amended complaint without leave to amend. Plaintiff, a developmentally disabled (handicapped) person residing in Stockton State Hospital, claims defendants wrongfully failed to spend money received by the state under the federal Education of the Handicapped Act (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (hereafter EHA) on handicapped children in state hospitals. As a consequence, the class of eligible children in state hospitals has been and will be denied the free appropriate public education due it under the EHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleged various theories upon which he and his class were entitled either to money damages or to an order compelling defendants to spend EHA funds for their education.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">We conclude plaintiff and his class are not entitled to money damages for any past denial of a free appropriate public education. We further conclude plaintiff and his class cannot pursue a lawsuit to compel the expenditure of current EHA funds for their benefit without first exhausting an available administrative procedure. However, we also conclude plaintiff and his class are entitled to be provided with compensatory educational services to remedy any past denial of services for which they were eligible. Since there is no available administrative remedy to adjudicate the past class-wide, systemic exclusion from the EHA alleged by plaintiff on behalf of his class, plaintiff is not barred from pursuing this action to obtain an adjudication of the entitlement of eligible children in state hospitals to compensatory educational services. In the event plaintiff prevails on his claim, proving a systemic exclusion of handicapped children from EHA services to which they were entitled, any disputes about the compensatory services due each child should be initially resolved through an available administrative procedure under the supervision of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">On July 11, 1983, plaintiff filed his second amended complaint alleging six counts purporting to state separate causes of action The facts alleged in the complaint, which we accept as true <em>(Committee on Children\u2019s Television, Inc. </em>v. <em>General Foods Corp. </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 213 [197 Cal.Rptr. 783, 673 P.2d 660]), are as follows: Plaintiff is a developmentally disabled person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>who has been diagnosed as mentally retarded, autistic, cerebrally palsied and ataxic since the age of two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Between 1977 and 1981, defendant State of California applied for and received federal funds to provide a free appropriate education to handicapped children as mandated by the EHA. These funds were allocated by defendants to public educational institutions and systems in California for the benefit of handicapped children. However, between 1977 and 1981, defendants allocated no EHA funds to the education of eligible students in the California state hospital system which includes Stockton State Hospital in which plaintiff resides.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Plaintiff alleged that the failure to allocate EHA funds for the education of children in state hospitals deprived him, and those similarly situated, of their \u201cliberty interest\u201d in a free appropriate public education in violation of the due process clauses of the state and federal Constitutions. Plaintiff\u2019s first count sought at least $20 million in damages and attorney\u2019s fees under the federal Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983-1988) (hereafter section 1983 or 1988) for violations of the EHA and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794) (hereafter Rehabilitation Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s second count also sought damages under the Civil Rights Act. It realleged the provisions of the first count and alleged that defendants\u2019 acts restricting his free appropriate public education in turn impaired his ability to care for himself and live free from restraint [presumably the restraints of life in state hospitals], all in violation of interests allegedly protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s third count sought specific performance. It alleged defendants entered into a series of annual contracts with the federal government between 1978 and the present to provide plaintiff and his class a free appropriate public education, \u201cbut defendants did fail to allocate any monies received as a result of said agreement for the purpose of providing a free appropriate education to plaintiff, and all other persons similarly situated, who were residents at state hospitals . . . from 1978 until the present.\u201d Plaintiff, as a third party beneficiary, sought to compel defendants to allocate EHA funds received pursuant to the contracts for the benefit of handicapped children in state hospitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s fourth count realleged the pertinent provisions of the first and third counts and sought $20 million in damages for breach of contract. Plaintiff did not allege he complied with the Tort Claims Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 905.2) by timely filing a claim with the State Board of Control.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s fifth count sought to impose a constructive trust on the moneys plaintiff alleges should have been spent on him and on members of his class. It alleged that defendants, as public entities and officials, owed plaintiff a fiduciary duty with regard to distribution of federal funds and failed to take all necessary and reasonable actions to assure that the funds would be hsed for plaintiff\u2019s benefit, so as to provide him a free appropriate public education.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s sixth count sought an accounting of all federal EHA funds received by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Plaintiff did not attempt to exhaust any administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Defendants filed a demurrer to plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleging, among other things, that there existed administrative remedies that plaintiff had failed to exhaust. The trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, noting in its ruling \u201cthe [EHA] has procedures and remedies which must be exhausted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">\n<em>First Count</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">A. <em>An overview of the EHA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">Plaintiff has attempted to state claims under section 1983 and the Rehabilitation Act in addition to the EHA. However, since the EHA is at the center of plaintiff\u2019s universe of claims, plaintiff\u2019s contentions are best understood by beginning with an overview of the EHA furnished by the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">\u201cCongress stated the purpose of the [EHA] in these words: \u2018[T]o assure that all handicapped children have available to them... a free appropriate public education which emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs [and] to assure that the rights of handicapped children and their parents or guardians are protected.\u2019 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">\u201cThe [EHA] defines a \u2018free appropriate public education\u2019 to mean \u2018special education and related services which (A) have- been provided at public expense, under public supervision and direction, and without charge, (B) meet the standards of the State educational agency, (C) include an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>appropriate preschool, elementary, or secondary school education in the State involved, and (D) are provided in conformity with [an] individualized educational program.\u2019 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(18).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\u201cThe <em>modus operandi </em>of the [EHA] is the . . . \u2018individualized educational program [IEP].\u2019 The IEP is in brief a comprehensive statement of the educational needs of a handicapped child and the specially designed instruction and related services to be employed to meet those needs. \u00a7 1401(19). The IEP is to be developed jointly by a school official qualified in special education, a child\u2019s teacher, the parents or guardian, and, where appropriate, the child. In several places, the [EJIA] emphasizes the participation of the parents in developing the child\u2019s educational program and assessing its effectiveness. See \u00a7\u00a7 1400(c), 1401(19), 1412(7), 1415(b)(1)(A), (C), (D), (E), and 1415(b)(2); 34 CFR \u00a7 300.345 (1984).\u201d <em>(Burlington School Comm. </em>v. <em>Mass.

The [EHA] represents an ambitious federal effort to promote the education of handicapped children, and was passed in response to Congress\u2019 perception that a majority of handicapped children in the United States \u2018were either totally excluded from schools or [were] sitting idly in regular classrooms awaiting the time when they were old enough to \u201cdrop out.\u201d \u2019 HR Rep No. 94-332, p 2 (1975)(HR Rep). . . . [fl] In order to qualify for federal financial assistance under the [EHA], a State must demonstrate that it \u2018has in effect a policy that assures all handicapped children the right to a free appropriate public education.\u2019 20 USC \u00a7 1412(1) [20 USCS \u00a7 1412(1)]. That policy must be reflected in a state plan submitted to and approved by the Secretary of Education, \u00a7 1413, which describes in detail the goals, programs, and timetables under which the State intends to educate handicapped children within its borders. \u00a7\u00a7 1412, 1413. . . . The [EHA] broadly defines \u2018handicapped children\u2019 to include \u2018mentally retarded, hard of hearing, deaf, speech impaired, visually handicapped, seriously emotionally disturbed, orthopedically impaired, [and] other health impaired children, [and] children with specific learning disabilities.\u2019 \u00a7 1401(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">. . [T]he [EHA] imposes extensive procedural requirements upon States receiving federal funds under its provisions. Parents or guardians of handicapped children must be notified of any proposed change in \u2018the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child or the provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>of a free appropriate public education to such child,\u2019 and must be permitted to bring a complaint about \u2018any matter relating to\u2019 such evaluation and education. \u00a7\u00a7 1415(b)(1)(D) and (E). Complaints brought by parents or guardians must be resolved at \u2018an impartial due process hearing,\u2019 and appeal to the state educational agency must be provided if the initial hearing is held at the local or regional level. \u00a7\u00a7 1415(b)(2) and (c). Thereafter, \u2018[a]ny party aggrieved by the findings and decision\u2019 of the state administrative hearing has \u2018the right to bring a civil action with respect to the complaint ... in any State court of competent jurisdiction or in a district court of the United States without regard to the amount in controversy.\u2019 \u00a7 1415(e)(2).\u201d <em>(Hendrick Hudson Dist Bd. of Ed. </em>v. <em>Rowley </em>(1982) 458 U.S. 176, 179-183 [73 L.Ed.2d 690, 695-697, 102 S.Ct. 3034], fns. omitted; see <em>Irving Independent School Dist. </em>v. <em>Tatro </em>(1984) 468 U.S. 883 [82 L.Ed.2d 664, 669-670, 104 S.Ct. 3371].)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">The EHA payment system is set out in sections 1411 and 1414. Section 1411(d) provides that from the total of federal funds available, \u201ceach local educational agency or intermediate educational unit shall be entitled to an amount [proportioned to] the number of handicapped children aged three to twenty-one, . . . receiving special education and related services in such local educational agency . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cSpecial education\u201d is defined as \u201cspecially designed instruction . . . <em>including . . . instruction in hospitals and insti</em>tutions.\u201d (\u00a7 1401(16), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Section 1414 provides a means of reallocating EHA funds. Subsection (d) of that section provides that whenever a local educational agency is unable or unwilling to provide the required services or has handicapped children best served by a regional or state center, the \u201cState educational agency shall use the payments which would have been available to such local educational agency to provide\u201d the appropriate services. Subsection (e) of section 1414 provides that the state \u201cmay reallocate funds . . . made available to [a \u2018local educational agency\u2019]\u201d only when the state \u201cdetermines that [it] is adequately providing a free appropriate public education to all handicapped children residing in the area served by such agency with State and local funds otherwise available to such agency . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>California has elected to participate in the federal EHA program and has enacted a comprehensive set of laws governing special education.

California\u2019s implementing statutes (Ed. Code, \u00a7 56000 et seq.) include provisions containing the EHA\u2019s procedural safeguards. (\u00a7 1415; Ed. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 56500-56507.) The Education Code\u2019s procedural safeguards are implemented in title 5 of the California Administrative Code, section 3081, which provides for notice and a hearing by an independent hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">B. <em>Plaintiff may use section 1983 to obtain an adjudication that the federal statutory rights of the class were violated.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s first count seeks at least $20 million in damages under section 1983 for alleged violations of the EHA and the Rehabilitation Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These statutory violations allegedly deprived plaintiff and his class of their constitutionally protected liberty interest in a free appropriate public education.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\"> Plaintiff has plainly pleaded a wrong done by defendants to him and his class, since \u201cthe [EHA] establishes an enforceable substantive right to a free appropriate public education.

Moreover, the pleadings are sufficient to allege the systemic denial of a free appropriate public education between 1977 and 1981 was caused by the illegal allocation of EHA funds in violation of sections 1411 and/or 1414. Thus, the questions at hand are whether plaintiff can pursue this action under section 1983 or whether he must assert his claims exclusively under the EHA, and whether damages are an appropriate remedy for the pleaded wrongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>1. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Robinson, supra, 468 U.S. 992 [82 L.Ed.2d 746], precludes resort to section 1983 if plaintiff and his class have a remedy under the EHA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Section 1983 provides in relevant part that \u201cEvery person who, under color of [state law] subjects . . . any . . . person ... to the deprivation of any rights, privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution <em>and laws, </em>shall be hable to the party injured . . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">In <em>Maine </em>v. <em>Thiboutot </em>(1980) 448 U.S. 1 [65 L.Ed.2d 555, 100 S.Ct. 2802] respondents brought an action under section 1983 claiming they had been denied monetary welfare benefits to which they were entitled under a statute comprising a part of the federal Social Security Act. The court concluded the \u201cplain language\u201d of section 1983, referring to \u201claws,\u201d entitled respondents to relief under section 1983 for a violation of federal statutory law. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 4-5 [65 L.Ed.2d at pp. 559-560].)</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">Plaintiff contends <em>Maine </em>entitles him and his class to pursue the present action under section 1983 for damages premised on defendants\u2019 failure to appropriate EHA funds to be used for their education in violation of the EHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">However, the section 1983 remedy approved in <em>Maine </em>has been subject to subsequent judicial narrowing. (See <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Roanoke Redev. &amp; Housing Auth. </em>(1987) 479 U.S. 418, 423 [93 L.Ed.2d 781, 788, 107 S.Ct. 766].) Thus, for example, section 1983 is not available to redress a federal statutory violation where a federal statutory scheme provides a judicial remedy leaving \u201cno room for additional private remedies under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 423 [93 L.Ed.2d at p. 788; see <em>Middlesex Cty. Sewerage Auth. </em>v. <em>Sea Clammers </em>(1981) 453 U.S. 1 [69 L.Ed.2d 435, 101 S.Ct. 2615].)</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Robinson, supra, </em>468 U.S. 992 [82 L.Ed.2d 746], the Supreme Court considered the interrelationship of section 1983, the Rehabilitation Act, and the EHA. The petitioners, a handicapped child and his parents, alleged members of a local school committee had wrongfully refused to pay the costs for special education for the child. The petitioners asserted claims under the EHA and the Rehabilitation Act as well as section 1983 claims premised on constitutional deprivations of due process and equal protection. (468 U.S. at p. 1000 [82 L.Ed.2d at p. 757].) The petitioners\u2019 constitutional claims were virtually identical to their EHA claims. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1009 [82 L.Ed.2d at p. 763].) The court was thus confronted with the question, \u201cwhether Congress intended that the EHA be the exclusive avenue through which a plaintiff may assert those claims.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>The court concluded \u201cThe EHA is a comprehensive scheme set up by Congress to aid the States in complying with their constitutional obligations to provide public education for handicapped children. Both the provisions of the statute and its legislative history indicate that Congress intended handicapped children with constitutional claims to a free appropriate public education to pursue those claims through the carefully tailored administrative and judicial mechanism set out in the state [sic].\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The court reasoned, \u201cIn light of the comprehensive nature of the procedures and guarantees set out in the EHA and Congress\u2019 express efforts to place on local and state educational agencies the primary responsibility for developing a plan to accommodate the needs of each individual handicapped child, we find it difficult to believe that Congress also meant to leave undisturbed the ability of a handicapped child to go directly to court with an equal protection claim to a free appropriate public education. Not only would such a result render superfluous most of the detailed procedural protections outlined in the statute, but, more important, it would also run counter to Congress\u2019 view that the needs of handicapped children are best accommodated by having the parents and the local education agency work together to formulate an individualized plan for each handicapped child\u2019s education.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1011-1012, fn. omitted [82 L.Ed.2d at pp. 764-765].) <em>Smith </em>concluded neither section 1983 nor the Rehabilitation Act was available to vindicate plaintiff\u2019s EHA claims. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 1009, 1016 [82 L.Ed.2d at pp. 763, 767-768].)</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">2. <em>The EHA affords no procedure to adjudicate plaintiff\u2019s claim of unlawful class exclusion from the EHA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">Does <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>require plaintiff to proceed exclusively under the EHA and to exhaust the section 1415 administative procedure before pursuing this action? We think a later case, <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Roanoke Redev. &amp; Housing Auth., supra, </em>479 U.S. at p. 423 [93 L.Ed.2d at p. 788] compels the conclusion plaintiff can use section 1983 to obtain an adjudication that plaintiff and his class were unlawfully excluded from receipt of EHA services in years past.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">In <em>Wright, </em>the court considered whether tenants could pursue a class action under section 1983 against a local housing authority that had violated federal law imposing ceilings on rents. The court noted it could not lightly conclude Congress intended to preclude reliance on section 1983 as a remedy for deprivation of a federal statutory right. <em>(Wright, supra, </em>479 U.S. at pp. 423, 427 [93 L.Ed.2d at pp.788, 791].)</p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>The court concluded the statutory scheme evidenced no intent by Congress to preclude a section 1983 claim. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 429 [93 L.Ed.2d at p. 792].) Addressing the availability of an administrative remedy required by statute (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437d(k); 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 966.51(b)), the court twice noted the remedy made no provision for class relief. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 426, 427 [93 L.Ed.2d at pp. 790, 791].)</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">To be sure, <em>Wright </em>remarked that the EHA \u201cstatutes . . . themselves provided for private judicial remedies, thereby evidencing congressional intent to supplant the \u00a7 1983 remedy.\u201d (479 U.S. at p. 427 [93 L.Ed.2d at p. 791].) However, that remark must be read along with <em>Wright\u2019s </em>characterization of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>as a case that \u201cheld that allowing a plaintiff to circumvent the Education of the Handicapped Act\u2019s administrative remedies would be inconsistent with Congress\u2019 carefully tailored scheme, which itself allowed private parties to seek remedies for violating federal law.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 423 [93 L.Ed.2d at p. 788].) Of course, as <em>Wright </em>itself holds, we cannot infer that Congress intended to make citizens resort to an administrative procedure\u2014to the exclusion of section 1983\u2014where the administrative procedure fails to supply a remedy. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>itself acknowledged that limitation, strictly holding \u201cthat <em>where the EHA is available </em>to a handicapped child asserting a right to a free appropriate public education, based either on the EHA or on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the EHA is the exclusive avenue through which the child and his parents or guardian can pursue their claim.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>468 U.S. at p. 1013 [82 L.Ed.2d at p.766], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">These inferences of congressional intent are consistent with the established rule placing limitations on the requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies.  \u201cIt is settled that the rule requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies does not apply where an administrative remedy is unavailable [citation] or inadequate [citation].\u201d <em>(Tiernan </em>v. <em>Trustees of Cal. State University &amp; Colleges </em>(1982) 33 Cal.3d 211, 217 [188 Cal.Rptr. 115, 655 P.2d 317].) A corollary of this rule excuses resort to an administrative procedure where class relief is sought and the administrative procedure affords no remedy for the class. <em>(Ramos </em>v. <em>County of Madera </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 685, 690-691 [94 Cal.Rptr. 421, 484 P.2d 93]; <em>Rose </em>v. <em>City of Hayward </em>(1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 926, 935 [179 Cal.Rptr. 287]; see <em>Lowry </em>v. <em>Obledo </em>(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 14, 25 [169 Cal.Rptr. 732].)</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The EHA contains no administrative procedure by which plaintiff can obtain an adjudication that his class was systemically excluded from EHA entitlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The EHA \u201cmakes no specific provision for the bringing of class actions.\u201d (Note, <em>Enforcing the Right to an </em>\u201cAppropriate\u201d Education: <em>The Education </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number><em>for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 </em>(1979) 92 Harv.L.Rev. 1103, 1113; Annot, Exhaustion of State Administrative Remedies Under \u00a7 615 of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (20 USCS \u00a7 1415) (1983) 62 A.L.R. Fed. 376.) Thus, for example, the fair hearing procedures set forth in section 1415(b) uniformly permit use by the parents or guardians of <em>\u201cthe </em>child\u201d or <em>\u201csuch </em>child.\u201d (Italics added.) Education Code section 56501, subdivision (a), provides in pertinent part that, \u201cThe due process hearing procedures prescribed by this chapter extend to <em>the </em>pupil, <em>the </em>parent, and the public education agency involved . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) The hearing procedures in section 3081 of title 5 of the California Administrative Code are described in subdivision (a) of section 3080 of that code as applicable to <em>\u201ca </em>parent\u201d and <em>\u201cthe </em>pupil.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The EHA administrative procedures are not designed to process claims of systemic unlawful funding abuses. (See <em>Medley </em>v. <em>Ginsberg </em>(S.D.W.Va. 1980) 492 F.Supp. 1294, 1309.) Indeed, addressing California\u2019s EHA administrative remedy provided in Education Code section 56500, this court noted in <em>Nevada County Office of Education </em>v. <em>Riles </em>(1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 767 [197 Cal.Rptr. 152]: \u201cLarger systemic issues, such as which government agency should provide or pay for the . . . services needed, involve only tangentially the parent and pupil, and would clearly expand the scope of the administrative hearing beyond that contemplated in Education Code section 56500 et seq.\u201d (Pp. 776-777, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Since the EHA administrative procedures make no provision to adjudicate the systemic grievance plaintiff has alleged, we shall not infer that Congress intended to preclude resort to section 1983 to obtain the sought-after adjudication. <em>(Wright </em>v. <em>Roanoke Redev. &amp; Housing Auth., supra, </em>479 U.S. at pp. 428, 429 [93 L.Ed.2d at pp. 791-792]; see <em>Lowry </em>v. <em>Obledo, supra, </em>111 Cal.App.3d at pp.24-25; see 3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Actions, \u00a7 238, pp. 269-271.) A contrary conclusion would mean that every hospitalized handicapped child would have to initiate and pursue his or her own claim through the administrative procedure in order to show an entitlement to EHA services from which the class was unlawfully excluded. While we shall later conclude individual administrative appeals would be appropriate when initiated and supervised by order of court, we cannot believe Congress intended to place the burden on handicapped children or their parents to initiate separate administrative claims in the circumstances pleaded here.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">3. <em>Plaintiff\u2019s claims to past unlawful exclusion from the EHA are not barred by his failure to exhaust administrative remedies in section 3080 of title 5 of the California Administrative Code.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">Defendants contend plaintiff\u2019s claims are barred by his failure to exhaust administrative procedures set forth in section 3080 of title 5 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>California Administrative Code. (All further references to section 3080 are to this regulation.) We shall have more to say about these procedures later. For present purposes, we need note only that the statutory origin of section 3080 is found in section 1221e-3(a)(l), which empowers the Secretary of Education of the United States to promulgate rules and regulations governing the programs administered by the Department of Education. The pertinent federal regulations are set forth in 34 Code of Federal Regulations sections 76.780 through 76.783. Section 76.780 states in relevant part, \u201c(a) A State shall adopt written procedures for\u2014fl|] (1) Receiving and resolving any complaint that the State or a subgrantee is violating a Federal statute or regulations that apply to a program; . . .\u201d Section 76.780 is found in sub-part G of part 76 of 34 Code of Federal Regulations. Part 76 is \u201cState-Administered Programs.\u201d Subpart G is: \u201cWhat Are the Administrative Responsibilities of the State and its Subgrantees?\u201d The first regulation in subpart G says, \u201cA State and a subgrantee shall comply with the State plan and applicable statutes, regulations, and approved applications, and shall use Federal funds in accordance with those statutes, regulations, plan, and applications.\u201d (34 C.F.R. \u00a7 76.700.) Consequently, section 3080 is intended to provide a procedure whereby persons may complain that federal funds are not being used in accordance with the state plan and applicable statutes and regulations. If ultimately sustained at the federal level, enforcement is achieved by issuance of cease and desist orders (34 C.F.R. \u00a7 78.34) and by withholding federal funds or certification to the Attorney General (34 C.F.R. \u00a778.86).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">There are two reasons why plaintiff need not exhaust the section 3080 procedure before pursuing his section 1983 action. First, the existence of a state administrative remedy does not ordinarily foreclose resort to section 1983. <em>(Patsy </em>v. <em>Florida Board of Regents </em>(1982) 457 U.S. 496, 516 [73 L.Ed.2d 172, 187-188, 102 S.Ct. 2557].) The section 3080 procedure constitutes such a state administrative remedy even though it is established pursuant to the authority of a federal statute. (See <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Roanoke Redev. &amp; Housing Auth., supra, </em>479 U.S. at p. 427 [93 L.Ed.2d at p. 791].)</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Second, exhaustion is not required because the section 3080 procedure provides no effective remedy for <em>past wrongs </em>done plaintiff and his class; the withholding of federal funds, for example, does not make plaintiff and his class whole. (See <em>Kling </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(9th Cir. 1980) 633 F.2d 876, 879; <em>Camenisch </em>v. <em>University of Texas </em>(5th Cir. 1980) 616 F.2d 127, 135.)</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">We therefore hold plaintiff may pursue his class action under section 1983 to try to prove that he and his class were unlawfully systemically excluded from EHA services between 1977 and 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>C. <em>Should plaintiff prove he and his class were unlawfully excluded from EHA services, they are entitled to compensatory educational services; money damages are unavailable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">This leaves the question whether plaintiff and his class are entitled to money damages should they succeed in proving the asserted unlawful exclusion from EHA entitlement. The United States Supreme Court has not decided whether money damages are available under section 1983 for violation of a plaintiff\u2019s federal statutory rights. <em>(Newport </em>v. <em>Fact Concerts, Inc. </em>(1981) 453 U.S. 247, 270 [69 L.Ed.2d 617, 634, 101 S.Ct. 2748].) For a variety of reasons, we conclude money damages are neither necessary nor appropriate to redress the pleaded wrongs done plaintiff and his class.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">1. <em>Compensatory educational services are available.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">First, we do not think money damages are necessary to compensate plaintiff and his class because the children can be supplied with compensatory EHA services to make them whole. Unlike the Social Security Act at issue in <em>Maine </em>v. <em>Thiboutot, supra, </em>448 U.S. 1, the EHA grants plaintiff no entitlement to any money. Rather, his statutory entitlement is to educational <em>services </em>comprising a free appropriate public education. (\u00a7 1412(1); 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.121(a).) This entitlement exists irrespective of whether the state allocates EHA funds for services to be provided to plaintiff. \u201cThe State educational agency, as a recipient of [EHA] funds is responsible for insuring that all public agencies in the State comply with the provisions of the Act, regardless of whether they receive [EHA] funds. If a local educational agency elects not to apply for its [EHA] entitlement, the State would be required to use those funds to insure that a free appropriate public education (FAPE) is made available to children residing in the area served by that local agency. However, if the local entitlement is not sufficient for this purpose, additional State or local funds would have to be expended in order to insure that \u2018FAPE\u2019 and the other requirements of the Act are met.\u201d (Com. to 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.360.) \u201cEach State may use whatever State, local, Federal, and private sources of support are available in the State to meet the requirements of [the EHA].\u201d (34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.301(a); see \u00a7\u00a7 1401(18); 1412(2)(B).)</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\"> Since plaintiff and his class have no statutory entitlement to receive any EHA funds, their claim for damages<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is ultimately premised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>on the denial of a free appropriate public education. If the EHA provides a remedy whereby plaintiff and his class can obtain the free appropriate public education due them, then, in our view, they have not been substantially damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">We see no reason why the EHA cannot provide plaintiff and his class with the free appropriate public education he claims they were denied. The EHA can furnish plaintiff and his class \u201ccompensatory educational services,\u201d i.e., remedial services to make up for services lost when the state violated its duty to provide a free appropriate education. (See Com., <em>Compensatory Educational Services and the Education for All Handicapped Children Act </em>(1984) Wis.L.Rev. 1469.)</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Plaintiff was bom on March 4, 1960. Plaintiff first filed the complaint on July 21, 1982, after he had turned 22. In order to receive EHA funds, states must provide free appropriate education to handicapped children between the ages of three and twenty-one inclusive.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (\u00a7 1412(2)(B); 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.121(a); Sen. Rep. No. 94-168, p. 16 [paramount goal is to provide free appropriate public education to all handicapped children aged three through twenty-one].) Ordinarily there is no duty under the EHA to furnish a free appropriate public education to a . person over age 21. (See, e.g., <em>Georgia Ass\u2019n of Retarded Citizens </em>v. <em>McDaniel </em>(11th Cir. 1983) 716 F.2d 1565, 1579; <em>Timms </em>v. <em>Metro. Sch. Dist. of Wabash County, Ind. </em>(7th Cir. 1983) 722 F.2d 1310, 1314.)</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">However, in <em>Burlington School Comm. </em>v. <em>Mass. Dept. of Ed., supra, </em>471 U.S. 359, the Supreme Court held local authorities could be made to reimburse parents for costs of special education, paid by the parents, that should have been furnished under EHA. (471 U.S. at p. 371 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 396].) The court emphasized the relief was available under the administrative procedures required by the EHA. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 371, 374 [85 L.Ed.2d at pp. 396, 397-398].) Had plaintiff\u2019s parents furnished the special education services he claims he was wrongfully denied between 1977 and 1981, <em>Burlington </em>would authorize reimbursement. We cannot believe EHA-eligible children may obtain relief only if their parents have the financial resources to pay initially for services wrongfully denied under the EHA. Rather, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>conclude plaintiff and his class are entitled to be provided with compensatory educational services, funded by state monies, if necessary, to \u201ccompensate\u201d them for any services wrongfully denied him under the EHA. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has also read <em>Burlington </em>as requiring that compensatory educational services be furnished to a handicapped child who was entitled to EHA services but is now beyond the age of ordinary entitlement. <em>(Miener By and Through Miener </em>v. <em>State of Mo. </em>(8th Cir. 1986) 800 F.2d 749, 754.)</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Thus, should plaintiff prevail on his claims that he and his class were systemically denied EHA services in years past the trial court should enter a declaratory judgment establishing the entitlement of the class to compensatory EHA services. The trial court can fashion an appropriate method of notifying class members of their entitlement to compensatory services and of insuring that they receive them. Thus, for example, in the event of any dispute as to the nature or extent of compensatory services to be provided any class member, the court can order defendants to resolve the dispute initially using the EHA administrative procedure under the continuing supervision of the court. (See <em>Employment Development Dept. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 256, 266 [178 Cal.Rptr. 612, 636 P.2d 575].)</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">2. <em>It would be anomalous to have different remedies for those asserting individual EHA claims and those asserting class claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">There are additional reasons why money damages are inappropriate in the pleaded circumstances.  It is well settled that no tort damages are available under the EHA except in circumstances not pleaded here, i.e., where administrators have denied a procedural remedy in bad faith or where a child\u2019s physical health has been endangered by denial of services. (See <em>Department of Educ., State of Haw. </em>v. <em>Katherine D. </em>(9th Cir. 1983)727 F.2d 809, 820, cert. den. 471 U.S. 1117 [86 L.Ed.2d 260, 105 S.Ct. 2360]; <em>Timms </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Sch. Dist. of Wabash Cty. </em>(7th Cir. 1983) 718 F.2d 212, 216; <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Defore </em>(11th Cir. 1983) 699 F.2d 1078, 1081; <em>Monahan </em>v. <em>State of Neb. </em>(8th Cir. 1982) 687 F.2d 1164, 1169; <em>Miener </em>v. <em>State of Mo. </em>(8th Cir. 1982) 673 F.2d 969, 979-980; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(7th Cir. 1981) 658 F.2d 1205, 1208-1211 [63 A.L.R.Fed. 197].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It would be anomalous to have the availability of a damages remedy depend on whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>the plaintiffs were members of a class alleging systemic wrongs sufficient to avoid initially the EHA administrative mechanism, thereby entitling them to pursue an action under section 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">3. <em>Money damages are against congressional and public policy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Moreover, the avoidance of a damages remedy is consistent with Congress\u2019s intent to allow the limited financial resources of states to be spent on the education of handicapped children rather than on damages. (See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Robinson, supra, </em>468 U.S. at p. 1020 [82 L.Ed.2d at p. 770].)</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Finally, we note that under section 1983, a state officer acting under color of law may be <em>personally </em>liable for damages. <em>(Monroe </em>v. <em>Pape </em>(1961) 365 U.S. 167, 172 [5 L.Ed.2d 492, 497, 81 S.Ct. 473] overruled on other grounds <em>in Monell </em>v. <em>New York City Dept. of Soc. Serv. </em>(1978) 436 U.S. 658, 701 [56 L.Ed.2d 611, 641-642, 98 S.Ct. 2018].) Putting aside questions of immunity of state officers not addressed by the parties, we doubt whether the wholesale importation of the personal liability doctrine into the arena of state administration of education would have a salutory effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">4. <em>Enactment of the Handicapped Children\u2019s Protection Act of 1986 does not entitle plaintiff and his class to money damages.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">In 1986 Congress enacted the Handicapped Children\u2019s Protection Act of 1986 (Pub.L. No. 99-372, 100 Stats. 796-797, eff. Aug. 5, 1986; hereafter Protection Act) which was intended to overcome much of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Robinson. </em>(See 1986 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, pp. 1799-1811.)</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">In pertinent part, the Protection Act added subsections (e)(4) and (f) to section 1415. Subsection (e)(4) authorizes reasonable attorney\u2019s fee awards under the EHA, thus eliminating one major disparity between the EHA on the one hand, and section 1983 and the Rehabilitation Act on the other.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Subsection (f) addressed the key issue considered by the court in <em>Smith-, </em>the EHA\u2019s effect on other laws. Subsection (f) provides: \u201cNothing in this title shall he construed to restrict or limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available under the Constitution, title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 790 et seq.], or other Federal statutes protecting the rights of handicapped children and youth, except that before the filing of a civil action under such laws seeking relief that is also available under this part, the procedures under subsections (b)(2) and (c) shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be required had the action been brought under this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>part.\u201d Subsections (b)(2) and (c) refer to the due process hearing procedures available at the local and state levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">In an uncodified section 5, the Protection Act provides: \u201cThe amendment made by section 2 [adding subsection (e)(4), related to attorneys fees but <em>not </em>subsection (f) related to other remedies] shall apply with respect to actions or proceedings brought under section 615(e) of the Education of the Handicapped Act [\u00a7 1415(e)] after July 3, 1984, and actions or proceedings brought prior to July 4, 1984, under such section which were pending on July 4, 1984.\u201d (Pub.L. No. 99-372, 100 Stat. 797.)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">In a supplemental brief plaintiff contends his claims for money damages, premised on section 1983 and the Rehabilitation Act, are expressly authorized by subsection (f) of section 1415, added by the Protection Act. However, for reasons explained at length in <em>Silane </em>v. <em>Tirozzi </em>(D.Conn. 1987) 651 F.Supp. 1021 at pages 1024-1026, which we need not replicate here, we conclude subsection (f) of section 1415 does not apply retroactively to claims, such as plaintiff\u2019s, that arose between 1977 and 1981, before the effective date of the Protection Act: August 5, 1986.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">For these reasons then, we conclude that plaintiff and his class can use section 1983 to prove the pleaded deprivation of EHA entitlement. However, should they succeed, their remedy is compensatory educational services under the EH\u00c1, not money damages.  Although a demurrer was properly sustained as to plaintiff\u2019s first count for damages, it is a \u201cwell accepted principle that against a <em>general </em>demurrer the only requirement is that upon a consideration of all the facts stated it must appear plaintiff is entitled to some relief, notwithstanding that . . . plaintiff may demand relief to which he is not entitled under the facts alleged. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Selby Realty Co. </em>v. <em>City of San Buenaventura </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 110, 123 [109 Cal.Rptr. 799, 514 P.2d 111], italics added.) Since plaintiff and his class were entitled to some relief, the general demurrer to the first count was erroneously sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">\n<em>Second Count</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s second count differs from his first only as to the alleged consequences of defendants\u2019 alleged violation: whereas in the first count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>defendants denied plaintiff his liberty interest in a free appropriate public education, in the second count the lack of education <em>in turn </em>deprived plaintiff of another asserted liberty interest, that of being able to care for himself and to live free of the restraints of state hospitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">We perceive no material difference between the first and second counts; our prior discussion therefore applies to this count as well. The general demurrer to this count was erroneously sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">\n<em>Third Count</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">\n<em>Plaintiff Cannot Pursue His Third Count for Specific Performance Until He Has Exhausted His Administrative Remedy Under Section 3080</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s third count seeks a decree of specific performance commanding defendants to perform their obligations under their EHA \u201ccontracts\u201d with the federal government. Plaintiff, as a third party beneficiary, wants defendants ordered to allocate a portion of their EHA funds to a specific use: providing a free appropriate public education to handicapped children in state hospitals. Plaintiff again seeks this relief for himself and for his class. Plaintiff attached to his complaint, as an example of the contracts in question, the fiscal year 1978 plan submitted by the state to the federal government as required by sections 1412 and 1413.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Defendants do not dispute that the plan is a contract between the federal government and the state. (See <em>Bossier Parish School Board </em>v. <em>Lemon </em>(5th Cir. 1967) 370 F.2d 847.) The plan does not allocate any EHA funds to state hospitals.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Plaintiff relies particularly on the following language in the 1978 plan as the basis of defendants\u2019 contractual duty: \u201cThe State Educational Agency is responsible for assuring that the requirements of [the EHA] are carried out and that each educational program for handicapped children administered within the State, including all programs administered by any other State or local agency, is under the general supervision of the State Education Agency persons responsible for educational programs for handicapped children</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Plaintiff has made no argument nor cited authority supporting the view that defendant may somehow be ordered to allocate EHA funds already spent in years past. To the extent plaintiff and his class were systemically denied their EHA entitlement to services in years past, they may proceed under the first count, with an amendment of the complaint to encompass later years if appropriate. Here, we assume the assertion is that defendants are currently unlawfully refusing to allocate available EHA funds to children in state hospitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">For present purposes we shall assume plaintiff has standing as a third party beneficiary to compel defendants to comply with their contractual duty to spend EHA funds in accordance with the law. (See <em>Zigas </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 827, 838 [174 Cal.Rptr. 806]; compare <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>Socoma Companies, Inc. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 394, 401 [113 Cal.Rptr. 585, 521 P.2d 841]; <em>Dateline Builders, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Santa Rosa </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 520, 527 [194 Cal.Rptr. 258].) <em>However, in this instance, plaintiff has gone to court prematurely before exhausting an available administrative remedy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">We recently had occasion to remark, \u201cThe doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies, it has been held, is not a matter of judicial discretion but is a fundamental rule of procedure. <em>(Abelleira </em>v. <em>District Court of Appeal </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 280, 293 [109 P.2d 942, 132 A.L.R. 715].) \u2018In brief, the rule is that where an administrative remedy is provided by statute, relief must be sought from the administrative body and this remedy exhausted before the courts will act.\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at p. 292.) When no exception applies, the exhaustion of an administrative remedy is a jurisdictional prerequisite to resort to the courts. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 293.)\u201d <em>(County of Contra Costa </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 62, 73 [222 Cal.Rptr. 750].)</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies has been applied to bar judicial relief premised on contractual rights where an unexhausted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>governmental administrative remedy would resolve the contractual dispute.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (See, e.g., <em>McKee </em>v. <em>Bell-Carter Olive Co. </em>(1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 1230, 1239 [231 Cal.Rptr. 304] [statutory administrative remedy existed to resolve contract dispute between olive producer and olive processor]; <em>Yamaha Motor Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 1232, 1242 [230 Cal.Rptr. 382] [dispute under franchise contract subject to resolution by New Motor Vehicle Board]; <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Norcal Mutual Ins.

We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Subdivision (a) of section 3080 provides in pertinent part: \u201cThis section applies to the filing of a complaint, in accordance with provisions of Title 34, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 76.780-783, regarding a public education agency\u2019s alleged violation of federal or state law or regulation relating to the provision of a free appropriate public education.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Section 3080 is designed to process precisely the sort of complaint plaintiff has pleaded in this count\u2014that the state is using federal EHA funds in violation of a federal statute.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (See 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 76.700.)</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>We see no reason why the section 3080 procedure would not allow the Superintendent and the State Board of Education to remedy any present unlawful denial of EHA funds to agencies responsible for providing a free appropriate education to plaintiff and his class.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">However, plaintiff contends that, even if resort to section 3080 is normally required as a prerequisite to obtaining judicial relief, that requirement is excused in the present case on the basis of futility.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (See generally, <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Ambach </em>(2d Cir. 1981) 668 F.2d 635, 640-641, followed in <em>Jose P. </em>v. <em>Ambach </em>(2d Cir. 1982) 669 F.2d 865, 869.)</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Plaintiff alleged in his complaint that \u201cit would have been futile to seek [administrative] relief as a result of the failure of Area VI Developmental Disabilities Board, an agency of the State of California, to obtain <em>comparable, but not identical, relief </em>in the matter styled <em>Area VI Developmental Disabilities Board </em>v. <em>Wilson C. Riles, et al. </em>...\u201d (Italics added.) This allegation of futility is insufficient as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Futility is a narrow exception to the general rule requiring a plaintiff to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>(Sea &amp; Sage Audubon Society, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Com. </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 412, 418 [194 Cal.Rptr. 357, 668 P.2d 664]; <em>County of Contra Costa </em>v. <em>State of California, supra, 177 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 77; <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>City of Chino </em>(1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 673, 683 [172 Cal.Rptr. 844]; <em>see Edgren </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 515, 520 [205 Cal.Rptr. 6].) In <em>Gantner &amp; Mattem Co. </em>v. <em>California E. Com. </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 314 [109 P.2d 932] our Supreme Court long ago explained that exhaustion of administrative remedies is required unless the petitioner can positively state that the administrative body <em>has declared what its ruling will be in the particular case. </em>(P. 318; see <em>George Arakelian Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 654, 662 [221 Cal.Rptr. 488, 710 P.2d 288]; <em>Sea &amp; Sage, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 418; <em>County of Contra Costa, supra, 177 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 78; <em>Edgren, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.3d at pp. 520-521; <em>Doyle, supra, </em>117 Cal.App.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>p. 683.) Plaintiff\u2019s allegation that the Developmental Disabilities Board was unable to obtain \u201ccomparable, but not identical\u201d relief in a different case is not the unequivocal declaration contemplated by these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Plaintiff also contends it would have been futile to seek relief from the Superintendent of Public Instruction because the superintendent would be the ultimate decisionmaker in any administrative proceeding and would be reluctant to upset his own decision. In support of this contention, plaintiff cites authority holding that a demand need not be made on public officials before suit is filed to redress breach of a duty imposed by law.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (See <em>Briare </em>v. <em>Matthews </em>(1927) 202 Cal. 1, 8-9 [258 P. 939]; <em>Osburn </em>v. <em>Stone </em>(1915) 170 Cal. 480, 483 [150 P. 367]; <em>Mock </em>v. <em>City of Santa Rosa </em>(1899) 126 Cal. 330, 342 [58 P. 826]; <em>Wool </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1956) 140 Cal.App.2d 835, 846 [296 P.2d 17]; <em>Citizens\u2019 etc. Pensions </em>v. <em>Bd. of Supervisors </em>(1949) 91 Cal.App.2d 658, 660 [205 P.2d 761]; <em>Newberry </em>v. <em>Evans </em>(1929) 97 Cal.App. 120, 125 [275 P. 465].)</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Putting aside the question whether under section 3080 the superintendent is the final decisionmaker in light of the roles of the Board of Education and the federal Education Department, it appears plaintiff has overlooked a crucial distinction between a mere demand for compliance and the administrative remedy at issue here. Unlike a mere demand, the procedure under section 3080 contemplates that a complainant will supply information in support of his claim; the procedure includes a right to respond to information from the agency and features an investigation and report. (See fn. 13, <em>ante.) </em>The available administrative remedy therefore allows plaintiff the opportunity to inform the superintendent fully of the basis of his claim of illegality and requires a response.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We will not assume the superintendent would persist in any illegality shown to exist.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Moreover, should an unlawful allocation of contract funds be shown a lawful allocation would provide a remedy for plaintiff\u2019s class. In these circumstances, it is simply not futile to require plaintiff to pursue his contract claim to resolution under section 3080. (Cf. <em>Sessions </em>v. <em>Livingston Parish School Bd. </em>(M.D.La. 1980) 501 F.Supp. 251, 254 [62 A.L.R.Fed. 369]; cf. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Mara\u00f1a Unified Sch. Dist. of Pima County </em>(9th Cir. 1984) 735 F.2d 1178, 1181 [rehg. by state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>review officer excused where plaintiffs had obtained two prior hearings by state review officers]; <em>Christopher T </em>v. <em>San Fran. Unified Sch. Dist. of Pima County </em>(N.D.Cal. 1982) 553 F.Supp. 1107, 1117 [plaintiff obtained favorable decision from state review officer yet obtained no relief].)</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">We conclude plaintiff\u2019s admitted failure to exhaust his section 3080 administrative remedy is not excused by the doctrine of futility. Plaintiff\u2019s pursuit of his third count in the courts is therefore premature. <em>(Sea &amp; Sage Audubon Society, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Com., supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 419.)</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The trial court properly sustained defendants\u2019 demurrer to the third count without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">\n<em>Fourth Count</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">\n<em>Plaintiff\u2019s Fourth Count Is Barred for Failure to Comply With the Tort Claims Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s fourth count seeks damages for breach of the previously discussed annual plans between defendants and the federal government. It is clear plaintiff\u2019s contract cause may not proceed because plaintiff has failed to allege he complied with the Tort Claims Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 905.2) by filing a claim with the State Board of Control.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">Government Code section 905.2 provides in pertinent part that \u201cThere shall be presented in accordance with Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 900) and Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 910) of this part all claims for money or damages against the state:. . . [ft] (c) For money or damages (1) on express contract,. . .\u201d The section applies to actions for damages for breach of contract. <em>(Loehr </em>v. <em>Ventura County Community College Dist. </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 1071, 1079 [195 Cal.Rptr. 576].) Moreover, the claim requirement is not excused merely because a claim is brought as a class action. <em>(Bozaich </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 688, 696-699 [108 Cal.Rptr. 392].) Plaintiff\u2019s claim for monetary recovery in the form of contract damages is therefore barred. <em>(Loehr </em>v. <em>Ventura County Community College Dist., supra, </em>147 Cal.App.3d at p. 1080.)</p>\n<p id=\"b437-13\">The trial court properly sustained defendant\u2019s demurrer to the fourth count without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-14\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b437-15\">\n<em>Plaintiff\u2019s Fifth and Sixth Counts Have Been Brought Prematurely</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b437-16\">Plaintiff\u2019s fifth and sixth counts allege breach of fiduciary duty and seek imposition of a constructive trust on EHA funds and an accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>These claims are premised on the asserted right of plaintiff and his class to receive EHA funds or to have them allocated for their benefit.

Consequently, in the absence of exhaustion of the section 3080 procedure, plaintiff and his class have no lawful claim to a constructive trust or an accounting of EHA funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The trial court did not err in sustaining defendants\u2019 demurrer to the fifth and sixth counts without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Although defendants\u2019 general demurrer was properly sustained as to the third through sixth counts, the demurrer was erroneously sustained as to the first and second counts and the judgment of dismissal must therefore be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">The judgment is reversed.

Entitlement funds are passed on by the state in proportional allocations to the local and regional public schools and state agencies serving the children counted.

California does provide for education in that age range (Ed.

The cases generally reason that, \u201cThe EHA is a comprehensive scheme set up by Congress to aid the States in complying with their constitutional obligations to provide public education for handicapped children.\u201d <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Robinson, supra, </em>468 U.S. at p. 1009 [82 L.Ed.2d at p. 763].)

However, prior to the ruling on demurrer, plaintiff provided the trial court with a complete 1978 plan. Since no objection to consideration of the complete plan was made in the trial court or here, we shall consider it as a true copy of the plan as agreed by the parties. Moreover, although the complaint pleads that other fiscal year plans are \u201ccomparable,\u201d the complaint does not plead that any relevant contractual obligations under any other plans are different from those in the 1978 plan. Accordingly, we construe the pleading as premised on contractual duties set forth in the 1978 plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b432-12\"> This does not necessarily mean public funds were not provided. As we have noted, state and local funds may be used to provide a free appropriate public education. Moreover, the plan itself recognizes that funds from other federal programs may be used: \u201cFunds received by the State or any of its political subdivisions under any other Federal program, including Section 121 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 241e-2), Section 305(b)(8) of that Act (20 U.S.C. 844a(b)(8) or its successor authority, and Section 122(a)(4)(B) of the Vocational Education Act of 1963 (20 U.S.C. 1262(a)(4)(B), under which there is specific authority for assistance for the education of handicapped children, will be used by the State or any of its political subdivisions, only in a manner consistent with the goal of providing free appropriate public education for all handicapped children, except that noth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>ing in this section will limit the specific requirements of the laws governing those Federal programs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b434-7\"> A variation of the doctrine also applies in some circumstances where a contract provides for a private dispute-resolution mechanism. (See, e.g., <em>Westlake Community Hosp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 465, 474-476 [131 Cal.Rptr. 90, 551 P.2d 410]; <em>Holderby </em>v. <em>Internat. Union etc., Engrs. </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 843, 846 [291 P.2d 463].) Here, the plan at issue expressly requires establishment of administrative remedies in title 5 of the California Administrative Code.
