The Department petitions this court for a writ of review in order to establish that the Appeals Board lacks jurisdiction to review a decision of the Department concerning the proper fees for the transfer of liquor licenses by real-party-in-interest, Safeway Stores, Inc., and related parties (Safeway or real parties in interest).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both the Appeals Board and Safeway contend that the Appeals Board has jurisdiction to review the Department\u2019s decision in this matter. We affirm the Appeals Board\u2019s denial of the Department\u2019s motion to dismiss Safeway\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">In connection with a corporate reorganization and liquidation, Safeway Stores, Inc., transferred over 500 California alcoholic beverage licenses (mostly off-sale general) to Safeway Stores Holdings Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries, Safeway Stores 23, Inc., Safeway Stores 24, Inc., Safeway Stores 25, Inc., and Safeway Stores 65, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">In a letter to the Department, dated September 15, 1986, Safeway presented its views concerning certain aspects of the license transfers, including its analysis of the applicable fee provision, concluding that the transfers were governed by Business and Professions Code section 24071,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which imposes a fee of $50 for transfer of each license.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>By letter dated October 14, 1986, the Department responded, confirming a telephone conference of September 30, 1986, and \u201ccommitting] to writing [its] findings and conclusions\u201d regarding the license transfers. The Department concluded that the license transfers fell within general fee provisions of section 24072,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which would result in a fee of $1,250 for transfer of each off-sale general license.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Safeway appealed the decision of the Department to the Appeals Board. The Department filed a motion to dismiss. Both the Department and Safeway filed briefs with the Appeals Board in support of their positions. The Appeals Board, by order dated April 2, 1987, denied the Department\u2019s motion. The Department now challenges the Appeals Board\u2019s jurisdiction in a petition for review which was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Does the Appeals Board have jurisdiction to review the decision of the Department determining the applicable fee for the transfer of Safeway\u2019s liquor licenses?</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">The Alcoholic Beverage Control Act provides a comprehensive framework of the powers and duties of the Department, the Appeals Board, and the role of the courts in matters concerning the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages. The Department is authorized to issue, revoke and transfer licenses according to specifications set out in the statutes. (Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 22; Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 23000 et seq., 23049 et seq., 23300 et seq. and 23950 et seq.; Gov. Code, \u00a7 11150 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>Article XX, section 22 of the California Constitution created the Department as well as the Appeals Board and provides, in pertinent part, as follows: \u201cWhen any person aggrieved thereby appeals from a decision of the department ordering any penalty assessment, issuing, denying, transferring, suspending or revoking any license for the manufacture, importation, or sale of alcoholic beverages, the board shall review the decision subject to such limitations as may be imposed by the Legislature. In such cases, the board shall not receive evidence in addition to that considered by the department. Review by the board of a decision of the department shall be limited to the questions whether the department has proceeded without or in excess of its jurisdiction, whether the department has proceeded in the manner required by law, whether the decision is supported by the findings, and whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record. In appeals where the board finds that there is relevant evidence which, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, could not have been produced or which was improperly excluded at the hearing before the department it may enter an order remanding the matter to the department for reconsideration in the light of such evidence. In all other appeals the board shall enter an order either affirming or reversing the decision of the department. When the order reverses the decision of the department, the board may direct the reconsideration of the matter in the light of its order and may direct the department to take such further action as is specially enjoined upon it by law, but the order shall not limit or control in any way the discretion vested by law in the department. Orders of the board shall be subject to judicial review upon petition of the director or any party aggrieved by such order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Consistent with the constitutional mandate, the Legislature has provided for appeal to the Appeals Board by \u201cany party aggrieved by a final decision of the department.\u201d (\u00a7 23081.) \u201cDecision\u201d is defined as \u201cany determination of the department imposing a penalty assessment or affecting a license which may be appealed to the board under Section 22 of Article XX of the Constitution.\u201d (\u00a7 23080.) The scope of review by the board is limited to those questions specified in the Constitution. (\u00a7 23084.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>The Department contends that the decision regarding the fee applicable to the transfer of Safeway\u2019s licenses is \u201cpurely administrative\u201d and that the Appeals Board\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to a review of quasi-judicial decisions of the Department only after a hearing has been held and there is an administrative record to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Initially, we observe that the decision which is the subject of this writ proceeding is an adjudicatory or quasi-judicial action rather than an administrative or quasi-legislative action because it is the determination of specific rights in regard to a specific fact situation. <em>(Patterson </em>v. <em>Central Coast Regional Com. </em>(1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 833, 840-841 [130 Cal.Rptr. 169].) \u201cParticular procedural characteristics of the administrative process are not necessarily determinative of the classification of the function. <em>(Rivera </em>v. <em>Division of Industrial Welfare, 265 </em>Cal.App.2d 576, 586-587 . . .; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Hidden Valley Mun. Water Dist., </em>256 Cal.App.2d 271, 279 . . . .) Nor is the breadth or narrowness of the agency\u2019s discretion controlling. <em>(Pitts </em>v. <em>Perluss, </em>[1962], 58 Cal.2d at p. 834 [27 Cal.Rptr. 19, 377 P.2d 83].)\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 841.)</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The Appeals Board contends that the Department did conduct a hearing, although not an APA hearing (referring to the procedure provided by the Administrative Procedure Act, Gov. Code, \u00a7 11370 et seq.) in that Safeway submitted evidence in the form of its counsel\u2019s letter of September 15, 1986, and memorandum to \u201cDistribution\u201d dated August 8, 1986, which were attached to the Department\u2019s petition for review. The Appeals Board refers to \u201coral argument via appearance of its counsel\u201d before the Department\u2019s assistant director, Legislative and Regulatory Affairs, on September 16, 1986, referred to in the September 15, 1986, letter, and via telephone conference of September 30, 1986, mentioned in the Department\u2019s letter of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">We find it unnecessary to characterize the Department\u2019s review as a \u201chearing,\u201d because the decision, whether following a hearing or not, is appealable to the Appeals Board, as discussed, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">The Department\u2019s contention that a hearing is a prerequisite to the Appeals Board\u2019s jurisdiction rests on the argument that the language of article XX, section 22 of the California Constitution \u201cmirrors\u201d the language contained in Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, which provides for judicial review of administrative adjudications by administrative mandamus proceedings. This argument overlooks important differences between these two provisions. Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 specifically states it applies to \u201cany final administrative order or decision made as the result of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>proceeding in which by law a hearing is required to be given, evidence is required to be taken, and discretion in the determination of facts is vested in the inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or officer . . . .\u201d Neither the Constitution nor the Business and Professions Code expresses such a prerequisite in regard to the decisions reviewable by the Appeals Board. Also, Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 specifically mentions that the scope of judicial inquiry includes \u201cwhether there was a fair trial,\u201d which is <em>not </em>expressed in the Appeals Board\u2019s mandate. These differences suggest that the Appeals Board is not limited to review of quasi-judicial decisions following formal hearings only.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Furthermore, the prescribed scope of review within the Appeals Board\u2019s jurisdiction is as appropriate for a Department decision without a hearing as it is for one following a hearing,  The present case illustrates that appropriateness: the decision regarding the proper transfer fee is a question of law, which falls within the Appeals Board\u2019s power to review \u201cwhether the department has proceeded without, or in excess of, its jurisdiction,\u201d and \u201cwhether the department has proceeded in the manner required by law\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 22; \u00a7 23084, subds. (a) and (b)). Because there is no factual dispute,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the correspondence between the Department and Safeway provides a sufficient record, with stated findings and decision, for the Appeals Board\u2019s review of \u201c[wjhether the decision is supported by findings\u201d and \u201c[w]hether the findings are supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 23084, subds. (c) and (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The Department relies on <em>Top Hat Liquors </em>v. <em>Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 107 [118 Cal.Rptr. 10, 529 P.2d 42], for the proposition that the Appeals Board can only review decisions where there has been a hearing with a record to review and after the Department has acted in its quasi-judicial capacity. However, in the <em>Top Hat </em>case, the Supreme Court defines the jurisdiction of the courts to review departmental decisions, not the jurisdiction of the Appeals Board. A liquor licensee sought a writ of mandate to compel the Department to reduce monetary penalties assessed against it. In denying the writ, the Supreme Court held that the exclusive avenue to judicial review of adjudicatory decisions of the Department is by the writ of review provided by sections 23090 through 23090.7, <em>after a final order of the Appeals Board. </em>The licensee had failed to exhaust his administrative remedy, appeal to the Appeals Board, and the writ was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>In reaching its conclusion, the Supreme Court emphasized that it had not overlooked that provision of section 23090.5 which states that notwithstanding the express limitations on judicial review, \u201ca writ of mandate shall lie from the Supreme Court or the courts of appeal in any proper case.\u201d The court explained that this provision does not authorize an alternative avenue of judicial review of adjudicatory decisions, but that the writ of mandate \u201cremains available as a vehicle to otherwise challenge departmental performances or lack thereof \u2018which the law specifically enjoins\u2019 or which denies to a party \u2018the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which he is entitled.\u2019 (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085.) \u2018As we read section 23090.5, the Legislature intended thereby to provide for judicial review of the orders, rules or decisions or other acts of the department in the performance of its duties when acting in its administrative [quasi-legislative] rather than its limited judicial capacity.\u2019 <em>(Samson Market Co. </em>v. <em>Kirby </em>(1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 577, 581 [68 Cal.Rptr. 130].)\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 111-112.)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Even if one assumes the Department\u2019s decision regarding transfer fees is \u201cpurely administrative,\u201d as the Department urges, the Supreme Court did not <em>preclude </em>appeal of such decisions to the Appeals Board. In fact, the court stated, \u201cEven if we were to assume that petitioner is entitled to a general mandamus review pursuant to section 23090.5, that avenue of judicial review would also require that the administrative remedy first be pursued and exhausted. (See <em>Abelleira </em>v. <em>District Court of Appeal </em>[1941] 17 Cal.2d 280, 284-285, 291-293 [109 P.2d 942, 132 A.L.R. 715].)\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 112, fn. 6.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">In the case before us, an \u201caggrieved\u201d party has appealed to the Appeals Board, which is empowered by law to review a \u201cdecision of the department. . . transferring . . . any license . . . .\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a722.)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>There is no authority which denies the Appeals Board jurisdiction to review the Department\u2019s decision regarding fees for the transfer of Safeway\u2019s liquor licenses, whether the Department conducted a formal hearing or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The order of the Appeals Board, denying the Department\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jursidiction, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Klein, P.

Section 23322 shall not apply to this transfer fee. (b) The fee for transfer of a retail license from a licensee to another person is a fee equal to 50 percent of the original fee for the license, but not to exceed one thousand two hundred fifty dollars ($1,250), or if no original fee is provided for by law, one hundred dollars ($100). (c) Except as provided in Section 24082, the fee for transfer of a license from one premises to another premises is one hundred dollars ($100). (d) Notwithstanding the other fee provisions of this section, the fee for a transfer of an off-sale general license from one county to another county shall be three thousand dollars ($3,000). ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b716-5\"> Section 23084 provides: \u201cThe review by the board of a decision of the department shall be limited to the questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">\u201c(a) Whether the department has proceeded without, or in excess of, its jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">\u201c(b) Whether the department has proceeded in the manner required by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-8\">\u201c(c) Whether the decision is supported by the findings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-9\">\u201c(d) Whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-10\">\u201c(e) Whether there is relevant evidence, which, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, could not have been produced or which was improperly excluded at the hearing before the department.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Nothing in the administrative record before the Appeals Board at the time of ruling on the Department\u2019s motion for dismissal suggested that there were any contested factual issues or a need for additional information. In appropriate circumstances, the Appeals Board can remand the matter to the Department for additional factfinding. (\u00a7 23085.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b719-7\">The Department also cites <em>Gonzales &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Alcoholic Bev. Control </em>(1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 172 [198 Cal.Rptr. 479], in which the Court of Appeal granted a writ of mandate commanding the Department to refrain from undertaking any measures to curtail or restrain petitioner\u2019s consumer rebate program on the ground that it violated a provision of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act. The Department claims the court held that an immediate writ was the proper remedy to review an administrative decision of the Department. There is no discussion of this issue by the <em>Gonzales </em>court. The court assumed jurisdiction of the writ, simply noting, \u201cPursuant to Business and Professions Code section 23090.5, this court shares exclusive original jurisdiction with the Supreme Court to issue a writ of mandate to the Department.\u201d <em>(Id, </em>at p. 174, fn. 1.) Accordingly, this case has no relevance to the issue of the jurisdiction of the Appeals Board to review the Safeway transfer fee decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">While there may be circumstances in which a party aggrieved by a decision, order or action of the Department may properly petition for a writ of mandate without first appealing to the Appeals Board (see, e.g., <em>Sail\u2019er Inn, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kirby </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 1 [95 Cal.Rptr. 329, 485 P.2d 529, 46 A.L.R.3d 351]), because Safeway did in fact appeal to the Appeals Board, we need not consider whether <em>this </em>is such a case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b720-7\"> Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
