Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 211) and two counts of kidnapping by force (\u00a7 207, subd. (a)) following a court trial based on the transcripts and documents of previous proceedings in the case. The trial court also found Gonzales used a deadly weapon in the commission of each offense within the meaning of section 12022, subdivision (b). The court trial followed a mistrial granted because of prosecutorial misconduct and a subsequent jury trial in which the trial court granted a new trial because of instructional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">Gonzales contends the federal double jeopardy clause should have barred his retrial because the prosecutorial misconduct in his first trial was intended to provoke him into moving for a mistrial. Gonzales also asks us as a matter of first impression to interpret the state\u2019s double jeopardy clause as a bar to retrial where the prosecutor consciously engages in prejudicial misconduct and <em>either intends or is indifferent to </em>the resulting mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">College students Matthew Carey and Kathleen Earley arrived in San Diego on Thanksgiving Day, November 24, 1983. After dining in Tijuana, they stopped in San Ysidro to exchange pesos for dollars. When the couple returned to their car, a man wearing a leather jacket, scraggly in appearance, with uneven wet hair to the shoulders, a mustache and a growth of beard put a knife to Kathleen\u2019s throat. He pushed her in the car and directed Matthew to drive back to the border parking lot where the couple had earlier left their car. Stopping there, the man robbed both victims, locked them in the trunk and drove around for at least an hour stopping on occasion to demand more money for a drug fix. At the second of the stops, the victims had an opportunity to closely observe him. Kathleen noted his blue eyes; Matthew remarked he would never forget his face. The man stopped at a 7-Eleven store, left the engine running and got out of the car. The victims unlatched the back seat, climbed into the passenger compartment, drove away and called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Each with some hesitation identified Gonzales as the kidnapper-robber from photographs shown to them by the police. At trial, Matthew had \u201cno doubt\u201d Gonzales was the perpetrator although he was heavier, his hair was neatly combed and he was clean shaven. His identification at the preliminary hearing was unsure because of the changed appearance. Kathleen was positive in her identification and remembered his \u201cblue eyes.\u201d Matthew did not observe any facial scarring of the man. Neither smelled any alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Gonzales took the stand. He acknowledged coming to San Diego for the Thanksgiving holiday, drinking beer in an Otay pool hall and visiting his sister\u2019s house from 11 p.m. November 24 until 4 a.m. the following day. His eyes were green, he had gained weight and the left side of his face was scarred. Clean shaven except for a mustache, he admitted his facial hair was as pictured in a photo taken December 17, 1983. Friends and relatives confirmed his whereabouts at the Otay pool hall and his sister\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">While the circumstances of the crime are fairly straightforward, aspects of the procedural history of the case are considerably more muddled: Gonzales\u2019s first trial began March 7, 1984, before Judge J. Perry Langford. During cross-examination of Gonzales, the prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney Daniel Williams, asked for a sidebar conference to obtain an advance ruling regarding the propriety of questioning Gonzales about a prior drug arrest. The trial court indicated it would not allow the questioning and Williams said he would drop the matter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>The following day, when Gonzales\u2019s sister was on the stand, Williams\u2014 without seeking an advance ruling at sidebar\u2014asked her whether her brother has any problems with drugs. Gonzales\u2019s trial counsel objected and moved for a mistrial. The motion was granted, based \u201csimply [on] the misconduct of the District Attorney.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>A second jury trial began May 29, 1984, before a different judge. Gonzales was convicted on all counts. Prior to sentencing, new counsel was substituted and presented a motion for a new trial, raising several issues. The trial court granted a. new trial on the basis of instructional error. On August 13, 1984, Gonzales entered a plea of once in jeopardy. The People appealed the new trial order and this court affirmed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gonzales </em>(D002084), an unpublished opinion issued July 31, 1985. On November 13, 1985, Gonzales\u2019s motion to sustain the plea of once in jeopardy was heard and denied by Judge Langford.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">A third jury trial was to start on December 3, 1985, before Judge Alpha Montgomery. However, Gonzales waived his right to a jury trial, and the matter was submitted to Judge Montgomery for verdict based on the transcripts of the preliminary examination and both previous trials and various documents. The trial court found Gonzales guilty of all counts except those specifically dismissed by the district attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Gonzales contends that after Judge Langford granted his motion for mistrial during the first trial the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to the United States Constitution barred any retrial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Although a defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial generally acts as a consent to retrial, removing any double jeopardy bar, an exception has been recognized in some cases of official misconduct. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dinitz </em>(1976) 424 U.S. 600, 611 [47 L.Ed.2d 267, 276, 96 S.Ct. 1075]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jorn </em>(1971) 400 U.S. 470, 485 [27 L.Ed.2d 543, 556-557, 91 S.Ct. 547].) In <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Kennedy </em>(1982) 456 U.S. 667 [72 L.Ed.2d 416, 102 S.Ct. 2083], the Supreme Court delineated the standard of misconduct required to invoke double jeopardy: <em>\u201cOnly </em>where the governmental conduct in question is intended to \u2018goad\u2019 the defendant into moving for a mistrial may a defendant raise the bar of double jeopardy to a second trial after having succeeded in aborting the first on his own motion.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 676 [72 L.Ed.2d at p. 425].) (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Hence, the question of whether the federal double jeopardy bar should have been applied here revolves solely around whether prosecutor Williams intended to provoke Gonzales into moving for a mistrial. Fortuitously, we have a detailed finding by the very judge who heard and granted the mistrial motion that this was not Williams\u2019s intent. At the November 13, 1985, hearing, Judge Langford made the following findings: \u201cI disagree in your assessment that Mr. Williams committed his act of misconduct for the purpose of provoking a mistrial so that he could take another run at the case. As a matter of fact, if I had agreed with you, it\u2019s quite conceivable that I would not have granted the mistrial, but rather would have admonished the jury in a manner which would have rendered Mr. Williams either curly-headed or bald. And I think I could have done that.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">\u201cBut I believed then, and I believe now, that though Mr. Williams engaged in a\u2014an intentional act of prosecutorial misconduct, his purpose was not to obtain a mistrial in order to start over.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">\u201cThe situation was that I had suggested to him some considerable risks in the introduction of some evidence that he wanted introduced, and I also made some comments about the nature of the evidence in the case, that it was truly a triable case, which it was and is. There are two sides to it. It\u2019s an eyewitness identification case by strangers, which is a type of thing that is enough to scare anybody as to the possibility of a miscarriage of justice. But that\u2019s a far cry from Mr. Williams thinking he was about to lose and trying to salvage the case. I don\u2019t believe he thought that, and I didn\u2019t think that, either.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">\u201cRather what he had was a close case that he might win and he might lose, and some evidence that he thought would do him a substantial amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>of good, which he wanted to get in, and there was a judge who was waffling and shilly-shallying and saying that it was a question whether it could come in or refusing to receive it on grounds stated. And that\u2019s an interesting little aspect of the case which you have to throw in in order to understand where it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">\u201cThe evidence of the defendant\u2019s involvement with narcotics was not irrelevant. I don\u2019t know if Mr. Williams ever figured out the ground on which it might be admissible. He was offering it for the purpose of motive. He couldn\u2019t make the foundation, as I understand it, in either trial on that ground. And it may be that it couldn\u2019t have been admitted on any ground. But it was potentially relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">\u201cThe evidence in the trial was that whoever perpetrated the offenses charged here\u2014and there isn\u2019t any dispute that someone perpetrated those offenses. It\u2019s an identification case. Whoever that person was was a narcotic addict in need of drugs. The evidence left that crystal clear. So that that aspect of the criminal became part of his description, and if the defendant fit the description in that way, that was relevant evidence\u2014in other words, there may be many, many Hispanic people who physically look like the defendant and who might be mistaken for the defendant by the victims, or the defendant might be mistaken for them by the victims, and probably substantial fewer Hispanic narcotic drug addicts who look like the defendant; and therefore the fact that the\u2014if it be a fact, that the defendant fitted that aspect of the description, would be relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">\u201cAnd that was what was troubling me at the time. It was a 352 problem. You could let the evidence in for that purpose; but the problem of telling a jury, \u2018Now, you may consider the fact that the defendant\u2019s an addict for the purpose of deciding whether he\u2019s the person who committed this particular offense, but you may not consider the fact that he is an addict for the purpose of thinking that because he\u2019s an addict he\u2019s more likely to be guilty than not,\u2019 that\u2019s a terrible line to explain to a jury of lay people.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">\u201cThe danger of prejudice was profound, and that\u2019s what bothered me, and that\u2019s what I was struggling with. And I firmly believe that what Mr. Williams proposed to do was to set my mind at rest and make it unnecessary for me to struggle. Having laid the information before the jury, I\u2019m quite certain he expected that I would conclude that it was a close question, the evidence had come in, and that I would admonish the jury. And he cared not what I told the jury, because he figured that he had it for what it was worth, no matter what limiting instruction I gave, and that\u2019s why he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>did it, not because he wanted a mistrial, but because he wanted the evidence and he didn\u2019t want me interfering with his getting it. And that\u2019s why I granted the mistrial, because I didn\u2019t see how a court could ever deal with a district attorney who proceeded along those lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">\u201cSimple question of authority. He couldn\u2019t get away with it, and so I granted the mistrial. And he didn\u2019t get away with it, and he didn\u2019t get it the second time around, either.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Judge Langford\u2019s findings on the issue are supported by substantial evidence, and, therefore, dispositive. <em>(Barajas </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 30, 33, fn. 4 [196 Cal.Rptr. 599].) In light of Judge Langford\u2019s finding that Williams lacked the requisite intent, under <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. 667, it is clear that the double jeopardy bar under federal law does not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">The federal double jeopardy provision and the standards developed in its application by the United States Supreme Court apply to the states through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>(Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1969) 395 U.S. 784, 795-796 [23 L.Ed.2d 707, 716-717, 89 S.Ct. 2056].) However, states are not precluded from extending greater protection if they can find an independent state ground for doing so. California has done so in the area of double jeopardy. <em>(Curry </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 707, 716 [87 Cal.Rptr. 361, 470 P.2d 345].)</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">The California Constitution provides in article I, section 15, \u201cPersons may not twice be put in jeopardy for the same offense. . . .\u201d Gonzales urges us as a matter of state constitutional law to interpret this provision more broadly than the United States Supreme Court has interpreted the federal double jeopardy clause in <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. 667, with respect to defense-requested-mistrial/retrial situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">Gonzales refers us to decisions by the supreme courts of Oregon and Arizona, each of which has adopted a more stringent standard than <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Kennedy. </em>In <em>State </em>v. <em>Kennedy </em>(1983) 295 Ore. 260 [666 P.2d 1316], the Oregon Supreme Court held the double jeopardy clause of the Oregon Constitution bars a retrial \u201cwhen improper official conduct is so prejudicial to the defendant that it cannot be cured by means short of a mistrial, and if the official knows that the conduct is improper and prejudicial and either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>intends or is indifferent to the resulting mistrial or reversal.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1326.) The Arizona Supreme Court, in <em>Pool </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 139 Ariz. 98 [677 P.2d 261], held that jeopardy attaches under the Arizona Constitution when a mistrial is granted on motion of defendant or declared by the court under the following conditions: \u201c1. Mistrial is granted because of improper conduct or actions by the prosecutor; and [ff] 2. such conduct is not merely the result of legal error, negligence, mistake, or insignificant impropriety, but, taken as a whole, amounts to intentional conduct which the prosecutor knows to be improper and prejudicial, and which he pursues for any improper purpose with indifference to a significant resulting danger of mistrial or reversal; and [fl] 3. the conduct causes prejudice to the defendant which cannot be cured by means short of a mistrial.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 271-272, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Both the Oregon and Arizona Supreme Courts found fault with the federal standard set forth in the opinion of <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. 667. The two state courts disagreed with the premise of the opinion that a test broader than intent to provoke a mistrial would in reality be standardless. Instead, the Oregon and Arizona Supreme Courts went along with the reasoning of the four-member minority, which concluded the majority\u2019s<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> test must necessarily involve a subjective inquiry and is too difficult to determine. We are not likewise persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">We, of course, are not blind to the practical difficulties of proving intent. But as noted by the majority opinion and Justice Powell\u2019s concurring opinion, intent can be inferred from the objective circumstances of the conduct at issue. <em>(Oregon </em>v. <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. at pp. 675, 680 [72 L.Ed.2d 416, 427].) The Supreme Court majority called the intent test \u201ca manageable standard to apply. It merely calls for the court to make a finding of fact. Inferring the existence or nonexistence of intent from objective facts and circumstances is a familiar process in our criminal justice system.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 675 [72 L.Ed.2d at p. 424].) We tend to agree, and, if anything, the facts and findings by Judge Langford here bear this out.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The broader tests adopted by the Oregon and Arizona Supreme Courts and suggested by the minority in <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. 667, encompass a more generalized test that has variously been characterized as \u201cbad faith conduct\u201d or \u201charassment\u201d or \u201coverreaching.\u201d Besides being so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>broad as to be essentially standardless, the tests display a basic naivete of courtroom dynamics and trial strategy in an adversarial system.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">\u201cEvery act on the part of a rational prosecutor during a trial is designed to \u2018prejudice\u2019 the defendant by placing before the judge or jury evidence leading to a finding of his guilt. Given the complexity of the rules of evidence, it will be a rare trial of any complexity in which some proffered evidence by the prosecutor or by the defendant\u2019s attorney will not be found objectionable by the trial court. Most such objections are undoubtedly curable by simply refusing to allow the proffered evidence to be admitted, or in the case of a particular line of inquiry taken by counsel with a witness, by an admonition to desist from a particular line of inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">\u201cMore serious infractions on the part of the prosecutor may provoke a motion for mistrial on the part of the defendant, and may in the view of the trial court warrant the granting of such a motion.\u201d (456 U.S. at pp. 674-675 [72 L.Ed.2d at p. 424].)</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">If we were to adopt the amorphous tests urged by Gonzales, there would be little rhyme or reason to the jeopardy bar. A single \u201coverreaching\u201d question could trigger the bar in one case if the court were offended, yet more egregious conduct might not bar retrial in another. Vigorous advocacy might be condemned in one quarter while it could be allowed in another. We believe it would be a mistake to adopt such an approach that is necessarily premised on a case-by-case analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">The intentional provocation standard is clear, thereby avoiding the uneven application that is inherent in the standards urged upon us by Gonzales. Furthermore, the intent test does not condone prejudicial conduct. The court still retains the discretion to declare a mistrial and the power to hold the egregious prosecutor in contempt of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">In determining whether California should adopt a standard more stringent than the federal standard, it is important to consider the interests implicated by the double jeopardy prohibition. Perhaps the most prominent is the defendant\u2019s right to an adjudication by a particular tribunal. Included in this notion is the defendant\u2019s right not to be burdened with the anxiety and expense of repeated trials and his right to a fair trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the same time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>we cannot lose sight of society\u2019s interest in the punishment of those properly found guilty. A double jeopardy claim cannot be properly disposed of by analyzing one of these factors to the exclusion of the other; a balancing of the interests at stake is essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">When a defendant is deprived of his right to continue a trial before a particular tribunal because of misconduct designed to provoke a mistrial, the deprivation is so unjustified that society\u2019s interest in the punishment of those properly found guilty must yield to a discharge of the accused. However, when the intent of the deprivation is not so evident, it is the defendant\u2019s and society\u2019s interest in a fair trial that is primarily affected, and the remedy of a new trial is sufficient to vindicate both. The public interest in convicting those guilty of crimes is too important an interest to be subordinated to a concept of a prosecutor\u2019s recklessness. (See <em>Burks </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1978) 437 U.S. 1, 15 [57 L.Ed.2d 1, 12, 98 S.Ct. 2141].)</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Gonzales argues that without the retrial bar, the defendant who is the victim of prosecutorial overreaching is left with a Hobson\u2019s choice between giving up his first jury and continuing the trial tainted by prejudicial judicial or prosecutorial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">But Gonzales\u2019s analysis ignores the fact that the prosecutor gets less than he desires as well. In the event of prejudicial error he must continue with a case that he can no longer win. That is, once a prosecutor commits the kind of error that is grounds for a mistrial, the trial becomes tainted and the defendant becomes entitled to a reversal if he is eventually convicted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, if a defendant has an option to proceed with the trial while preserving his claim of error, it means that he has something to win and little to lose. If he is acquitted despite the taint, he succeeds in ending the case once and for all; if he is convicted, his conviction will be reversed and he will be given a second opportunity\u2014this time error free\u2014to obtain an acquittal. The defendant\u2019s option to go with the first jury represents a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>pragmatic compromise between the defendant\u2019s interest in finality and society\u2019s interest in prosecution. A defendant\u2019s constitutional interest in finality is not absolute and must be balanced against society\u2019s interest in conducting further proceedings. Society has a vital interest in fair trials designed to end in just judgments and in the enforcement of criminal laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">We find persuasive the close analogy between an appellate reversal of an erroneous conviction upon a defendant\u2019s appeal and the trial court\u2019s declaration of a mistrial upon defense motion. In cases of appellate reversal of a conviction, obviously the error was egregious, even flagrant, and was done with the deliberate purpose of enhancing the chance of convictibn. It is nonetheless clear the sanction was the reversal itself and retrial was not barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">\u201cThe determination to allow reprosecution in these circumstances [after reversal of erroneous conviction] reflects the judgment that the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy interests, however defined, do not go so far as to compel society to so mobilize its decisionmaking resources that it will be prepared to assure the defendant a single proceeding free from harmful governmental or judicial error.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jorn, supra, </em>400 U.S. at p. 484 [27 L.Ed.2d at p. 556].)</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">It is absolutely clear that only those reversals based upon the legal insufficiency of the evidence\u2014that is, those cases which should have resulted in verdicts of not guilty upon the merits\u2014will be reversed outright and that reversals for other varieties of error will result in a remand. <em>(Burks </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>437 U.S. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">\u201c[Rjeversal for trial error, as distinguished from evidentiary insufficiency, does not constitute a decision to the effect that the government has failed to prove its case. As such, it implies nothing with respect to the guilt or innocence of the defendant. Rather, it is a determination that a defendant has been convicted through a judicial process which is defective in some fundamental respect, e.g., incorrect receipt or rejection of evidence, incorrect instructions, or prosecutorial misconduct. When this occurs, the accused has a strong interest in obtaining a fair readjudication of his guilt free from error, just as society maintains a valid concern for insuring that the guilty are punished.\u201d (437 U.S. at p. 15 [57 L.Ed.2d at p. 12].) We see no basis in law or reason to avoid applying this rationale to Gonzales\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">As indicated above, this is a case of first impression in California. However, <em>People </em>v. <em>Hathcock </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 599 [105 Cal.Rptr. 540, 504 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>476] (disapproved on another ground in <em>People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 33-34 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468], which in turn was disapproved on another ground in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 826, 834, fn. 3 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468]) acknowledged the issue without addressing it.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Hathcock, </em>nonetheless, lends support to our rejection of Gonzales\u2019s argument regarding his Hobson\u2019s choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">In <em>Hathcock, </em>our Supreme Court affirmed the first degree murder conviction of defendant on a retrial after a mistrial. The defendant had moved for the mistrial after the prosecutor asked a number of questions about the defendant\u2019s alleged involvement in the business of prostitution. On appeal, the defendant contended his double jeopardy right had been violated when he was forced to undergo a second trial after his initial trial ended in a mistrial. The <em>Hathcock </em>court noted the general rule that a defense motion for mistrial ordinarily will remove any barrier to reprosecution. The court continued: \u201cDefendant attempts to dilute the strength of this general principle in the instant case by contending that he cannot \u2018realistically\u2019 be found to have consented to his retrial since his motion for a mistrial was allegedly \u2018compelled\u2019 by the blatantly improper misconduct of the prosecutor. Defendant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct impaled him on the horns of an \u2018impossible dilemma\u2019: if defendant did not ask for a mistrial he ran an increased risk of conviction because of the inflammatory and prejudicial material improperly presented to the jury, while if he did ask for a mistrial and it was granted the prosecution would get \u2018a second crack\u2019 at the defendant, having gained the benefit of a full-scale rehearsal of the trial and exposure of the defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">\u201cWe fail to see how defendant\u2019s \u2018dilemma\u2019 differs in any significant respect from the normal situation arising after possibly prejudicial error has occurred at any trial. In determining whether or not to move for a mistrial, defendants must always weigh the disadvantages of allowing the prosecution to begin its case anew against the benefits of completely eliminating a given trial error; these opposing considerations were certainly as much present in all the cases establishing and applying the general rule of \u2018consent\u2019 as they are in the instant case. [Citation.] Nothing in the instant record suggests that the motion for mistrial was other than knowingly and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>intelligently made or that the defendant and his counsel were not fully aware of the consequences of the motion. Accordingly, there was no violation of the defendant\u2019s right not to be placed twice in jeopardy.\u201d (8 Cal.3d at p. 614, fn. omitted.) Here, too there was no violation of the defendant\u2019s right not to be placed twice in jeopardy. We have a detailed finding of fact by the trial court that the prosecutor did not intend to provoke a mistrial; hence, under federal law the double jeopardy bar does not apply. As to state law, we fail to see an adequate and independent state ground to adopt a standard different than the federal one.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Kremer, P.

He made one decision yesterday, and then he tells us that his own reexamination of what he had wrought by yesterday, plus my comments on it, convinced him that he needed it more than he thought he did yesterday, and so he asked a question which was objectionable . . . . [ft]. . . [T]he question was not just 352\u2019d, but it was an improper question. [ft]. . . [I] don\u2019t see how under the circumstances we can conduct courts if we can\u2019t expect counsel to give the opportunity to rule, [ft] Mr. Williams, you showed us yesterday that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>you knew that it was a subject as to which you should do that. You knew that I regard it as close. The conduct is of a sufficiently serious nature. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">The trial court later explained to the jury: \u201cNow, we don\u2019t try the District Attorney\u2019s office in these cases, and we don\u2019t grant mistrials just for purposes of punishment. But if it had happened by accident, I might have been more likely to try to continue the trial in one way or another, but it didn\u2019t happen by accident, [f] And, accordingly, I feel that the only way to maintain\u2014well, I told you one of my functions is to act as a referee, and referees impose penalties because that way they get listened to. And that is one ingredient of the grant of motion. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b633-12\">The pertinent clause in the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution reads: \u201c. . . nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-13\">As a historical sidelight, we note legal purists point out that situations involving retrial following mistrial were not considered part of common law double jeopardy. Rather, an independent common law tradition, dating from early Stuart times, protected a defendant from having his trial needlessly aborted by the Crown when a prosecutor or judge believed the state was losing the trial. <em>(Regina </em>v. <em>Charlesworth </em>(1861) 121 Eng.Rep. 786.) In such cases where the state deliberately aborted the trial to obtain more favorable conditions at a subsequent retrial, this independent doctrine protected the defendant from a retrial. English courts continue to this day to distinguish between the two. (Friedland, Double Jeopardy (Oxford 1969).) Early on, federal courts recognized the independent doctrine and separate procedural right, most notably in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Perez </em>(1824) 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579 [6 L.Ed. 165], Double jeopardy is not mentioned in <em>Perez. </em>However, in <em>Wade </em>v. <em>Hunter </em>(1949) 336 U.S. 684, 689 [93 L.Ed. 974, 978, 69 S.Ct. 834], Justice Black designated this independent com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>mon law procedural right as an aspect of double jeopardy. Subsequently, courts in this country have routinely dealt with it under the rubric of double jeopardy law, as we shall do here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b637-8\"> Although <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. 667 has been characterized as a plurality opinion (see <em>Pool </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 677 </em>P.2d at pp. 268, 271), it is in fact a majority opinion by Rehnquist, J., joined in by Burger, C.
