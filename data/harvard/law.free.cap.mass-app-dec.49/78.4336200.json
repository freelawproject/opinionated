They seek compensation under St. 1967, c. 852, now G.L. c. 258A, entitled \u201cCompensation of Victims of Violent Crimes.\u201d After a hearing their claims were denied and they requested a report.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">\u00a7 2 of c. 258A gives jurisdiction of such petitions to the District Courts and the right of review by the Appellate Division is granted by G.L. c. 231, \u00a7 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The facts were stipulated or undisputed. We therefore treat it as a case stated. It was the duty of the judge, and now ours, to order the judgment required by the application of correct principles of law to the facts stated. <em>Richard D. Kimball Co. </em>v. <em>Medford, </em>340 Mass. 727, 728. <em>Associate Discount Corp. </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>41 Mass. App. Dec. 99,102.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The reported evidence shows:</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">The claims were timely filed and the petitioners are eligible and have complied with all procedural requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">The victim was thirty-two (32) years of age when he was shot and killed in Springfield, Massachusetts on the morning of November 20,1970, without provocation, by his landlord, Robert Boudreau. Boudreau was convicted of manslaugter and sentenced to serve a term in prison. The crime was immediately reported to the Springfield Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>The victim\u2019s widow, the petitioner Celine Gurley, was 29 years of age and their four children ranged in age from three to seven years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> All were dependent for support upon, and were living with the victim at the time of his death. They are not related by blood or marriage to Boudreau.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">The deceased victim was employed by Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft of East Hartford, Connecticut. He was earning approximately $8,509.-80 a year. His life expectancy was 38.19 years with an earning capacity of $324,961.76.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The widow\u2019s reasonable and necessary expenses on account of her husband\u2019s death which were not reimbursable were as follows: Funeral bill of $1,516.00 ;\u2022 cost of burial lot $150.00; cost of opening grave, $115.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">The petitioners received, as a result of the death of the victim, life insurance proceeds in the amount of $17,000.00. The widow also has, or will receive $2400.00 over a two year period payable at the rate of $100.00 monthly under another insurance policy. She also receives from Social Security. $360.00 per month and $48.00 every two weeks from the Welfare Department of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-18\">The court made the following special finding of fact:</p>\n<p id=\"b86-20\">\u2018 \u2018 In addition to the facts stipulated by counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>I find that the victim on his death had a life expectancy of 38.19 years with an earning capacity of $324,961.76. I find that the claimants received from a double indemnity insurance policy the sum of $17,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\u201cThey are receiving from another policy the sum of $100.00 monthly up to November 20, 1972 and social security of $360.00 monthly and $48.00 every two weeks from the State Department of Public Welfare. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The first sentence of paragraph four of section five of the Violent Crimes Act provides: \u201cAny compensation for loss of earning or support shall be in an amount equal to the <em>actual loss sustained; </em>provided, however, that no \u00bfward under this chapter shall exceed <em>ten thousand dollars.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The second paragraph of section six provides: \u201cAny compensation paid pursuant to this chapter shall be reduced by the amount of any payments received or to be received as a result of the injury (a) from or on behalf of the offender, (b) <em>under insurance programs, </em>(emphasis supplied) or from public funds. \u2019 \u2019<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">The petitioners contend, that because the judge found \u201cthat the victim on his death had a life expectancy of 38.19 years with an earning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>capacity of $324,961.76\u201d, the $17,000.00 received by them from the insurance proceeds, plus other benefits set out above should be deducted from the $324,961.76 which would leave mathematically an \u201cactual loss sustained\u201d many times in excess of the $10,000.00 limitation. And therefore, the petitioners are entitled to the maximum compensation, namely $10,000.00 less the $100.00 deduction provided in section 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The Commonwealth takes the position that the petitioners\u2019 having received the $17,000.00, an amount in excess of the maximum compensation permitted are not entitled to any benefits provided by the statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">\u2018 \u2018 The cannon of interpretation applicable ... is that its words are to be construed according to the common and approved usage of the language considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the preexisting state of the law, the mischief to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>275 Mass. 55, 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">It seems to us, in these petitions, a determination is first made of \u201cthe actual loss sustained\u201d by eligible petitioners, limited to $10,000.00. Then the \u201closs\u201d, so found, is reduced by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>amounts, if any, received by the petitioners from the sources specified in section six.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b89-7\">Robert H. Quinn, <em>Attorney General </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b89-8\">Herbert Murphy of Springfield for the petitioners.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">We think the words used in section five \u201cno award under this chapter shall exceed $10,000.-00\u201d and in section six \u201cany compensation paid \u2014 shall be reduced by the amount of any payments ... under insurance programs\u201d when read together compel, on the facts in this case, that the petitioners are not entitled to compensation because of their receipt of insurance proceeds in excess of $10,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">As we find no error the report is to be dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b86-21\"> Joel J., Doreen A., Edward R. and Lorrie Ann Gurley.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b87-9\"> The last sentence of the first paragraph of section five provides that one hundred dollars shall be deducted from any award for \u201cout of pocket\u201d loss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b87-10\"> We need not decide whether social security payments are made \u201cfrom public funds\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b88-8\"> Section 6 provides, in part, that in determining the amount of compensation \u201cThe court shall take into consideration ... the availability of funds appropriated for the purpose of this chapter.\u201d The respondent argues that funds sufficient to pay outstanding awards had not been appropriated at the time of the finding in this case. Because this issue was not presented to us in the report we cannot consider it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
