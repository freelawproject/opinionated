The answer was a general denial, the allegation of truth and the allegation of privilege and the lack of any real damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">The plaintiff duly filed the following requests for rulings of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-10\">1. A matter is a libel if in view of all of the circumstances it discredits the plaintiff in the minds of any considerable and respectable class in the community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-11\">2. The libel published herein accuses the plaintiff of a crime and is actionable per se.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>3. The language that the plaintiff was divorced on the grounds of adultery taken in its ordinary and' natural meaning is capable of being understood by the average man as a personal reflection on the plaintiff\u2019s character.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">The judge granted all the requests. He then made a general finding for the defendant and also made the following findings of specific facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-5\">\u201cI find that the publication in a newspaper of the proceeding of the probate court in divorce cases is a matter of public interest. I find that the defendant did not publish an inaccurate account of divorce proceedings, with actual malice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The plaintiff being aggrieved by the general finding of the court claimed this report.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Findings inconsistent with the disposition of requests are not subject of report, the remedy is by motion to correct, or motion for a new trial. <em>Vieira </em>v. <em>Balsamo, </em>328 Mass. 37. <em>Spring </em>v. <em>F. B. Rich &amp; Son, Inc., </em>18 Legalite 21, p. 6. We do not choose to decide this case on this technicality.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">There was evidence that the defendant published in its newspapers a list of probate decrees one of which was the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-9\">\u201cOn the grounds of cruel and abusive treatment and adultery to John David Tyburski of 923 Liberty Street from Lucille Diane LaFlamme Tyburski of 191 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Cherokee Drive, custody of two children to mother. Married September 3, 1960.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">A reporter for one of the defendant\u2019s newspapers testified that he went to the Probate Court at 4:00 p.m., and examined the divorce papers that were allowed that day, that he made the mistake in that he read the petition but the decree had not been typed. There was evidence indicating he was not activated by any malice and that he had not known the plaintiff. The report states there was evidence \u201cthat the divorce was obtained among other grounds on the grounds of adultery.\u201d But from the whole report we infer that adultery was not set forth in the decree thereafter the publication was inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">\u201cA general finding for the defendant by the trial judge will not be disturbed by this court if it can be supported upon any reasonable view of the evidence with all rational inferences of which it is susceptible, unless such finding is plainly wrong.\u201d <em>Scire </em>v. <em>Scire, </em>348 Mass. 768; Piekos v. <em>Bachand, </em>333 Mass. 211; <em>Hannaford </em>v. <em>Carlson, </em>23 Legalite 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The specific findings render the requests immaterial and therefore the allowance of them does not constitute reversible error. <em>Cassiani </em>v. <em>Ballino, </em>338 Mass. 784; <em>Deutsch </em>v. <em>Ormsby, </em>354 Mass. 485, 487; <em>Fain </em>v. <em>Fitzhenry-Guptil Co., </em>335 Mass. 6; <em>DeSouza </em>v. <em>Angelarous, </em>330 Mass. 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">The issue is whether it is necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>prove malice in an action against a newspaper for publication of an inaccurate report of a probate court decree. In our opinion malice is now required. The older cases wherein it has been held the inaccurate publication accusing the plaintiff of a crime is actionable per se have been superseded.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">\u201cThe Founders (of our government) felt that a free press would advance \u2018truth, science, morality and arts in general; as well as responsible government.\u201d <em>Curtis Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Butts, </em>388 U.S. 130, 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">In a series of cases beginning with <em>New York Times </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254 the court has considered the limitations upon state libel laws imposed by the constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and of the press.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">\u201cTraditional arguments suggest the libel law protects two separate interests of the individual : First, his desire to preserve a certain privacy around his personality from unwarranted intrusion, and, second a desire to preserve his public good name and reputation. <em>Rosenblatt </em>v. <em>Baer, </em>383 U.S. 75, 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">In <em>Times, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>385 U.S. 374, 388 the court said \u201cWe have recognized that \u2018Exposure of the self to others in varying degrees is a concomitant of life in a civilized community\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">. \u201cIt is clear that there has emerged from our cases decided since <em>(Times </em>v. <em>Sullivan) </em>the concept of the First Amendment\u2019s impact upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>state libel laws derives not so much from whether the plaintiff is a \u2018public official\u2019, \u2018public figure\u2019, or \u2018private individual\u2019 as it derives from the question whether' the allegedly defamatory publication concerns a matter of public or general interest.\u201d <em>Rosenbloom </em>v. <em>Metromedia, Inc., </em>U.S. (1971) 39 L.W. 4695, 4699.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">In the same case the court said \u201cWe think the time has come forthrightly to announce that the determinant whether the First Amendment applies to state libel actions is whether the utterance involved concerns an issue of public or general concern, albeit leaving the delineation of the reach of that term to future cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The court also said \u201cFreedom of the press and freedom of speech persuade us that allowing private citizens to obtain damage judgments on the basis of a jury determination that a publisher probably failed to exercise reasonable care would not provide adequate \u2018breathing space \u2019 for these great freedoms. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The Massachusetts Supreme Court followed <em>Rosenbloom </em>in abandoning \u201cpublic official\u201d or \u201cpublic figure\u201d in the application of actual malice. <em>Priestley </em>v. <em>Hastings &amp; Sons Publishing Company of Lynn, </em>359 - Mass. - (1971 Mass. Adv. Sh. 1265, 1268, 1269). It quoted from the <em>Rosenbloom </em>case: \u201cIf a matter is a subject of public or general interest, it cannot suddenly become less so merely because a private individual is involved, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>because in some sense the individual did not \u2018voluntarily\u2019 choose to become involved. The public\u2019s primary interest is in the event; the public focus is on the conduct of the participant and the content, effect, and significance of the conduct, not the participant\u2019s prior anonymity or notoriety. \u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b45-8\">George W. Leary of Springfield for the Plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b45-9\">James R. Crowe of Springfield for the Defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">In both the <em>Rosenbloom </em>and <em>Priestley </em>cases, actions by private individuals, the court held that the actual malice standard was applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">In the case before us, at most there was neglicence but not knowledge nor reckless disregard of the falsity of the publication. Therefore, proof of malice is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">There being no prejudicial error, the report is to be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
