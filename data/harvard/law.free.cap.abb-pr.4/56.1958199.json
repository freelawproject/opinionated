Had it been reduced to writing it would have sustained an action at law. It was not a gift, but an <em>agreement to convey, </em>founded upon a valuable consideration. Upon performance by the purchaser, the land, in equity, became his ; the vendor simply holding it as trustee <em>(Jer. Eq., </em>446; <em>Buckmasterv. </em>Harrop, <em>Ves. Jr., </em>456, 472; Pollexfen <em>v. </em>Moore, 3 <em>Atk., </em>272). The consideration was neither inequitable nor inadequate (3 <em>Pars. Contr., </em>359 ; Sheppard <em>v. </em>Bevin, 9 <em>Gill, </em>32; Crosbie <em>v. </em>McDonnell, 13 <em>Ves. Jr., </em>148 ; Rerick <em>v. </em>Kern, 14 <em>Serg. &amp; R., </em>271; King <em>v. </em>Thompson, 9 <em>Pet., </em>204; Syler <em>v. </em>Eckert, 1 <em>Binn., </em>378; McClure <em>v. </em>McClure, 1 <em>Barr., </em>374.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b71-7\">Parker, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQz\">This action is brought to compel a specific performance of an alleged parol agreement between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s father and the defendant\u2019s father, \"by which the former agreed to convey to the latter a piece of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The complaint states the agreement as follows:\u2014 \u201c That on or \u00e1bout the 1st day of November, 1846, Pliny Lobdell, for a good and valuable consideration, paid by Seymour Lobdell to said Pliny, sold, and, by parol, conveyed to said Lobdell all that certain piece or .parcel of land,\u201d describing it by metes and bounds, \u201ccontaining about fourteen acres of land, more or less; and at the same time said Pliny Lobdell yielded and gave up to said Seymour Lobdell the full and complete possession of said lands and premises, and agreed to and with said Seymour Lobdell to execute and deliver to him or his heirs a good and sufficient deed of conveyance thereof, in writing, at anytime, on request.\u201d It then sets forth that, in pursuance of such sale and conveyance, and relying upon the same, and upon the said promise to convey by a good and sufficient deed, the said Seymour, with the knowledge and consent of .said Pliny, took and entered into possession of the whole of said lands, and cleared up a large portion thereof, and tilled, cultivated, and used the same, as his own, continuously, until his death ; and while thus in possession, expended considerable sums of money in making substantial improvements and erecting valuable buildings thereon, with the knowledge and approbation of said Pliny. The answer denies the alleged sale and agreement to convey, and the payment of any valuable consideration, and avers that the occupation of said Seymour was by the permission of the said Pliny, who was his father, as tenant. at will, and that such was at all times the understanding of the parties in respect to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The case was tried before a referee, who found and reported that, in November, 1846, the said Pliny Lobdell made a verbal agreement with said Seymour Lobdell, that if the said Seymour would take possession of and clear up, and reduce to cultivation, and make improvements upon about fifteen acres, parcel of a piece of wild land owned by said Pliny, the said fifteen acres should become the property of said Seymour, and that he, the. said Pliny, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>would convey the same to him by a sufficient deed of conveyance for that purpose; and that the said Seymour took possession of said fifteen acres under said agreement, built a log house thereon with Pliny\u2019s assistance, moved his family into the house, and commenced to clear up the land, and built a barn on it; and in 1852 erected on it a framed dwelling-house, into which he moved his family, and where he continued to reside until his death, in May, 1864. That, while so residing on the premises, he cleared all of said fifteen acres but about three acres, farmed it, reduced it to cultivation, raised crops upon it, and had the entire management, use, and enjoyment of it as his own property. That the said Pliny and Seymour built a line fence between it and the residue of the lot, on which res-, idue Pliny cleared up to the line fence on one side, and Seymour cleared up to it on the other; the said Pliny having built upon the said residue, where he lived for the last ten or twelve years of his life, and died in November, 1864.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">As a conclusion of law, the referee found that the plaintiffs were entitled to judgment against these defendants, who bring this appeal, that they convey the said fifteen acres to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The general term affirmed the judgment entered upon the report of the referee, and the defendants, who are decreed to convey, appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">No question is raised but that the contract, if made as found by the referee, was taken out of the statute of frauds, by the part performance; but the defendants\u2019 counsel insist that the contract found is not sustained by any evidence ; that, at all events, it is not so clearly and satisfactorily proved as to make out a case for specific performance ; that the failure to prove the contract set up in the complaint should have produced a dismissal of the complaint; that the promise found was without valuable consideration; that the conditions were not fully performed by the promisees, and that the fifteen acres given to the plaintiffs were more than they are entitled to.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">It is impossible to maintain that there is no evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>support the findings of the referee. The testimony of Nancy Lohdell, the widow of Pliny, that her husband told his two sons, Seymour and Ammon, that they might have fourteen acres apiece, to go on to, and do the work as he did, and, as long as they did as he wanted them to, they might stay on it; that they should clear it up in farm-like style, and should not run over it, and (as stated on her cross examination) that, if they would go down on to this lot, and cultivate it, the land should, some time, be theirs;\u2014together with the .facts that they did go down and each take possession of the piece assigned him ; that when, some six months afterward, they came and asked him for deeds, or writings on his part which would entitle them to the land,, he refused, on the ground that his <em>word </em>was as good as a writing; that Seymour did clear, cultivate, and build on the piece assigned to him; that the father assisted in making the line fence, cutting it off from his other land, and recognized to various witnesses Seymour\u2019s right to control it, and told the witness, Oliver Pierce, after Seymour\u2019s death, that he meant to have &lt; deeded it to Seymour before he died, are surely some evidence in support of the finding of the referee, as to the agreement and its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Whether the court would have come to the same conclusion as the referee did, in regard to the contract, upon the whole evidence, we are not to inquire. In an action for specific performance, as in other actions, the questions of fact, upon conflicting evidence, are for the court below, and not for this court, except in the c\u00e1se provided for in section 268 of the code.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The rule which courts of equity have adopted in suits for the specific performance of contracts requires that the contract be established by competent and satisfactory proof; by proof which is definite and certain; for the reason, as Judge Story expresses it, that a court of equity \u201c ought not to act upon conjectures and if the proof should end in leaving the contract uncertain, so that the court cannot say what its precise import and limitations are, a decree for a specific performance will be withheld (1 <em>Story Eq. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number><em>Jur., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 764, 767). All this depends upon the evidence; and if evidence is given in the court \"below, tending to the establishment of such a contract, the sufficiency of the proof to satisfy the mind of the court as to the existence of the contract, with the requisite degree of clearness and certainty, is not a matter for this court to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The variance between the contract set up in the complaint, and that found by the referee, is not such as to require a dismissal of the complaint. Even under the former practice of the court of chancery, no such iron rule existed, but a variance might have led to an amendment of the bill rather than its dismissal (Harris <em>v. </em>Knickerbacker, 5 <em>Wend., </em>638); or the court would sometimes decree a specific performance in favor of the plaintiff, notwithstanding he failed to make out the case stated in his bill (1 <em>Story Eq. Jur., </em>\u00a7 770; Mortimer v. Orchard, 2 <em>Ves. Jr., </em>243). The rule of practice established by the code in regard to variances, however, whatever was the former rule, must now prevail in cases of this kind, as well as others. The difference between the terms of the contract, as alleged, and those proved in this case, was a mere variance, and was properly disregarded <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 169-171).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The promise to convey, as found by the referee, was not a mere voluntary one, but was made upon a <em>valuable </em>consideration, emanating from- a loss or disadvantage to the promisee. Pliny said to Seymour, \u2018 \u2018 If you will bestow certain work and labor on this piece of land, I will convey it to you.\u201d It cannot be doubted that if, after Seymour had done the work, Pliny had refused to convey, an action at law would lie for the breach of the contract. The consideration is sufficient to support the promise. A court of equity does not require more, in this respect, than a court of law, except that it will look at the consideration, with reference to its adequacy, in order to ascertain whether the inadequacy is so great as to show the contract fraudulent or unconscionable, in which case it will refuse its aid, and leave the complainant to his action at law (Seymour <em>v. </em>Delancy, 3 <em>Cow., </em>445). On the other hand, \u201cif the promisee, on the faith of the promise, does some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>act, or enters into some engagement which the promise justified, and which a breach of the promise would make very injurious to him, equity might regard this as confirming and establishing the promise, in much the same way as a consideration for it would\u201d (3 <em>Pars. Cont., </em>369 ; Crosbie <em>v. </em>McDoual, 13 <em>Ves., </em>148). In Shepperd <em>v. </em>Bevin (9 <em>Gill, </em>32) it was held that money exp'ended in improvement of land by a son, on the faith of an agreement of his parent to convey the land to him, constituted a consideration for which specific performance might be decreed against the heirs of the parent. The case at bar is stronger than that. The consideration is valuable, and there is no inadequacy, and the decreeing of a specific performance of the contract does not involve hardship or injustice against the defendants, while the denial of such a decree would operate as a fraud upon the plaintiffs. Their ancestor, under whom they claim, executed his part of the agreement in the confidence that the other party would do the same. To permit such other party or his heirs now to withdraw from the performance of the contract, would aid a manifest fraud against the plaintiffs (Parkhurst <em>v. </em>Van Cortlandt, 1 <em>Johns. Ch., </em>284; Malins <em>v. </em>Brown, 4 <em>N. Y. </em>[4 <em>Comst.], </em>403; 1 <em>Story Eg. Jur., </em>\u00a7 759).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The performance of the agreement by Seymour Lob-dell, as found by the referee, is, I think, sufficient to entitle the plaintiffs to the conveyance. There is no defect of performance, unless in the fact that about three acres of the fifteen remained uncleared. The contract, as found, was that Seymour should \u201ctake possession of, clear up, and reduce to cultivation, and make improvements upon a part of said piece of wild land containing fifteen acres.\u201d All this he did, with the exception above mentioned ; and this, I think, may well be deemed a substantial fulfillment of the contract on his part, especially as the referee also finds that the father, at various times, while Seymour lived oh the premises, assumed to direct him as to the clearing of the same, and that Seymour regarded his directions as binding on him, and obeyed the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">In regard to the quantity of land contained in the piece <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>fenced off for Seymour by the line fence built by him and his father, the referee also found that, although the exact quantity lying south of the fence was not distinctly proved, yet the parties spoke of it, treated and supposed it to be fifteen acres. The conclusion of law that the said Seymour Lobdell, at his death, was justly and equitably entitled to a deed of conveyance in fee of said fifteen acres of land from said Pliny, and the, direction for judgment for a conveyance to the plaintiffs of said fifteen acres of land, does not give them any land north of the'said division fence; and if the plaintiffs, in their judgment, have so described the land as to include land north of such fence, the defendants\u2019 remedy for such wrong is not to be had upon this appeal, but by application to the court below, to correct the judgment in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Upon the trial Ammon Lobdell and George Lobdell, the defendants against whom the decree to convey was made, were sworn as witnesses, and each was sought to be examined in his own behalf, in respect t\u00f3 the arrangement made by Pliny Lobdell, th\u00e9ir father, and Seymour Lobdell, in their presence, under which Seymour went into possession of the land in question,; which was objected to by the plaintiffs, on the ground that the witnesses were not competent, under section 399 of the code, to testify to such transaction. The objection was sustained, and the defendants excepted. Section 399 of the code, as it stood at the time of the trial, authorized parties to be witnesses in their own behalf, in the same manner as other witnesses, \u201cprovided, however, that the assignor of a thing in action shall not be examined in behalf of said party, nor shall a party to an action be examined in his own behalf, in respect to any transaction or communication had personally by said assignor, or said party, respectively, with a deceased person, against, parties who are the executors, administrators, h'eirs-at-law, next, of kin, or assignees of such deceased person,\u201d &amp;c. In this case a party to the action sought to be examined in his own behalf. So far, he had a right to testify. And it was against parties who were the heirs-at-law of a deceased person. This was not suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>cient to exclude him, unless the subject-matter of his-testimony was a transaction or communication had personally by him.with such deceased person, blow, the transaction or communication respecting which he sought to testify was not between himself and the deceased person, or, in the explicit language of the statute, \u201chad personally by said party with a deceased person,\u201d but was between the deceased person and a third person. I am unable to see why he was not a competent witness to that transaction, or how, without extending the limitation further than the statute has done, he could be excluded. Although it may be said that a party standing in the relation in which he does ought to have been excluded, for he has the same advantage over the plaintiffs as a witness as his father would have had, if living and standing as defendant in the suit, still, unless the section, as it stood, can be construed so as to exclude him, the legislature, and not the court, must rectify the omission. It will not suffice to say the case is within the spirit of the enactment, unless a fair construction of the language used will bring it within.the enactment itself. The subject of the section is, the allowance of parties to be witnesses in them own behalf, and its object is to provide generally for their examination as such witnesses, and the. specific exceptions to such' examination. The legislature having undertaken to specify the exceptions, the courts cannot allow any that are not specified by the legislature. When the legislature expressly limited the exclusion of a party to cases in. which he should offer to testify in respect to a transaction or communication had personally by him with the deceased person, it is impossible to construe that exclusion as meaning to cover transactions or communications had by some third person, whoever he may be, and however connected with the party offering to testify, with the deceased person. ' Such construction would ignore the terms \u201chad personally by him,\u201d which serve to show the precise extent of the exclusion. The testimony of these parties which was excluded was upon a vital point in the case, the proof in regard to which was conflicting. We cannot say but that it would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>over-balanced all the evidence of a contract to convey, and have satisfied the referee that none had been made. The error of their exclusion, if it was one, as I think it was, is, therefore, ground for a reversal of the judgment, and for granting a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered ; costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Judgment reversed, &amp;c.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
