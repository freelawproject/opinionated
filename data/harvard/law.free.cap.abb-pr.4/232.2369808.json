In the affidavit of verification, which was made by one of the plaintiffs, the affiant stated that \u201c he believes it to be true; all the allegations therein being made on information and belief:\u201d The defendant served an answer in due time, but it was unverified; and plaintiff\u2019s attorney accordingly returned it, and entered judgment as upon failure to answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-9\">Defendant now moved to set aside the judgment as irregular.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b248-10\"><em>H. P. </em>Fessenden, for the motion,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZf\">contended that the verification of the complaint was insufficient, and that defendant was, therefore, entitled to serve an unverified answer.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b248-11\"><em>John E. </em>Burrill, opposed.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b248-12\">Peabody, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Agff\">\u2014The Code (\u00a7157) requires the verification of a pleading, when made, to \u201c be to the effect that the same is true, to the knowledge of the person making it, except as to those matters stated on information and belief, and as to those matters he believes it to be true.\u201d Every verification, to comply with the Code, must be to this <em>effect; </em>and any thing short of this is not a verification within the meaning of the Code. The Code says \u201c <em>to the </em>effect,\u201d not <em>in the form or </em>language, much less in the precise words. Then where the matters in a pleading are stated on information and belief throughout, and the party verifying says that he believes it to be true, does he, in \u201c effect,\u201d say \u201c as to the matters therein stated on information and belief, he believes it to be true \u201d ?</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">It seems to me that it is perfectly certain that he does so. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>can hardly conceive of any thing more entirely beyond cavil. As to the verification in respect to matters stated on the party\u2019s knowledge, all inquiry here would be impertinent, as there are none stated in that manner in this complaint. Perhaps no deviation from the formula suggested by the Code, which is made to apply to both the modes of statement, has ever been sanctioned by the court; but I think this must. be. There are two modes of stating matters in a pleading recognized by the Code. The one is an absolute or unqualified averment. As to this, the verification must be to the effect that it is true to the party\u2019s knowledge. The other mode is on information and belief; and as to this the verification must be to the effect that the party believes it to be true. The happy pleader has here skilfully separated the verification proper for matter alleged on information and belief, from that proper for matter alleged without that qualification, and therefore on actual knowledge; and he has done it exactly at the proper place, for there cannot be a reasonable doubt, that with the other part of the usual affidavit omitted, he has given just what is properly applicable to the mode of averment adopted in the pleading, and all that is so applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The answer, therefore, was irregular, and the judgment was correctly entered. There is no irregularity, and the motion, so far as it is based on this irregularity, must be denied; but there is also a motion to be let in to answer and defend on the merits, which must be granted on the usual terms of payment of costs; judgment to stand as security, &amp;e.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
