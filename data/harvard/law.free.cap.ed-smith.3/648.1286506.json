Upon the return of the notice, the parties appeared; and the usual order, directing the joining of issues and. the service of the several pleadings \u25a0 allowed in ordinary actions, was entered by consent.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AlI\">The complaint was duly served, but: .the. defendant failed to answer. Upon proof of the regularity of the plaintiff\u2019s proceedings and of the default of the defendant in failing to answer, a writ of inquiry was issued to the sheriff, and the plaintiff\u2019s damages were assessed by a jury, summoned by that officer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b661-8\">Preparatory to entering judgment, the plaintiff now applied, under \u00a7 308 of the Code, before the amendments of April 17, 1857, for an allowance of a percentage upon the amount of the verdict, to be taxed with the ordinary costs of the action.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b661-9\"><em>Lawrence J. </em>Goodall, for the motion..</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b661-10\"><em>Peter Van Antwerp </em>and <em>Thomas D. </em>James, opposed.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b660-12\"> The power to grant an extra allowance, where \u201ca,trial has been had,\u201d in an action \u201c for the recovery of money,\u2019.\u2019 is abolished by. the amendments to which this section of the Code was subjected, in the act of April 17, 1857.

The plaintiff\u2019s damages have been assessed, by a sheriff \u2019a jury, and preparatory to entering up judgment-he asks for. an extra allowance. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b661-12\">There is no authority for granting.an extra allowance in-such a case. The action is. for the recovery of money,:but there, has not been a trial within the meaning of the 308th section of the Code. What is meant by a trial in that section is the trial of an issue:. If issue, has been joined, the plaintiff, whether the defendant appears, to contest at the trial or not, Is bound to go <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>on and establish the truth of the matters put in issue; but where the plaintiffs take judgment by default for want of an answer, the cause of action is admitted, and there is no occasion for a trial. A writ of inquiry or a reference is ordered under the statute of 1855, merely to ascertain the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">It is suggested that the course of procedure is analogous to the foreclosure of a mortgage, in which case an extra allowance may be granted. It is very true that this proceeding is analogous to the foreclosure of a mortgage, but it is not the foreclosure of a mortgage for which alone provision has been made in the section referred to. It is also suggested that it is in the nature of a claim upon real property, but it is not in the language of the statute \u201c a proceeding to compel the determination of claims to real property.\u201d As it falls, therefore, within none of the cases provided for by \u00a7 308, there is no authority for granting an extra allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">As the point is suggested for the first time, I have conferred with my brethren, and they agree with me that we have no power to grant an extra allowance in such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Motion'denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
