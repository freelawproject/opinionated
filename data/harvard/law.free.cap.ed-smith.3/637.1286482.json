These provisions show the intent of the act to be the creation of a lien on real estate, which is to be foreclosed by a proceeding in the form of an action, which lien is to continue until the judgment is recovered and payment enforced by legal proceeding. In pursuance of such a construction, we have heretofore held that a proceeding under this statute is an equitable one. In originally construing this statute, we were compelled to adopt the opinion, that in the proceedings under it the court must act as a court of equity, and that the remedy was one of an equitable rather than of a \"legal character. <em>(Doughty </em>v. <em>Devlin, </em>1 E. D. Smith, p. 644.)</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">And in <em>Cronkright </em>v. <em>Thomson, </em>1 E. D. Smith, p. 661, we also held that the proceeding was not to recover money from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>the defendant personally, but was a proceeding <em>in rem </em>to foreclose a lien upon property; and in <em>Gridley </em>v. <em>Rowland, </em>ib. 670, that it was a foreclosure of a security, and formed no defence (until paid) to proceedings to recover the money in a personal action. (See also <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Decker, </em>ib. 699; <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Jaques, 2 </em>E. D. Smith, p. 571.)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">In <em>Eagleson </em>v. <em>Clarke, 2 </em>E. D. Smith, 644, the court decided the form- of a judgment to be in that case proper, declaring the sum due to be a lien upon the premises-, and directing the sale of. the interest-of the defendant therein, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">. In <em>Althause et al. </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>ib. p. 657, Judge Daly, adopting these views,-directed.a:, judgment to be entered declaring the amount of the lien,- directing a sale of the defendant\u2019s interest, and that the sheriff report, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">From a view of all the cases, it. is apparent that from the first adjudication upon this statute, the court has. been compelled to treat the proceeding as an equitable one, as <em>in rem, </em>and not <em>in personam, </em>and as only the foreclosure of a lien, and not the ordinary action for the collection of a debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">The objection that payment of the judgment is tobe enforced by execution, as in other actions, is qualified by the 7th section, which says the execution is to be issued for the enforcement of the claim or lien, and we have also held that-the execution cannot be in. the ordinary form, inasmuch-as the same cannot be enforced against any other property .of the defendant than the land subject to the lien, except in cases where a personal liability also exists on his part, and must specially direct the sheriff what he..shall sell in pursuance of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">I have no hesitation, therefore, in regard to the question now before me, in adopting the conclusion, that the sale of the defendant\u2019s interest to be made \u25a0 under this -statute was intended to be an absolute sale, in, the same manner as under the foreclosure of a mortgage, of all the interest of the owner to the extent of such interest at the .time the notice of claim was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">It was urged, however, .in opposition to this motion, that the provisions- of the Revised Statutes, 2d. vol. p. 370, allowing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>right of redemption on the sale of real estate by virtue of an execution, applies to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">That statute applies only to personal actions and not to proceedings <em>in rent, </em>and the mere fact that the lien law directs an execution to issue to enforce the judgment, does not bring it within the purview of that act. The Revised Statutes apply to the case of executions issued against the goods and chattels of the debtor, and the form is prescribed to be against the personal property first, and then the real estate, and it relates to real estate held by the debtor at the time of docketing the judgment. Under the lien law nothing belonging to the debtor is to be sold except an interest in a specified piece of land, and then only as it existed at a time prior to the commencement of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The provisions for redeeming also would in many instances be found inapplicable to such a case, and the security contemplated by the lien law would be materially changed if such redemption is made applicable to sales under this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">But whatever view may be taken of this question prior to the act of 1855, there can be no doubt of the intention under that statute. The first section prescribes the form of the judgment, and provides that it \u201c shall direct the sale of the interest of the owner in the land and premises upon which the lien exists, to the extent of the right of such owner at the time of filing of the notice of the lien,\u201d and directs a distribution of the proceeds in part, and the surplus to be brought into court. It also provides for a distribution of such residue by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">The 4th section directs that such sale shall be made subject to all prior liens, unless-the persons holding them are made parties, in which case the court is to settle their respective rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">These provisions are intended more clearly to assimilate the proceedings under this act to the foreclosure of a mortgage, and I think they must be governed by the same rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">It may well be doubted whether under the act of 1855 there is now any necessity to issue an execution merely for the sale of the defendant\u2019s interest, if no costs or other moneys are to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>be collected. The act speaks of sales of the defendant\u2019s interest under the judgment which specially directs the sale, and the change which is made by that statute, or rather the legislative interpretation given by that to the former statute, might warrant a proceeding in this case the same as in the case oi foreclosure of mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The motion is granted without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
