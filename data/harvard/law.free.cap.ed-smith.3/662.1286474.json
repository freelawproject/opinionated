Richmond, Commr. of Deeds.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b675-14\">On the day the intended lien was filed, the notice, provided in the fourth section of the act of 1851, requiring the defendant to appear and submit to an accounting, was served upon the defendant, returnable October 22,1851, at which time the parties appeared in this court. The usual order for the joinder of issues and for the service of pleadings was entered, and the cause proceeded upon complaint, answer and reply. A reference for the trial of the action having been directed, the proceedings were continued for several months, during which a mass of testimony was adduced upon either'side.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b675-15\">The trial finally resulted in a report in favor of the plaintiff, affirming the regularity of his proceedings to effect and enforce the statutory lien contended for, and finding against the defendant upon the contested merits of the claim on which the alleged lien was founded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b675-16\">Appecial judgment having been entered in the form prescribed by law and by the decisions of this court, the defendant appealed therefrom to the general term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>\u25a0 The amount found hy the referee due from the defendant was $825 88.

' -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b676-8\">The-notice of appeal from the judgment specified,, among other grounds of objection, that the judgment'contravened the statute of 1851, and the acts amendatory thereof, \u201cin all re-, spects, and particularly in respect to the lien notice.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b676-9\"><em>Benjamin T. Kissam, </em>for the defendant, made and argued the following with other points : .</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b676-10\">I. The notice served by the plaintiff upon the county clerk does not conform to the provisions of the \u201c act for the better security of mechanics and others,\u201d passed July 11,1851, and. the act amendatory thereof, passed April 13,1855; and hence this court has not acquired jurisdiction of the proceeding.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b676-11\">II. The first section of the act of 1851, gives a lien upon filing the notice prescribed by the sixth section, which prescribes four specific facts: . -</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b676-13\">\u25a0 1. The amount of the claim;</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeV\">2. The person against whom the claim is made;</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b676-15\">3. The name of the owner of the building;</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b676-16\">, 4. The situation of the building-.by its street and number, if the number be known.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b676-17\">. Each-and . all . of these specifications is and are vital.to the proceeding; and the notice having omitted the third one, viz., \u201c the name of the owner,\u201d it is a nullity. <em>(Beals </em>v. <em>The </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number><em>B'nai Jeshurun, </em>1 E. D. Smith, 654; Sedg. on Stat. and Com. Law, 347, <em>et </em>seq.; <em>Cronkright </em>v. <em>Thomson, </em>1 E. D Smith, 461.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b677-5\">HI. The notice is not verified in the same manner as a pleading is now required to be verified by the Code of Procedure. (Act of 1855, \u00a7 7; Code of Procedure, \u00a7 157; Requirements under the Code, <em>Van Horn </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>5 Pr. Rep. <em>328; Waggooner </em>v.

Bogardus, </em>for the plaintiff, made and argued the following with other points :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b677-7\">I. The notice of lien filed and offered in evidence by the plaintiff was competent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b677-8\">It contained all that was required by the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b677-9\">It was filed within the time required by the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b677-10\">It was properly verified.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b677-11\">See <em>Kinkaid </em>v. <em>Kip, </em>11 Leg. Obs. 313; <em>Radway </em>v. <em>Mather, </em>5 Sand. S. C. R. 655.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b677-12\">II. The objection to the notice of lien comes too late, as it should have been taken advantage of on the return of the notice for an accounting and in the answer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b677-13\">The defendant should have objected to its sufficiency .by answer or demurrer; and he has waived the objection if tenable at all.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b677-14\">By the Court. Ingraham, First J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHJ5\">The notice to create the lien in this case was not. verified as required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-15\">By the act of 1855, it is provided that such notice shall be verified in the same manner as a pleading. It cannot be pretended that an affidavit that the statement of the balance is due, is a verification of all the facts stated in the notice\u2014either of the plaintiff\u2019s own knowledge or on information or belief. It does not verify the allegations that the contract was made, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>nor that the defendants had any interest in the land, nor the location of the premises ; all of which are as necessary to the validity of the lien as the statement of the balance. This defect is one which goes to the whole claim and cannot be amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">It is suggested by the plaintiff that the defendant should have made the objection sooner. It is not obligatory on him to do so except on the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Unless the plaintiff shows a valid claim under a lien duly filed, he cannot succeed in \u2019an action under this statute. A void notice furnishes no foundation for a judgment. The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
