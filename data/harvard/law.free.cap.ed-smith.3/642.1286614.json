The judgment provided for the proper disposition of the proceeds of sale, and for the filing of a report, etc., and then directed that the purchaser be let into possession upon the production of the sheriff\u2019s deed and a certified copy of the order confirming the report of sale.

The premises in question consisted of several lots of land situate at the southeast corner of the Fifth Avenue and Thirty-fifth street, together with a church edifice erected thereon.

The act of 1787 (Greene, Laws N.

S. 500) or. existed until the act of 1820 (chap. clxxxiv. Laws 1820.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>That statute provided, \u201c That whenever lands or- t\u00e9nem\u00e9hte shall be sold \u201d \u201c by virtue- of any execution \u201d \u201c it shall be the duty of the sheriff or other officer inst\u00e9ad of-executing a de\u00e9d for the premises sold, to give to the purchaser or'purchasers of such lands or tenements a certificate,\u201d etc. The remaining provisions are\"substantially those of the present <em>law;'\u25a0</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-5\">The title of this act explains its object and limits its application: \u201cAn act in addition to the act c\u00f3n'cernihg judgments and executions.\u201d It conferred a right on-debtors (and their other creditors) whose'\"lands w\u00e9r\u00e9 bound by general judgments* but limited this right by the well \"known terms-of judgment and execution and \u25a0 by express r\u00e9f\u00e9rence to \"the act by which lands were made liable to be Sold \u201c by'virtue\u2019bf'ah'-execution.\u201d That under the broad terms, \u201c sheriff or other . offic\u00e9f,\u201d and any execution,\u201d it was intended- to \u2018apply-to \"other cases dhan those referred to, has never been pretended or Supposed.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-6\">The- subsequent statutes of the state have employed the same terms, \u201c any execution,\u201d but \u00e1s has always been-supposed, with the like limited effect. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-7\">But if by the employment of the term, execution, in the statutes allowing redemption, and in the lien law, it iseupposed the right of redemption may have been unwittingly given, it remains to inquire whether this , was the real intent of the act, or whether it is not controlled by other legislation;', ' \u2018 -..</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-8\">The lien'law (\u00a77) indeed-says that \u201c'exeeution shall issue for the enforcement\" of the claim in'the same manner as in cases-upon other judgments'in such Courts; \u201d-but this court-has held that \u201cwhen the legislature; in the act-in question, have likened the proceedings herein\" to proceedings upon-issues joined and judgments'rendered-'in other Civib actions for .the recovery of moneys, they must be deemed to mean civil actions for the recovery of moneys secured by liens upon property in some sort resembling the liens contemplated by this statute.\u201d <em>(Doughty </em>v. <em>Devlin, </em>1 E. D. Smith, p 644.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-9\">Again this court has -expressly held that parties may or may not be joined as in ordinary mortgage cases, and that the lien is a <em>quasi Us pendens. (Kaylor </em>v. <em>O'Connor, 1 </em>E. D. Smith, 679.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Bat \u00a7 287 of the Code, reenacted (1852) subsequently to the passage of this law, expressly provides that \u201creal property adjudged to be sold must be sold in the county,\u201d etc.,, and \u201c thereupon the sheriff or referee must execute a conveyance to the purchaser.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b658-5\">Now the judgment in this case does adjudge that real property shall be sold and therefore falls directly within the express provision of the Code, while the seventh section of the lien law alone uses the term \u201c execution,\u201d and that act nowhere provides that sales of real property shall be by execution or limits the remedy to execution. Further than this, there may be cases where an ordinary execution would be proper under the seventh section, as for a deficiency or where the judgment was personal; but in others, the word execution must be controlled by the words \u201c in the same manner as in cases upon other judgments.\u2019\u201d The nature of the judgment will therefore determine the \" manner \u201d in which the relief is to be granted. Where the judgment is personal, it will be by ordinary execution. Where \u201c real property is adjudged to be sold,\u201d it will be \u201c in the same manner as in cases upon other judgments, or by a certified copy of the decree.\u201d Under \u00a7 8 of .the act this is still clearer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b658-6\">Whatever may be determined in a case arising before the amendments of 1855, it must be held impossible to give any effect to the first section of that act, if the sale by the sheriff here be as under an ordinary execution. The intent of the legislature to make the practice conform to that in an ordinary foreclosure case seems so clear that no argument is deemed necessary. It would however remove many doubts, could the decision of the court be made to rest on the act of 1851 alone.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b658-7\"><em>Aug.

The judgment directed the sheriff to sell the interest of the defendant in the premises at the time of filing the notice to create the lien, and to execute a deed therefor to the purchaser. The sale was made by the sheriff, who refuses to give a deed, but offers a certificate of sale, in the same manner as under sale of a debtor\u2019s interest and lands under ordinary executions.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">It would be sufficient for this case to say that the judgment of the court directs the sheriff to make the sale of the defendant\u2019s interest and to execute a deed therefor to the purchaser. As an officer of the court it is his duty to obey the judgments and decrees of the court, and it is not within his province to say that any judgment so rendered was erroneous, or to refuse obedience to its directions. So long as the judgment remained, the sheriff and defendant were alike bound by it, and if that judgment directed an absolute sale of the property, and the execution of a deed therefor to the purchaser, the sheriff could not with any propriety go behind such judgment to inquire whether it was properly rendered. If the judgment was erroneous it could only be corrected by the defendant on appeal, and until so corrected it was the duty of the sheriff to obey its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">For the reasons stated in the case of <em>Randolph </em>v. <em>Leary, </em>decided by me at this term, March, 1857, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>I am of the opinion that the judgment was not erroneous, that the sale of the defendant\u2019s interest is absolute, that the defendant has no right of redemption and that the sheriff should execute the deed as required by the plaintiff on this motion. I refer to my opinion in that case for the reasons upon which it is founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">There is, however, a difficulty in this case which prevents the granting of this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">On referring to the certificate of sale I find that the sheriff sold the property described and not the interest of the defendant in the property on the day of filing the notice as directed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>judgment. That such ..property was sold,, also subject: to mortgages and judgments thereon, andean-order directing the sheriff to give a deed of the premises ,as sold, would , direct a. conveyance of the property and not of . the .interest .of the defendant in the properfy.at the time of, filing the notice to create the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The sale in this form was erroneous,.and.npt warranted .by the judgment. The statute is positive in directing what shall be sold. The first section of the .amendatory act, Sess. Laws, 1855, p. <em>760, </em>provides that the judgment shall direct.the sale, of the. interest of the owner, in the land, to the, extent.,pf: the right of, the owner at the time of ..the filing of., the notice, of lien. The first section provides, that such sale shall be. made subject to any prior liens existing therepn. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">It is not necessary to. sell , in express ,terms subject, to mortgages, or other encumbrances, because i,f the sale, is properly-made of only the defendant\u2019s interest, such sale.will, as matter of law, be subject to the rights and interest, of any other person in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">The motion must on. this account be denied, and. a resale, be directed at which the defendant\u2019s interest only, must be sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b659-9\"> <em>Ante, </em>p. 637.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
