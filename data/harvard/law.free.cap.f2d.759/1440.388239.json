On the same day, Center sent notice by Mailgram<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to its ten largest creditors of a hearing on December 22, 1981, before the bankruptcy court for approval of a stipulation Center had entered into with Union Bank, Center\u2019s secured lender.</p>\n<p id=\"b1504-8\">Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation (Owens-Corning), Center\u2019s largest creditor, received the mailgram on December 21, 1981, the day before the hearing. Owens-Corning states that it was unable to send counsel to the hearing, although one of its regional credit managers did attend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1504-20\">At the end of the hearing, Bankruptcy Judge King signed a Cash Collateral Order (CCO) incorporating the terms of the stipulation. The CCO accomplished two basic goals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1504-21\">(1) pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 364(d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the CCO permitted Center to borrow additional funds from Union Bank in exchange for granting the Bank a senior lien on all of Center\u2019s pre-petition and post-petition property, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1504-22\">(2) pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(c),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the CCO permitted Center to use its cash collateral<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to make payments to Union Bank, thereby gradually reducing Center\u2019s indebtedness to the Bank.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1504-23\">At the date of filing the Chapter 11 petition, Union Bank had a senior lien on all of Center\u2019s inventory<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Owens-Corning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1443\">*1443</page-number>had a junior lien on Center's Owens-Corning inventory.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The CCO stated that \u201c[t]he parties believe that [the CCO] <em>does not affect the rights of any other lienholder,\u201d </em>and that Center \u201cratifies and affirms the validity, perfection and enforceability of all liens, security interests and encumbrances heretofore granted by [Center] to [Union Bank] <em>without prejudice to the rights of any other party.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Despite this clear language, Owens-Corning argues that the CCO did affect its security interest in Center\u2019s Owens-Corning inventory and proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-5\">Owens-Corning asserts that, on the date of filing, Center owed Union Bank $990,-000; that Center owed Owens-Corning $1,400,000; that the collateral subject to Union Bank\u2019s lien (all of Center\u2019s inventory, including the Owens-Corning inventory) was worth $6,313,278; and that the portion of the collateral subject to Owens-Corning\u2019s lien (Center\u2019s Owens-Corning inventory) was worth $1,214,303.</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-6\">To summarize these allegations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1505-7\">Center\u2019s Inventory: Other Goods Owens-Corning Total</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1505-8\">Goods</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1505-9\">Value of Collateral: $5,098,975 + $1,214,303 = $6,313,278</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1505-10\">First Lienor</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1505-11\">(amt. of debt): Bank--{$990,000) - Bank</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1505-12\">Second Lienor</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1505-13\">(amt. of debt): \u2014 Owens-Corning</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1505-14\">($1,400,000)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1505-15\">Owens-Corning argues that the CCO improperly authorized Center to use the proceeds from the sale of Owens-Corning inventory (worth $1,214,303) to satisfy <em>not only the Bank\u2019s senior lien in the amount of $990,000, but also the additional debt incurred under the CCO. </em>Based on the above allegations, Owens-Corning argues that the CCO thereby <em>granted the Bank a senior lien on the portion of the inventory on which Owens-Corning previously was the sole lienor, </em>i.e., <em>$224,303 </em>($1,214,303 minus $990,000) worth of Center\u2019s Owens-Corning inventory, <em>effectively extinguishing Owens-Coming\u2019s rights in the property.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1505-16\">On December 24, 1981, Center mailed to all of its creditors notice of a hearing on January 14, 1982, before Judge King \u201cto consider the debtor\u2019s application for approval of the <em>continued effectiveness </em>of a certain financing agreement between the debtor and Union Bank, the debtor\u2019s general lender.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Six days later, Center mailed the creditors a copy of the CCO.</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-20\">Judge King held the hearing on January 14 to allow creditors who had not received notice of the December 22 hearing to express opposition to the CCO. Counsel for Owens-Corning attended the hearing and moved for a continuance on the ground that he had not had sufficient time to review the CCO. Judge King denied the motion for a continuance because he concluded that the CCO was a final order, subject to attack only by a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1505-21\">As I read this order: there is an order. There is nothing that seems to provide for a continued hearing. The notice says that there is to be an application for approval, but really it has already been approved. So, I think that the options that are open to creditors if they are unhappy are to take advantage of remedies provided in the approved stipulation; and if they feel that the approval was improvident or improper, then perhaps they can proceed under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; but aside from that, I see nothing that can be done today, or any reason to set it for a future hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1505-22\">On April 26, 1982, Owens-Corning filed a complaint against Center and Union Bank seeking reclamation of goods, declaration of a security interest, adequate protection of that interest, and related remedies. Pursuant to the procedure in the Northern District of California, this adversary proceeding was assigned to Judge Rainville, a bankruptcy judge different from the one presiding over the chapter proceeding (Judge King).</p>\n<p id=\"b1505-23\">Center filed a motion for partial summary judgment in the adversary proceeding. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1444\">*1444</page-number>On March 3, 1983, Judge Rainville entered a Corrected Amended Opinion and Order, granting Center\u2019s motion for summary judgment in large part, but also holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1506-4\">Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation does have a perfected lien as to the value of any Owens-Corning Corporation inventory and proceeds thereof in possession of Center Wholesale, Inc. as of the commencement of the chapter 11 case on December, 1981, less the amount of Union\u2019s senior security interest on December, 1981, and <em>less the amount of Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation\u2019s inventory and proceeds paid to Union pursuant to the court\u2019s cash collateral order dated December, 1981.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1506-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-6\">Owens-Corning- appealed Judge Rain-ville\u2019s Opinion and Order to the District Court. On November 13, 1984, U.S. District Judge Conti affirmed Judge Rain-ville\u2019s Corrected Amended Opinion and Order, holding that Owens-Corning did have a valid security interest in Center\u2019s Owens-Corning inventory, but that the CCO properly permitted Center to use that inventory to pay off the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-7\">On June 15, 1983, approximately three months after Judge Rainville issued his Corrected Amended Opinion and Order, Owens-Corning brought a Rule 60(b) motion in the chapter proceeding before Judge King, alleging surprise, change of circumstances, and voidness, and seeking modification of the CCO to marshal liens as between Owens-Corning and the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-8\">Judge King held a hearing and entered an order denying Owens-Corning\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion on the grounds that it was untimely and that the requested relief would prejudice the estate. Owens-Corning appealed to the district court, but the district court entered an order denying appeal and affirming the bankruptcy court. Owens-Corning then appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-12\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-13\">I. Whether and to what extent Owens-Corning had property rights that were affected by the CCO.</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-14\">II. Whether Owens-Corning\u2019s Rule 60(b) (4) motion was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-15\">III. Whether Center\u2019s notice of the hearing to approve the CCO satisfied due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1506-16\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"A6Q\">In <em>Northern Pipeline Const. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., </em>458 U.S. 50,102 S.Ct. 2858, 73 L.Ed.2d 598 (1982), the Supreme Court invalidated the trial court jurisdiction accorded bankruptcy judges by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To prevent undue disruption, the Court held that the <em>Marathon </em>decision would not apply to judgments entered by bankruptcy judges before October 4, 1982. <em>Id. </em>at 88, 102 S.Ct. at 2880. The Court later extended this stay to December 24, 1982. 459 U.S. 813, 103 S.Ct. 200, 74 L.Ed.2d 60 (1982). In light of <em>Marathon, </em>we have held that a Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (BAP) may decide only those bankruptcy appeals involving judgments entered before the stay expired on December 24, 1982. In re <em>Burley, </em>738 F.2d 981, 984 (9th Cir.1984).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Judgments and orders entered by bankruptcy judges after that date under the Emergency Rule<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> are not appealable to the BAP.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1445\">*1445</page-number>Burley\u2019s significance on the standard of review is its effect on prior Ninth Circuit cases discussing this court\u2019s review of BAP decisions. Because the district court replaced the BAP as the intermediate court in this ease,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> our determinations as to the appropriate standards for reviewing BAP decisions should apply when we review the district court\u2019s decision as well.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1507-5\">We have consistently held that because this court is in as good a position as the BAP to review the findings of a bankruptcy judge, we independently review the bankruptcy judge\u2019s decision without deferring to the BAP\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., In re Mellar, </em>734 F.2d 1396, 1399 (9th Cir.1984); In re <em>Comer, </em>723 F.2d 737, 739 (9th Cir. 1984); <em>In re Bialac, </em>712 F.2d 426, 429 (9th Cir.1983). Similarly, because we are in as good a position as was the district court to review Judge King\u2019s denial of Owens-Corning\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion, we review that decision de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-6\">Whether Owens-Corning had property rights and to what extent those rights were affected by the CCO involve questions of fact that we review under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>See id. </em>However, because Judge King never made these crucial findings, we must remand to permit him to adopt Judge Rainville\u2019s findings, if any, under the doctrine of collateral estoppel,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or make the findings himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-13\">The remaining issues \u2014 whether Owens-Corning can avail itself of the doctrine of marshaling to create or enlarge its property rights, whether Owens-Corning\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion was timely, and whether the mailgram notice satisfied due process \u2014 involve questions of law that we review de novo. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1507-14\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-15\">I. Whether and to what extent Owens-Corning had property rights affected by the CCO.</p>\n<p id=\"b1507-16\">A. <em>Valuation of Center\u2019s Owens-Corning Inventory.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1507-17\">The Fifth Amendment provides that no person shall \u201cbe deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d To have standing to bring a Rule 60(b) motion challenging the CCO on due process grounds, Owens-Corning must show that it had property rights affected by the CCO.</p>\n<p id=\"b1508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1446\">*1446</page-number>Judge King did not address the factual question whether Owens-Corning had property rights in the collateral Center used to pay off its debt to Union Bank pursuant to the CCO. In a separate adversary action, Judge Rainville did determine that Owens-Corning had a \u201cperfected lien as to the value of any Owens-Corning Corporation inventory and proceeds thereof in possession of Center Wholesale, Inc. as of the commencement of the chapter 11 case on December, 1981, less the amount of Union\u2019s senior security interest on December, 1981____\u201d But Judge Rainville\u2019s Amended Opinion and Order does not contain a valuation of Owens-Corning\u2019s claim on the date of filing or the amount of Owens-Corning inventory used to pay off Union Bank after that date. In the July 15, 1983, hearing before Judge King, counsel for Owens-Corning indicated that valuation was an issue before Judge Rainville, but that he had not yet ruled on it.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1508-5\">For the purposes of the following discussion, we will assume that Owens-Corning had a valid junior security interest and that Owens-Corning\u2019s valuation of Center\u2019s inventory is correct. This would give Owens-Corning a valid security interest in the portion of Owens-Corning inventory (allegedly worth $224,303) that exceeds the $990,000 debt Center owed Union Bank. On remand, Judge King may be able, under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, to adopt Judge Rainville\u2019s findings, if any, as to valuation; otherwise, he should make valuation findings himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1508-8\">B. <em>Marshaling.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1508-9\">Owens-Corning argued before the bankruptcy and district courts that it was entitled under California law<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> to request a marshaling of assets, requiring Union Bank to satisfy its claim out of the assets on which Owens-Corning did not have a lien before the Bank could turn to Center\u2019s Owens-Corning inventory for satisfaction. In other words, Owens-Corning asserts that it had a valid property right in all of Center\u2019s Owens-Corning inventory, even that part ($990,000 worth) in which Union Bank had a senior lien. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1508-10\">Section 544 of the Bankruptcy Code, the \u201cstrongarm clause,\u201d vests the trustee or debtor in possession<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> with all of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHD\">the rights and powers of ... a creditor that extends credit to the debtor at the time of the commencement of the case, and that obtains, at such time and with respect to such credit, a judicial lien on all property on which a creditor on a simple contract could have obtained a judicial lien, whether or not such a creditor exists____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1508-11\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544(a)(1) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1508-12\">In its position as a judicial lien creditor under section 544, Center objected to Owens-Corning\u2019s request for marshaling on the ground that it would do \u201cinjustice to third persons,\u201d namely the estate. Cal.Civ. Code \u00a7 3433. If Union Bank used collateral other than Center\u2019s Owens-Corning inventory to satisfy Union\u2019s claim, permitting Owens-Corning exclusively to use the Owens-Corning inventory to satisfy Owens-Corning\u2019s claim, there would be $990,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1447\">*1447</page-number>less in assets in the estate to divide up among the unsecured creditors than if the Bank used the Owens-Corning inventory and thereby foreclosed Owens-Corning\u2019s ability to use that portion ($990,000 worth) of the collateral to satisfy its debt.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Judge King agreed \u201cwith the suggestion by the debtor [in possession] that there would be prejudice to the debtor [in possession], and also to the unsecured creditors, if this marshaling approach were to be taken long after the initial order was entered.\u201d He therefore denied Owens-Corning\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion in part because marshaling would be inappropriate and prejudice the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1509-5\">In <em>In re Forester, </em>529 F.2d 310 (9th Cir.1976), we concluded in an alternate holding that, under the Bankruptcy Act of 1968,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the trustee<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> of a bankrupt estate could not block a request for marshaling made by a junior secured creditor to a senior secured creditor. <em>Id. </em>at 316-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1509-6\">However, after <em>Forester </em>was decided, the California courts clarified the rights of a judicial lien creditor in <em>Shedoudy v. Beverly Surgical Supply Co., </em>100 Cal.App.3d 730, 161 Cal.Rptr. 164 (1980). In holding that a judgment creditor is entitled to a marshaling order, <em>Shedoudy </em>implied that such a creditor is also entitled to block a marshaling order prejudicing his interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1509-11\">Because the validity, nature, and effect of liens are governed by the law of the state where the property is located, and because California law after <em>Shedoudy </em>gives judicial lien creditors, such as the debtor in possession under \u00a7 544, the power to block a marshaling order, we hold as a matter of law that Center has standing to block Owens-Corning\u2019s request for marshaling.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Otherwise, Owens-Corning would be able to take advantage of collateral for which it never bargained, namely, $990,000 worth of Center\u2019s inventory other than Owens-Corning goods, to the detriment of the general unsecured creditors. Our holding, therefore, limits Owens-Corning\u2019s property rights to the portion of Center\u2019s Owens-Corning inventory that exceeds in value Union Bank\u2019s senior lien, namely, $224,303 worth of Owens-Corning goods under the alleged facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1509-12\">II. Whether Owens-Corning\u2019s Rule 60(b) (4) motion was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1509-13\">Owens-Corning brought a motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4), which provides that \u201c[o]n motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: ... (4) the judgment is void.\u201d The rule requires that a 60(b)(4) motion \u201cbe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1448\">*1448</page-number>made within a reasonable time,\u201d but if a judgment is void, a motion to set it aside may be brought at any time. <em>See </em>11 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 2862 at 197 (1973) and cases cited therein. Moreover, a void judgment cannot acquire validity because of laches on the part of the judgment debtor (Owens-Corning in this case). <em>Id. </em>Therefore, Owens-Corning\u2019s delay in bringing its Rule 60(b)(4) motion is irrelevant and the motion was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1510-4\">III. Whether Center\u2019s notice of the hearing to approve the CCO satisfied due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1510-5\">As noted above, Owens-Corning is appealing the bankruptcy and district courts\u2019 denial of its Rule 60(b) motion on voidness grounds. A judgment is not void merely because it is erroneous. It is void only if the court that rendered judgment lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter, or of the parties, or if the court acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law. <em>See </em>11 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 2862 at 198-200 (1973) and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1510-7\">Owens-Corning alleges that Center provided insufficient notice of the hearing in which Judge King approved the CCO and deprived Owens-Corning of due process of law. We have previously acknowledged that a judgment may be set aside on voidness grounds under Rule 60(b)(4) for a violation of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. <em>Winhoven v. United States, </em>201 F.2d 174, 175 (9th Cir.1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b1510-9\">The Supreme Court set forth the due process requirements for notice in <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1510-10\">An elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and to afford them an opportunity to present their objections. The notice must be of such nature as reasonably to convey the required information ... and it must afford a reasonable time for those interested to make their appearance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1510-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 314, 70 S.Ct. at 657 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1510-13\">The Court later explained that \u201c[t]he purpose of notice under the Due Process Clause is to apprise the affected individual of, and permit adequate preparation for, an impending \u2018hearing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Division v. Craft, </em>436 U.S. 1, 14, 98 S.Ct. 1554, 1563, 56 L.Ed.2d 30 (1978) (footnote omitted). Owens-Corning claims that Center\u2019s mail-gram notice, received one day before the hearing, came too late and provided insufficient information to permit Owens-Corning adequately to prepare and present its objections. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1510-14\">In reaching our conclusion that the notice Center provided did not fulfill the due process requirements of timeliness and specificity, we examine the notice\u2019s adequacy in light of the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s statutory requirements, safeguards, and remedies. We recognize, of course, that Owens-Corning must prove a constitutional, not merely statutory, violation to succeed on its Rule 60(b)(4) motion. Yet, because the adequacy of notice depends upon the factual context in which it is given, we need to examine its timeliness and specificity in light of the Bankruptcy Code provisions governing Center\u2019s actions under the CCO. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 102(1)(A), 363(c)(3) &amp; 364(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1510-15\">The Code contains specific provisions concerning the type of notice required when the debtor in possession wishes to use its cash collateral (\u00a7 363(c)(2)) or to borrow additional funds after the date of filing (\u00a7 364(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1510-16\">Concerning the use of cash collateral, section 363(c)(2) states that \u201c[t]he trustee may not use, sell, or lease cash collateral under paragraph (1) of this subsection unless \u2014 ... (B) the court, <em>after notice and a hearing, </em>authorizes such use, sale, or lease in accordance with the provisions of this section.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(c)(2) (emphasis added). Section 363(c)(3) further provides that <em>\u201c[a]ny hearing </em>under paragraph (2)(B) of this subsection ... <em>shall be scheduled in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1449\">*1449</page-number><em>accordance with the needs of the debtor </em>____ The court shall act promptly on any request for authorization under paragraph (2)(B) of this subsection.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(c)(3) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-6\">Concerning the obtaining of credit, section 364(d)(1) provides that \u201c[t]he court, <em>after notice and a hearing, </em>may authorize the obtaining of credit or the incurring of debt secured by a senior or equal lien on property of the estate that is subject, to a lien ...\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 364(d)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-7\">The Code\u2019s rules of construction define the phrase \u201cafter notice and a hearing\u201d to mean <em>\u201cafter such notice as is appropriate in the particular </em>circumstances____\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(1)(A) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-10\">Reviewing the facts as Owens-Corning alleges them to be and as Judge Rainville\u2019s Amended Opinion suggests they are, we conclude that Judge King\u2019s issuance of the CCO as a final order<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> on such short notice, viz., one day, was inappropriate in the circumstances and violated the requirements of the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-14\">At the time the stipulation was approved, the bankruptcy judge and all interested parties, including Owens-Corning, had no reason to think that the CCO would affect Owens-Corning\u2019s security interest. The CCO provided that \u201c[t]he liens granted to [Union Bank] herein shall be senior to all other liens, security interests and encumbrances which may <em>hereafter </em>be created in favor of third parties,\u201d implying that the liens would be junior to liens that Center had previously granted creditors like Owens-Corning. (Emphasis added.) Moreover, the CCO explicitly stated that \u201c[t]he parties believe that this Stipulation <em>does not affect the rights of any other lien-holder\u201d </em>and that Center \u201cratifies and af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1450\">*1450</page-number>firms the validity, perfection and enforceability of all liens, security interests and encumbrances heretofore granted by the Debtor to [Union Bank] <em>without prejudice to the rights of any other party.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-4\">The CCO did provide that Center would \u201cturn all said collections and all cash sale proceeds over to [Union Bank], and [Union Bank] shall apply said receipts to the Loan, until payment in full of all amounts owing to [Union Bank] by [Center].\u201d But it was not until Judge Rainville found that Owens-Corning had a perfected lien in Center\u2019s Owens-Corning inventory and that the CCO authorized Center to erode that security interest by selling off the inventory and paying the proceeds to Union Bank, that it became clear that the CCO affected Owens-Corning\u2019s security interest. Judge Rain-ville\u2019s decision prompted Owens-Corning to move under Rule 60(b) for modification of the CCO to force Union Bank to marshal its assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-5\">The bankruptcy and district courts did not want to overturn the CCO because (1) the parties had proceeded to carry it out and make business arrangements based on their belief that the CCO was final, and (2) Owens-Corning\u2019s request for marshaling was inappropriate since it would work to the detriment of the unsecured creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-6\">Yet, to the extent the CCO permitted Center to foreclose Owens-Corning\u2019s security interest in the portion of Center\u2019s Owens-Corning inventory that exceeded in value Center\u2019s original debt to Union Bank, the CCO violated section 364(d) of the Bankruptcy Code, requiring the debtor in possession to provide adequate protection of a secured creditor\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-7\">Section 364(d) permits the debtor in possession to incur debt secured by a senior lien only if the debtor demonstrates that it \u201cis unable to obtain such credit otherwise\u201d and that \u201cthere is <em>adequate protection </em>of the interest of the holder of the lien on the property of the estate on which such senior or equal lien is proposed to be granted.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 364(d)(1) (emphasis added). Adequate protection is defined in section 361 to include \u201cproviding ... an additional or replacement lien to the extent that such stay, use, sale, lease, or grant results in a decrease in the value of such entity\u2019s interest in such property ____\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 361(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-11\">Because the CCO authorized Center to use proceeds from the inventory on which Owens-Corning was the sole lienor to pay off Center\u2019s new debts to Union Bank, the CCO effectively granted the Bank a senior lien in that inventory. Under the provisions of section 364(d), Center was therefore required to prove that it was adequately protecting Owens-Corning\u2019s interest. In this case, the protection probably would have consisted of granting Owens-Corning a replacement lien in other Center property. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 361(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1512-12\">Neither the mailgram nor the stipulation put Judge King or Owens-Corning on notice that Owens-Corning\u2019s security interest would be affected. Particularly in light of the fact that the stipulation stated that it did \u201cnot affect the rights of any other lienholder,\u201d Owens-Corning\u2019s receipt the day before the hearing of notice that Center \u201cwill grant to Union Bank a lien upon all of its assets to secure all indebtedness to Union Bank\u201d was insufficient to alert Owens-Corning that it should immediately require Center to provide it with the adequate protection to which it was entitled under the Code. We therefore find that the one-day notice violated the requirements of the Due Process Clause because the notice was insufficient to permit Owens-Corning to adequately prepare for the impending hearing in which Judge King approved the CCO. <em>See Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Division, </em>436 U.S. at 14, 98 S.Ct. at 1562.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1451\">*1451</page-number>If the debtor in possession (Center) fails to provide adequate protection of a creditor\u2019s security interest, section 507(b) offers an equitable solution.

We realize that \"in certain circumstances the entire reorganization effort may be thwarted if emergency relief is withheld\" and that reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code \"is a perilous process, seldom more so than at the outset of the proceedings when the debtor is often without sufficient cash flow to fund essential business operations.\" <em>In re Sullivan Ford Sales, 2 </em>B.R. 350, 355 (Bankr.D.Me.1980).

However, the necessity of an immediate hearing to authorize the debtor's use of cash collateral or borrowing does not excuse a careful consideration of the continued propriety of such actions at a later date. In the legislative history accompanying section 102(1), which defines notice and hearing as that which \u201cis appropriate in the particular circumstances,\u201d Congress acknowledged that \"[i]n very limited emergency circumstances, there will be insufficient time for a hearing to be commenced before an action must be taken.

The court concluded that such an order \u201cshould remain in effect not more than ten days from its issuance, unless extended by the court within the ten-day period for good cause shown or by agreement of all adverse parties.\u201d 2 B.R. at 357. The court in <em>In re Sheehan </em>followed a similar procedure. Although it authorized the debtor\u2019s use of cash collateral at a hearing of which the debtor's major creditors has only 72 hours advance notice, the court scheduled a final hearing approximately 12 days later. <em>In re Sheehan, </em>38 B.R. 859, 863 (Bankr.D.S.D.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-16\">The debtor in the instant case appears to have proceeded under the assumption that Judge King\u2019s approval of the CCO on December 22 was merely temporary because its notice described the January 14 hearing as one to consider the \u201ccontinued effectiveness\u201d of the CCO. Judge King subsequently determined that the CCO was final because it did not contain a provision conditioning its effectiveness on the court\u2019s approval at the January 14 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1511-17\">Had the CCO contained such a provision and had Judge King seriously reconsidered the CCO\u2019s propriety at the January 14 hearing or granted Owens-Corning\u2019s request for a continuance and reconsidered the CCO at a later hearing where Owens-Corning, the creditors\u2019 committee, and the other creditors had a chance to challenge fully the CCO, then the notice of the December 22 hearing probably would have been sufficient to satisfy due process. Notice of a hearing for a temporary order need not meet the stringent standards notice of a hearing for a final order must meet to pass constitutional muster.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1512-8\">. Both Owens-Corning and Center cite to bankruptcy court decisions finding the notice given by the debtor in possession either appropriate or inappropriate under the circumstances of the particular case. Because these decisions are fact specific and do not directly address the due process issue, they are not particularly helpful in resolving questions of notice in the instant case. <em>See e.g., In re Sheehan, </em>38 B.R. 859 (Bankr.D.S.D.1984); <em>In re Adamson Co., Inc., </em>29 B.R. 937 (Bankr.E.D.Va.1983); <em>In re Anderson-Walker Industries, Inc., </em>3 B.R. 551 (Bankr.C.D. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1451\">*1451</page-number>Cal.1980); <em>In re Sullivan Ford Sales, 2 </em>B.R. 350 (Bankr.D.Me.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1513-21\">In the only case involving the issue of adequate protection, <em>Anderson-Walker Industries, </em>the creditor who was objecting to the use of cash collateral was vastly oversecured: its collateral was worth 7.3 times its secured claim. <em>Id. </em>at 552. There was little risk that Anderson-Walker\u2019s use of the cash collateral would harm the creditor\u2019s interest. In contrast, Owens-Corning is vastly undersecured: its claim is worth nearly 7 times its collateral. Therefore, both the risk of harm and the importance of notice are greatly increased.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1513-22\">. Section 507(b) addresses the situation where the debtor in possession initially provides protection that, after the fact, turns out to be inadequate.
