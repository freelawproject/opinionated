BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"APG\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-28\">Petitioner Emil Lawrence, who is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) as an associated person (\u201cAP\u201d) of a commodity broker, was a respondent in an earlier Commission enforcement proceeding, <em>In re First Commodity Cory, of Boston, </em>CFTC Docket No. 79-28. On September 3, 1980, Lawrence agreed to a settlement in that proceeding. He consented to findings that he had violated antifraud provisions of the Commodities Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-26 (1980) \u201cthe Act\u201d, relating to transactions in commodity options, and agreed to pay a civil penalty of 13,500.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finding this settlement acceptable, the Commission on October 15, 1980 entered an order imposing a $3,500 civil penalty against Lawrence, payable six months later on April 15, 1981.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>The instant petition for review arises from a disciplinary proceeding conducted by the Commission pursuant to sections of the Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9,12a(3), and 13(b). In this proceeding the Commission determined that Lawrence had willfully violated its previous order to pay the civil penalty assessed against him. For this willful violation, the Commission suspended Lawrence\u2019s AP registration for three months.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Lawrence appeals his suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">The administrative complaint served upon Lawrence on December 9, 1981 charged that he was unfit to remain registered as an AP of a commodity broker<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because he had violated the Commission\u2019s October 15, 1980 order to pay the $3,500 civil penalty. Pursuant to the Act,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Commission sought to determine whether it should revoke Lawrence\u2019s AP registration, suspend his contract market trading privileges, or enter a cease and desist order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">The complaint at issue here was the subject of a hearing before Administrative Law Judge (\u201cAU\u201d) George Painter. The AU found that Lawrence did not pay the $3,500 penalty when it came due on April 15, 1981; that the Commission\u2019s Division of Enforcement notified Lawrence by letter dated May 7, 1981 that the penalty had become due; that Lawrence made no written request to the Division for an extension of time in which to pay the penalty between April 15 and December 9, 1981, when the second complaint was served; that Lawrence spoke with no responsible Division official between April 15 and December 9, 1981 concerning his alleged inability to pay the penalty; that Lawrence had not paid the penalty when the second proceeding was commenced; and that any efforts by Lawrence to resolve the matter before issuance of the second complaint \u201cwere half-hearted at best.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-13\">Concluding that Lawrence had violated the Commission\u2019s order to pay his penalty,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>the ALJ directed him to pay the $3,500 civil penalty, with interest, within ten days, and also imposed an additional $500 penalty for the violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">The Commission, following an independent review of the record, in part reversed the decision of the AU. The Commission concluded that Lawrence\u2019s violation of its order to pay the $3,500 on April 15, 1981 had been willful, and suspended his AP registration for three months.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">The Commission based its determination on uncontroverted evidence that Lawrence was aware that payment was due on April 15, 1981; that he failed to pay the penalty when due; that he never made a written request for an extension of time in which to pay; that he never responded in writing to a warning letter sent to him by the Commission on May 7, 1981; and that he never tendered even partial payment until after the enforcement complaint was filed, more than seven months after payment had come due. The Commission\u2019s January 31, 1984 Order provided that Lawrence\u2019s suspension would not take effect until 30 days after service so as to give Lawrence an opportunity to wind down his affairs in an orderly fashion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">II. ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">This appeal presents three issues, the first and third being questions of first impression.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-8\">1. Did the the Commission have jurisdiction under \u00a7 6(b) of the Commodity Exchange Act to bring an independent enforcement proceeding against Lawrence for his failure to timely pay the consented-to civil penalty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-9\">2. Did the weight of the evidence support the Commission\u2019s finding that Lawrence\u2019s violation of its order to pay the penalty was willful?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-11\">3. Was the Commission\u2019s decision to suspend Lawrence\u2019s AP registration for three months so severe that it should be set aside as an abuse of discretion?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A7m\">\n<em>A. Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">Lawrence contends that pursuant to 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 9 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1355, the Commission\u2019s only remedy for his violation of its 1980 order to pay the civil penalty was to refer a collection action to the Department of Justice. He argues that the Commission lacked jurisdiction to bring the second, independent enforcement action.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-14\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1355 gives the district courts original jurisdiction over court actions brought to reduce fines to judgment. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 9a provides that collection of overdue money penalties imposed by the CFTC shall be referred to the Attorney General for recovery in a federal district court action. The Commission, however, also has the authority to suspend or revoke the registration of any person it finds to have violated any of its orders. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 9, <em>see supra, </em>note 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-15\">Nothing in the language of \u00a7 9 suggests that the Commission\u2019s authority to bring an action seeking suspension is limited to violations of particular kinds of Commission orders. We conclude that the broad reference in \u00a7 9 to \u201cany\u201d Commission order includes the order to Lawrence to pay his monetary penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-16\">Likewise, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12a(3)-(4) expressly empowers the Commission to suspend or revoke the registration of anyone found to have violated any provision of the Act or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>order thereunder. Congress repeated verbatim in \u00a7 12a(3) the broad language used in \u00a7 9, again without any suggestion that the Commission\u2019s authority to suspend or revoke registration hinges on the particular type of Commission order violated.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">The Commission argues that although 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 9a limits its collection remedy to referral to the Justice Department, Lawrence\u2019s failure to pay the $3,500 penalty constituted a discrete violation of a Commission order, cognizable under 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The Commission\u2019s interpretation of its authority under the Act deserves substantial deference. The Supreme Court has repeatedly declared that \u201cgreat deference [should be given] to the interpretation given the statute by the officers or agency charged with its administration.\u201d <em>Udall v. Tollman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">Recently, the Supreme Court reemphasized the narrowness of a court\u2019s inquiry in reviewing an agency\u2019s interpretation of its empowering act. When the legislature has left a gap in a statute as to the details of its administration, \u201ca court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.\u201d <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,-, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2782, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-13\">Nothing in 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 9a or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1355 suggests that Congress intended referral to the Department of Justice to be the Commission\u2019s exclusive remedy for violation of its orders to pay fines. The more reasonable interpretation is that Congress did not intend such exclusivity, since 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9, 12a(3)-(4) expressly provide for other, noncollection remedies for violations of any Commission order.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-14\">The Commission\u2019s interpretation of its powers is also consistent with the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3701, 3711, 3718-19 <em>(as amended by </em>Debt Collection Act of 1982, Pub.L. No. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749 (1982)) (\u201cFCCA\u201d). The legislative history of the FCCA expressly reflects Congress\u2019s stated preference for the handling of agency claims by the agency involved.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The provisions of the FCCA and the amendments in the Debt Collection Act of 1982 express a Congressional mandate that agencies play a more active role in the collection of delinquent claims than merely referring them to the Department of Justice.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>We hold that the Commission had jurisdiction to bring a second action seeking sanctions for Lawrence\u2019s violation of its payment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">\n<em>B. Willfulness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Although Lawrence concedes that he never attempted to pay the overdue $3,500 penalty until the Commission complaint placed his AP registration in jeopardy, he attacks the Commission\u2019s conclusion that his failure to pay was willful. Instead, he characterizes his prolonged, knowing failure to pay as \u201cnegligent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">The standard of review applicable here is set forth in 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 9: \u201cthe findings of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by the weight of evidence, shall ... be conclusive.\u201d The phrase \u201cweight of evidence\u201d in 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 13a has been interpreted to mean \u201c \u2018the preponderance\u2019 or \u2018greater weight of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Myron v. Hauser, </em>673 F.2d 994, 1005 n. 17 (8th Cir.1982) (quoting <em>Haltmier v. CFTC, </em>554 F.2d 556, 560 (2d Cir.1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">Lawrence admits that he was aware that his fine had fallen due on April 15, 1981. Despite doubts about his ability to pay the fine as far back as September 1980 when he first agreed to it, Lawrence admittedly never made a written request for an extension of time; nor did he speak with any responsible official at the CFTC\u2019s Division of Enforcement. Moreover, Lawrence admits that he never responded in writing to the Commission\u2019s warning letter of May 7, 1981.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> He did not even tender partial payment during the eight months of his delinquency leading up to the issuance of the second complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-14\">Lawrence does not dispute these facts. Instead he argues that his conduct was merely negligent. For purposes of the Act, however, it is well settled that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-15\">[i]f a person 1) intentionally does an act which is prohibited, \u2014 irrespective of evil motive or reliance on erroneous advice, or 2) acts with careless disregard of statutory requirements, the violation is willful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-16\"><em>Flaxman v. CFTC, </em>697 F.2d 782, 787 (7th Cir.1983) (quoting <em>Goodman v. Benson, </em>286 F.2d 896, 900 (7th Cir.1961)). To establish willfulness, the Commission only needed to show that Lawrence\u2019s ongoing failure to act was intentional as opposed to accidental. Proof of an evil motive is unnecessary. <em>See Hinkle Northwest, Inc. v. SEC, </em>641 F.2d 1304, 1307-08 (9th Cir.1981) (quoting <em>Nees v. SEC, </em>414 F.2d 211, 221 (9th Cir.1969)). We agree with the Corn-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>mission that Lawrence\u2019s inaction was willful.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Lawrence argues that the Commission\u2019s willfulness conclusion should be reversed because it failed to give proper deference to the ALJ\u2019s first-hand assessment of Lawrence\u2019s credibility. But the Commission gives less deference to an ALJ\u2019s findings on ultimate questions of fact, and it also need not hesitate to overrule an ALJ\u2019s finding if his analysis of the evidence is \u201clogically unsound.\u201d <em>In re Tip-ton, </em>[1977-1980 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut.L.Rep. (CCH) 120,673 at 22,749, 22,752 and n. 12 (1978), <em>aff'd mem., </em>No. 78-3581 (6th Cir.1981); <em>see also Pierce v. SEC, </em>239 F.2d 160, 162-63 (9th Cir.1956). In <em>Moore v. Ross, </em>687 F.2d 604, 607-09 (2d Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1115, 103 S.Ct. 750, 74 L.Ed.2d 969 (1983), the court held that credibility determinations are questions of fact within an agency\u2019s province and that the agency\u2019s resolution of them contrary to the ALJ\u2019s must stand unless it is not supported by substantial evidence.8 *****<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">Given these standards, we affirm the Commission\u2019s finding of willfulness. Lawrence\u2019s failure to take any meaningful action between April 15 and December 3, 1981 was conscious and it was intentional.</p>\n<p id=\"AnB\">\n<em>C. The Discretionary Suspension</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Lawrence contests as impermissibly severe the Commission\u2019s suspension of his AP registration for three months. Lawrence also maintains that the Commission should not have imposed any sanction because he presented sufficient evidence of mitigation or rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">Although authorized to do so under 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9, 12a, and 13b, the Commission did not prohibit Lawrence from trading on contract markets, enter a cease and desist order against him, or impose conditions on or permanently revoke his registration. We find that the Commission considered several potential sanctions and imposed one \u2014 a three month suspension\u2014 that fitted Lawrence\u2019s willful violation and served the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-15\">Choice of sanction here is a matter within the Commission\u2019s sound discretion. <em>See Silverman v. CFTC, </em>562 F.2d 432, 439-440 (7th Cir.1977). If within statutory limits, the Commission\u2019s determination will be upheld unless it reflects an abuse of that discretion. <em>Flaxman v. CFTC, </em>697 F.2d at 789; <em>Sundheimer v. CFTC, </em>688 F.2d 150, 153 (2d Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1022, 103 S.Ct. 1273, 75 L.Ed.2d 494 (1983); <em>see also Nees v. SEC, </em>414 F.2d 211, 217 (9th Cir.1969).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-16\">The Supreme Court has declared it a: \u201cfundamental principle ... that where Congress has entrusted an administrative agency with the responsibility of selecting the means of achieving the statutory policy \u2018the relation of remedy to policy is peculiarly a matter for administrative competence.\u2019 \u201d <em>American Power Co. v. SEC, </em>329 U.S. 90, 112 [67 S.Ct. 133, 146, 91 L.Ed. 103] (1946). Thus, the [Administrator\u2019s] choice of sanction was not to be overturned unless the Court of Appeals might find it \u201cunwarranted in law or ... without .justification in fact....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112-113, 67 S.Ct. at 146....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-17\"><em>Butz v. Glover Livestock Commission Co., </em>411 U.S. 182, 185-86, 93 S.Ct. 1455, 1458, 36 L.Ed.2d 142 (1973). This \u201cfundamental principle\u201d has repeatedly been applied by the Supreme Court, this court and the other federal courts of appeals in upholding sanctions under the Act and other federal remedial regulatory statutes. <em>See, e.g., Nees v. SEC, </em>414 F.2d at 217; <em>Pierce v. SEC, </em>239 F.2d 160, 163-64 (9th Cir.1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-18\">In upholding a remedial sanction denying registration to a securities broker, this court articulated the appropriate standard of review for cases of this kind:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-19\">Denial of registration is not to be regarded as a penalty imposed on the broker. To the contrary, it is but a means to protect the . public interest____ This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>Court ordinarily should not substitute its judgment of what would be appropriate under the circumstances in place of the Commission\u2019s judgment as to measures necessary to protect the public interest____ [W]e cannot conclude that the Commission abused its discretion in denying ... registration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-5\"><em>Pierce, </em>239 F.2d at 163-64 (citations omitted).1 *************<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">The standard for suspension of a registration already granted is similar. Once a willful violation of the Commission\u2019s 1980 order had been proved, a <em>prima facie </em>case of Lawrence\u2019s unfitness to remain registered as an AP was established and the statutory basis under the Act to revoke Lawrence\u2019s registration was met. <em>See In re Tipton, </em>[1977-80 Transfer Binder] Comm.Fut.L.Rep. (CCH) 1120,673.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">The three month suspension here meets these settled standards. Well within the limits authorized by statute, the suspension was neither \u201cunwarranted in law\u201d nor \u201cwithout justification in fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">1. <em>Mitigation and Rehabilitation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">Even though the Commission established a prima facie case of Lawrence\u2019s unfitness for continued registration, it could have chosen not to suspend Lawrence\u2019s registration if he had shown, through evidence of mitigation or rehabilitation, that the public interest would not be served. <em>See Savage v. CFTC, </em>548 F.2d 192, 196-97 (7th Cir.1977); <em>In re Tipton, </em>[1977-80 Transfer Binder] Comm.Fut.L.Rep. (CCH) at 22,750. But the burden on Lawrence to persuade the Commission that he should receive no registration sanction was substantial. <em>See Flaxman v. CFTC, </em>697 F.2d at 788-89; <em>Savage, </em>548 F.2d at 196-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-24\">In arguing mitigation, Lawrence asserted that he had lacked the funds to timely pay the penalty. He testified that the $6,000 he spent on attorney\u2019s fees in the original action rendered him unable to pay the penalty agreed to in settlement of that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-25\">Lawrence has provided no explanation for his decision to subordinate the Commission\u2019s payment order to his other financial obligations. His speedy tendering of payment in an attempt to settle this proceeding, once it was commenced, belies his claimed inability to comply. Lawrence\u2019s intentional inaction until faced with the second proceeding shows indifference toward the Commission\u2019s 1980 payment order and disrespect for the Commission. Lawrence failed to carry the heavy burden of demonstrating mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-26\">As for rehabilitation, Lawrence argues that except for his failure to pay the penalty (and for the underlying findings against him as set forth in the 1980 payment order), he did not otherwise violate the Act or the Commission\u2019s regulations. Lawrence also argues that his offer to settle the second complaint by paying the overdue $3,500 demonstrated rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-27\">The Commission determined below and argues here, however, that while Lawrence\u2019s late offer of payment may have obviated the permanent revocation of his registration, it was not sufficient to assure the Commission that he had gained respect for his duty to abide by the requirements of the Act. The Commission therefore concluded that Lawrence had not demonstrated rehabilitation sufficient to warrant no registration penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>We will not disturb an administrative determination of this kind unless the Commission abused its discretion. <em>See Silverman v. CFTC, </em>562 F.2d 432, 439 (7th Cir.1977). Contrary to his assertion, the Commission did not give \u201cshort shrift\u201d to Lawrence\u2019s rehabilitation evidence. Although it was within the Commission\u2019s sound discretion not to consider such evidence, it chose, over the objections of its Division of Enforcement, to consider all the rehabilitation evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Reviewing the evidence, we conclude that Lawrence has not demonstrated that the Commission abused its discretion. Neither his tender of payment after commencement of the second proceeding, nor his refraining from further offenses, is sufficiently probative. We conclude that the suspension was specifically authorized by the Act, was warranted in fact, and was within the Commission\u2019s statutory discretion.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">2. <em>Severity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Lawrence argues that his three-month suspension was too severe because this case represents the Commission\u2019s first administrative action brought for a failure to obey an order to pay a civil penalty, and because he may suffer financial harm from his suspension.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">The Commission, \u201clike the SEC in the securities area, is the \u2018statutory guardian\u2019 entrusted with the enforcement of the congressional scheme for safeguarding the public interest in commodity futures markets.\u201d <em>CFTC v. British American Com-modify Options Corp., </em>560 F.2d 135, 142 (2d Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>438 U.S. 905, 98 S.Ct. 3123, 57 L.Ed.2d 1147 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">The Commission concluded that the circumstances of Lawrence\u2019s willful violation of its payment order raised substantial questions about his respect for the Commission\u2019s enforcement program. By imposing the suspension, the Commission sought to impress upon Lawrence and other registrants that they cannot ignore Commission orders, wait for the Commission to proceed administratively against them, and only then, if necessary, bring themselves into compliance with impunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-12\">Lawrence characterizes his suspension as \u201ca novel move by the CFTC,\u201d and it is true that this was the first proceeding brought for failure to obey a Commission order to pay a civil penalty. A sanction, however, is \u201cnot rendered invalid in a particular case because it is more severe than sanctions imposed in other cases.\u201d <em>Sartain v. SEC, </em>601 F.2d 1366, 1374-75 (9th Cir.1979) (quoting <em>Butz v. Glover Livestock Commission Co., </em>411 U.S. 182, 187-88, 93 S.Ct. 1455, 1458-59, 36 L.Ed.2d 142 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-13\">Deterrence is a permissible function of the Commission\u2019s disciplinary sanctions. <em>Steadman v.

The offer of settlement consented to by Lawrence states on its face that the findings of wrongdoing made therein would have no collateral effects <em>except </em>for other Commission proceedings.

Mr. Thomas Sanchez (not a party here) was also named as a respondent in that disciplinary proceeding for similarly violating a Commission order to pay a civil penalty agreed to by him in settlement of an earlier administrative enforcement action. Mr. Sanchez has not sought review of the Commission's January 31, 1984 Opinion and Order, the final order appealed from here by Mr. Lawrence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b840-8\">.

Under the Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12a(3)-(4), the Commission is authorized in accord with procedures under 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 9 to revoke, suspend or place restrictions upon the registration of any person registered under the Act if \"such person has been found by the Commission or by any court of competent jurisdiction to have violated, or has consented to findings of a violation of, any provision of this chapter, or any rule, regulation or order thereunder.\" 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 12a (3)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b840-15\">.

The AU also concluded in the \"discussion\" portion of his decision (i.e., neither finding of fact nor conclusion of law) that Lawrence \u201chas been in economic straits for some time, and that his failure to keep his agreement was due more to economic necessity than to a willful violation of the Commission\u2019s order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-21\">We are persuaded that the AU\u2019s use of the term \u201cwillful\u201d in his discussion was more eolio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>quial than technical-legal. His discussion does not explain the legal standard for determining when a violation is \"willful.\u201d A decision by the AU containing such an explanation conceivably could have still concluded that Lawrence\u2019s violation was not willful, but on the facts of this case, such a conclusion would have required thorough argument and justification. Thus, unlike the Commission, the AU never truly measured Lawrence\u2019s conduct against the legal standard of willfulness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b841-19\">. The three month suspension of Lawrence\u2019s registration as an AP went into effect on March 2, 1984. On February 28, 1984, Lawrence filed the instant petition for review. On April 10, 1984, this court stayed the suspension pending disposition of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b842-7\">. Lawrence fails to challenge in any respect this reading of 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9, 12a(3)-(4). Indeed, although he argues that the Commission\u2019s enforcement complaint was not authorized by statute, he fails even to mention 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9, 12a(3)-(4), or to address the interplay between 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 9a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b842-8\">. See <em>United States v. Stevenson, </em>215 U.S. 190, 197-98 (1909), 30 S.Ct. 35, 36, 54 L.Ed. 153 and <em>Dollar Savings Bank v. United States, </em>86 U.S. (19 Wall.) 227, 238-40, 22 L.Ed. 80 (1874), in which the Court held that in the absence of specific language, Congress will not be presumed to have excluded the Government from well-recognized methods of enforcing its statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">Lawrence\u2019s contrary reliance upon <em>Kissinger v. Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the Press, </em>445 U.S. 136, 100 S.Ct. 960, 63 L.Ed.2d 267 (1980), is misplaced. The issue in <em>Kissinger </em>was whether a private right of action should be <em>implied </em>under two federal statutes. Here, the Commission\u2019s authority to bring administrative enforcement proceedings for violations of its orders is expressly provided for in the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b842-15\">. Congress stated that it preferred that agencies handle the collection of their own claims because they are more likely to be familiar with the facts and legalities of such claims. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 1331, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. (1966), <em>reprinted in </em>1966 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2532, 2536. The Senate Judiciary Committee also recommended enactment of the FCCA because it would reduce the drain on the Justice Department and the courts. <em>See id., reprinted in </em>1966 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 2534.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b842-16\">. The FCAA encourages diligent claims collection by federal agencies and direct the Comptroller General and the Attorney General to promulgate regulations governing the administrative collection of all federal civil claims. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3711, 3718-19 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-17\">Pursuant to this authority, the General Accounting Office (\"GAO\") and the Department of Justice jointly adopted regulations which direct in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b842-18\">Agencies seeking the collection of statutory penalties, forfeitures, or debts provided for as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>an enforcement aid or for compelling compliance will give serious consideration to the suspension or revocation of licenses or other privileges for any inexcusable, prolonged or repeated failure of a debtor to pay such a claim and the debtor will be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"AdB\">4 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.9 (1985). Lawrence does not even acknowledge the existence of these regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">The jurisdictional argument Lawrence makes is distinct from his argument that the Commission\u2019s May 7, 1981 warning letter did not provide him with adequate notice. This notice argument boils down to the claim that Lawrence\u2019s violation was not willful because the warning letter did not specifically threaten him with suspension if he did not pay his penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">As discussed <em>infra, </em>Lawrence\u2019s notice-specificity argument is misguided. If \"willfulness\u201d for present purposes does not require specific intent, then the fact that the Commission\u2019s warning letter provided non-specific notice does not itself make the suspension impermissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b843-12\">. Lawrence argues that the May 7, 1981 letter was inadequate as a \"second chance\u201d warning under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 558(c), making the suspension unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-18\">This argument is misconceived. Because Lawrence\u2019s violation was willful, there was no APA requirement for the Division to provide him with a second chance warning notice. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 558(c). Even in cases of non-willful violations, the APA only requires \"notice by the agency in writing of <em>the facts or conduct which may warrant the action.\u201d </em>(emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>The APA does not require that a respondent be apprised of precisely what action the agency will take because of his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-19\">The purpose of the APA \"second chance\u201d doctrine is to give wrongdoers an opportunity to correct their transgressions before actual termination or suspension of their licenses. <em>Gallagher &amp; Ascher Co. v. Simon, </em>687 F.2d 1067, 1074 (7th Cir.1982). An opportunity for the respondent to comply, not a formal hearing, is required. <em>Id. </em>Lawrence received such an opportunity. Thus, even assuming arguendo that his violation was not willful, Lawrence received all the process that he was due.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b844-11\">. Even more strongly worded is <em>Retail, Wholesale &amp; Department Store Union v. NLRB, </em>466 F.2d 380, 386-87 (D.C.Cir.1972), in which the court held that an agency\u2019s ruling on credibility will be sustained over the ALJ\u2019s unless it is \"hopelessly incredible.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b845-13\">. In upholding remedial sanctions imposed under 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 9, another federal court of appeals has stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b845-16\">It is ... clear ... that if the order of an administrative agency finding a violation of a statutory provision is 'valid and the penalty fixed for the violation is within the limits of the statute the agency has made <em>an allowable judgment in its choice of the remedy </em>and ordinarily the Court of Appeals has no right to change the penalty because the agency might have imposed a different penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-29\"><em>G.H. Miller &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>260 F.2d 286, 296 (7th Cir.1958) (emphasis in original), <em>cert. denied, </em>359 U.S. 907, 79 S.Ct. 582, 3 L.Ed.2d 572 (1959). To be sustained, the penalty must only bear a \"reasonable relation to the unlawful practice found to exist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>FTC v. National Lead Co., </em>352 U.S. 419, 429, 77 S.Ct. 502, 509, 1 L.Ed.2d 438 (1957)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b846-8\">. We also reject Lawrence's related argument that he should not have been suspended because he has a \"right\" to be registered as an AP. Such registration confers a <em>privilege </em>with corresponding duties, and this privilege may be suspended or revoked under the Act for a breach of these duties. <em>See Century Arms, Inc. v. Kennedy, </em>323 F.Supp. 1002, 1016-17 (D.Vt.), <em>aff'd, </em>449 F.2d 1306 (2d Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 1065, 92 S.Ct. 1494, 31 L.Ed.2d 794 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b846-9\">. Lawrence also urges this court to take judicial notice of his claim that the three-month suspension will cause him to lose customers and income. Such speculation is not appropriate matter for judicial notice. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 201 (\"[a] judicially noticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute\u201d); McCormick, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 328 (3d ed. 1984). There is no evidence in the record to support this speculation, and we give it no weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-15\">Furthermore, although Lawrence cannot function as an AP for the remainder of the time left in his suspension (approximately 78 days), he has not established that he cannot remain gainfully employed in other capacities with his current employer. Nor has he established that his employer, a large company offering a vast array of financial services, cannot service Lawrence's long-term customers during the remainder of the suspension period.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
