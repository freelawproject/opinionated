STYLE OF THE CASE</p>\n<p id=\"Acg\">The style of the case in which this certificate is made is <em>Beryl T Minvielle, </em>Plaintiff-Appellant, versus <em>Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corporation </em>and <em>Kaiser Aluminum Exploration Company, </em>Defendants-Appellees, Case No. 84-3760, United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, on appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">II. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">Mr. Ralph Minvielle, husband of appellant and an employee of appellee, was injured in a work-related accident on January 21, 1983, when a grating gave way at appellee\u2019s works in Gramercy, Louisiana. Mr. Minvielle is receiving worker\u2019s compensation benefits as a result of this injury. Appellant brought this action against appellee for loss of consortium resulting from her husband\u2019s injury. Appellee moved for summary judgment, contending that pursuant to Louisiana Revised Statutes 23:1032 Mr. Minvielle\u2019s compensation benefits are his wife\u2019s exclusive remedy and that Article 2315 of the Louisiana Civil Code, as amended, allowing recovery for loss of consortium, recognizes this exclusivity. Summary judgment for appellee was granted, and this appeal from it was properly taken,</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">III. QUESTION FOR THE SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">Are the workers\u2019 compensation benefits afforded an injured employee against his employer by the Louisiana compensation program the exclusive remedy for his spouse\u2019s loss of consortium?</p>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">QUESTION CERTIFIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-13\">The entire record in this case, together with copies of the briefs of the parties, are transmitted herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-7\">. District court decisions adverse to Mrs. Minvielle\u2019s contentions were handed down in this case and in <em>Dozier v. J.A. Jones Construction Co., Inc., </em>587 F.Supp. 289 (E.D.La.1984). We note also, however, the decision in <em>Ferriter v. Daniel O\u2019Connell's Sons, Inc., </em>381 Mass. 507, 413 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>690 (1980), in which a similar statutory scheme was construed to permit such claims as that of Mrs. Minvielle.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
