We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1573-30\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1573-31\">Clean-Up \u201984 is a registered political action committee seeking to use the initiative procedure provided by Fla. Const, art. XI, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the March, 1984, presidential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1512\">*1512</page-number>preference primary, Clean-Up \u201984 sought to use the initiative amendment process to obtain signatures for a proposed environmental rights amendment to the Florida Constitution. On March 5, 1984, CleanUp \u201984 sought and obtained a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of Fla. StatAnn. \u00a7 104.36 (West Supp.1985) (as amended Laws 1984, ch. 84-302, \u00a7 25 effective July 1, 1984).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Clean-Up \u201984 v. Heinrich, </em>582 F.Supp. 125 (M.D.Fla.1984). Clean-Up \u201984 also obtained a preliminary injunction against enforcement of Fla.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 99.097(4) (West Supp.1985).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1574-4\">The preliminary injunction prohibited the enforcement of the 100-yard provision on the primary preference date, March 13, 1984. The district court found that the state failed to show that the statute was a necessary or even reasonable way of ensuring order at the polls. Additionally, it found the statute overbroad and not drawn in the least restrictive manner. On March 27, 1984, the district court modified its March 5 preliminary injunction extending its prohibitions to \u201call municipal elections held throughout the state of Florida.\u201d On July 19, 1984, the court permanently enjoined enforcement of Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 104.-36 declaring it to be a restriction of speech and association lacking sufficient justification, overbroad, and not the least restrictive means to achieve the purpose of ensuring an orderly election process.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1574-13\">The state contends that the statute is constitutional. The state argues that it may impose restrictions on first amendment rights if the time, place, and manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1513\">*1513</page-number>of the restrictions are reasonable, if the restrictions serve a significant state interest, and if the restrictions are narrowly drawn to serve that interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-5\">Our sole issue is whether the district court erred in holding unconstitutional the provision of the Florida Election Code prohibiting solicitation of signatures on petitions within 100 yards of a polling place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-6\">A challenge to a statute on first amendment grounds requires that we first consider whether the speech or conduct is protected by the United States Constitution. If the answer is affirmative, we then consider whether the statute is unconstitutional \u201con its face.\u201d <em>City Council v. Taxpayers for Vincent, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 104 S.Ct. 2118, 2124, 80 L.Ed.2d 772, 781 (1984). Where the statute has been applied, an additional question is whether the statute is unconstitutional as applied. <em>City Council, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-,-, 104 S.Ct. at 2124, 2128, 80 L.Ed.2d at 781, 786. Either finding of unconstitutionality invalidates the statute\u2019s operation on first amendment freedoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-10\">The parties agree that the activity encompassed by the statute, the soliciting of signatures for petitions within 100 yards of a polling place on election day, is first amendment activity. Further, we agree with the district court that \u201casking a voter to sign a petition\u201d is protected \u201cspeech\u201d and \u201cgathering at the polls to solicit signatures\u201d is protected association. Both activities involve the communication of ideas to voters. <em>See Brown v. Hartlage, </em>456 U.S. 45, 53-54, 102 S.Ct. 1523, 1528-1529, 71 L.Ed.2d 732 (1982).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1575-11\">The First Amendment protects political association as well as political expression. The constitutional right of association explicated in <em>NAACP v. Alabama, </em>357 U.S. 449, 460, 78 S.Ct. 1163 [1170], 2 L.Ed.2d 1488 (1958), stemmed from the Court\u2019s recognition that \u2018[effective advocacy of both public and private points of view, particularly controversial ones, is undeniably enhanced by group association.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1575-12\"><em>Buckley v. Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 15, 96 S.Ct. 612, 632-633, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-13\">Facial invalidity exists where either a statute is \u201cunconstitutional in every conceivable application,\u201d or it \u201cseeks to prohibit such a broad range of protected conduct\u201d that it is \u201coverbroad.\u201d <em>City Council, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 104 S.Ct. at 2124, 80 L.Ed.2d at 781. A claim of substantial overbreadth seeks to invalidate statutes that <em>may </em>infringe protected expressions of third parties. <em>Thornhill v. Alabama, </em>310 U.S. 88, 60 S.Ct. 736, 84 L.Ed. 1093 (1940).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1575-16\">It matters not that the words appellee used might have been constitutionally prohibited under a narrowly and precisely drawn statute. At least when statutes regulate or proscribe speech and when \u2018no readily apparent construction suggests itself as a vehicle for rehabilitating the statutes in a single prosecution,\u2019 <em>Dombrowski v. Pfister, </em>380 U.S. 479, 491, 85 S.Ct. 1116 [1123] 14 L.Ed.2d 22, 31 (1965), the transcendent value of all society of constitutionally protected expression is deemed to justify allowing \u2018attacks on overly broad statutes with no requirement that the person making the attack demonstrate that his own conduct could not be regulated by a statute drawn with the requisite narrow specificity,\u2019 <em>id., </em>at 486 [85 S.Ct. at 1121].... This is deemed necessary because persons whose expression is constitutionally protected may well refrain from exercising their rights for fear of criminal sanctions provided by a statute susceptible of application to protected expression.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWO\"><em>Gooding v. Wilson, </em>405 U.S. 518, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 1103, 1105, 31 L.Ed.2d 408 (1972) (citations omitted). For a court to find that a statute is overbroad, it' must find the existence of a \u201crealistic danger that the statute itself will significantly compromise recognized first amendment protections of parties not before the court.\u201d <em>City Council, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 104 S.Ct. at 2126, 80 L.Ed.2d at 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b1575-18\">Among other reasons, the district court found the statute overbroad because the 100-yard radius at some polling sites included private homes and businesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1514\">*1514</page-number>\u201cwhere the gathering of signatures could impose no threat to the voting process.\u201d The state\u2019s answer to this ruling is that although it is conceivable a sheriff or supervisor of elections might seek to enter a private home or business within 100 yards of a polling place and attempt to prevent a person from soliciting signatures, no evidence was presented that any sheriff or supervisor has ever done so, and it is unlikely an elected official would use the power of his or her office in such an abusive manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-4\">The state misconceives the overbreadth \u00abi inquiry. The danger in an overbroad statute is not that actual enforcement will occur or is likely to occur, but that third parties, not before the court, may feel inhibited in utilizing their protected first amendment communications because of the existence of the overly broad statute. <em>City Council, </em>80 L.Ed.2d at 784. It is no answer, therefore, to this facial challenge that the statute has not been enforced against persons in private homes or businesses within the 100-yard radius.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1576-7\">We hold, therefore, that Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 104.36 is unconstitutionally overbroad on its face. We express no opinion on whether a more narrowly drawn statute would pass constitutional muster. We recognize that the state has a significant interest in protecting the orderly functioning of the election process. It must ensure its voters that they may exercise their franchise without distraction, interruption, or harassment. The significant interest which the state seeks to protect must be gained through a statute more narrowly drawn as to time, place, and manner. Further, because of its facial invalidity, and because the statute has not been applied to CleanUp \u201984, we find it unnecessary to determine whether the statute is also unconstitutional as applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1576-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1573-21\">.
