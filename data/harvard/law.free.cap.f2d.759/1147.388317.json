Wayne M. McMillian, the claimant here, appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the Secretary who had denied the claim on the basis that claimant had not established that for purposes of \u00a7 202(d) of the Social Security Act (the Act), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(d), he was the illegitimate son of the deceased wage earner who he asserted to be his father. We affirm, though on different grounds than those directly relied upon by the Secretary and the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-11\">Wayne M. McMillian (claimant or Wayne) was bom on March 11, 1976, to Annie M. McMillian (Annie). At that time and continuously since 1966, Annie was married to and living with James McMillian (James). Beginning in 1973, however, Annie had had an extramarital affair with Willie M. Beatty, Jr., that continued until Beatty\u2019s' death on February 11, 1981. On March 10, 1981, Annie applied for survivor\u2019s insurance benefits for Wayne, alleging that Beatty, indisputably an insured wage earner under the Act, was Wayne\u2019s natural father. In the course of the administrative proceedings that then ensued, evidence both supporting and opposing the critical allegation of Beatty\u2019s biological parentage was adduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-12\">Annie testified to the existence of the affair and asserted, though, ambiguously, that for two or three months preceding Wayne\u2019s conception she had been separated from her husband and during that time had had sexual relations only with Beatty. There was a substantial amount of evidence that Beatty believed that Wayne was his son. He wrote a number of occasion cards and letters to Annie both before and after Wayne\u2019s birth that strongly, if circumstantially, confirmed their ongoing affair and sexual relationship. Some, following Wayne's birth, contained inferable allusions to Wayne as their son, though none identified Wayne by name. Numerous affidavits and live testimony by acquaintances of Beatty\u2019s asserted that Beatty believed and held out Wayne to be his son. An acquaintance of Annie\u2019s corroborated Annie\u2019s version of her separation from her husband and her sexual relationship solely with Beatty at the time of Wayne\u2019s conception. A group insurance application by Beatty on file with the International Longshoreman\u2019s Association identified \u201cWayne Matthew McMillan\u201d [sic] as an unmarried dependent child of Beatty\u2019s along with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>Beatty\u2019s one child, Crystal Beatty, by his marriage. There was considerable evidence that up until his death Beatty provided financial support specifically for Wayne. Annie testified that Beatty often gave her as much as $100 weekly for Wayne\u2019s support. Beatty paid dental bills for Wayne and provided weekly day care support and school funds for him. Annie testified that Beatty purchased a mobile home for her so that she and Wayne might have a place to live if James should throw them out. Finally, there was testimony that discord arose between Annie and James because of the latter\u2019s suspicion or knowledge that Wayne was not his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-4\">From the other side there was no evidence directly refuting Annie\u2019s essential version of her affair with Beatty nor of James\u2019s non-access to her at the time of Wayne\u2019s conception. Nor was there any evidence directly refuting that of Beatty\u2019s subjective belief and holding out that Wayne was his son, nor his provision of significant financial support for Wayne, aside from some dispute as to the reality of the mobile home purchase. There was, however, record evidence suggesting, though circumstantially, that James was Wayne\u2019s father. Wayne\u2019s registered birth certificate identified James as Wayne\u2019s \u201cfather\u201d in the block provided for that information on the official form. More critically, a 1978 state court order in a child support proceeding brought by Annie against James identified Wayne as a child born of their marriage for whom support was sought and awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-5\">Based essentially upon the evidence of Beatty\u2019s various acknowledgments of parentage and his provision of financial support for Wayne, the claim was first administratively allowed. When Beatty\u2019s wife, however, protested the award (whose effect- was to reduce the survivor benefits payable to her and her daughter by Beatty) the administration reconsidered the claim. Based essentially upon the birth certificate and state court support order which recited James\u2019s parentage, the administration reversed its earlier determination and directed that Annie refund the sum already paid under the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-7\">Now represented by counsel, Annie requested and was given a hearing before an AU in which Beatty\u2019s widow and their daughter were joined as interested parties. Following receipt of the evidence generally summarized above, the AU denied Wayne\u2019s claim on the basis that claimant had not established that he was Beatty\u2019s \u201cchild\u201d for purposes of the Act. The Appeals Council declined to review this hear-' ing decision which thereupon became the final decision of the Secretary. Upon judicial review the district court accepted its magistrate\u2019s recommendation and granted summary judgment upholding the Secretary\u2019s denial of Wayne\u2019s claim and its direction to Annie to make repayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-8\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-10\">The issue, broadly stated, is whether the Secretary\u2019s decision denying survivor benefits on the basis that claimant had not established that he was \u201cdependent child\u201d of the deceased wage earner, Beatty, is supported by substantial evidence and is not erroneous in law. The answer turns on the proper interpretation and application of important provisions of the Social Security Act that present interpretive problems. We therefore begin by reviewing in summary fashion those provisions most relevant to the issue and by indicating wherein their application to the instant claim bears upon the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-11\">The underlying entitlement provision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(d) provides survivor benefits to every \u201cchild\u201d who survives \u201ca fully or currently insured individual\u201d if the \u201cchild\u201d has applied for benefits, is unmarried and within certain age limits, and was dependent on the insured individual at the time of the latter\u2019s death. There is no dispute here about any of these predicates for entitlement except the \u201cchild\u201d and \u201cdependency\u201d status of claimant in relation to Beatty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-12\">In definitional provisions of the Act, \u201cchild\u201d is defined to include both legitimate and, under special conditions of proof, ille-. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>gitimate children of insured wage-earners. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 402(d)(1), 402(d)(3), 416(e), and 416(h). Any legitimate \u201cchild\u201d is \u201cdeemed dependent\u201d per \u00a7 402(d)(3). An illegitimate claimant may establish that he is a \u201cchild\u201d for eligibility purposes under either of three critical provisions of the Act: \u00a7\u00a7 416(h)(2)(A), 416(h)(2)(B), or 416(h)(3)(C). In rough summary these provide, respectively, for establishing \u201cchild\u201d status by (1) showing that under the law of the deceased wage earner\u2019s domicile at death the claimant would have been treated as a child of the decedent for purposes of the devolution of intestate property, \u00a7 416(h)(2)(A); or by (2) showing that claimant\u2019s legitimacy was prevented only by some \u201clegal impediment\u201d to an otherwise valid marriage between his parents, \u00a7 416(h)(2)(B); or by (3) independently establishing one of a number of specific factual predicates from which \u201cchild\u201d status is \u201cdeemed\u201d to exist, \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C). Any illegitimate claimant \u201cdeemed\u201d to be a \u201cchild\u201d under either \u00a7 416(h)(2)(B) (legitimate but for legal impediment) or \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C) (independent proof of child status) is, in turn, \u201cdeemed ... legitimate,\u201d hence \u201cdependent,\u201d per \u00a7 402(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-5\">From the time that the instant claim first took specific legal form in the hearing before the AU, it has been pressed by claimant only under \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C), that is, by attempting to establish \u201cdeemed child\u201d status, hence \u201cdeemed dependent\u201d status, by one of the specific means of proof provided in that critical subparagraph of \u00a7 416. Because the proper interpretation and application of this statutory provision has been critically disputed throughout these proceedings, the relevant text is important to our consideration. That text runs as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-6\">(3) An applicant who is the son ... of a[n] ... insured individual, but who is not (and is not deemed to be) the child of such insured individual under [the preceding \u201cstate property law\u201d or \u201clegal impediment\u201d provisions], shall nevertheless be deemed to be the child of such insured individual if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-8\">(C) in the case of a deceased individual\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-9\">(i) such insured individual\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-10\">(I) had acknowledged in writing that the applicant is his or her son or daughter,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-11\">(II) had been decreed by a court to be the mother or father of the applicant, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-12\">(III) had been ordered by a court to contribute to the support of the applicant because the applicant was his or her son or daughter,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-13\">and such acknowledgment, court decree, or court order was made before the death of such insured individual, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-14\">(ii) such insured individual is shown by evidence satisfactory to the Secretary to have been the mother or father of the applicant, and such insured individual was living with or contributing to the support of the applicant at the time such insured individual died.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1220-15\">On the facts adduced in evidence, there has been no possibility (and no assertion) here that entitlement could have been established under either (i)(II) (court decree of parentage) or (i)(III) (court ordered support). The Secretary, upheld by the district court, so noted, and that is not in dispute at this point. The dispute has been and remains only whether, on a proper interpretation and application of this statutory provision, entitlement might have been, or was, established under either (i)(I) or (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-16\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-17\">In denying the claim as pressed under \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C), the AU, upheld in turn by the Appeals Council and the district court, adopted and applied two legal positions that are the focus of claimant\u2019s challenge on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-18\">First, adopting the Secretary\u2019s construction, the AU found in the introductory reference in paragraph (3) to \u201can applicant who is the son ... of a[n] ... insured,\u201d a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>predicate requirement, applicable to all claims pressed under any provision of that paragraph, that the claimant prove the biological parentage of the insured independently of and in addition to the specific elements of proof spelled out in subparagraphs (C)(i) and (C)(ii). Applying this construction, the AU determined that Beatty\u2019s parentage had not been independently proven, and on that basis alone denied the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-5\">Second, the ALJ\u2019s determination that Wayne had not proven Beatty\u2019s biological parentage was actually based upon a conclusion that the evidence proved to the contrary that James McMillian was that parent. This conclusion in turn was based in part upon the recitations (not direct adjudications) of James McMillian\u2019s parentage in the birth certificate and court support orders. But it was based as well upon the North Carolina common law presumption that a child born in wedlock is the child of his mother\u2019s husband (is legitimate), a presumption rebuttable only by proof of non-access or impotence. <em>See, e.g., State v. White, </em>300 N.C. 494, 268 S.E.2d 481, 490 (1980) (criminal non-support case); <em>Eubanks v. Eubanks, </em>273 N.C. 189, 159 S.E.2d 562, 568 (1968) (civil non-support).</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-6\">Claimant attacks the legal premises underlying both of these positions. He contends first that the different means of establishing \u201cdeemed\u201d dependent child status provided in subparagraphs (C)(i) and (C)(ii) are alternative, free-standing means of proving that dispositive status, and that their invocation does not therefore require any additional independent proof of biological parentage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-10\">Beyond that, he contends that the state common law presumption of parentage could not properly be applied in assessing claims of dependent child status under any of the provisions of \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On this basis, he contends that his essentially unrebutted evidence of Beatty\u2019s acknowledgment of parentage established entitlement under subparagraph (i)(I), or that, alternatively, his independent evidence of Beatty\u2019s parentage coupled with his evidence of significant support by Beatty established entitlement under subparagraph (ii), if assessed free of the state law presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-12\">We admit, but need not in this case authoritatively accept, the force of claimant\u2019s contention that in logic \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C) should not be construed to impose on claimants invoking either subparagraph (C)(i) or (G)(ii) any further independent requirement of proving biological parentage; i.e., that the requirements for establishing deemed dependent child status are fully stated within the two subparagraphs as freestanding, independent alternatives.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>we agree with claimant\u2019s contention (though for different reasons) that a state presumption of in-wedlock parentage is not applicable of its own force (or by congressional incorporation) to claims made under \u00a7 (h)(3)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-4\">Nevertheless, for reasons that follow, we conclude that any error committed by the Secretary and the court below in respect of these two matters was harmless, and that the judgment upholding the Secretary\u2019s denial of claims may therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-5\">The basic difficulty in applying the relevant statutory provisions to the survivor benefit claim in this case traces to the relatively rare circumstance that the claim here is that of an illegitimate child born in wedlock. The relevant statutory provisions for claims by illegitimates were obviously drawn with the more common circumstance of out-of-wedlock births primarily in mind. But the statutes make no distinction, as surely they should not, between illegitimates born in and those born out of wedlock. There is thus no question but that a claimant born in wedlock may in appropriate circumstances establish his entitlement to survivor benefits as the illegitimate child of another than his mother\u2019s husband under one or the other of the provisions of \u00a7 416(h). <em>See, e.g., Torres v. Gardner, </em>270 F.Supp. 1 (D.P.R.1967) (entitlement established under \u00a7 (h)(2)(A) by proving inheritance rights under state intestate succession law). No one really challenges that general proposition here, but the special circumstance has undoubtedly led to considerable confusion and difficulty in dealing with this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-6\">Until 1965, \u00a7 416(h)(2) provided the sole means by which illegitimates could establish entitlement to benefits as dependent children, with \u00a7 (h)(2)(A) the primary vehicle. Under that provision, an illegitimate claimant could establish entitlement to benefits by proving his entitlement to inherit from the insured wage earner as a \u201cchild\u201d under the intestate succession law of the state of the insured\u2019s domicile. In 1965, \u00a7 (h)(3)(C) was added specifically to provide other means by which entitlement might be established. <em>See Mendoza v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>655 F.2d 10, 13 (1st Cir.1981); <em>Severance v. Weinberger, </em>362 F.Supp. 1348, 1350-51 (D.D.C.1973) (3-judge court).</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-9\">Under the state inheritance law provisions of \u00a7 416(h)(2)(A), a claimant born in wedlock who sought to establish entitlement to benefits as the illegitimate child of another than his mother\u2019s husband was and is perforce confronted with any presumption of in-wedlock parentage integral to the state\u2019s inheritance law. <em>See Torres, supra. </em>That element of state law is necessarily included in the general congressional incorporation of state inheritance law into \u00a7 416(h)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-10\">But when \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C) was added in 1965 to provide supplementary and alternative means of proving entitlement by illegitimates, it did not expressly or by implication incorporate any element of state law respecting parentage, inheritance rights or any other matter of possible relevance to dependent child status. So far as the text of \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C) is concerned, all questions of its interpretation and application are referable solely to federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-11\">Accordingly, in this case, the North Carolina common law presumption of in-wedlock parentage had no application of its own force or by congressional incorporation to Wayne\u2019s claim under \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C)(i)(I) and (ii). The Secretary and the district court therefore erred in applying that presumption as a matter of state law in denying the claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1222-12\">But, as indicated, we think this error was harmless under a proper construction and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1153\">*1153</page-number>application of those provisions of \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C) under which the claim here in issue was made. This flows essentially from our perception \u2014 which we now hold\u2014 that the relevant state law presumption of legitimacy of children born in wedlock should apply by judicial adoption as an essential element of federal common law respecting claims by persons born in wedlock seeking to establish entitlement under either \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C)(i)(I) (parental acknowledgment) or \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C)(ii) (independent proof of parentage and support) as children of insured wage earners other than their mothers\u2019 husbands.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Our reasons are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-4\">Whatever the intended effect of the concededly ambiguous introductory reference in paragraph (3) of \u00a7 416(h) to \u201can applicant who is the son,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it is clear that Congress intended that a claimant invoking either of the alternative means of establishing entitlement provided by \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C) should be put to proving as one ultimate fact that the insured was his natural parent. The only question created by the statutory ambiguity is whether the elements of proof laid out in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) were intended wholly to suffice as the predicates from which \u201cchild\u201d status was to be \u201cdeemed\u201d for survivor benefit purposes. For our purposes, as earlier noted, we need not attempt to resolve that thorny issue, it being sufficient to note that, by whatever exact means, parentage of the insured is an ultimate fact to be proven under either subparagraph (C)(i) or (C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">That being so, the question inevitably arises whether in applying this federal statutory requirement to the claim of one born in wedlock, the common law presumption of in-wedlock parentage should operate as an interstitial element of federal law. As indicated, it could only do so by judicial adoption; the statute neither provides such a presumption as a matter of express federal law, nor does it incorporate such a presumption by express reference to state law sources as does \u00a7 416(h)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-9\">As further indicated, we are persuaded that such a presumption should be so adopted. The presumption is one of the most venerable, persistent, and continuously pervasive in the common law. <em>See generally, </em>Lawson, <em>The Law of Presumptive Evidence, </em>pp. 140-152 (2d ed. 1899). In variant forms, now frequently codified, it is currently applied in most, if not all, states. <em>See </em>Krause, <em>[] </em>\u2014 A <em>Proposed Uniform Act on Legitimacy, </em>44 Tex.L.Rev. 829, 844-45 &amp; nn. 29-35 (1966). The reason is plain. Though evidentiary in form, it is substantive in its intended effect as a conservator of generally recognized fundamental social values related to the institutions of marriage and family and to the stability and predictability of property interests. <em>Id. </em>at 844. It would be anomalous if federal statutory law concerned with or dependent in any way upon determinations of the parentage of children born in wedlock did not include as an interstitial common law element a presumption so universally applied by the states, the fundamental repositories of \u201cdomestic relations\u201d law. It is therefore an altogether fit subject for judicial adoption as an element of federal common law. <em>See Board of County Commissioners v. United States, </em>308 U.S. 343, 349-52, 60 S.Ct. 285, 287-89, 84 L.Ed. 313 (1939) (state law respecting remedy for illegal exaction of taxes \u201cabsorbed\u201d as \u201cgoverning federal rule\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-10\">There then arises the question of the proper source and form of the presumption to be adopted. Because there is in general \u201cno federal law of domestic relations,\u201d <em>DeSylva v. Ballentine, </em>351 U.S. 570, 580, 76 S.Ct. 974, 979-80, 100 L.Ed. 1415 (1956), we can only look to general common law sources or to the law of particular states for the most appropriate source. As between these two, we are satisfied that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1154\">*1154</page-number>more appropriate source is the same source directly incorporated by Congress in \u00a7 (h)(2)(A) \u2014 the law of the insured\u2019s domicile at the date of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">The general sources \u2014 the original common law presumption and its many variant forms as now applied \u2014 do not readily yield a particular form so obviously adapted to the underlying purposes of the federal statutory scheme that it should be adopted for general application. In its common law evolution it took many variant forms, <em>See </em>Lawson, <em>supra, </em>and, as indicated, it exists today in many variant state law forms. For that reason and others more critical we think the proper form for adoption into federal law is the law of the relevant state as defined in \u00a7 (h)(2)(A). By this means, consistency in particular applications of the presumption under \u00a7 (h)(2)(A) and \u00a7 (h)(3)(C) is insured, as well as consistency with general state law applications of the presumption in determining questions of parentage. <em>See DeSylva v. Ballentine, </em>351 U.S. 570, 76 S.Ct. 974, 100 L.Ed. 1415 (1956) (whether reference to \u201cchildren\u201d in copyright statute includes illegitimates answered by reference to state law rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-6\">Reviewing the judgment on the basis that the state law presumption of parentage might properly have been applied as an element of federal law,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we cannot declare the finding that Beatty was not Wayne\u2019s father clearly erroneous. Aside from the force of the presumption, there was other evidence supporting the finding \u2014 most notably the entry on the birth certificate identifying James McMillian as the father and the specific claim in the non-support proceeding that claimant was a child of McMillian\u2019s. The information upon which these assertions were made was traceable, at least by permissible inference, to Wayne\u2019s mother. As such, it of course conflicted with her litigation testimony identifying Beatty as claimant\u2019s father. The resulting credibility issue was for the trier of fact. Its resolution against the mother\u2019s litigation testimony is not made manifestly implausible by any other evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-9\">The evidence of Beatty\u2019s various acknowledgments of his parentage is of course direct evidence only of his subjective belief. Though obviously of great relevance to the issue, indeed perhaps sometimes sufficient standing alone to support an inferred finding of parentage, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C)(i)(I), it does not compel such a finding here in view of the opposing force of the presumption of legitimacy and the inherently suspect quality of all acknowledgments of parentage made in circumstances of conceded promiscuity such as those reflected in the evidence here. <em>See Montgomery v. Schweiker, </em>523 F.Supp. 1128, 1131-32 (D.Md.1981) (parentage by virtue of acknowledgment under \u00a7 (h)(3)(C)(i)(I) should be found only on basis of clear and unequivocal evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>While by the very terms of the presumption the mother\u2019s testimony as to her husband\u2019s non-access was entitled to consideration, it clearly did not suffice to compel a determination that the presumption\u2019s force had been negated. The credibility of this testimony like the parallel testimony respecting Beatty\u2019s parentage was drawn seriously in issue by other evidence and was properly subject to rejection by the trier of fact. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">Because the dispositive factual finding that the insured wage earner, Beatty, was not claimant\u2019s natural parent was not clearly erroneous we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1221-7\">. The actual basis for claimant\u2019s contention as to the non-applicability of the state presumption was, confusedly, that the state\u2019s inheritance law, within which the presumption was applied, was unconstitutional in its denial of equal protection to illegitimate children \u2014 a challenge comparable to that considered in such cases as <em>Latli v. Lalli, </em>439 U.S. 259, 99 S.Ct. 518, 58 L.Ed.2d 503 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-8\">Though the state, by intervention, formally defended its inheritance law against this challenge, and though the district court formally rejected it, the challenge was wholly misdirected. Such a challenge, even if successful, would only have invalidated those portions of the inheritance law that treated natural illegitimate children differently than natural legitimate children. It would not touch a presumption affecting the question whether a person were in the first instance a natural child of the person from whom right of intestate succession as a child was sought to be shown.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1221-14\">. In summary, claimant points out the redundancy and internal inconsistency of a reading that requires an applicant to prove biological parentage as a threshold predicate and then <em>in addition </em>to prove parental acknowledgment (subpar. (C)(i)(I)), or decrees of other courts establishing parentage (supars. (C)(i)(II) and (III)); and the incomprehensibility of a reading that requires an applicant to prove biological parentage as a threshold predicate and then <em>in addition </em>to \"show[ ] by evidence satisfactory to the Secretary [that the insured was] the ... father of the applicant, ...\u201d (subpar. (C)(ii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-15\">The Secretary, however, defends these readings as necessary to give any meaning to the introductory reference in par. (3) to \u201c[a]n applicant who is the son <em>...\" </em>and supports this by reference to a regulation that arguably so interprets the statute, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.355, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>claims for the regulation the judicial deference due such agency interpretation. Perhaps significantly, the Secretary advances a fail-back position if this interpretation should not be accepted under which the case would be remanded for consideration only under subpar. (C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-13\">As indicated, because of our basis for decision, we need not resolve this problem of statutory construction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1222-14\">. Though not on the constitutional ground urged by claimant. <em>See </em>note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">. If entitlement is sought under either (C)(i)(II) or (C)(i)(III) (prior court decrees of parentage or support based on parentage) proof of either type of decree establishing natural parentage of the other-than-husband insured will indicate that the presumption has already been judicially overcome.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1223-13\">. <em>See </em>note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1224-7\">. Though we must always be wary about deciding critical issues on appeal on grounds other than those relied upon by lower tribunals, the wariness traces most powerfully \u2014 though not entirely \u2014 to concerns about fairness to the disfavored party. Here, we are satisfied that our basis for decision does not unfairly prejudice the claimant. Though the possibility that the common law presumption might apply as adopted federal common law (though not as state law by its own force or by incorporation) was not addressed either by the parties or the lower tribunals, we raised the possibility <em>sua sponte </em>on oral argument, and invited supplemental briefing by post-argument memoranda. Understandably, given the fact now established by our own research that the question is apparently one of first impression, the parties were unable to cite any judicial authority either adopting or rejecting adoption of the presumption into federal law. The Secretary cited only to <em>McKenzie v. Harris, </em>679 F.2d 8 (3d Cir.1982), but that case (and there are others) only involved application of a comparable state law presumption as an element of congressionally incorporated state law under \u00a7 (h)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-11\">Under the circumstances, we are persuaded that either allowing rehearing for full adversary development of the question in this court, or remanding to the district court for first instance application of the presumption in its same form but now as federal law would obviously be wasteful exercises not required in the interest of justice. <em>Cf. United States v. The Barge Shamrock, </em>635 F.2d 1108, 1111 (4th Cir.1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
