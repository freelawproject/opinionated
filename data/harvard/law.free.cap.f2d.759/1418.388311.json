His attorneys and accountant appeal from the district court\u2019s order to produce documents enumerated in subpoenas served upon them. Terry intervened in the district court and is therefore pursuing an appeal here as well. <em>See In re Gren, </em>633 F.2d 825, 826 (9th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-31\">The government issued subpoenas to attorneys Ingber and Rosenfield and to accountant Barrett, seeking documents of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1419\">*1419</page-number>Terry\u2019s in their possession. Ingber formerly represented Terry; Rosenfield now represents him. Barrett is a member of the accounting firm retained by Rosenfield to assist in Terry\u2019s representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-5\">The appellants provided the government with those documents they characterized as corporate, but refused to provide others, described by appellants as \u201cthose documents belonging to the client personally, and relating to the client\u2019s personal transactions and records.\u201d Appellants also claimed a privilege as to documents they described as involving \u201ctransactions ... conducted through the non-institutional type partnerships and partnership joint ventures ... for which the documents were the client\u2019s personal documents.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1481-6\">Appellants provided a general inventory of the types of documents they possessed to the district court. At a hearing June 16, 1982, the appellants argued that many of the items sought were Terry\u2019s personal documents and thus privileged. Appellants offered to prepare further affidavits, offer testimony <em>in camera, </em>or submit the documents to the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-7\">Following that hearing, an affidavit prepared by the taxpayer was submitted to the court under seal. After reviewing this final affidavit, the court held a brief hearing July 7, 1982, where the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1481-8\">In my review of the items, I don\u2019t find any items that I deem to be of a personal nature as understood by the controlling law in the Ninth Circuit, or indeed anywhere within the circuits or within the United States Supreme Court decisions and that being the case, I don\u2019t find any privacy issue that would be violated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6a\">(Ill RT 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-9\">The district court\u2019s order stated that \u201cno Fifth Amendment privilege, work product privilege, or attorney-client privilege exists\u201d and ordered appellants to produce the documents. The basic contention on appeal is that the requested documents are personal in nature and thus privileged under the fifth amendment, a privilege which the appellants claim is not lost merely because the documents are entrusted to attorneys for legal advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-10\">We vacated submission of this case pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Matter of Grand Jury Empanelled March 19, 1980, </em>680 F.2d 327 (3d Cir.1982), <em>cert. granted sub. nom. United States v. Doe, </em>461 U.S. 913,103 S.Ct. 1890, 77 L.Ed.2d 281 (1983). The Supreme Court rendered its decision in <em>United States v. Doe, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1237, 79 L.Ed.2d 552 (1984). The case is therefore resubmitted for decision and we now reverse the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-13\">The precise basis for the district court\u2019s conclusion is unclear. Either the appellants failed to convince the court that most of the documents were properly characterized as personal business or sole proprietorship records, or the district court felt that after <em>Fisher v. United States, </em>425 U.S. 391, 96 S.Ct. 1569, 48 L.Ed.2d 39 (1976), personal business records are not privileged. We need not detain ourselves with the problem of interpreting the district court\u2019s rationale because the Supreme Court has now made it clear that regardless of the precise characterization of the disputed papers, the contents of such documents are not privileged under the fifth amendment in the absence of some showing that creation of the documents was the product of compulsion. <em>United States v. Doe, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1242.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-14\">In <em>Doe, </em>the owner of several sole proprietorships attempted to quash subpoenas demanding the production of various records from the owner\u2019s companies. He was successful in the district court and the third circuit affirmed. The third circuit concluded that the papers of a sole proprietorship are similar to the individual owner\u2019s personal records and as such were entitled to fifth amendment protection. The court also reasoned that the mere act of producing the documents carried communicative aspects thereby bringing the act of production within the privilege. 680 F.2d at 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-15\">The Supreme Court partially embraced the third circuit\u2019s approach. The Court held that the act of producing the documents may be privileged when the facts indicate that production would involve testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1420\">*1420</page-number>monial self-incrimination. 104 S.Ct. at 1242-43. The Court rejected the third circuit\u2019s conclusion that the contents of business records may be privileged according to their content even if their creation was not compelled. \u201c[T]he Fifth Amendment would not be violated by the fact alone that the papers on their face might incriminate the taxpayer, for the privilege protects a person only against being incriminated by his own compelled testimonial communications.\u201d 104 S.Ct. at 1241 (quoting <em>Fisher v. United States, </em>425 U.S. 391, 409-10, 96 S.Ct. 1569, 1580-81, 48 L.Ed.2d 39 (1976)) (citations omitted). The Court concluded that the contents of the documents were not privileged absent a showing that the owner \u201cprepared the documents involuntarily or that the subpoena would force him to restate, repeat, or affirm the truth of their contents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1242 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-4\">Terry does not contend that he created the requested documents under any compulsion. Therefore, the contents of the documents are not privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-5\">However, the teaching of <em>United States v. Doe </em>suggests that \u201c[although the contents of a document may not be privileged, the act of producing the document may be.\u201d 104 S.Ct. at 1242 (citing <em>Fisher, </em>425 U.S. at 410, 96 S.Ct. at 1580); <em>accord In re Grand Jury Proceedings, </em>745 F.2d 1250, 1251 (9th Cir.1984). In <em>Doe, </em>the district court found that enforcement of the subpoena would force the respondent to admit the existence of the records demanded, his possession of them, and their authenticity. These tacit communications, if compelled by subpoena, would constitute testimonial self-incrimination. <em>Id., </em>104 S.Ct. at 1242-43. The Supreme Court refused to overturn the district court\u2019s findings, and, on this basis, concluded that the respondent could not be compelled to produce the subpoenaed documents. <em>Id. </em>at 1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b1482-7\">We face a somewhat different question here, because the government sought production from Terry\u2019s attorney, rather than from Terry himself.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Fisher, </em>the Supreme Court held that the fifth amendment privilege against self incrimination is not implicated when an attorney is ordered to produce a client\u2019s documents even though such production may have been privileged under the fifth amendment while in the client\u2019s possession. 425 U.S. at 397, 96 S.Ct. at 1574. The Court further held, however, that when documents are transferred to an attorney for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, the documents, if unobtainable by summons from the client, are unobtainable by summons from the attorney. <em>Id. </em>at 405, 96 S.Ct. at 1578. This holding rests on the policy reasons supporting the attorney-client privilege. <em>Id. </em>To hold otherwise would discourage clients from disclosing incriminating documents to their attorneys. The attorney-client privilege and the interests it protects would be ill-served by holding that Terry \u201cwalked into his attorney\u2019s office unquestionably shielded with the fifth amendment\u2019s protection, and walked out with something less.\u201d <em>United States v. Judson, </em>322 F.2d 460, 466 (9th Cir.1963). Thus, we must consider whether, if Terry held the records demanded, his act of turning them over would be testimonial and incriminating. <em>Accord In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum, </em>754 F.2d 918, 920 (11th Cir.1985) (recognizing that an attorney\u2019s production could implicate client in compelled testimonial incrimination); <em>In re Grand Jury Proceedings, </em>747 F.2d 1098, 1100 (6th Cir.1984) (attorney\u2019s production of partnership and corporation records would require tacit incriminating admissions). It must also be determined whether the subpoenaed documents were actually given to the attorney to obtain legal advice. <em>Fisher, </em>425 U.S. at 404, 96 S.Ct. at 1577.</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1421\">*1421</page-number>The act of production is testimonial if it can be used by the government to show the existence, possession, or authenticity of the documents requested. <em>Doe, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1243, n. 11. These are uniquely factual inquiries. <em>Doe, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1243; <em>Fisher, </em>425 U.S. at 410, 96 S.Ct. at 1580.</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-5\">The subpoena in this case demands personal journals, files related to the purchase of fishing boats, stock transactions, escrow statements, and receipts. Many of these documents belong to, and were prepared by, Terry, himself. Terry\u2019s production of them could therefore relieve the government of proving the existence, possession, or authenticity of the records, and, thus could be incriminatory. We cannot conclude on the basis of the record before us that the act of production would involve only \u201ctrifling and imaginary\u201d incrimination. <em>See Doe, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1243 n. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-6\">Because these unresolved factual issues are more properly suited to resolution in the district court, we must remand this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1483-7\">REVERSED and REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1482-6\">. Recently, in <em>In re Grand Jury Proceedings, </em>745 F.2d 1250 (9th Cir.1984), we applied <em>Doe </em>and concluded that the government could <em>compel </em>a bookkeeper to turn over records she prepared and kept for her principal, even though the government could not have compelled production of the same records from the principal himself. <em>Id. </em>at 1251-52. Because, in this case, the persons who possess the documents the government seeks are Terry\u2019s attorney and an accountant, allegedly hired by the attorney in connection with providing legal advice to Terry, we must analyze production in light of the purposes underlying the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
