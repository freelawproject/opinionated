Trakas had sued Quality Brands, Inc., for breach of contract and for sex-based discrimination in violation of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>and the Equal Pay Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206. We find that in the special circumstances of this case, the trial judge abused her discretion by denying a continuance and dismissing the suit with prejudice. We therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-14\">Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b), a defendant may move for involuntary dismissal for \u201cfailure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with these rules or any order of court.\u201d The cases indicate that use of the rule has been limited to egregious conduct by dilatory plaintiffs. The leading case on dismissal for want of prosecution is <em>Link v. Wabash Railroad, </em>370 U.S. 626, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962), in which a sharply-divided Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of an action that had been pending for six years. The petitioner\u2019s lawyer had failed without reasonable explanation to appear for a pretrial conference, and the majority found that it \u201ccould reasonably be inferred ... that petitioner had been deliberately proceeding in a dilatory fashion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633, 82 S.Ct. at 1390.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-16\">In the other cases cited by the defendant as upholding dismissal, the conduct was as bad or worse. <em>See, e.g., Asociacion de Empleados v. Rodriguez Morales, </em>538 F.2d 915 (1st Cir.1976) (dismissal not an abuse of discretion where plaintiffs had already received one time extension, had failed to appear for a hearing, had failed to comply with court directives, had failed to meet a filing deadline after explicitly promising to meet it, and had proffered no plausible excuses); <em>Ramsay v. Bailey, </em>531 F.2d 706 (5th Cir.1976) (dismissal not an abuse of discretion where action had been pending for more than three years, had already been dismissed for want of prosecution and then reinstated, the plaintiff had unreasonably delayed replying to a discovery order, had received several time extensions, had interposed frivolous motions, had failed to file a reply brief after promising the court its imminent delivery, and had ignored repeated warnings). As we have noted before, <em>see, e.g., Butler v. Pearson, </em>636 F.2d 526, 529 (D.C.Cir.1980); <em>Jackson v. Washington Monthly Co., </em>569 F.2d 119, 121 (D.C.Cir.1977), <em>Link </em>and its progeny authorize dismissal where the record reveals \u201ca course of protracted neglect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-17\">The law of this circuit partakes of the general view that dismissal is an extremely harsh sanction and may be reversed when discretion is abused. <em>Camps v. C &amp; P Telephone Co., </em>692 F.2d 120, 123-24 (D.C.Cir.1981). Since our system <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>favors the disposition of cases on the merits, dismissal is a sanction of last resort to be applied only after less dire alternatives have been explored without success. <em>See id.; Jackson, </em>569 F.2d at 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><em>Automated Datatron, Inc. v. Woodcock, </em>659 F.2d 1168 (D.C.Cir.1981), relied upon so heavily by the dissent, is not to the contrary. In <em>Woodcock, </em>we upheld the dismissal of a count of a counterclaim where the dismissal resulted from the litigant\u2019s \u201cprolonged failure\u201d \u2014 over a period of six months \u2014 to comply with a clear instruction of the trial court to amend his pleadings. The litigant had had \u201cample opportunity\u201d to comply, he had been instructed and warned to do so, and the necessary steps were \u201cfully\u201d within his control. We found that he had advanced no excuse apart from inadvertence or oversight and presented no special circumstances that might explain his neglect and \u201cconspicuous disregard\u201d of the court\u2019s directive. Compliance, we pointed out, would have been relatively simple. We observed, moreover, that although the dismissal occurred two weeks before trial, permitting the litigant to comply at that date would have necessitated rescheduling a trial which had already been postponed once before. Consideration of the record in the present case shows that the conduct of the plaintiff was not such as to reasonably warrant the sanction of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Trakas was formerly a liquor saleswoman in the employ of the defendant and, allegedly, the only woman in the restaurant division of the company\u2019s sales force. On March 1, 1982, a new division sales manager was appointed. According to Trakas, her new supervisor publicly stated that one of his goals was to develop an all-male sales force. The defendant claims that Trakas was dismissed for failure to meet her sales quotas. Trakas describes that explanation as a pretext, asserting that she had increased sales in her territory every month and that male employees who failed to meet the quotas were not dismissed. Suffice it to say there are many facts at issue which will require a trial for resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">The record shows that Trakas lost her job on August 13, 1982, instituted administrative action on September 8, 1982, received a \u201cright to sue\u201d letter from the appropriate federal agency in the late summer of 1983, and forthwith instituted the present action on August 31, 1983. At a November 10, 1983 status call, the trial date was set for March 7, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Plaintiff remained unemployed after her firing. In June 1983, she moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where her husband, an attorney, had been offered a job. The plaintiff\u2019s husband was gainfully employed in November, when the trial date was set. In January 1984, however, he lost his job. With both spouses out of work, getting the money to travel to Washington for the trial unexpectedly became a problem. Trakas claims she planned to borrow the requisite funds from her parents but that at the last minute the parents did not provide the loan. On the weekend before trial, Trakas called her attorney to say that due solely to lack of funds she could not get to Washington but that she still desired to pursue her claim. She added that her husband had accepted employment as a waiter, and that she expected to have the necessary money within a month.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">Trakas\u2019 attorney immediately notified opposing counsel and the district court. The timing was such that both had less than two days notice of Trakas\u2019 desire for a continuance. There was, however, sufficient advance warning for the defendant to call off its witnesses and for the judge to advise the jurors to stay home. The expense of an appearance by counsel might also have been spared had the judge ruled on the plaintiff\u2019s written motion, but the judge requested counsels\u2019 appearance on the scheduled trial date. In court, she denied the continuance, thereby rendering prosecution of the case impossible, and then dismissed for want of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">We obviously do not condone plaintiff\u2019s waiting so long to bring her financial difficulties to the attention of counsel and of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>the court, but the error did not cause such consequences as to warrant the harsh sanction of dismissal. It is uncontroverted that up until the incident in question here, Tralcas had pursued her claim diligently and expeditiously. No prior continuances had been sought and the only delay of any sort had been on the part of the defendant (in answering interrogatories). The record discloses no evidence whatsoever of bad faith, deliberate misconduct, or tactical delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">The trial judge at several points suggested that because the plaintiffs husband is a member of the bar, she must necessarily have funds at her disposal. We find nothing in the record which supports such an inference. Plaintiffs attorney attested in court that plaintiffs husband had been out of work for two months and had finally agreed to work as a waiter, that the couple had sold possessions in order to meet their living expenses, and that, to the best of his knowledge, the couple was \u201cliving on a shoe string\u201d and \u201cvery destitute.\u201d Counsel\u2019s assertions were supported later by a sworn affidavit from the plaintiff herself. None of the assertions was ever disputed by the defendant or contradicted by any record evidence. We must agree with the plaintiff\u2019s attorney that although the law is an illustrious profession, it is not invariably a profitable one, and, to the extent that the trial judge based her decision on a contrary unsubstantiated assumption, she erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The trial judge also placed considerable reliance on the unwillingness of plaintiff\u2019s counsel to assume court costs voluntarily. In light of plaintiff\u2019s financial situation, however, counsel's reluctance was perfectly justified. Nor did the trial judge apparently even consider other alternative sanctions that would also be less drastic than complete dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s first and only misstep was the last-minute request for a continuance to allow her to be present; without her, the case could not proceed. Defendant has introduced absolutely no evidence to refute plaintiff\u2019s claim that this impropriety occurred largely through circumstances beyond her control. Nor, as we noted above, is there any indication of bad faith, dilatory intent, or protracted neglect on the part of the plaintiff. In sum, we do not believe that the single act of misconduct in this case was sufficient to justify the action of the trial court. In so holding, we emphasize that we are fully cognizant of the need of trial courts to manage their calendars so as to dispense justice as expeditiously and efficiently as possible. As we held in <em>Camps, </em>692 F.2d at 123, however, \u201ca single act of misconduct seldom if ever can justify dismissal,\u201d and there is nothing in the facts of this case that would place it among the exceptions. We accordingly reverse the judgment and remand the case to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b258-9\">SCALIA, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A9X\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">I think today\u2019s decision intrudes upon the discretion that belongs to trial judges and that is essential for the fair and expeditious conduct of their business.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">It was not unreasonable for the trial judge to be skeptical regarding the utter inability of this plaintiff, formerly employed as a saleswoman, married to an attorney, and not proceeding <em>pro se </em>but represented by a private attorney, to scrape up the funds for a trip to Washington from St. Louis. As far as the record discloses, the plaintiff did not even consider so plebian a means of conveyance as bus, but planned to come by plane or not at all. Assuming, however, that it was not the plaintiff\u2019s burden to present at the hearing some demonstration of impecuniousness more substantial than the secondhand and undocumented assurances of counsel; and therefore assuming, with the majority, that \u201cto the extent that the trial judge based her decision on [an] unsubstantiated assumption [of financial ability], she erred,\u201d Maj. op. at 188; that would still be no justification for our making the <em>contrary </em>assumption, based on no more than plaintiff\u2019s self-serving affidavit filed on motion for reconsideration. That appears to be, however, precisely what the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>does, concluding that \u201cthe single act of misconduct in this case was [not] sufficient to justify the action of the trial court,\u201d and that \u201cthere is nothing in the facts of this case\u201d that would support dismissal, Maj. op. at 188. Even if one believes that an impecunious plaintiffs failure to take reasonable precautions to prevent her impecuniousness from disrupting a scheduled trial at the eleventh hour is not enough to justify the District Court\u2019s action, the remand here should at the very least permit the court to conduct further inquiry into the fact of impecuniousness. As I read the opinion, that course is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">More fundamentally, however, there seems to me no proper basis for setting aside the District Court\u2019s action at all. I shall discuss the case, as the majority has, as though we were reviewing the trial judge\u2019s discretion in dismissing (with prejudice) for misconduct. I must note preliminarily, however, that what is actually involved is a matter on which the trial judge\u2019s discretion is even more expansive and her decision even more necessarily sustained. Though the final action in the case took the form of a dismissal, the essence of appellant\u2019s complaint is the trial judge\u2019s <em>refusal to grant a continuance the day before trial. </em>The court, the jury and opposing counsel were ready to proceed; counsel for plaintiff said that he could not and would not do so, and requested a continuance. He argues before us, in effect, that he was <em>entitled </em>to the continuance even though he was unwilling to stand good for the costs that would impose upon the other side. Especially since the last-minute (and thus disruptive) need for the continuance was not attributable to any Act of God but to the plaintiff\u2019s own fault in not making her financial arrangements for the trip to Washington much earlier, reversing the trial judge\u2019s refusal to grant the continuance absent payment of costs is awe-inspiring. <em>None </em>of the cases cited by the majority involved such a matter of grace, and I am aware of no case reversing the trial judge\u2019s decision in a remotely similar context.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">I shall assume, however, that we are dealing with an affirmative act of dismissal for misconduct, rather than merely a refusal to take extraordinary action to save the plaintiff from her own folly (and visit its effects upon the defendant). It is no small matter to have the judge and jury prepared for trial, and opposing counsel ready with the preparation of his case and his witnesses, and then to advise the court <em>the day before trial </em>(and opposing counsel only one day before that) that the plaintiff cannot proceed. <em>Whatever </em>Mrs. Trakas\u2019s financial condition might have been, there was no adequate excuse for this behavior. The majority suggests a state of facts more favorable than the record supports by saying that \u201cTrakas claims she planned to borrow the requisite funds from her parents but that at the last minute the parents did not provide the loan.\u201d Maj. op. at 187. As far as appears, the parents failed to come through \u201cat the last minute\u201d not because they went back on an earlier commitment, but because Mrs. Trakas never bothered to ask them for the funds <em>until </em>\u201cthe last minute.\u201d Even her affidavit filed on motion for reconsideration asserts no more than that she was optimistic her parents would lend her the money, only to have that optimism shattered when they refused the Sunday before trial. Such a cavalier attitude towards the litigation is, on any basis, grave and inexcusable.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">In <em>Link v. Wabash R.R., </em>370 U.S. 626, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962), the Supreme Court upheld dismissal for an attorney\u2019s failure to appear at a pretrial conference. While, as the majority notes, there were aggravating circumstances in that case that do not exist here, enabling the Court to infer \u201cthat petitioner had been deliberately proceeding in dilatory fashion,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 633, 82 S.Ct. at 1390; there are other factors here that in my view more than make up for that difference. Here, unlike there, it was the trial itself rather than merely a pretrial conference that was disrupted. Here, unlike there, the misdeeds of the attorney were not being visited upon the client, but the plaintiff was suffering the consequences of her own failure to give prosecution of her case the attention it required. And most important <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>of all, here, unlike there, the sanction of dismissal was imposed <em>only after plaintiffs counsel rejected the alternative sanction of paying the other side\u2019s costs attributable to </em>the delay <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u2014 which, as I shall discuss below, was the only alternative to dismissal that would have been effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The expansive dictum in <em>Camps v. C &amp; P Telephone Co., </em>692 F.2d 120, 123 (D.C.Cir. 1981), relied upon by the majority, to the effect that \u201ca single act of misconduct seldom if ever can justify dismissal\u201d is plainly an exaggeration insofar as the \u201cif ever\u201d is concerned. (Is it conceivable that <em>no </em>single act can <em>ever </em>warrant the sanction?) And the \u201cseldom\u201d part is neither very informative nor notably applicable here. One must hope it is seldom that a party to litigation will inexcusably wait until the day before trial to advise the court that it must be rescheduled for a reason she could have been aware of weeks before. I find nothing in the holding of <em>Camps </em>or of the two other decisions of this court cited by the <em>majority </em>\u2014 Butler <em>v. Pearson, </em>636 F.2d 526 (D.C.Cir.1980), and <em>Jackson v. Washington Monthly Co., </em>569 F.2d 119 (D.C.Cir.1977)\u2014 incompatible with the action of the District Court here. None of them involved misconduct equivalently grievous and disruptive, and all involved misconduct by the attorney rather than the party herself \u2014 except <em>Camps, </em>which involved a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s appearance \u201c10 to 30 minutes late for [a] status call,\u201d 692 F.2d at 122. What I do find strikingly incompatible, however, is the holding of the majority and the holding of this court in <em>Automated Datatron, Inc. v. Woodcock, </em>659 F.2d 1168 (D.C.Cir. 1981) , which upheld dismissal of a counterclaim for failing to comply with a court order to join a party. There was no indication of bad faith or dilatory intent, but merely of \u201coversight,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1169; the fault was that of the lawyer rather than the litigant; though the trial would have had to be rescheduled in order to permit the added party to prepare his defense, there was at least time (two weeks from the point at which the court learned of the defect) to replace the trial with another case on the court\u2019s docket; and we acknowledged that \u201ca less drastic sanction\u201d might have been possible, <em>id. </em>We held, nonetheless, that the trial court had not abused the discretion it must have \u201c[t]o prevent litigation delay and waste of scarce judicial resources,\u201d <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">The majority faults the trial judge for her failure \u201capparently even [to] consider other alternative sanctions <em>[i.e., </em>other than assessment of costs] that would also be less drastic than complete dismissal,\u201d Maj. op. at 188. That criticism would be more appropriate if it were joined with some suggestion of what other alternative sanction would be effective \u2014 both to compensate the other side for the costs inflicted by the plaintiff\u2019s conduct and to deter such conduct in the future. <em>See Locascio v. Teletype Corp., </em>694 F.2d 497, 499 (7th Cir. 1982) , <em>cert. denied, </em>461 U.S. 906, 103 S.Ct. 1876, 76 L.Ed.2d 808 (1983) (dismissal for failure to prosecute proper when \u201clesser sanctions either have not been or will not be effective\u201d); <em>Anderson v. Air West, Inc., </em>542 F.2d 522, 525 (9th Cir.1976) (same). <em>Cf. Hobson v. Wilson, </em>737 F.2d 1, 46 (D.C.Cir. 1984) (refusal to dismiss proper because, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number><em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe alternative to dismissal that was imposed ... adequately protected [defendant\u2019s] interests\u201d). I, at least, can conceive of none. A dismissal <em>without </em>prejudice leaves the plaintiff free to continue the litigation without compensating the defendant for the costs she has inflicted; and is no deterrent against such misconduct in the future where the plaintiff is positively desirous of protracting the litigation. Requiring the plaintiff to compensate the defendant out of her recovery constitutes no sanction whatever if the suit proves to be not only wrongfully delayed but in addition unmeritorious, so that there is no recovery from which the costs can be deducted. It also is a toothless deterrent against similar action in the future by precisely those plaintiffs who are most likely to engage in <em>it </em>\u2014 i.e., those whose cases are so weak that they do not fear a threat of reduction of their recovery, and who are using litigation and the protraction of litigation to extort a settlement. It is interesting (and utterly incomprehensible) that the sanction of costs which the majority rejects as excessive here was precisely the sanction <em>ordered by this court </em>(for the much lesser misconduct of failure to respond to discovery requests) in its remand of the dismissal in <em>Butler, supra. See </em>636 F.2d at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Perhaps it could be argued that the district judge erred in a respect not considered by the <em>majority </em>\u2014 i.e., in failing to impose the reasonable sanction of costs (rather than dismissal) despite the plaintiff\u2019s lack of agreement to that alternative. But that is not what appellant complains of here, nor what she requested in the motion for reconsideration below. Apart from the consideration that we should not reverse for an error both invited and unassigned, the fact is that absent an agreement to or request for that alternative, we cannot really be sure that it <em>is </em>a \u201clesser\u201d sanction than dismissal. The trade-off between fixed pecuniary liability and the foregoing of a chance for future recovery depends largely upon how good the chance of recovery is. For all we know, Mrs. Trakas would be well advised to take dismissal instead of costs. There is in any event no basis for saying that the District Court abused its discretion in declining to impose upon the plaintiff a choice she rejected, and continues to reject.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">I reemphasize that Mrs. Trakas was not being punished for her temporary impecuniousness, if that was indeed her situation, but for her inexplicable failure to take the steps necessary to prevent that situation from causing serious disruption of the trial process and imposing unnecessary expenses upon the defendant. Had she advised the court and counsel of her inability to appear a decent time in advance; or had she even made the necessary plans to appear (for example, by obtaining her parents\u2019 agreement to provide her the funds), which plans went awry at the last minute; it would be a different matter. But here we have a case of an intelligent woman who was seriously remiss in her obligation to take the most rudimentary steps for prosecution of the litigation, and who refused to stand good for the costs which her action wrongfully imposed on the other side. It may well be that, were this court vested with the discretion that belongs to the district judge, <em>see, e.g., Hornbuckle v. ARCO Oil &amp; Gas Co., </em>732 F.2d 1233, 1237 (5th Cir.1984); <em>Locascio v. Teletype Corp., </em>694 F.2d at 499, it would have been more merciful to the plaintiff (at the defendant\u2019s expense); but it seems to me impossible to say that the district judge\u2019s action was beyond the bounds of the reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">It is fine for the majority to \u201cemphasize that we are fully cognizant of the need of trial courts to manage their calendars so as to dispense justice as expeditiously and efficiently as possible,\u201d Maj. op. at 188. But if that cognition is to have any extra-psychic effect, then, as we said in <em>Automated Datatron, </em>659 F.2d at 1170, the district judge\u2019s \u201cpower to dismiss, in situations such as the one before us, must be more than theoretical.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b260-5\">At the time of the dismissal, counsel asserted that he had no authority from his client to agree to such a lesser sanction. Even if it be thought, however, that he should not have discussed this obvious possibility with his client in advance, he did not ask the court for time to conduct such consultation. Moreover, he had time to do so before filing his motion for reconsideration of the dismissal a month-and-a-half later; that also did not agree to the lesser sanction. Plaintiffs Motion for Reconsideration, <em>Tralcas v. International Distributor Corp., </em>Civ. No. 83-2562 (D.D.C. Apr. 25, 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">It should be noted in this regard that plaintiff did not purport to be permanently indigent, but rather to be suffering from temporary unemployment of her and her husband. In any case, if regard for the plaintiff\u2019s presumed permanent indigency is-what moves the majority to disregard the offer and rejection of the alternate sanction, it seems to me to establish a frightful proposition of law. Surely it cannot be that a permanently indigent plaintiff with an unmeritorious case can impose unjustified expenses upon the other side with impunity \u2014 being immune (out of consideration for indigency) from even an <em>assessment </em>of costs, and immune from dismissal as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
