(Frisch\u2019s) initiated this proceeding alleging a cause of action under the Lanham (Trademark) Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a), seeking monetary damages, and injunctive relief against defendant-appellee Shoney\u2019s Inc. (Shoney\u2019s) enjoining Shoney\u2019s from constructing or continuing to operate any restaurant under the name \u201cShoney\u2019s\u201d in states in which Frisch\u2019s has the exclusive right to use the \u201cBig Boy\u201d trademark. The district court issued a thirty-two page opinion denying the injunction and there followed this timely appeal. <em>Frisch\u2019s Restaurants, Inc. v. Shoney\u2019s Inc., </em>No. 1-82-834 (S.D.Ohio, Mar. 7, 1984) (Holschuh, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-20\">For twenty-five years, Shoney\u2019s had been licensed to use the \u201cBig Boy\u201d trademarks to promote its restaurants in West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Missouri. In those states, Shoney\u2019s operated or sublicensed 381 \u201cShoney\u2019s Big Boy Restau<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>rants\u201d. Frisch\u2019s has the exclusive \u201cBig Boy\u201d rights in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, and Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-4\">In 1982, and thereafter, Shoney\u2019s launched food service operations in Kentucky and Florida under the tradename of \u201cShoney\u2019s Towne and Country Restaurant\u201d. Frisch\u2019s charged that the operation of \u201cShoney\u2019s Towne and Country\u201d restaurants in the territory reserved to it for the use of the \u201cBig Boy\u201d mark violated the Lanham Act because of the public\u2019s association of the name \u201cShoney\u2019s\u201d with \u201cBig Boy\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-5\">The case is before this court upon timely appeal from the district court\u2019s order denying Frisch\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction against Shoney\u2019s enjoining the use of the \u201cShoney\u2019s\u201d name outside the Shoney\u2019s \u201cBig Boy\u201d license area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-6\">This circuit has enunciated four elements which must be considered and \u201ccarefully balanced\u201d in deciding to issue or withhold a preliminary injunction. <em>Mason County Medical Ass\u2019n v. Knebel, </em>563 F.2d 256, 264 (6th Cir.1977);</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1325-7\">1. Whether the movant has shown a strong or substantial likelihood or probability of success on the merits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1325-8\">2. Whether the movant has shown irreparable injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1325-9\">3. Whether the preliminary injunction could harm third parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1325-10\">4. Whether the public interest would be served by issuing the preliminary injunction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1325-11\">563 F.2d at 261 (citing cases). <em>See also In re DeLorean Motors Co., </em>755 F.2d 1223 (6th Cir.1985); <em>USACO Coal Co. v. Carbomin Energy, Inc., </em>689 F.2d 94 (6th Cir. 1982); <em>Mobil Corp. v. Marathon Oil Co., </em>669 F.2d 366, 368 (6th Cir.1981). The standard of appellate review of a district court order granting or denying a preliminary injunction is whether it abused its discretion. <em>Tate v. Frey, </em>735 F.2d 986, 990 (6th Cir.1984). <em>See also, e.g., In re DeLorean Motors Co., supra; Friendship Materials Inc. v. Michigan Brick, Inc., </em>679 F.2d 100, 102 (6th Cir.1982); <em>Adams v. Federal Express Corp., </em>547 F.2d 319 (6th Cir.1976). Rigid adherence to the \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard is required to avoid untoward disruption of the progression of lawsuits as the lower court decision \u201cwas in no sense a final disposition\u201d. <em>Tate v. Frey, </em>735 F.2d at 990 (citing <em>Securities and Exchange Comm\u2019n v. Senex Corp., </em>534 F.2d 1240 (6th Cir.1976); <em>Brandeis Machinery and Supply Corp. v. Barber-Green Co., </em>503 F.2d 503 (6th Cir.1974)). <em>See, e.g., In re DeLorean Motors Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1325-13\">Of course, the <em>Mason County </em>criteria \u201cdo not establish a rigid and comprehensive test for determining the appropriateness of preliminary injunctive relief\u201d. <em>Tate v. Frey, </em>735 F.2d at 990 (quoting <em>Friendship Materials, Inc. v. Michigan Brick, Inc., </em>679 F.2d at 102). <em>See also Roth v. Bank of the Commonwealth, </em>583 F.2d 527, 537 (6th Cir.1978), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>442 U.S. 925, 99 S.Ct. 2852, 61 L.Ed.2d 292 (1979). \u201c[T]he four considerations applicable to preliminary injunction decisions are factors to be balanced, not prerequisites that must be met.\u201d <em>In re DeLorean Motor Co., </em>755 F.2d at 1229. <em>Cf. Roth v. Bank of the Commonwealth, </em>583 F.2d at 537-38 (quoting <em>Metropolitan Detroit Plumbing &amp; Mechanical Contractors Ass\u2019n v. H.E.W., </em>418 F.Supp. 585, 586 (E.D.Mich.1976)). In the case at bar, the district court concluded that \u201cFrisch\u2019s has failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits\u201d, and denied injunctive relief without consideration of whether the remaining three factors might nevertheless have counseled in favor of the injunction. On appeal the parties have again addressed Frisch\u2019s ability or lack thereof to support its probability of success on the Lanham Act claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-15\">Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1325-16\">(a) Any person who shall ... use in connection with any goods or services ... a false designation of origin, or any false description or representation, including words or other symbols tending falsely to describe or represent the same, and shall cause such goods or services to enter into commerce ... shall be liable to a civil action by any person doing business in the locality falsely indicated as that of origin or in the region in which said locality is situated, or by any person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1264\">*1264</page-number>who believes that he is or is likely to be damaged by the use of any such false description or representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1326-4\">The Congress enacted the Lanham Act to make \u201cactionable the deceptive and misleading use of marks in ... commerce ... [and] to protect persons engaged in such commerce against unfair competition\u201d. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127. The Sixth Circuit has previously concluded that false representations about the origin of goods or services are actionable under \u00a7 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a). <em>Federal-Mogul Bower Bearings, Inc. v. Azoff, </em>313 F.2d 405, 408 (6th Cir.1963). In <em>Federal-Mogul, </em>this court determined that the Lanham Act provided \u201ca right of action to persons engaged in interstate and foreign commerce, against deceptive and misleading use of words, names, symbols, or devices, or any combination thereof, which have been adopted by a ... merchant to identify his goods and distinguish them from those manufactured by others\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 409, <em>quoted in Frisch\u2019s Restaurants, Inc. v. Elby\u2019s Big Boy of Steubenville, Inc., </em>670 F.2d 642, 647 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 916, 103 S.Ct. 231, 74 L.Ed.2d 182 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-5\">In this circuit, equitable relief, such as a preliminary injunction, is available to a Lanham Act plaintiff upon demonstrating, at a minimum, a likelihood of confusion among consumers as to the origin of the goods and services provided by defendant resulting from the defendant\u2019s use of the disputed mark, as well as irreparable harm to the plaintiffs interests. <em>Frisch\u2019s Restaurants, Inc. v. Elby\u2019s Big Boy of Steubenville, Inc., </em>670 F.2d at 647, 651. <em>See also Carson v. Here\u2019s Johnny Portable Toilets, Inc., </em>698 F.2d 831, 833 (6th Cir. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-6\">In <em>Frisch\u2019s Restaurants, </em>this circuit articulated eight factors for evaluating the \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d. 670 F.2d at 648. These factors are not immutable, but merely indicate the need for weighted evaluation of the pertinent facts in arriving at the legal conclusion of confusion. <em>See Carson v. Here\u2019s Johnny etc., supra, </em>698 F.2d at 833 (\u201c[i]n <em>Frisch\u2019s Restaurants </em>we approved the balancing of <em>several </em>factors____ In <em>that </em>case we examined <em>eight </em>factors\u201d (emphasis added)). These factors were culled from the Ninth Circuit cases of <em>AMF v. Sleekcraft Boats, </em>599 F.2d 341, 348 (9th Cir.1979), and <em>Toho Company, Inc. v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>645 F.2d 788, 790 (9th Cir.1981). They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1326-9\">1. strength of the plaintiffs mark;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1326-10\">2. relatedness of the goods;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1326-11\">3. similarity of the marks;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1326-12\">4. evidence of actual confusion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1326-13\">5. marketing channels used;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1326-14\">6. likely degree of purchaser case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1326-15\">7. defendant\u2019s intent in selecting the mark;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1326-16\">8. likelihood of expansion of the product lines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1326-17\">The district court\u2019s factual findings as to the evidence supporting the eight factors addressing the issue of \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d are subject to the clearly erroneous rule of appellate review. <em>Frisch\u2019s Restaurants, Inc. v. Elby\u2019s Big Boy of Steubenville, Inc., </em>670 F.2d at 651. However, the <em>evaluation </em>of those findings is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>examination by the appeals court. <em>Id., followed by Carson v. Here\u2019s Johnny etc., </em>698 F.2d at 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-18\">The strength of a mark is a factual determination of the mark\u2019s distinctiveness. The more distinct a mark, the more likely is the confusion resulting from its infringement, and, therefore, the more protection it is due. As stated in a modern legal treatise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1326-19\">A mark is strong if it is highly distinctive, i.e., if the public readily accepts it as the hallmark of a particular source; it can become so because it is unique, because it has been the subject of wide and intensive advertisement, or because of a combination of both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1326-20\">Callmann, <em>Unfair Competition, Trademarks &amp; Monopolies, </em>1120.43 (4th ed. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-21\">In the case at bar, the district court concluded that the \u201cBig Boy\u201d mark was neither an indicator of origin nor distinctive, but was \u201ca relatively weak mark\u201d. The \u201cBig Boy\u201d mark, the court explained, is owned by the Marriott Corporation which leases it to independent licensees throughout the country who obtain exclusive rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>to the mark in particular areas. According to the lower court, the evidence disclosed that \u201ceach user of the Big Boy mark develops and operates its own system\u201d. As a result, \u201c[t]here are substantial differences between each competitor\u2019s restaurants [and] [t]he only significant link ... is that each sells a double-deck hamburger called a Big Boy\u201d. In fact, the court noted that the various licensees deviated even in their formulas for the namesake sandwich. The \u201cBig Boy\u201d mark was thus used with products which lacked uniformity, and was therefore not distinct. It originated from various sources, and was therefore not a source indicator. As stated by the lower court (emphasis in original):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1327-5\">In the unusual structure created by Marriott, it is clear that the Big Boy mark does not serve as an indicator of a single source of origin____ Any confusion en-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1327-6\">gendered by Marriott\u2019s own unique system of using the same mark on different \u201cproducts\u201d cannot be the basis for one competitor enjoining another from using <em>its own mark, </em>about which consumers are <em>not </em>confused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1327-7\">On the appeal, Frisch\u2019s urges that the district court erred in its factual findings as to the strength of the \u201cBig Boy\u201d mark. The appellant\u2019s entire unexpurgated analysis of this issue is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1327-8\">As noted earlier, the district court concluded that the Big Boy Mark \u201chas never functioned, nor was it intended to function, as an origin-indicator for services.\u201d (Opinion p. 18.) The district court\u2019s conclusion is in direct conflict with the federal registration for the Big Boy service mark, Defendant\u2019s advertisements, billboards, license agreements and representations contained in its Uniform Franchise Offering Circular.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1327-9\"><em>Brief of Appellant </em>(5/9/84) at 29-30. It is true that the \u201cBig Boy\u201d mark has been registered as a service mark, but that does not negate the factual circumstances of this case wherein the lower court found that \u201cBig Boy\u201d did not <em>act </em>as a service mark. Frisch\u2019s notes that Shoney\u2019s advertised its Big Boy operations as \u201cShoney\u2019s Big Boy Restaurants\u201d. This reference, however, appears to errode Frisch\u2019s argument since the phrase could imply that <em>Shoney\u2019s </em>operated only those Big Boy Restaurants designated as Shoney\u2019s Big Boy Restaurants, thus emphasizing an independent \u201cShoney\u2019s\u201d operation and diverse \u201cBig Boy\u201d operations. By emphasizing <em>\u201cShoney\u2019s </em>Big Boy Restaurants\u201d, as it did in its advertising, Shoney\u2019s has identified <em>itself </em>as the source of the services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-11\">The district court\u2019s view of the commercial strength of the \u201cBig Boy\u201d mark is supported by the record. That the \u201cBig Boy\u201d mark is a weak service-origin mark is demonstrated by Frisch\u2019s own survey. For example, in Bowling Green, Kentucky [Frisch\u2019s territory], nearly 30% of the respondents identified \u201cJerry\u2019s\u201d, a local restaurant chain, as a \u201cBig Boy Restaurant\u201d; in Louisville the percentage was over 30%. In addition, the evidence indicated that Shoney\u2019s emphasized its own name in its advertisement of the Big Boy restaurants; in billboard\u2019s, for example, if the \u201cBig Boy\u201d words appeared at all they appeared in print up to 30 times smaller than the name \u201cShoney\u2019s\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-12\">Although, as Frisch's points out, there is evidence opposing the district court\u2019s conclusion, there is also sufficient evidence upon which the lower court anchored its decision. This court is therefore unable to conclude that the disposition of the trial court was clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 394-95, 68 S.Ct. 525, 541-42, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-13\">There is no dispute that the district court did not err in finding that the parties market similar goods. The district court identified the marks to be compared as \u201cShoney\u2019s\u201d and \u201cBig Boy\u201d. The lower court dismissed Frisch\u2019s argument that \u201cShoney\u2019s\u201d and \u201cBig Boy\u201d should be considered as identical; the district judge observed that the identity, in the public mind, of \u201cShoney\u2019s\u201d and \u201cBig Boy\u201d reflected the ultimate issue of consumer confusion. In putative rebuttal, on appeal Frisch\u2019s argues that the district court should have considered the two marks in their commercial context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1327-14\">The entire thrust of FRISCH\u2019S complaint is that the \u201cShoney\u2019s\u201d and \u201cBig <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>Boy\u201d service marks ... have become linked in the mind of a sizeable segment of the population in Defendant\u2019s licensed territories into which Defendant\u2019s reputation has spread. Viewing the marks in isolation and out of the context of their use over 25 years of course leads to the conclusion that the marks are \u201cvery dissimilar.\u201d However, such an abstract comparison ignores the realities of the marketplace and is an error of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdJ\"><em>Brief of Appellant </em>(5/9/84) at 30. Thus Frisch\u2019s concedes that the \u201clink in the mind of a sizable segment of the population\u201d <em>was </em>the ultimate issue before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-4\">Obviously, Frisch\u2019s is correct that the resolution of this lawsuit depends upon the performance of the marks in the commercial context. This circuit has developed an elemental factual analysis to be superimposed upon what would otherwise be an entirely subjective reaction. Similarity represents only one element of the calculation which engages the judicial inquiry into the commercial performance of the marks. Within the context of this case the lower Court\u2019s approach was not an error of law and the district judge\u2019s factual conclusion was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-5\">As an adjunct to its attack on the lower court\u2019s decision on the similarity issue, Frisch\u2019s argues on appeal that the marks which should have been compared were \u201cShoney\u2019s Big Boy\u201d and \u201cShoney\u2019s\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1328-6\">The residents of Bowling Green, Kentucky, Tallahasse, Florida and other communities on the fringes of Defendant\u2019s licensed Big Boy territory are familiar with Shoney\u2019s Big Boy. On seeing a restaurant in their community displaying the \u201cShoney\u2019s\u201d name, the comparison they would make is between \u201cShoney\u2019s Big Boy\u201d and \u201cShoney\u2019s\u201d. That is the comparison that is legally relevant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJG\"><em>Brief of Appellant </em>(5/9/84) at 32-33. At first glance this argument is attractive. However, the charged infringing mark is \u201cShoney\u2019s Towne and Country\u201d, which Frisch\u2019s claims unfairly competes with the \u201cFrisch\u2019s Big Boy\u201d mark. Frisch\u2019s argues that theoretically \u201cShoney\u2019s\u201d has become so notoriously associated with \u201cBig Boy\u201d beyond the former Shoney\u2019s license areas that mere use of the \u201cShoney\u2019s\u201d mark in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana and Florida invokes, for the public, the unspoken \u201cBig Boy\u201d mark. That is, as observed by the district judge, the ultimate issue in this case and Frisch\u2019s is not entitled to compel the trial court to presume a favorable conclusion during the step-by-step factual analysis leading to that conclusion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-9\">Although Frisch\u2019s has failed to cite them, appellee points out those cases which hold that in reviewing the similarity of marks the commercial context must be considered. \u201c[I]n assessing the similarity of two marks, it is the effect upon prospective purchasers that is important.\u201d <em>McGregor-Doniger Inc. v. Drizzle, Inc., </em>599 F.2d 1126 (2d Cir.1979). In those cases, however, the marks were <em>facially </em>similar. In <em>McGregor </em>the plaintiff\u2019s mark was \u201cDrizzler\u201d, the defendant\u2019s was \u201cDrizzle\u201d, and each was applied to a coat.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-10\">In <em>McGregor </em>the plaintiff was denied an injunction because its <em>product </em>was identified as the \u201cMcGregor Drizzler\u201d while the defendant\u2019s merchandise displayed the \u201cDrizzle\u201d mark to identify Drizzle, Inc. as the <em>source </em>of the product, rather than as the name of a line of products. Similarly, in this case Shoney\u2019s used the \u201cShoney\u2019s\u201d mark to identify <em>itself </em>as the source of the product line \u2014 in this case \u201cShoney\u2019s Big Boy\u201d and \u201cShoney\u2019s Towne and Country\u201d restaurants. Frisch\u2019s does not contest, and in fact insists, that the \u201cShoney\u2019s\u201d name has become well known through a large portion of the country; the emphasis of the \u201cShoney\u2019s\u201d mark over any subsidiary \u201cproduct line\u201d mark (\u201cBig Boy\u201d, \u201cTowne <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>and Country\u201d), therefore <em>reduces </em>the likelihood of confusion. Accordingly, even had the district judge erred in selecting the marks to be evaluated, the emphasis of the strong corporate name somewhat reduces, as in the <em>McGregor </em>case, the potential for confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-5\">In considering the evidence demonstrative of actual consumer confusion this court is mindful of precedent that teaches that proof of actual confusion is not necessary to obtain injunctive relief in a Lanham Act case, but it is obviously the most probative proof of the likelihood of confusion. <em>Amstar Corp. v. Domino\u2019s Pizza Inc., </em>615 F.2d 252, 263 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 899, 101 S.Ct. 268, 66 L.Ed.2d 129 (1980). The district court\u2019s evaluation of the evidence of actual confusion is a factual inquiry subject to the clearly erroneous rule. <em>Frisch\u2019s Restaurants, Inc. v. Elby\u2019s Big Boy, etc., supra. See Alpha Industries v. Alpha Steel Tube &amp; Shapes, Inc., </em>616 F.2d 440 (9th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-6\">To support its claim of consumer confusion, Frisch\u2019s presented a marketing survey designed and supervised by an Ohio State University professor, Dr. Lee Becker. Dr. Becker, who also testified at the hearing, gathered the survey data through telephone interviews with over 3,000 residents of seven communities. The lower court\u2019s recognition of Dr. Becker as a qualified expert in the field of scientific survey is not disputed on the appeal. The trial court, however, determined that the survey was defective and therefore assigned little weight to its evidentiary value in support of the issue of actual conclusion to which finding Frisch\u2019s strenuously took exception. The lower court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1329-7\">The factors that the Court finds discredit the accuracy of the survey results are as follows: First, the Court finds there is some merit in Shoney\u2019s position that the relevant universe defined by Dr. Becker was inappropriate. Dr. Becker defined the universe for his survey as the populations of seven communities. The sample to be surveyed was randomly selected from the telephone directories for those communities. While in some instances <em>{e.g., </em>Ironton, Ohio), the telephone directory included in one listing not only the primary but the surrounding communities, other telephone directories <em>{e.g. </em>Bowling Green, Kentucky) listed separately the residents of the primary community and each surrounding community. In the former instances, Dr. Becker drew his sample from both the primary and surrounding communities since the residents were listed together. In the latter instances, however, Dr. Becker drew his sample from only the primary community and excluded the surrounding communities. Although Dr. Becker testified that one reason for excluding certain communities was their relative distance from the primary community, the Court is not satisfied that Dr. Becker sufficiently familiarized himself with the geographies of the communities involved to base his decision on this ground but relied, instead, solely on the telephone company\u2019s definition of a certain community. The Court finds that this somewhat arbitrary method of selecting a sample detracts from the validity of the survey results. Indeed, Dr. Becker himself recognized that the exclusion of certain communities from the population group could have affected the results of the survey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1329-9\">Second, the Court also finds merit in Shoney\u2019s argument that the survey instrument itself renders the survey results invalid. The Court is particularly disturbed by the survey\u2019s use of the term \u201cBig Boy Restaurant\u201d in three key questions. First of all, Dr. Becker himself conceded that the term Big Boy Restaurant is an ambiguous term in that it means different things to different people. More importantly, however, is the fact that the use of the term may well have instilled in the respondents the false impression that there exists some sort of chain of restaurants called \u201cBig Boy Restaurants\u201d. These questions, therefore, taint the results of the,survey since the extent to which Big Boy functions as an indicator of source of services is an issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>very central to this case. The Court agrees with defendant that \u201c[b]y telling the respondent that there is such a thing as a Big Boy Restaurant, Dr. Becker is implying to the respondents that Big Boy functions as an indicator of source of services, and not just as a source of a hamburger.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1330-4\">Finally, the Court is concerned about the extent of participation in this survey by Frisch\u2019s counsel. Without in any sense meaning to impugn the integrity of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, a highly respected and extremely able attorney, the Court finds that the survey, rather than being totally neutral as to each side in this litigation, tends to reflect an advocate\u2019s point of view. Although Dr. Becker testified that he retained final authority over the survey, the Court concludes, considering both Dr. Becker\u2019s testimony as well as the survey instrument itself, that Dr. Becker\u2019s contacts with plaintiff\u2019s counsel unduly influenced his approach to the formulation of the survey instrument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1330-5\">Although no one of the above weaknesses standing alone may have unduly discredited the results of plaintiff\u2019s survey, their cumulative effect brings into serious doubt the validity of the results of the survey. The Court concludes, therefore, that plaintiff having failed to sufficiently demonstrate the validity of their survey instrument and the implementation thereof, the survey results admitted into evidence can be given little, if any, weight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1330-6\">The district court\u2019s criticism of Dr. Becker\u2019s reliance upon telephone listings to identify members of communities in which target restaurants were located is not persuasive. The restaurant locations were known and the decision to limit the respondent field to the main community as identified by the telephone listings is not suspect of itself. Further, the record lacks any evidence indicating that the survey failed to identify likely consumers. As to the lower court\u2019s holding that the survey was unduly influenced by counsel, the court did not articulate its basis for that conclusion and the record is void of supportive evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-8\">The lower court\u2019s observation that the survey predisposed respondents to identify \u201cShoney\u2019s Towne and Country\u201d restaurants as \u201ca\u201d \u201cBig Boy Restaurant\u201d does hit the mark. As noted by appellee, the survey mentions \u201cBig Boy Restaurants\u201d three times before the inquiry regarding the relationship of Shoney\u2019s. <em>See Appendix Volume B: Plaintiff Exhibits </em>at 358 (Ex. 28). The objectionable questions were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1330-9\">19. Now I\u2019m going to read you the names of some restaurants.

The formulation of the questions had firmly created a mindset in the interviewee that \u201cBig Boy\u201d was a restaurant name, such as Burger King, and the subsequent interview questions predetermine that consumers who were familiar with \u201cShoney\u2019s Big Boy\u201d outlets would conclude that any \u201cShoney\u2019s\u201d was <em>a </em>\u201cBig Boy\u201d. This technique is characterized as \u201caided awareness\u201d questioning; in effect it \u201csets up\u201d the desired response and therefore has been justly criticized and accorded diminished probative value. <em>See Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v.

Its effect in this case is dramatically illustrated by an examination of plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 14, <em>see Appendix Volume B: Plaintiffs Exhibits, </em>at 319, which was a summary of responses to questions 21, 22 and 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-6\">Question 21 inquired if there were any names the consumer associated with the local \u201cBig Boy Restaurant\u201d.

The lower court also distinguished the prior case of <em>Frisch\u2019s v. Elby\u2019s, supra, </em>on the basis of intent. In <em>Frisch\u2019s v. Elby\u2019s, </em>Elby\u2019s had undertaken to associate it\u2019s non-Big Boy outlets with its licensed Big Boy restaurants in a territory adjacent to its independent operations. Here, the district court observed Shoney\u2019s did not attempt any such association and had, in fact, undertaken to deemphasize the \u201cBig Boy\u201d mark in its <em>own </em>territory. The district judge specifically relied on the Ninth Circuit opinion in <em>Shakey\u2019s Inc. v. Covalt, </em>704 F.2d 426 (9th Cir.1983), as further support for its evaluation. The district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1332-4\">As the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals stated in <em>Shakey\u2019s, </em>the law of unfair competition does not impose upon Shoney\u2019s the duty to ensure that all its customers are aware its Towne &amp; Country restaurants are not affiliated with the Big Boy mark, but merely a duty not to promote a perpetuation of any perception that they are so affiliated. 704 F.2d at 432. Shoney\u2019s has not, unlike Elby\u2019s, acted to perpetuate any false impressions that consumers might have. To the extent there may exist a spill-over effect from any continuing or past use by Shoney\u2019s of the Big Boy mark in other states ... such effect is not a sufficient basis for a finding of \u201cintentional unauthorized association.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1332-5\">(Citation omitted). This court concurs in this analysis. The district judge performed an exhaustive review of the confusion issue and without error \u2014 clear or otherwise \u2014 in his conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-6\">On this record, the district court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cFrisch\u2019s has not met its burden of demonstrating a likelihood of success\u201d was correct. Of course, a finding that a party was not \u201clikely to prevail\u201d on the merits would not preclude a court from the exercise of its discretion to issue a preliminary injunction, <em>see In re DeLorean Motor Co., supra, </em>if the movant \u201cat least shows serious questions going to the merits <em>and </em>irreparable harm which decidedly outweighs any potential harm to the defendant if an injunction is issued\u201d. <em>Friendship Materials, Inc. v. Michigan Brick, Inc., </em>679 F.2d 100, 105 (6th Cir. 1982), <em>quoted in In re DeLorean Motor Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1332-8\">However, Frisch\u2019s has not shown any irreparable harm it would suffer which would \u201cdecidedly outweigh\u201d the prospective harm to Shoney\u2019s if the injunction were to issue. Under the requested injunction Shoney\u2019s would have to revamp, close, or halt construction on its \u201cShoney\u2019s Towne &amp; Country\u201d operations at substantial costs and injury to its business. Where the burden of the injunction would weigh as heavily on the defendant as on the plaintiff, the plaintiff must make a showing of at least a \u201cstrong probability of success on the merits\u201d before a trial court would be justified in issuing the order. <em>See In re DeLorean Motor Co., supra </em>(and cases cited therein); <em>Metropolitan Detroit Plumbing &amp; Mechanical Contractors Ass\u2019n v. H.E.W., </em>418 F.Supp. 585, 586 (E.D.Mich.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-9\">The district court concluded a comprehensive review and insightful analysis of a voluminous record and offered a soundly reasoned denial of the motion for a preliminary injunction. The trial court clearly acted within its discretion and authority. In accord with a strict policy of deference to such decisions, it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-10\">On April 13, 1984, after the appeal had been taken but prior to the argument, Shoney\u2019s and Marriott (owner of the \u201cBig Boy\u201d mark) entered into an agreement where-under Shoney\u2019s abandoned its right to use the \u201cBig Boy\u201d mark in any territory. Shoney\u2019s argued that Frisch\u2019s case was thereby mooted citing to <em>Shakey\u2019s Inc. v. Covalt, </em>704 F.2d 426 (9th Cir.1983) for the proposition that \u201cthere now is no association with \u2018Big Boy\u2019 to enjoin other than Shoney\u2019s <em>past </em>association which ... is legally insufficient to support a cause of action\u201d . <em>Brief of Appellee </em>(6/12/84) at 12. This court granted Shoney\u2019s motion to supplement the record with evidence of the April 13, 1984 agreement and the issue of mootness was therefore joined for disposition by this panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-11\">Upon review the panel concludes that the lawsuit has not been mooted. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number><em>Frisch\u2019s Restaurants, Inc. v. Elby\u2019s Big Boy, </em>670 F.2d 642 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 916, 103 S.Ct. 231, 74 L.Ed.2d 182 (1982), the defendant Elby\u2019s was, like Shoney\u2019s in this case, a former licensee of the \u201cBig Boy\u201d mark. By ruling that Frisch\u2019s had stated a cause of action, this court in <em>Frisch\u2019s v. Elby\u2019s </em>at least implicitly ruled that a current licensee could initiate an action for infringement against a former licensee. This court reaffirms that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-6\">In the case at bar, Frisch\u2019s theory is that Shoney\u2019s has impermissably traded on the reputation of \u201cBig Boy\u201d to the detriment of Frisch\u2019s. That theory remains viable despite the subsequent contractual disassociation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-7\">Consistent with the foregoing, the district court is affirmed and this case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1328-7\">. In passing, it might be observed that Frisch\u2019s has diluted its own position by arguing that \"Shoney\u2019s\u201d is so strong a mark that its influence extends beyond \"Shoney's Big Boy Restaurants\u201d. If, as determined by the trial court, \"Big Boy\" is a weak mark as a result of the licensing scheme adopted by Marriott, and \"Shoney\u2019s\u201d is a stronger, more dominant mark, then it would appear that the name \"Shoney\u2019s\u201d is entitled to more protection than \"Big Boy\u201d mark.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1331-55\">. It might be observed that Question 22 was constructed so that the respondent was first asked if McDonald\u2019s or Burger King were \"Big Boy Restaurants\u201d. These \"obvious no\u201d answers could conceivably have influenced the respondent to answer yes to the \"Shoney\u2019s Towne &amp; Country\u201d question in a desire to give a \"correct\" answer,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AK6\">. Of the cities, only in Nashville did \"Shoney\u2019s Big Boy\u201d operate; there are, in fact, a large number of \"Shoney\u2019s Big Boys\u201d in that city.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1333-8\">CORNELIA G. KENNEDY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ABR\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-9\">I agree with the majority of the panel that the District Court was not clearly erroneous in finding that the market survey did not properly measure consumer confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-10\">I write separately because I do not believe the majority has fully considered Frisch\u2019s theory with respect to confusion. Frisch\u2019s argues that consumers will be confused because they so strongly associate the name \u201cShoney\u2019s\u201d with \u201cBig Boy\u201d that they will also assume that \u201cShoney\u2019s Towne and Country\u201d is also licensed by or associated with \u201cBig Boy\u201d. The majority agrees with the District Court that \u201cBig Boy\u201d is a weak mark. A mark that designates the source is a strong mark, and I agree that \u201cBig Boy\u201d does not strongly designate the source. However, the confusion that is claimed here is not just confusion over the source \u2014 it is confusion over whether a particular source is associated with the national \u201cBig Boy\u201d trademark. \u201cBig Boy\u201d is a strong mark in the sense that it is \u201chighly distinctive.\u201d The two marks that need to be compared here are \u201cShoney\u2019s Big Boy\u201d and \u201cShoney\u2019s Towne and Country\u201d. Frisch\u2019s argues that a consumer seeing \u201cShoney\u2019s Towne and Country\u201d will think of \u201cShoney\u2019s Big Boy\u201d, a mark which Shoney\u2019s cannot use in states in which Frisch\u2019s has the exclusive right to the \u201cBig Boy\u201d mark. The majority reasons that the strength of the name \u201cShoney\u2019s\u201d reduces the possibility of confusion. However, when we consider Frisch\u2019s association theory and compare the two marks, the strength of the name \u201cShoney\u2019s\u201d, which is common to both, increases the similarity and thus the likelihood of associating the two marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-14\">I would permit Frisch\u2019s to pursue its theory of confusion by association. This type of \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d depends on the existence of actual consumer confusion, however. I agree with the majority\u2019s analysis of the consumer survey presented by Frisch\u2019s and the conclusion that Frisch\u2019s has not established a sufficient likelihood of success on the merits to require issuance of a preliminary injunction. I therefore concur in the majority opinion with the exception of its analysis of the strength and similarity of the marks.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
