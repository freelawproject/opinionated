Teleport also requested the district court to stay the bankruptcy court order pending appeal. The district court denied Teleport\u2019s request for stay, and Teleport appealed the denial of a stay to this court. The appeal from the order appointing a trustee remains pending in the district court. We dismiss for lack of jurisdiction Teleport\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of a stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-20\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d) (\u00a7 158) (formerly 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293(b)),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> this court has jurisdiction over \u201cappeals from all final decisions, judgments, orders and decrees\u201d of the district courts in bankruptcy matters. Previous decisions of this court have held that \u00a7 1293 replaces the traditional analysis of finality for purposes of appeal conducted under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (\u00a7 1291) with a more flexible approach to finality for bankruptcy appeals.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1439-21\">[Bankruptcy proceedings are unique ... the rules of finality developed for conventional litigation should not be applied mechanically. Those orders that \u201c \u2018may determine and seriously affect substantive rights\u2019 and \u2018cause irreparable harm to the losing party if he had to wait to the end of the bankruptcy case\u2019 \u201d are immediately appealable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1439-22\"><em>In re White, </em>727 F.2d 884, 885 (9th Cir. 1984) (quoting <em>In re Mason, </em>709 F.2d 1313, 1316-17 (9th Cir.1983)). <em>See also In re King City Transit Mix, Inc., </em>738 F.2d 1065, 1066 (9th Cir.1984). Under this approach, the district court\u2019s refusal to stay the appointment of a trustee is not appealable to this court as \u00e1 final order under \u00a7 158. The district court\u2019s decision not to grant a stay did not conclusively determine any controversy before the district court, and Teleport has not demonstrated that it will suffer irreparable injury if an immediate appeal of the refusal to stay is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-23\">Teleport argues that we have jurisdiction to address bankruptcy appeals under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (\u00a7 1292), which governs interlocutory appeals in non-bankrupt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number>cy matters, when the district court\u2019s order is not final within the meaning of \u00a7 158. Some of the decisions applying \u00a7 1293 have noted that appellate court jurisdiction over bankruptcy matters is limited to final orders, <em>see e.g., In re King City Transit, </em>738 F.2d at 1066; <em>In re White, </em>727 F.2d at 885, but these decisions did not specifically address the application of \u00a7 1292 to bankruptcy appeals. We hold that \u00a7 158 precludes bankruptcy appellants from relying on \u00a7 1292 as a basis for appellate court jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-4\">The express provisions for appeal from final orders in \u00a7 158 necessarily preclude reliance on \u00a7 1291 as a basis for appeal from final orders in bankruptcy cases. If \u00a7 1291 still applied to final bankruptcy orders, \u00a7 158 would be superfluous. It is evident that Congress intended \u00a7 158 to be the exclusive basis of jurisdiction in the appellate courts in bankruptcy matters. We conclude that the interlocutory appeal provisions of \u00a7 1292, like the final appeal provisions of \u00a7 1291, are inapplicable to bankruptcy proceedings. <em>See In re Regency Wood Apartments, Ltd., </em>686 F.2d 899, 901 (11th Cir.1982); <em>In re Riddervold, </em>647 F.2d 342, 343 (2d Cir.1981). Moreover, the availability of mandamus jurisdiction, discussed below, and the less stringent definition of finality applied under \u00a7 158 limit any potential hardship caused by denying bankruptcy appellants access to this court through \u00a7 1292.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-5\">Our decision that interlocutory orders of the type before us today are not appealable to this court under \u00a7 1292 or \u00a7 158 is consistent with this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>In re Sambo\u2019s Restaurants, Inc., </em>754 F.2d 811 (9th Cir.1985) <em>(Sambo\u2019s). </em>In <em>Sambo\u2019s </em>this court held that, where the bankruptcy court issues an indisputably final order, an order of the district court affirming or reversing the bankruptcy court order is also final even though it may be \u201cinterlocutory\u201d in the sense that it provides for further action by the bankruptcy court. The type of interlocutory order which we review today is distinct from the type of \u201cinterlocutory\u201d order at issue in <em>Sambo\u2019s. </em>In this case, the district court merely refused to issue a stay pending its decision on the merits of the appeal. It did not reverse or affirm a final order of the bankruptcy court. The type of interlocutory order which we review today is not final under the <em>Sambo\u2019s </em>doctrine, or, as discussed above, under the less stringent approach to finality which is generally applied to \u00a7 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-7\">We recognize that mandamus jurisdiction is available to review a district court\u2019s denial of stay in those extraordinary cases where a bankruptcy appellant in the district court is threatened with irreparable harm and there are no other means, including the eventual appeal, to protect himself from this harm. <em>See Bauman v. United States District Court, </em>557 F.2d 650, 654-55 (9th Cir.1977) (listing five factors to be considered in mandamus analysis). Even were we to construe the present appeal as a petition for mandamus relief, <em>see Unified Sewerage Agency v. Jelco, Inc., </em>646 F.2d 1339, 1343 (9th Cir.1981), we would deny relief because Teleport has not shown that it is threatened with irreparable injury. <em>See In re Cement Antitrust Litigation (MDL 296), </em>688 F.2d 1297, 1301-03 (9th Cir.1982), <em>aff'd for absence of quorom sub nom., Arizona v. Ash Grove Cement Co., </em>459 U.S. 1190, 103 S.Ct. 1172, 75 L.Ed.2d 425 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-8\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1439-18\">. Although the prior decisions of this court discussed below addressed 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293(b) they are applicable in this case involving \u00a7 158 because both \u00a7 1293 and \u00a7 158 refer to final judgments, orders or decrees as the basis for appellate court jurisdiction in bankruptcy matters.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
