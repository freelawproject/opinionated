In that action, the Fund sought vacation of an arbitrator\u2019s award that had ordered the Fund to pay appellee John McSkimming supplemental retirement benefits under the United States Steel Corporation Plan for Employee Pension Benefits (\u201cthe Plan\u201d). The district court granted summary judgment in McSkimming\u2019s favor. Because we hold that the district court erred in determining that the arbitrator\u2019s award drew its essence from the Plan, we will reverse the judgment below and remand with direction to grant summary judgment in the Fund\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">McSkimming, an employee of United States Steel Company (\u201cUSS\u201d) since 1948, became a Senior Project Engineer at USS\u2019s South Works plant in 1979. In 1982, USS initiated a reduction in force (\u201cRIF\u201d) at South Works, and ordered its managers to rank their employees on a numeric scale of one to four, with \u201cone\u201d being the highest rank. McSkimming received a rating of \u201cthree.\u201d Shortly thereafter, USS terminated McSkimming\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">McSkimming applied for, and is now receiving, regular pension benefits under the Plan. He also sought benefits under the Plan\u2019s \u201c70/80\u201d provision, under which an employee who meets certain age and length of service requirements<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> may receive supplemental retirement benefits if \u201chis Employing Company considers that [his] retirement would ... be in its interest and it approves an application for retirement under mutually satisfactory conditions.\u201d Plan \u00a7 2.6(b)(2). Although McSkimming was otherwise eligible for 70/80 benefits, USS refused to approve his application, and the Fund accordingly denied the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">McSkimming filed a grievance against the Fund, claiming entitlement to the 70/80 benefits. That grievance was submitted to arbitration in March, 1984. The sole question presented to the arbitrator was whether the Fund had \u201cacted improperly\u201d under the Plan in denying McSkimming\u2019s application for 70/80 benefits. The arbitrator ruled in McSkimming\u2019s favor, holding that the Fund had acted improperly in denying his application because USS had earlier approved a 70/80 application for an employee who had received a lower mark than McSkimming had in the RIF ranking.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The arbitrator recognized that the decision to treat McSkimming differently from the other employee was made by USS, which was not a party to the arbitration. Nevertheless, the arbitrator held that it was \u201cnot critical to identify the specific persons who so acted,\u201d because USS\u2019s retention of discretion to approve applications for 70/80 benefits constituted sufficient control of the Plan\u2019s \u201cmanagement or disposition of its assets\u201d to make it a fiduciary under ERISA. App. at 58 (citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(21)(A)(i)). USS\u2019s discrimination between McSkimming and a similarly situated employee was, in the arbitrator\u2019s view, a breach of its ERISA fiduciary duties. Finding that this perceived breach was attributable to the Fund, the arbitrator entered an award \u201cagainst the Plan as an entity.\u201d App. at 58. The arbitrator went on to note that, even absent the discrimination, he would be compelled to decide against the Fund because he believed that the 70/80 provision, which makes USS\u2019s self-interest a criterion for an award of benefits under the Plan, was facially invalid under ERISA. App. at 59-60 (citing <em>NLRB v. Amax Coal Co., </em>453 U.S. 322, 101 S.Ct. 2789, 69 L.Ed.2d 672 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">The Fund brought this action seeking to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award on the ground that he had exceeded his authority by deciding the grievance under ERISA, rather than under the Plan. Both parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The district court denied the Fund\u2019s motion and granted McSkimming\u2019s. The Fund now appeals from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b340-13\">As the district court noted, the standard of review applied by federal courts to labor arbitration awards is exceedingly narrow. This court has held that an arbitrator\u2019s award must be upheld</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABC\">if the interpretation can in any rational way be derived from the agreement, viewed in the light of its language, its context, and any other indicia of the parties\u2019 intention; only where there is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>manifest disregard of the agreement, totally unsupported by principles of contract construction and the law of the shop, may a reviewing court disturb the award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-5\"><em>Ludwig Honold Mfg. Co. v. Fletcher, </em>405 F.2d 1123, 1128 (3d Cir.1969). <em>See United Food &amp; Commercial Workers, Local 590 v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., </em>734 F.2d 455, 457 (3d Cir.1984); <em>Sun Petroleum Prods. Co. v. Oil, Chemical &amp; Atomic Workers, Local 8-901, </em>681 F.2d 924, 928 (3d Cir.1982). Applying this standard, the district court determined that arbitrator\u2019s award drew its essence from the Plan. The district court held that the approval of 70/80 benefits for an employee with a lower RIF ranking than McSkimming\u2019s was an \u201cindicia of the parties\u2019 intent\u201d to which the arbitrator could legitimately refer in interpreting the 70/80 clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Although we are mindful of the narrow scope of judicial review of arbitral decisions, we are constrained to hold that the district court erred in refusing to vacate the award in this case. \u201cIf an arbitral decision is based \u2018solely upon the arbitrator\u2019s view of the requirements of enacted legislation,\u2019 rather than on the [contract], the arbitrator has \u2018exceeded the scope of the submission,\u2019 and the award will not be enforced.\u201d <em>Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., </em>415 U.S. 36, 53, 94 S.Ct. 1011, 1022, 39 L.Ed.2d 147 (1974). <em>See USWA v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Co., </em>363 U.S. 593, 597, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 1361, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960). Here, the arbitrator\u2019s award was expressly based upon his view of ERISA. The arbitrator looked to USS\u2019s past practice not as an indicia of the meaning of the 70/80 clause, but rather as a breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA, and it was only through ERISA that he was able to attribute USS\u2019s actions to the Fund. Indeed, far from drawing the essence of his decision from the provision of the Plan submitted for his interpretation, the arbitrator found it to be facially invalid under ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Because the arbitrator\u2019s award is patently based on statutory interpretation rather than on the Plan, the district court erred in refusing to vacate it. We will therefore reverse the judgment below, and remand the cause with a direction to grant the Fund\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b340-8\">.
