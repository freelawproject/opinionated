CERCLA\u2014 adopted in the waning hours of the Ninety-sixth Congress, and signed by President Carter on December 11, 1980 \u2014 was intended to provide means for cleaning up hazardous waste sites and spills, and may generally be known to the public as authorizing the so-called Superfund, the $1.6 billion Hazardous Substances Response Trust Fund, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9631-9633.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-9\">On February 29, 1984, the State of New York brought suit against Shore Realty Corp. (\u201cShore\u201d) and Donald LeoGrande, its officer and stockholder, to clean up a hazardous waste disposal site at One Shore Road, Glenwood Landing, New York, which Shore had acquired for land development purposes. At the time of the acquisition, LeoGrande knew that hazardous waste was stored on the site and that cleanup would be expensive, though neither Shore nor LeoGrande had participated in the generation or transportation of the nearly 700,000 gallons of hazardous waste now on the premises. The State\u2019s suit under CERCLA for an injunction and damages was brought in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Henry Bramwell, Judge. The complaint also contained pendent state law nuisance claims, based on both common law and N.Y.Real Prop.Acts.Law \u00a7 841 (McKinney 1979). On October 15, 1984, the district court granted the State\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. Apparently relying at least in part on CERCLA, it directed by permanent injunction that Shore and LeoGrande remove the hazardous waste stored on the property, subject to monitoring by the State, and held them liable for the State\u2019s \u201cresponse costs,\u201d <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a)(4)(A). In the alternative the court based the injunction on a finding that the Shore Road site was a public nuisance. Following a remand by this court on December 14, 1984, the district court on January 11, 1985, stated with more particularity the undisputed material facts underlying its decision finding defendants liable for the State\u2019s response costs and clarifying its earlier decision by basing the injunction solely on state public nuisance law. The court also modified its earlier decision by suggesting that CERCLA does not authorize injunctive relief in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1107-13\">We affirm, concluding that Shore is liable under CERCLA for the State\u2019s response costs. We hold that Shore properly was found to be a covered person under. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a); that the nonlisting by the Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the site on the National Priorities List (\u201cNPL\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9605(8)(B), is irrelevant to Shore\u2019s liability; that Shore cannot rely on any of CERCLA\u2019s affirmative defenses; but that, as suggested in the amicus brief filed for the United States and the district court\u2019s supplemental memorandum, injunctive relief under CERCLA is not available to the State. We nevertheless hold that the district court, exercising its pendent jurisdiction, properly granted the permanent injunction based on New York public nuisance law. Moreover, we hold LeoGrande jointly and severally liable under both CERCLA and New York law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-14\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-15\">Some of the most heated arguments on this appeal involve whether certain materi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>al facts are undisputed. After careful scrutiny of the record and the district court's supplemental memorandum, we base our decision on the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">LeoGrande incorporated Shore solely for the purpose of purchasing the Shore Road property. All corporate decisions and actions were made, directed, and controlled by him. By contract dated July 14, 1983, Shore agreed to purchase the 3.2 acre site, a small peninsula surrounded on three sides by the waters of Hempstead Harbor and Mott Cove, for condominium development. Five large tanks in a field in the center of the site hold most of some 700,-000 gallons of hazardous chemicals located there, though there are six smaller tanks both above and below ground containing hazardous waste, as well as some empty tanks, on the property. The tanks are connected by pipe to a tank truck loading rack and dockage facilities for loading by barge. Four roll-on/roll-off containers and one tank truck trailer hold additional waste. And before June 15, 1984, one of the two dilapidated masonry warehouses on the site contained over 400 drums of chemicals and contaminated solids, many of which were corroded and leaking.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1108-5\">It is beyond dispute that the tanks and drums contain \u201chazardous substances\u201d within the meaning of CERCLA. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601(14). The substances involved \u2014 including benzene, dichlorobenzenes, ethyl benzene, tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, 1,1,1-trichloroethene, chlordane, poly-chlorinated biphenyls (commonly known as PCBs), and bis (2-ethyIhexyl) phthalate\u2014 are toxic, in some cases carcinogenic, and dangerous by way of contact, inhalation, or ingestion. These substances are present at the site in various combinations, some of which may cause the toxic effect to be synergistic.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-9\">The purchase agreement provided that it could be voided by Shore without penalty if after conducting an environmental study Shore had decided not to proceed. LeoGrande was fully aware that the tenants, Applied Environmental Services, Inc., and Hazardous Waste Disposal, Inc., were then operating \u2014 illegally, it may be noted \u2014 a hazardous waste storage facility on the site. Shore\u2019s environmental consultant, WTM Management Corporation (\u201cWTM\u201d), prepared a detailed report in July, 1983, incorporated in the record and relied on by the district court for its findings. The report concluded that over the past several decades \u201cthe facility ha[d] received little if any preventive maintenance, the tanks (above ground and below ground), pipeline, loading rack, fire extinguishing system, and warehouse have deteriorated.\u201d WTM found that there had been several spills of hazardous waste at\u2019 the site, including at least one large spill in 1978. Though there had been some attempts at cleanup, the WTM testing revealed that hazardous substances, such as benzene, were still leaching into the groundwater and the waters of the bay immediately adjacent to the bulkhead abutting Hempstead Harbor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After a site visit on July 18, 1983, WTM reported firsthand on the sorry state of the facility, observing, among other things, \u201cseepage from the bulkhead,\u201d \u201ccorrosion\u201d on all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>tanks, signs of possible leakage from some of the tanks, deterioration of the pipeline and loading rack, and fifty to one hundred fifty-five gallon drums containing contaminated earth in one of the warehouses. The report concluded that if the current tenants \u201cclose up the operation and leave the material at the site,\u201d the owners would be left with a \u201cpotential, time bomb.\u201d WTM estimated that the cost of environmental cleanup and monitoring would range from $650,-000 to over $1 million before development could begin. After receiving this report Shore sought a waiver from the State Department of Environmental Conservation (\u201cDEC\u201d) of liability as landowners for the disposal of the hazardous waste stored at the site. Although the DEC denied the waiver, Shore took title on October 13, 1983, and obtained certain rights over against the tenants, whom it subsequently evicted on January 5, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">Nevertheless, between October 13, 1983, and January 5, 1984, nearly 90,000 gallons of hazardous chemicals were added to the tanks. And during a state inspection on January 3, 1984, it became evident that the deteriorating and leaking drums of chemicals referred to above had also been brought onto the site. Needless to say, the tenants did not clean up the site before they left. Thus, conditions when Shore employees first entered the site were as bad as or worse than those described in the WTM report. As LeoGrande admitted by affidavit, \u201cthe various storage tanks, pipe lines and connections between these storage facilities were in a bad state of repair.\u201d While Shore claims to have made some improvements, such as sealing all the pipes and valves and continuing the cleanup of the damage from earlier spills, Shore did nothing about the hundreds of thousands of gallons of hazardous waste standing in deteriorating tanks. In addition, although a growing number of drums were leaking hazardous substances, Shore essentially ignored the problem until June, 1984. <em>See supra </em>note 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-8\">On September 19, 1984, a DEC inspector observed one of the large tanks, which held over 300,000 gallons of hazardous materials, with rusting floor plates and tank walls, a pinhole leak, and a four-foot line of corrosion along one of the weld lines. On three other tanks, flakes of corroded metal \u201cup to the size and thickness of a dime\u201d were visible at the floorplate level.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While defendants now claim that the large tank was not leaking, their denial is untimely; they did not formally dispute the fact before the district court rendered its October 15, \u2022 1984, order. Moreover, defendants\u2019 claim that the pinhole has been patched hardly makes the existence of the pinhole leak a triable issue of fact. In addition, defendants do not contest that Shore employees lack the knowledge to maintain safely the quantity of hazardous chemicals on the site. And, because LeoGrande has no intention of operating a hazardous waste storage facility, Shore has not and will not apply for a permit to do so. Nor do defendants cont\u00e9st that the State incurred certain costs in assessing the conditions at the site and supervising the removal of the drums of hazardous waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-9\">Cercla</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-10\">CERCLA\u2019s history reveals as much about the nature of the legislative process as about the nature of the legislation. In 1980, while the Senate considered one early version of CERCLA, the House considered and passed another. <em>See </em>H.R. 7020, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. (1980), <em>reprinted in 2 Legislative History of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (Superfund) </em>391-463 (Comm.Print 1983) [hereinafter cit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>ed as <em>CERCLA Legislative History </em>]; <em>see also </em>126 Cong.Rec. 26,757-99 (1980) (debate and passage of H.R. 7020), <em>reprinted in </em>2 <em>CERCLA Legislative History, supra, </em>at 294-389. The version passed by both Houses, however, was an eleventh hour compromise put together primarily by Senate leaders and sponsors of the earlier Senate version. Unfortunately, we are without the benefit of committee reports concerning this compromise. <em>But see infra </em>note 12. Nevertheless, the evolution of the legislation provides useful guidance to Congress\u2019s intentions. The compromise contains many provisions closely resembling those from earlier versions of the legislation, and the House and Senate sponsors sought to articulate the differences between the compromise and earlier versions. One of the sponsors claimed that the version passed \u201cembodie[d] those features of the Senate and House bills where there has been positive consensus\u201d while \u201celiminat[ing] those provisions which were controversial.\u201d 126 Cong.Rec. 30,932 (statement of Sen. Randolph), <em>reprinted in </em>1 <em>CERCLA Legislative History, supra, </em>at 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-8\">As explained in F. Anderson, D. Mandelker, &amp; A. Tarlock, <em>Environmental Protection: Law and Policy </em>568 (1984), CERCLA was designed \u201cto bring order to the array of partly redundant, partly inadequate federal hazardous substances cleanup and compensation laws.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It applies \u201cprimarily to the cleanup of leaking inactive or abandoned sites and to emergency responses to spills.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And it distinguishes between two kinds of response: remedial actions \u2014 generally long-term or permanent containment or disposal programs <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u2014 and removal efforts \u2014 typically short-term cleanup arrangements.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>CERCLA authorizes the federal government to respond in several ways. EPA can use Superfund resources to clean up hazardous waste sites and spills. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9611.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The National Contingency Plan (\u201cNCP\u201d), prepared by EPA pursuant to CERCLA, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 9605, governs cleanup efforts by \u201cestablish[ing] procedures and standards for responding to releases of hazardous substances.\u201d At the same time, EPA can sue for reimbursement of cleanup costs from any responsible parties it can locate, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 9607, allowing the federal government to respond immediately while later trying to shift financial responsibility to others. Thus, Superfund covers cleanup costs if the site has been abandoned, if the responsible parties elude detection, or if private resources are inadequate. <em>See </em>F. Anderson, D. Mandelker, &amp; A. Tarlock, <em>supra, </em>at 573. In addition, CERCIA authorizes EPA to seek an injunction in federal district court to force a responsible party to clean up any site or spill that presents an imminent and substantial danger to public health or welfare or the environment. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9606(a). In sum, CERCLA is not a regulatory standard-setting statute such as the Clean Air Act. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 7401-7642. Rather, the government generally undertakes pollution abatement, and polluters pay for such abatement through tax and reimbursement liability. <em>See </em>F. Anderson, D. Mandelker, &amp; A. Tarlock, <em>supra, </em>at 569.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1111-10\">Congress clearly did not intend, however, to leave clean up under CERCLA solely in the hands of the federal government. A state or political subdivision may enter into a contract or cooperative agreement with EPA, whereby both may take action on a cost-sharing basis. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9604(c), (d). And states, like EPA, can sue responsible parties for remedial and removal costs if such efforts are \u201cnot inconsistent with\u201d the NCP. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 9607(a)(4)(A). While CERCLA expressly does not preempt state law, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 9614(a), it precludes \u201crecovering compensation for the same removal costs or damages or claims\u201d under both CERCLA and state or other federal laws, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 9614(b), and prohibits states from requiring contributions to any fund \u201cthe purpose of which is to pay compensation for claims ... which may be compensated under\u201d CERCLA, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 9614(c).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, \u201cany ... person\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>who is acting consistently with the requirements of the NCP may recover \u201cnecessary costs of response.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 9607(a)(4)(B); <em>see also City of Philadelphia v. Stepan Chemical Co., </em>544 F.Supp. 1135, 1142-43 (D.C.E. D.Pa.1982) (allowing a landowner to maintain a CERCLA action against a hazardous waste generator under section 9607(a)(4)(B)). Finally, responsible parties are liable for \u201cdamages for injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources, including the reasonable costs of assessing such injury, destruction, or loss resulting from such a release.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a)(4)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">Congress intended that responsible parties be held strictly liable, even though an explicit provision for strict liability was not included in the compromise. Section 9601(32) provides that \u201cliability\u201d under CERCLA \u201cshall be construed to be the standard of liability\u201d under section 311 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1321, which courts have held to be strict liability, <em>see, e.g., Steuart Transportation Co. v. Allied Towing Corp., </em>596 F.2d 609, 613 (4th Cir.1979), and which Congress understood to impose such liability, <em>see </em>S.Rep. No. 848, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 34 (1980) [hereinafter cited as Senate Report], <em>reprinted in </em>1 <em>CERCLA Legislative History, supra, </em>at 308, 341.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Moreover, the sponsors of the compromise expressly stated that section 9607 provides for strict liability.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See </em>126 Cong.Rec. 30,932 (statement of Sen. Randolph), <em>reprinted in </em>1 <em>CERCLA Legislative History, supra, </em>at 685; <em>id. </em>at 31,964 (statement of Rep. Florio), <em>reprinted in </em>1 <em>CERCLA Legislative History, supra, </em>at 777; <em>see also id. </em>at 31,966 (Department of Justice view of Senate compromise discussing strict liability), <em>reprinted in </em>1 <em>CERCLA Legislative History, supra, </em>at 780-81. Strict liability under CERCLA, however, is not absolute; there are defenses for causation solely by an act of God, an act of war, or acts or omissions of a third party other than an employee or agent of the defendant or one whose act or omission occurs in connection with a contractual relationship with the defendant. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-10\">A. <em>Liability for Response Costs Under CERCLA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1112-11\">We hold that the district court properly awarded the State response costs under section 9607(a)(4)(A).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>costs in assessing the conditions of the site and supervising the removal of the drums of hazardous waste squarely fall within CERCLA\u2019s definition of response costs, even though the State is not undertaking to do the removal. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 9601(23), (24), (25). Contrary to Shore\u2019s claims, the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment sought such costs, and Shore had ample opportunity for discovery. That a detailed accounting was submitted only at this court\u2019s request for supplemental findings is immaterial; Shore had an opportunity to contest the accounting but failed to make anything more than a perfunctory objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">1. <em>Covered Persons. </em>CERCLA holds liable four classes of persons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1113-6\">(1) the owner and operator of a vessel (otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the United States) or a facility/<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1113-7\">(2) any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1113-8\">(3) any person who by contract, agreement, or otherwise arranged for disposal or treatment, or arranged with a transporter for transport for disposal or treatment, of hazardous substances owned or possessed by such person, by any other party or entity, at any facility owned or operated by another party or entity and containing such hazardous substances, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1113-13\">(4) any person who accepts or accepted any hazardous substances for transport to disposal or treatment facilities or sites selected by such person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1113-14\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a). As noted above, section 9607 makes these persons liable, if \u201cthere is a release, or a threatened release which causes the incurrence of response costs, of a hazardous substance\u201d from the facility,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> for, among other things, \u201call costs of removal or remedial action incurred by the United States Government or a State not inconsistent with the national contingency plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-15\">Shore argues that it is not covered by section 9607(a)(1) because it neither owned the site at the time of disposal nor caused the presence or the release of the hazardous waste at the facility. While section 9607(a)(1) appears to cover Shore, Shore attempts to infuse ambiguity into the statutory scheme, claiming that section 9607(a)(1) could not have been intended to include all owners, because the word \u201cowned\u201d in section 9607(a)(2) would be unnecessary since an owner \u201cat the time of disposal\u201d would necessarily be included in section 9607(a)(1). Shore claims that Congress intended that the scope of section 9607(a)(1) be no greater than that of section 9607(a)(2) and that both should be limited by the \u201cat the time of disposal\u201d language. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>By extension, Shore argues that both provisions should be interpreted as requiring a showing of causation. We agree with the State, however, that section 9607(a)(1) unequivocally imposes strict liability on the current owner of a facility from which there is a release or threat of release, without regard to causation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1114-4\">Shore\u2019s claims of ambiguity are illusory; section 9607(a)\u2019s structure is clear. Congress intended to cover different classes of persons differently. Section 9607(a)(1) applies to all current owners and operators, while section 9607(a)(2) primarily covers prior owners and operators. Moreover, section 9607(a)(2)\u2019s scope is more limited than that of section 9607(a)(1). Prior owners and operators are liable only if they owned or operated the facility \u201cat the time of disposal of any hazardous substance\u201d; this limitation does not apply to current owners, like Shore. Thus, Shore\u2019s reliance on the holding of the district court in <em>Cadillac Fairview/California, Inc. v. Dow Chemical Co., </em>14 Envtl.L.Rep. (Envtl.L. Inst.) 20,376 (C.D.Cal. Mar. 5,1984), is inappropriate The <em>Cadillac Fairview </em>court was concerned with a prior owner and predicated its holding solely upon the words of section 9607(a)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 20,378.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-5\">Shore\u2019s causation argument is also at odds with the structure of the statute. Interpreting section 9607(a)(1) as including a causation requirement makes superfluous the affirmative defenses provided in section 9607(b), each of which carves out from liability an exception based on causation. Without a clear congressional command otherwise, we will not construe a statute in any way that makes some of its provisions surplusage. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Mehrmanesh, </em>689 F.2d 822, 829 (9th Cir.1982); <em>National Insulation Transportation Committee v. ICC, </em>683 F.2d 533, 537 (D.C.Cir.1982).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Moreover, Shore again improperly relies on <em>Cadillac Fairview. </em>There, the court did not interpret section 9607(a) to require causation, as defendants claim, but simply ownership \u201cat the time of disposal.\u201d 14 Envtl.L.Rep. (Envtl.L.Inst.) at 20,378. Several other district courts explicitly have declined to read a causation requirement into section 9607(a). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Cauffman, </em>No. CY 83-6318-KN(Bx), slip op. at 2-3 (C.D.Cal. Oct. 23, 1984) (citing other cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-8\">Our interpretation draws further support from the legislative history. Congress specifically rejected including a causation requirement in section 9607(a). The early House version imposed liability only upon \u201cany person who caused or contributed to the release or threatened release.\u201d H.R. 7020, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. \u00a7 3071(a), 126 Cong.Rec. 26,779, <em>reprinted in </em>2 <em>CERCLA Legislative History, supra, </em>at 438. The compromise version, to which the House later agreed, <em>see </em>126 Cong.Rec. 31,981-82, <em>reprinted in </em>1 <em>CERCLA Legislative History, supra, </em>at 821-24, imposed liability on classes of persons without reference to whether they caused or contributed to the release or threat of release. <em>See also </em>S.1480, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. \u00a7 4(a), 126 Cong.Rec. 30,900 (Senate version of legislation changed from imposing liability on an \u201cowner or operator\u201d and \u201cany other person who caused or contributed ... to such discharge, release, or disposal\u201d to imposing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>liability on four classes of persons, the scheme adopted in the compromise version), <em>reprinted in </em>1 <em>CERCLA Legislative History, supra, </em>at 485-86. Thus, the remarks of Representatives Stockman and Gore describing the House version containing the causation language, <em>see </em>126 Cong. Rec. 26,786-87, <em>reprinted in 2 CERCLA Legislative History, supra, </em>at 359-61, on which Shore relies, are inapposite.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1115-5\">Furthermore, as the State points out, accepting Shore\u2019s arguments would open a huge loophole in CERCLA\u2019s coverage. It is quite clear that if the current owner of a site could avoid liability merely by having purchased the site after chemical dumping had ceased, waste sites certainly would be sold, following the cessation of dumping, to new owners who could avoid the liability otherwise required by CERCLA. Congress had well in mind that persons who dump or store hazardous waste sometimes cannot be located or may be deceased or judgment-proof. <em>See, e.g., </em>Senate Report, <em>supra, </em>at 16, <em>reprinted in </em>1 <em>CERCLA Legislative History, supra, </em>at 323. We will not interpret section 9607(a) in any way that apparently frustrates the statute\u2019s goals, in the absence of a specific congressional intention otherwise. <em>See Capitano v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>732 F.2d 1066, 1076 (2d Cir.1984); <em>Bartok v. Boosey &amp; Hawkes, Inc., </em>523 F.2d 941, 947 (2d Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">Finally, we need not address whether Shore is also subject to liability under section 9607(a)(2) because some 90,000 gallons of waste were disposed of, apparently by unauthorized tenants, after Shore took title on October 13, 1983. Nor need we decide whether hazardous substances have been \u201cdisposed of\u201d after Shore employees entered the property in January, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-10\">2. <em>Release or Threat of Release. </em>We reject Shore\u2019s repeated claims that it has put in dispute whether there has been a release or threat of release at the Shore Road site. The State has established that it was responding to \u201ca release, or a threatened release\u201d when it incurred its response costs. We hold that the leaking tanks and pipelines, the continuing leaching and seepage from the earlier spills, and the leaking drums all constitute \u201creleases.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601(22). Moreover, the corroding and deteriorating tanks, Shore\u2019s lack of expertise in handling hazardous waste, and even the failure to license the facility, amount to a threat of release.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-11\">In addition, Shore\u2019s suggestion that CERCLA does not impose liability for threatened releases is simply frivolous. Section 9607(a)(4)(A) imposes liability for \u201call costs, of removal or remedial action.\u201d The definitions of \u201cremoval\u201d and \u201cremedial\u201d explicitly refer to actions \u201ctaken in the event of the threat of release of hazardous substances.\u201d <em>See supra </em>notes 7, 8; <em>see also, </em>Senate Report, <em>supra, </em>at 54, <em>reprinted in </em>1 <em>CERCLA Legislative History, supra, </em>at 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-12\">3. <em>The NPL and Consistency, with the NCP. </em>Shore also argues that, because the Shore Road site is not on the NPL, the State\u2019s action is inconsistent with the NCP and thus Shore cannot be found liable under section 9607(a). This argument is not frivolous. Section 9607(a)(4)(A) states that polluters are liable for response costs \u201cnot inconsistent with the national contingency plan.\u201d And section 9605, which directs EPA to outline the NCP, includes a provision that requires EPA to publish the NPL. Nevertheless, we hold</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>that inclusion on the NPL is not a requirement for the State to recover its response costs.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">The State claims that, while NPL listing may be a requirement for the use of Superfund money, it is not a requisite to liability under section 9607. <em>See New York v. General Electric Co., </em>592 F.Supp. 291, 303-04 (N.D.N.Y.1984). The State relies on the reasoning of several district courts that have held that liability under section 9607 is independent of the scope of section 9611, which governs the expenditure of Superfund monies, and by extension, section 9604, which governs federal cleanup efforts. <em>See, e.g., id.; United States v. Northeastern Pharmaceutical &amp; Chemical Co., </em>579 F.Supp. 823, 850-51 (W.D.Mo. 1984) (\u201cNEPACCO\u201d); <em>United States v. Wade, </em>577 F.Supp. 1326, 1334-36 (E.D.Pa. 1983). These courts have reasoned that CERCLA authorizes a bifurcated approach to the problem of hazardous waste cleanup, by distinguishing between the scope of direct federal action with Superfund resources and the liability of polluters under section 9607. While implicitly accepting that Superfund monies can be spent only on sites included on the NPL, they conclude that this limitation does not apply to section 9607. And it is true that the relevant limitation on Superfund spending is that it be \u201cconsistent with\u201d the NCP, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9604(a), while under section 9607(a)(4)(A), liability is limited to response costs \u201cnot inconsistent with\u201d the NCP. This analysis, however, is not so compelling as might be; the distinction between section 9604 and section 9607 blurs for two reasons. First, as we noted above, Congress envisioned section 9607 as a means of reimbursement of monies spent by government on cleanup pursuant to section 9604. The money that the federal government presumably would be spending is Superfund money. That is to say, Congress may have seen section 9607 as equal in scope to sections 9604 and 9611. Second, it is difficult to accept the State\u2019s argument that section 9607\u2019s statement \u201c[njotwithstanding any other provision or rule of law\u201d supports the distinction. Shore\u2019s argument is not based on implying limitations on the scope of section 9604 into section 9607 but on an interpretation of \u201cnot inconsistent with\u201d the NCP under section 9607 itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-7\">Still, we reject Shore\u2019s argument. Instead of distinguishing between the scope of section 9607 and the scope of section 9604, we hold that NPL listing is not a general requirement under the NCP. We see the NPL as a limitation on remedial, or long-term, actions \u2014 as opposed to removal, or short-term, actions \u2014 particularly federally funded remedial actions. The provisions requiring the establishment of NPL criteria and listing appear to limit their own application to remedial actions. Section 9605(8)(A) requires EPA to include in the NCP \u201ccriteria for determining priorities among releases or threatened releases ... for the purpose of taking remedial action and, to the extent practicable taking into account the potential urgency of such action, for the purpose of taking removal action.\u201d And section 9605(8)(B), which requires EPA to draw up the NPL, refers to \u201cpriorities for remedial action.\u201d <em>Accord </em>126 Cong.Rec. 30,933 (statement of Sen. Randolph), <em>reprinted in </em>1 <em>CERCLA Legislative History, supra, </em>at 689; 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.68(a) (1984). And section 9604, which authorizes and governs federal response actions, reveals the special role of the NPL for federally sponsored remedial actions. Section 9604(c)(3) states that federal remedial actions can be taken only if \u201cthe State in which the release occurs first enters into a contract or cooperative agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>ment\u201d with the federal government, thus setting up a joint federal-state cost-sharing and cleanup effort. At the same time, section 9604(d)(1) states that such joint efforts must be taken \u201cin accordance with criteria and priorities established pursuant to section 9605(8)\u201d \u2014 the NPL provision. If the NPL criteria and listing were a general requirement for action \u201cconsistent with\u201d the NCP, this language would be surplus-age. <em>See supra </em>text accompanying note 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">CERCLA\u2019s legislative history also supports our conclusion. Congress did not intend listing on the NPL to be a requisite to all response actions. Neither the earlier House nor Senate version included the NPL in the NCP, <em>see </em>S.1480, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. \u00a7\u00a7 3(c)(5), 6(a)(2)(B), 126 Cong.Rec. 30,908, 30,913, <em>reprinted in </em>1 <em>CERCLA Legislative History, supra, </em>at 482-84, 529-30; H.R.7020, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. \u00a7\u00a7 3032(b), 3042, 126 Cong.Rec. 26,775, 26,-777, <em>reprinted in </em>2 <em>CERCLA Legislative History, supra, </em>at 404, 420-23, although the Senate version limited joint federal-state responses to sites on the NPL, <em>see </em>S.1480, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. \u00a7 6(a)(2)(B), 126 Cong.Rec. 30,913, <em>reprinted in </em>1 <em>CERCLA Legislative History, supra, </em>at 529-30; <em>see also </em>Senate Report, <em>supra, </em>at 60 (\u201cTo receive reimbursement from the Fund, [joint federal-state] response actions may be undertaken only at facilities or sites which are in accordance with the national priority list____\u201d), <em>reprinted in </em>1. <em>CERCLA Legislative History, supra, </em>at 367. It is also instructive to note that the Senate Report described the NPL as serving \u201cprimarily informational purposes, identifying for the States and the public those facilities and sites or other releases which appear to warrant <em>remedial actions.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). In reviewing the changes made by the compromise, no- one mentioned that NPL listing would be a requirement for removal action or even a general requirement under the NCP.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-9\">Moreover, limiting the scope of NPL listing as a requirement for response action is consistent with the purpose of CERCLA. The NPL is a relatively short list when compared with the huge number of hazardous waste facilities Congress sought to clean up. <em>See </em>126 Cong.Rec. 30,931 (statement of Sen. Randolph), <em>reprinted in </em>1 <em>CERCLA Legislative History, supra, </em>at 683-84; <em>id. </em>at 31,964 (statement of Rep. Florio), <em>reprinted in </em>1 <em>CERCLA Legislative History, supra, </em>at 776. And it makes sense for the federal government to limit only those long-term\u2014 remedial \u2014 efforts that are federally funded. We hold that Congress intended that, while federally funded remedial efforts be focused solely on those sites on the NPL, states have more flexibility when acting on their own. <em>See Pinole Point Properties, Inc. v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>596 F.Supp. 283, 290 (N.D.Cal.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-10\">Finally, we reject Shore\u2019s argument that the State\u2019s response costs are not recoverable because the State has failed to comply with the NCP by not obtaining EPA authorization, nor making a firm commitment to provide further funding for remedial implementation nor submitting an estimate of costs. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.62 (1984) (describing the states\u2019 role in joint federal-state response actions). EPA designed the regulatory scheme \u2014 the NCP \u2014 focusing on federal and joint federal-state efforts. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>\u00a7 300.6 (defining \u201clead agency\u201d). Shore apparently is arguing that EPA has ruled that the State cannot act on its own and seek liability under CERCLA. We disagree. Congress envisioned states\u2019 using their own resources for cleanup and recovering those costs from polluters under section 9607(a)(4)(A). We read section 9607(a) (4)(A)\u2019s requirement of consistency with the NCP to mean that states cannot recover costs inconsistent with the response methods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>outlined in the NCP.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Cf. </em>126 Cong.Rec. 30,933 (statement of Sen. Randolph) (suggesting that the primary purpose of the NCP was \u201cguidance on cost-effectiveness\u201d), <em>reprinted in </em>1 <em>CERCLA Legislative History, supra, </em>at 689. Moreover, the NCP itself recognizes a role for states in compelling \u201cpotentially responsible parties\u201d to undertake response actions independent of EPA and without seeking reimbursement from Superfund. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.24(c);<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>accord </em>47 Fed.Reg. 31,195 (1982). Thus, the NCP\u2019s requirements concerning collaboration in a joint federal-state cleanup effort are inapplicable where the State is acting on its own. <em>Cf Pinole Point, </em>596 F.Supp. at 289-90 (holding that supervision by EPA is not a requisite for an action under section 9607(a)(4)(B)). <em>But cf. Artesian Water Co. v. New Castle County, </em>No. 83-854-WKS, slip op. at 19-30 (D.Del. Feb. 14, 1985) (distinguishing between remedial and removal costs and holding that the NCP validly requires governmental approval of remedial actions by private parties seeking recovery under section 9607(a)(4)(B)); <em>Wickland Oil Terminals v. Asarco, Inc., </em>590 F.Supp. 72, 77-78 (N.D.Cal.1984) (holding that response costs by private party under section 9607(a)(4)(B) cannot be recovered absent supervision by EPA or by a state agency that has entered into a cooperative agreement under section 9604(d), pursuant to the NCP as promulgated by EPA, without distinguishing between remedial and removal actions); <em>Bulk Distribution Centers, Inc. v. Monsanto Co., </em>589 F.Supp. 1437, 1446-48 (S.D.Fla.1984) (same). Indeed, the kind of action taken here is precisely that envisioned by the regulations. <em>See supra </em>note 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-6\">4. <em>Affirmative defense. </em>Shore also claims that it can assert an affirmative defense under CERCLA, which provides a limited exception to liability for a release or threat of release caused solely by</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1118-7\">an act or omission of a third party other than an employee or agent of the defendant, or than one whose act or omission occurs in connection with a contractual relationship, existing directly or indirectly, with the defendant (except where the sole contractual arrangement arises from a published tariff and acceptance for carriage by a common carrier by rail), if the defendant establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that (a) he exercised due care with respect to the hazardous substance concerned, taking into consideration the characteristics of such hazardous substance, in light of all relevant facts and circumstances, and (b) he took precautions against foreseeable acts or omissions of any such third party and the consequences that could foreseeably result from such acts or omissions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1118-8\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(b)(3). We disagree. Shore argues that it had nothing to do with the transportation of the hazardous substances and that it has exercised due care since taking control of the site. Who the \u201cthird part(ies)\u201d Shore claims were responsible is difficult to fathom. It is doubtful that a prior owner could be such, especially the prior owner here, since the acts or omissions referred to in the statute are doubtless those occurring during the ownership or operation of the defendant.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Similarly, many of the acts and omissions of the prior tenants/operators fall outside the scope of section 9607(b)(3), because they occurred before Shore owned the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>property. In addition, we find that Shore cannot rely on the affirmative defense even with respect to the tenants\u2019 conduct during the period after Shore closed on the property and when Shore evicted the tenants. Shore was aware of the nature of the tenants\u2019 activities before the closing and could readily have foreseen that they would continue to dump hazardous waste at the site. In light of this knowledge, we cannot say that the releases and threats of release resulting of these activities were \u201ccaused solely\u201d by the tenants or that Shore \u201ctook precautions against\u201d these \u201cforeseeable acts or omissions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">B. <em>Injunctive Relief Under CERCLA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1119-6\">Having held Shore liable under CERCLA for the State\u2019s response costs, we nevertheless are required to hold that injunctive relief under CERCLA is not available to the State. <em>See supra </em>note 1. Essentially, the State urges us to interpret the right of action under section 9607 broadly, claiming that \u201climiting district court relief [under section 9607] to reimbursement could have a drastic effect upon the implementation of Congress\u2019s desire that waste sites be cleaned.\u201d Conceding that section 9607 does not explicitly provide for injunctive relief, the State suggests that the court has the inherent power to grant such equitable relief, citing <em>Hecht Co. v. Bowles, </em>321 U.S. 321, 329, 64 S.Ct. 587, 591, 88 L.Ed. 754 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-7\">The statutory scheme, however, shows that Congress did not intend to authorize such relief. Section 9606 expressly authorizes EPA to seek injunctive relief to abate \u201can actual or threatened release of a hazardous substance from a facility.\u201d Implying the authority to seek injunctions under section 9607 would make the express injunctive authority granted in section 9606 surplusage. <em>See supra </em>text accompanying note 18; <em>see also Minnesota v. Northern Securities Co., </em>194 U.S. 48, 71, 24 S.Ct. 598, 604, 48 L.Ed. 870 (1904) (denying private persons a right to injunctive relief under the Sherman Act because it expressly authorized only the federal government to seek relief); <em>cf. Paine Lumber Co. v. Neal, </em>244 U.S. 459, 471, 37 S.Ct. 718, 719, 61 L.Ed. 1256 (1917) (holding that section 4 of the Clayton Act provides a right of action for damages but not injunctions); <em>Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., </em>741 F.2d 482, 489 n. 20 (2d Cir.1984) (stating that no private right to an injunction may be implied from the government\u2019s right), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 901, 83 L.Ed.2d 917 (1985). In addition, the scope of injunctive relief under section 9607 would conflict with the express scope of section 9606. The standard for seeking abatement under section 9606 is more narrow than the standard of liability under section 9607. Section 9606 authorizes injunctive relief only where EPA \u201cdetermines that there may be an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health or welfare or the environment.\u201d Section 9607 contains no such limitation. Finally, we recognize that \u201cit is an elemental canon of statutory construction that where a statute expressly provides a particular remedy or remedies, a court must be chary of reading others into it.\u201d <em>Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, </em>444 U.S. 11, 19, 100 S.Ct. 242, 247, 62 L.Ed.2d 146 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-11\">If there were any doubt about the statutory language, the legislative history would compel us to reject the State\u2019s argument. Congress specifically declined to provide states with a right to injunctive relief. The early Senate version empowered either EPA \u201cor the State\u201d to seek injunctive relief, <em>see </em>S.1480, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. \u00a7 3(d), 126 Cong.Rec. 30,908, <em>reprinted in </em>1 <em>CERCLA Legislative History, supra, </em>at 484-85, yet the compromise limited that power to EPA alone, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9606(a). Moreover, the House version, which authorized EPA to order cleanup, <em>see </em>H.R.7020, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. \u00a7 3041(a), 126 Cong.Rec. 26,775-76, <em>reprinted in </em>2 <em>CERCLA Legislative History, supra, </em>at 406-12 \u2014 rather than to seek an injunction in federal court \u2014 did not give states that authority, even though the National Association of Attorneys General urged Congress to extend the same powers to the states as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>it gave to the federal government. <em>See </em>126 Cong.Rec. 26,761-62, <em>reprinted in </em>2 <em>CERCLA Legislative History, supra, </em>at 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-4\">C. <em>Common Law of Public Nuisance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1120-5\">As a preliminary matter, we cannot accept Shore\u2019s suggestion that the district court\u2019s reliance on New York public nuisance law as an alternative basis for the injunction rested on an improper exercise of pendent jurisdiction. The district court had the power to hear the state law claims. The public nuisance claim for abatement and the CERCLA claims clearly \u201cderive from a common nucleus of operative fact\u201d and the State \u201cwould ordinarily be expected to try them all in one judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. at 725, 86 S.Ct. at 1138; <em>accord Rosario v. Amalgamated Ladies\u2019 Garment Cutters\u2019 Union, Local 10, </em>605 F.2d 1228, 1247 (2d Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 919, 100 S.Ct. 1853, 64 L.Ed.2d 273 (1980). And we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in reaching the public nuisance claim. The state law issues do not predominate \u2014 particularly if the State\u2019s argument that CERCLA grants injunctive relief is seen as we see it to be colorable<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> \u2014 there is no likelihood of confusion; and \u201cinterests of judicial economy clearly weighed in favor of trying them together.\u201d <em>Id. See generally </em>13B C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 3567.1 (1984). Moreover, it is irrelevant that the scope of relief under state law differs from that under federal law. <em>See Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. at 728, 86 S.Ct. at 1140; <em>Rosario, </em>605 F.2d at 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-8\">In challenging the decision below, Shore fails to distinguish between a public nuisance and a private nuisance. The former \u201cis an offense against the State and is subject to abatement or prosecution on application of the proper governmental agency\u201d and \u201cconsists of conduct or omissions which offend, interfere with or cause damage to the public in the exercise of rights common to all ... in a manner such as to ... endanger or injure the property, health, safety or comfort of a considerable number of persons.\u201d <em>Copart Industries, Inc. v. Consolidated Edison Co., </em>41 N.Y.2d 564, 568, 362 N.E.2d 968, 971, 394 N.Y.S.2d 169, 172 (1977) (citations omitted); <em>see also State v.

The latter, however, \u201cthreatens one person or a relatively few ..., an essential feature being an interference with the use or enjoyment of land ____ It is actionable by the individual person or persons whose rights have been disturbed.\u201d <em>Copart Industries, </em>41 N.Y.2d at 568, 362 N.E.2d at 971, 394 N.Y.S.2d at 172. Public and private nuisance bear little relationship to each other. Although some rules apply to both, other rules apply to one but not the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-11\">Under New York law, Shore, as a landowner, is subject to liability for either a public or private nuisance on its property upon learning of the nuisance and having a reasonable opportunity to abate it.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>See Pharm v. Lituchy, </em>283 N.Y. 130, 132, 27 N.E.2d 811, 812 (1940); <em>Conhocton Stone Road v.

Mobil Oil Corp., </em>99 A.D.2d 185, 188-89, 473 N.Y.S.2d 172, 174 (1984). As noted in the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 839 comment d (1979) [hereinafter cited as <em>Restatement </em>]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE6\">[Liability [of a possessor of land] is not based upon responsibility for the creation of the harmful condition, but upon the fact that he has exclusive control over the land and the things done upon it and should have the responsibility of taking reasonable measures to remedy conditions on it that are a source of harm to others.

LeoGrande knew that the hazardous waste was present without the consent of the State or its DEC, but failed to take reasonable steps to abate the condition. Moreover, Shore is liable for maintenance of a <em>public </em>nuisance irrespective of negligence or fault. <em>See McFarlane v. City of Niagara Falls, </em>247 N.Y. 340, 343,160 N.E. 391, 391-92 (1928); <em>Schenectady Chemicals, </em>117 Misc.2d at 965, 970, 459 N.Y.S.2d at 976, 979. Nor is there any requirement that the State prove actual, as opposed to threatened, harm from the nuisance in order to obtain abatement. <em>See Southern Leasing Co. v. Ludwig, </em>217 N.Y. 100, 104, 111 N.E. 470, 472 (1916); <em>City of Rochester v. Gutberlett, </em>211 N.Y. 309, 316, 105 N.E. 548, 550 (1914); <em>Wall Street Transcript Corp. v. 343 East 43rd Street Holding Corp., </em>81 A.D.2d 783, 439 N.Y.S.2d 23 (1981); <em>Buchanan v. Cardozo, </em>24 A.D.2d 620, 621, 262 N.Y.S.2d 247, 249 (1965); W. Prosser, <em>Handbook of the Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 90, at 603 (1971). Finally, the State has standing to bring suit to abate such a nuisance \u201cin its role as guardian of the environment.\u201d <em>Schenectady Chemicals, </em>117 Misc.2d at 968, 459 N.Y.S.2d at 978; <em>accord State v. Monarch Chemicals, Inc., </em>90 A.D.2d 907, 907, 456 N.Y.S.2d 867, 869 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-7\">We also reject Shore\u2019s argument that its maintenance of the Shore Road site does not constitute a public nuisance. We have no doubt that the release or threat of release of hazardous waste into the environment unreasonably infringes upon a public right and thus is a public nuisance as a matter of New York law, <em>see Schenectady Chemicals, </em>103 A.D.2d at 37, 479 N.Y. S.2d at 1013; <em>Monarch Chemicals, </em>90 A.D.2d at 907, 456 N.Y.S.2d at 868-69, particularly in light of Title 13 of Article 27 of the New York Environmental Conservation Law, <em>see Restatement </em>\u00a7 821B comment c (statutes can indicate that conduct is an \u201cunreasonable interference with a public right\u201d). Shore challenges the existence of the releases or threatened releases claimed by the State. We have found, however, that several crucial facts are undisputed: the tanks have leaked and are corroding; the groundwater has been contaminated; and Shore is unwilling and unable to transform the site into a stable, licensed storage facility. It makes no difference that Shore has begun a cleanup. We simply hold that under New York law it is required to finish that cleanup.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-8\">The district court could have also found that Shore is maintaining a public nuisance under two alternative theories. Shore\u2019s continuing violations of N.Y.Envtl. Conserv.Law \u00a7 27-0913(1) (not having a permit to store or dispose of hazardous waste), and of <em>id. </em>\u00a7 27-0914(1) (possessing hazardous waste without authorization), if not of <em>id. </em>\u00a7 27-0914(2) (disposing of hazardous waste without authorization), constitute a nuisance per se. <em>See Delaney v. Philhern Realty Holding Corp., </em>280 N.Y. 461, 465, 21 N.E.2d 507, 509 (1939); <em>Driscoll v. New York City Transit Authority, </em>53 A.D.2d 391, 395, 385 N.Y.S.2d 540, 543 (1976). And while we recognize that determining whether an activity is abnormally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>dangerous depends on the circumstances, a review of the undisputed facts under the guidelines stated in <em>Doundoulakis v. Town of Hempstead, </em>42 N.Y.2d 440, 448, 368 N.E.2d 24, 27, 398 N.Y.S.2d 401, 404 (1977), convinces us that a New York court would find as a matter of law that Shore\u2019s maintenance of the site \u2014 for example, allowing corroding tanks to hold hundreds of thousands of gallons of hazardous waste \u2014 constitutes abnormally dangerous activity and thus constitutes a public nuisance. <em>See Schenectady Chemicals, </em>103 A.D.2d at 37, 479 N.Y.S.2d at 1013; <em>see also State v. Ventron Corp., </em>94 N.J. 473, 492, 468 A.2d 150, 160 (1983) (holding that \u201csimply dumping [a hazardous substance] onto land or into water\u201d is an abnormally dangerous activity).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\">D. <em>LeoGrande\u2019s Personal Liability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">We hold LeoGrande liable as an \u201coperator\u201d under CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607, for the State\u2019s response costs. Under CERCLA \u201cowner or operator\u201d is defined to mean \u201cany person owning or operating\u201d an onshore facility, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 9601(20)(A), and \u201cperson\u201d includes individuals as well as corporations, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 9601(21). More important, the definition of \u201cowner or operator\u201d excludes \u201ca person, who, without participating in the management of a ... facility, holds indicia of ownership primarily to protect his security interest in the facility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 9601(20)(A). The use of this exception implies that an owning stockholder who manages the corporation, such as LeoGrande, is liable under CERCLA as an \u201cowner or operator.\u201d That conclusion is consistent with that of other courts that have addressed the issue. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Carolawn Co., </em>14 Envtl.L.Rep. (Envtl.L.Inst.) 20,699, 20,-700 (D.S.C. June 15,1984); <em>NEPACCO, </em>579 F.Supp. at 847-48. In any event, LeoGrande is in charge of the operation of the facility in question, and as such is an \u201coperator\u201d within the meaning of CERCLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-7\">Turning to liability for abatement, it is debatable whether a New York court would hold LeoGrande personally liable by piercing the corporate veil. New York courts disregard the corporate form \u201creluctantly,\u201d <em>see Gartner v. Snyder, </em>607 F.2d 582, 586 (2d Cir.1979), and while the State claims that LeoGrande dominated Shore and that Shore was undercapitalized, these allegations are probably insufficiently particularized. <em>See Walkovszky v. Carlton, </em>18 N.Y.2d 414, 420, 223 N.E.2d 6, 10, 276 N.Y.S.2d 585, 590 (1966). Both the New York Court of Appeals and this court have been quite insistent that the corporate form will not be disregarded unless the opposing party shows that the corporate form is being used fraudulently or as a means of carrying on business for personal rather than corporate ends. <em>See Marine Midland Bank, N.A. v. Miller, </em>664 F.2d 899, 903 (2d Cir.1981); <em>Walkovszky, </em>18 N.Y.2d at 418, 420, 223 N.E.2d at 8, 10, 276 N.Y.S.2d at 588-90. The State\u2019s claim has not at this stage risen to that level.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-8\">Nevertheless, we hold LeoGrande liable for the abatement of the nuisance without piercing the corporate veil. New York courts have held that a corporate officer who controls corporate conduct and thus is an active individual participant in that conduct is liable for the torts of the corporation. <em>See State v. Ole Olsen, Ltd., </em>35 N.Y.2d 979, 324 N.E.2d 886, 365 N.Y. S.2d 528 (1975); <em>LaLumia v. Schwartz, </em>23 A.D.2d 668, 669, 257 N.Y.S.2d 348, 350 (1965). We need not address whether he is liable merely as an officer of Shore, for it is beyond dispute that LeoGrande specifically directs, sanctions, and actively participates in Shore\u2019s maintenance of the nuisance. <em>See also Escude Cruz v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., </em>619 F.2d 902, 907 (1st Cir.1980) (citing federal cases pronouncing this rule of liability for corporate officers). This general rule is particularly appropriate in the public nuisance context <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>where \u201c \u2018everyone who ... participates in the ... maintenance ... of a nuisance are liable jointly and severally.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schenectady Chemicals, </em>117 Misc.2d at 966, 459 N.Y. S.2d at 976 (quoting 17 Carmody-Wait 2d <em>Actions for Waste, Nuisance and Trespass </em>\u00a7 107:59, at 334 (1979); <em>accord Caso v.

The injunctive remedy is an equitable one; that abatement expenses may become prohibitive and disproportionate therefore may be taken into consideration. <em>See Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 839 comment f; <em>id. </em>\u00a7 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-5\">Appellants\u2019 application for a stay pending appeal which we have held in abeyance has been dealt with in connection with their appeal, Docket No. 85-7241, from an order of contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1107-10\">.

Hereinafter we use EPA to refer to any kind of executive authority under CERCLA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1108-6\">. When these drums concededly were \"bursting and leaking,\" Shore employees asked the State to enter the site, inspect it, and take steps to mitigate the \"life-threatening crisis situation.\" Pursuant to stipulation and order entered on June 15, 1984, Shore began removing the drums. Some may still remain at the site.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1108-7\">. Defendants now assert that there are triable issues of fact whether there was groundwater contamination, contamination in the harbor water near the bulkhead, or public toxicological risk associated with the chemicals in the soil or at the bulkhead. But Shore\u2019s own testing by WTM in August, 1984, shows significant concentrations of benzene, toluene, and xylene in the groundwater. And WTM's conclusion that there was no threat to drinking supplies was based on the observation that the groundwater flowed toward the harbor. Even assuming WTM\u2019s claim to be true, there was nevertheless groundwater contamination. Such a release poses a potential threat, it may be supposed, to local Long Island aquifers, a threat that defendants themselves brought to the attention of the bankruptcy court in seeking to evict the previous tenants. Moreover, defendants concede in their statement filed pursuant to Local Rule 3(g) that chemicals were leaching from the bulkhead into the harbor, at least in \"trace quantities.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1109-6\">. This testimony about leakage together with the unchallenged corrosion of several tanks certainly permitted the district court to disregard the conclusion of defendant\u2019s expert based primarily on 1980 ultrasonic tests that the tanks were safe. In addition, as noted above, WTM\u2019s report to defendants before purchase had pointed out, in July of 1983: \u201cThe tanks in the tank area on the hill demonstrated the greatest lack of maintenance. Upon inspection corrosion and lack of paint [were] obvious on both tanks that were in service and on those that were out of service.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">.

Title 13 of the Environmental Conservation Law, N.Y.Envtl.Conserv.Law \u00a7\u00a7 27-1301 to 27-1321 (McKinney 1984), represents the State\u2019s effort to fund and implement a program for cleaning up inactive hazardous waste disposal sites. Under Title 13, a state superfund management board administers the state fund, created by N.Y.State Fin.Law \u00a7 97-b (McKinney Supp. 1984), known as the hazardous waste remedial fund. The state fund, paid for by assessments on a hazardous waste generators pursuant to N.Y.Envtl.Conserv.Law \u00a7 27-0923, is available for cleanup and remedial programs pursuant to <em>id. </em>\u00a7 27-1313, but may not reimburse for costs covered by CERCLA, <em>see </em>Weinberg, <em>Practice Commentary, </em>following N.Y.Envtl.Conserv.Law \u00a7 27-1301.

Both the earlier House and Senate versions contained language providing for strict, joint and several liability. <em>See </em>S.1480, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. \u00a7 4(a), 126 Cong.Rec. 30,908, <em>reprinted in </em>1 <em>CERCLA Legislative History, supra, </em>at 486; H.R. 7020, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. \u00a7 3071(a)(1)(D), 126 Cong.Rec. 26,779, <em>reprinted in </em>2 <em>CERCLA Legislative History, supra, </em>at 438-39.

Randolph), <em>reprinted in </em>1 <em>CERCLA Legislative History, supra, </em>at 685. Moreover, while we need not address the question, commentators have noted that joint and several liability is consistent with the contribution language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(e)(2). <em>See </em>F. Anderson, D. Mandelker, &amp; A. Tarlock, <em>supra, </em>at 576.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1112-13\">. We pause to note that, while the district court order granting the State response costs under CERCLA is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory order, it is appropriate to review the order based on pendent appellate jurisdiction. The response cost issues surely \"are related to the primary appealable\u201d injunction issues, <em>Sweater Bee by Banff, Ltd. v. Manhattan Industries, Inc., </em>754 F.2d 457, 466 (2d Cir.1985), and \"review of the appealable order will involve consideration of factors relevant to the otherwise nonappealable order,\u201d <em>General Motors Corp. v.

Schenectady Chemicals Co., </em>103 A.D.2d 33, 37, 479 N.Y. S.2d 1010, 1014 (1984).

The phrase \"from which there is a release, or a threatened release which causes the incurrence of response costs, of a hazardous substance\u201d is incorporated in and seems to flow as if it were a part only of subparagraph (4), but it is quite apparent that it also modifies subparagraphs (1) \u2014 (3) inclusive. When the Senate\u2019s compromise bill was printed in the Congressional Record at the start of the debate, 126 Cong. Rec. 30,916-30, the predecessor of \u00a7 9607, <em>id. </em>at 30,921, followed the printing format of the Senate version as reported at <em>id. </em>at 30,908; <em>see also </em>1 <em>CERCLA Legislative History, supra, </em>at 486; in each case subparagraph (4) ended with the words \"selected by such person,\u201d and the com\u2022mencing clause \"from which there is a release\u201d was printed as a new line, supporting the reading we give it above. The latter clause evidently slipped into subparagraph (4), as sometimes happens in the waning days of a session, when the entire Senate compromise was reprinted pri- or to the final vote. 126 Cong.Rec. 30,961; <em>see also </em>1 <em>CERCLA Legislative History, supra, </em>at 602-03. The change thus appears to have been simply a printer's error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1114-6\">. We pause to note the distinction between whether \u00a7 9607(a) imposes strict liability and whether it requires a showing of causation. That is to say, finding that \u00a7 9607(a) imposes strict liability does not rebut Shore's causation argument. Traditional tort law has often imposed strict liability while recognizing a causation defense. <em>See </em>W. Prosser, <em>Handbook of the Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 79, at 517 (1971); <em>see also supra </em>note 13 and accompanying text (discussing strict liability).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1114-9\">. The phrase \u201cfrom which there is a release, or a threatened release which causes the incurrence of response costs, of a hazardous substance\u201d also limits the scope of \u00a7 9607(a)(1). <em>See supra </em>note 16. It is, however, clumsy grammatically, and ambiguous since the absence of a comma after the words \"threatened release\u201d and the use of the words \"which causes,\u201d as opposed to \"that causes,\u201d leave it uncertain whether there is liability from a release without the incurrence of \u201cresponse costs.\" Since response costs were incurred here, the ambiguity is academic for our purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1115-7\">. Indeed, an opponent of the bill, Representative Broyhill, argued that one of the defects of the bill was that the owner of a facility could be held \"strictly liable ... entirely on the basis of having been found to be an owner____ There is no language requiring any causal conviction <em>[sic: </em>connection] with a release of a hazardous substance.\u201d 126 Cong.Rec. 31,969 (1980), <em>reprinted in </em>1 <em>CERCLA Legislative History, supra, </em>at 786.

Shore also argues that the NPL's exclusion of the Shore Road site deprived the district court of \"subject matter jurisdiction\" under \u00a7 9607.

In light of our holding, we do not address whether \u00a7 9607 states jurisdictional requirements, <em>cf. </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9613(b) (providing for exclusive jurisdiction over all controversies arising out of this chapter in the district courts), or whether pendent jurisdiction would lie even if inclusion on the NPL were a requirement for recovery under \u00a7 9607(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1117-8\">. Shore does not argue that the State\u2019s costs are \"inconsistent with\u201d the cost-effective response methods outlined in the NCP. In any event, it appears that the State\u2019s costs in fact are consistent with those response methods. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.65(b) (immediate removal actions); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number><em>id. </em>\u00a7 300.66(c) (inspections and testing for removal actions); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 300.68(f) (sampling and monitoring for remedial actions); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 300.71 (worker protection and compliance with \"[safety] requirements deemed necessary by the lead agency\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1118-5\">. Section 300.24(c) provides: \"States are encouraged to use State authorities to compel potentially responsible parties to undertake response actions, or to themselves undertake response actions which are not eligible for Federal funding.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1118-10\">. While we need not reach the issue, Shore appears to have a contractual relationship with the previous owners that also blocks the defense. The purchase agreement includes a provision by which Shore assumed at least some of the environmental liability of the previous owners.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1120-6\">. We need not decide whether in the future a state\u2019s claim for response costs under CERCLA will be sufficient to support the exercise of pendent jurisdiction to seek injunctive relief. <em>See generally People v. 11 Cornwell Co., </em>695 F.2d 34, 40 (2d Cir.1982), <em>vacated in part on other grounds and remanded, </em>718 F.2d 22 (2d Cir. 1983) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1120-7\">. We cannot agree with Shore's claim that the trend toward limiting the liability of successor landowners for the cost of abating a nuisance supports reversal. <em>See Apportionment of Damages and Landowner Liability in Hazardous Waste Cases, </em>12 Envtl.L.Rep. (Envtl.L.Inst.) 30,-031, 30,034 (1982). The trend toward limited liability clearly does not extend to successor owners who knew about the condition of the land before purchasing it. <em>See id. </em>In any event, Shore provides no evidence that the New York courts have recognized or would recognize the \"trend.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b1122-6\">. Neither of the parties cites any New York law concerning the permissible scope of an abatement order. Nevertheless, we presume that a New York court would order removal and cleanup here where the owner and operator concede that they do not intend to make the site into a safe facility.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
