We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-16\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b770-17\">Redd pleaded guilty on April 19, 1982 to one count of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(h)(1) (1982), which prohibits felons from receiving firearms in interstate commerce. The district court suspended imposition of his sentence, and placed him on five years probation subject to various conditions, including residence and participation in a community drug treatment center. Four days later, on April 23, 1982, the district court modified these conditions and permitted Redd to leave the treatment center from April 24, 1982 to May 9, 1982 during the hours of 7:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M., in order to locate his children and place them in an appropriate living situation. On the next day, April 24,1982, Redd violated the treatment center\u2019s rules by consuming alcohol while on leave: a breath intoxilyzer test administered that day revealed that he was \u201cintoxicated\u201d as defined under California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-19\">As a result, on April 29,1982, the district court rescinded its order granting Redd permission to leave the treatment center. On June 1, 1982, following an evidentiary hearing, the district court found Redd to have violated the terms and conditions of his probation, and sentenced him to three years imprisonment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205(a) (1982). This court affirmed the district court\u2019s revocation of Redd\u2019s probation in an unpublished decision on December 16, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-20\">Redd and his attorney then raised two separate challenges to his probation revocation. On January 31, 1983, Redd filed a pro se motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. On June 13, 1983, Redd\u2019s attorney filed motions under Fed.R. Crim.P. 35(a) to correct Redd\u2019s allegedly illegal sentence and under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b) to modify Redd\u2019s sentence to time already served. On August 15, 1983, the district court denied the \u00a7 2255 and Rule 35(a) motions, and granted the Rule 35(b) motion in part (to allow parole eligibility to be determined pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205(b)). Redd now appeals the denial of his \u00a7 2255 and Rule 35(a) motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-21\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b770-22\">The claims in Redd\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion are without merit. Redd contends that in revoking his probation based on his con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>sumption of alcohol on April 24, 1982, the district court violated double jeopardy and due process principles, because it had already punished him for the same behavior when it rescinded its travel authorization on April 29, 1982. Redd raised this precise claim in his direct appeal, and this court expressly rejected it. Therefore, this claim cannot be the basis of a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Egger v. United States, </em>509 F.2d 745, 748 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 842, 96 S.Ct. 74, 46 L.Ed.2d 61 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Redd also contends that the principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel barred the district court from revoking his probation. He claims that once the district court had considered the alcohol incident and rescinded its travel authorization, it was precluded from considering the same incident again at his probation revocation hearing. There is no authority for this proposition. The same actions by a probationer can lead to direct punishment and can also constitute the basis on which his probation, for a prior offense is revoked. <em>See Bible v. Arizona, </em>449 F.2d 111, 112 (9th Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 994, 92 S.Ct. 1268, 31 L.Ed.2d 463 (1972); <em>see also United States v. Guadarrama, </em>742 F.2d 487, 488-89 (9th Cir.1984). There is no rule requiring courts to consider probation revocation at the same proceeding or time as they make determinations concerning new offenses with which a probationer is charged. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Guadarrama, </em>742 F.2d at 488; <em>Bible v. Arizona, </em>449 F.2d at 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Redd also claims that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to raise double jeopardy, due process, res judicata, and collateral estoppel challenges during his probation revocation hearing. Since these challenges would all have been meritless, Redd cannot claim that his counsel\u2019s failure to raise them constituted ineffective assistance. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,-, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">Finally, Redd claims that there have been intervening changes in the law since his direct appeal which would require a different outcome in his case. However, the cases he cites in support of this assertion\u2014 <em>Johnson v. Smith, </em>696 F.2d 1334 (11th Cir.1983), and <em>United States v. Hamilton, </em>708 F.2d 1412 (9th Cir.1983) \u2014 reveal no change in prevailing legal standards that would entitle him to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">Redd\u2019s Rule 35(a) motion is also without merit. Redd contends that the district court illegally \u201cenhanced his sentence\u201d by revoking his probation after it had already revoked his travel authorization for the same conduct. This is merely another version of his double jeopardy claim. Redd was not punished twice for the same offense, nor was his punishment for a single offense illegally \u201cenhanced.\u201d Redd was given two separate punishments for two separate offenses: his violation of the conditions of the district court\u2019s travel authorization, and his violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(h)(1). The district court sentenced Redd for his violation of \u00a7 922(h)(1) when he entered his guilty plea on April 19,1982, and suspended imposition of that sentence subject to various conditions, in order to give Redd an opportunity to remain at the community treatment center. Redd\u2019s actions on April 24,1982 violated those conditions and led the district court to revoke his probation and reinstate his original sentence. However, the fact that the district court based its decision that probation was inappropriate in Redd\u2019s case upon the April 24,1982 incident does not transform Redd\u2019s reinstated sentence for violating \u00a7 922(h)(1) into a punishment for the April 24, 1982 incident. <em>See Bible v. Arizona, </em>449 F.2d at 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-12\">Redd also contends that the district court violated his due process rights because of its \u201cunreasonable delay\u201d and \u201cpiecemeal approach\u201d in proceeding as it did. Since only about five weeks intervened between the April 24, 1982 incident and Redd\u2019s probation revocation hearing, and since only one probation revocation hearing was conducted, we cannot conclude that Redd\u2019s due process rights were violated. <em>See United States v. Hamilton, </em>708 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>F.2d 1412, 1415 (9th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Tyler, </em>605 F.2d 851, 853 (5th Cir.1979) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Finally, Redd\u2019s claim that he was entitled to be present at his Rule 35 hearing is without merit. Fed.R.Crim.P. 43(c) provides that a defendant is not required to be present at an argument on a question of law or a reduction of sentence under Rule 35. Fed.R.Crim.P. 43(c)(3)-(4). Redd\u2019s claim that his Rule 35 hearing was in actuality a resentencing, and that therefore he was entitled to be present at the hearing, is not supported by the record or by this court\u2019s ruling on Redd\u2019s direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">For these reasons, the district court\u2019s denial of Redd\u2019s \u00a7 2255 and Rule 35(a) motions is</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
