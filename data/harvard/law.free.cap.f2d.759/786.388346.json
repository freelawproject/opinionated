Aaron, </em>570 F.2d 317 (10th Cir.1978). Nothing in-our opinion, 724 F.2d 862, or prior opinions prevents prison officials from incorporating information within the area of responsibility and expertise of the Health Department and developed by them in the <em>Martinez </em>report prepared by prison officials. As thus understood, we see no reason to depart from the standards established in <em>Martinez </em>or in our decision in this case. The responsibility to prepare the appropriate report under the <em>Martinez </em>doctrine must remain with prison officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">Upon consideration of the petition and the brief of amicus curiae, the petition is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
