Plaintiff owns and operates a dental laboratory, the American Denture Center, which constructs, repairs, reproduces, duplicates, and processes dentures. He describes himself as a \u201cdenturist.\u201d The complaint\u2019s antitrust and constitutional claims challenge certain regulations issued by the Arkansas State Board of Dental Examiners, at the instance, it is alleged, of the Arkansas State Dental Association. These regulations, among other things, define the practice of dentistry, which the board regulates under state law, to include the construction of dentures. The regulations provide that no one may construct a denture \u201cwithout written prescription or work order therefor signed by [a] dentist.\u201d Rule 5(f) of the Dental Board. Plaintiff claims, in addition, that the regulations have the effect of prohibiting the making of dentures by anyone not employed by a licensed dentist.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">The main question presented is whether the defendant Board\u2019s issuance of these regulations, at the instance of the defendant association, is immune from antitrust attack under the state-action doctrine. The District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, 593 F.Supp. 1354, held in favor of the immunity defense. Its opinion is comprehensive and discriminating, and we have nothing of substance to add.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">We have considered appellants\u2019 other arguments and hold that they are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b745-25\">.
