KENNEDY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">This is an appeal from an order dismissing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as a defendant in a suit alleging violations of the Hill-Burton Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 291 <em>et seq. </em>Plaintiff-Appellants Patricia Gillis and Citizens for Better Health Care, Inc. (CBC) brought suit individually and as class representatives on behalf of all persons eligible to receive Hill-Burton uncompensated or reduced cost services at several Southeastern Michigan hospitals, alleging that the defendant hospitals had failed to fulfill their obligations relevant to the provision of such services, and that HHS had failed to monitor and enforce the hospitals\u2019 performance of those obligations. In their complaint they sought declaratory and injunctive relief, declaring the defendants to have acted unlawfully and ordering them to take corrective steps to remedy past violations and ensure that no future violations occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-15\">A number of issues are raised by the parties to this appeal \u2014 whether CBC has standing to be a party plaintiff to this suit, whether an implied cause of action exists under the Hill-Burton Act against HHS, and whether a cause of action exists against HHS under the Administrative Procedure Act,' 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(1). Initially, however, we must determine whether the dismissal of HHS as a party defendant while the action continued against the hospitals is an appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-17\">To be appealable, the District Court\u2019s order dismissing HHS from this suit must qualify as either a final judgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, or an \u201c[interlocutory order[ ] ... granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions\u201d under \u00a7 1292(a)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An order that does not specifically refuse an injunction but has the practical effect of doing so may be immediately appealable under \u00a7 1292(a)(1). However, because \u00a7 1292(a)(1) was intended to carve out only a limited exception to the final judgment rule, \u201c[ujnless a litigant can show that an interlocutory order of the district court might have a \u2018serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence,\u2019 and that the order can be \u2018effectually challenged\u2019 only by immediate appeal, the general congressional policy against piecemeal review will preclude interlocutory appeal.\u201d <em>Carson v. American Brands, Inc., </em>450 U.S. 79, 84, 101 S.Ct. 993, 996, 67 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-18\">In discussing the \u201cirreparable consequences\u201d factor, the Court in <em>Carson </em>deemed significant whether the party seek<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>ing to appeal had requested and effectively been denied a preliminary injunction. 450 U.S. at 84-86, 101 S.Ct. at 996-998 (distinguishing <em>Switzerland Cheese Ass\u2019n v. E. Horne\u2019s Market, </em>385 U.S. 23, 87 S.Ct. 193, 17 L.Ed.2d 23 (1966), and <em>Gardner v. Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., </em>437 U.S. 478, 98 S.Ct. 2451, 57 L.Ed.2d 364 (1978), on basis that in those cases no preliminary injunction was sought nor irreparable harm alleged). \u201cMost of the cases dealing with the practical denial of preliminary relief turn on the fact that characteristically, preliminary relief must be granted promptly to be effective.\u201d 16 C. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper &amp; E. Gressman, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3924, at 70 (1977). However, the logical significance of an effective denial of preliminary relief is undermined if it appears that the request for preliminary relief was included in the complaint as a matter of routine and despite reasonable opportunity is not being pressed. <em>Id. </em>at 69-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">In the instant case, although plaintiffs requested a TRO and preliminary injunction against both HHS and defendant hospitals in their first amended complaint, no hearing was held on that request, nor is there any indication in the record that plaintiffs requested a hearing or actively pursued preliminary relief. In fact, the specific request for a TRO and preliminary injunction was omitted from plaintiffs\u2019 proposed second amended complaint, although in their reply brief to this Court they argue that effective denial of a preliminary injunction against HHS would result in its continued failure to carry out its Hill-Burton duties to the detriment of eligible consumers of health care in Wayne County, Michigan. Since, however, those duties involve oversight, not the actual provision of care, a preliminary injunction against the defendant hospitals, if warranted, would have achieved the desired end prior to final disposition of all claims. <em>Cf. Western Geophysical Co. v. Bolt Associates, </em>440 F.2d 765, 769-71 (2d Cir.1971) (in case involving multiple claims, dismissal of claim on which preliminary relief was sought was not appealable where claims remained pursuant to which preliminary relief might still be obtained). Because appellants cannot show that dismissal of HHS, although effectively denying injunctive relief, would have serious consequences and can only be effectively challenged by an immediate appeal, this Court is not vested with jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) to consider their appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Nor, in the context in which this case was presented to us prior to oral argument, would this Court be vested with jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Although the relief being sought against the agency is distinct from that sought against defendant hospitals, <em>accord Davis v. Ball Memorial Hospital, </em>640 F.2d 30, 35 (7th Cir. 1980);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>see generally Local P-171, Amalgamated Meat Cutters of N.A. v. Thompson Farms Co., </em>642 F.2d 1065, 1067-71 (7th Cir.1981) (discussion of when interlocutory order has disposed of separate claim for relief for purposes of rule 54(b) certification), in the absence of \u201cthe entry [by the district court] of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties ... upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), it is clear that there is no final judgment in terms of \u00a7 1291 and that this Court is without jurisdiction to consider the appeal. <em>William B. Tanner Co. v. United States, </em>575 F.2d 101 (6th Cir.1978). However, we learned from plaintiffs\u2019 counsel for the first time during oral argument that none of the individual hospital defendants remain in the case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Thus, we are presented with the question of whether a premature notice of appeal is effective to vest this Court with jurisdiction where the remaining elements of the case have been finally disposed of but no new notice of appeal has been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Every circuit that has had occasion to address this question has held that an interlocutory appeal lacking the requisite rule 54(b) certification invokes appellate jurisdiction where judgment becomes final prior to disposition of the appeal. <em>See Pireno v. New York Chiropractic Ass\u2019n, </em>650 F.2d 387, 389-90 n. 4 (2d Cir.1981), <em>aff'd sub nom. Union Labor Life Insurance Co. v.

Campbell, </em>692 F.2d 112 (11th Cir.1982).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A contrary holding would create a split in the circuits, which we are reluctant to do on an issue such as this. Although we do not condone plaintiffs\u2019 sloppy practice, we con-elude that we have jurisdiction to consider the appeal in this instance. <em>Cf. Brandon v. Holt, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 105 S.Ct. 873, 879, 83 L.Ed.2d 878, 886-87 (1985) (Burger, C.J., concurring). Therefore, we proceed to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">A. STANDING</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">In plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint, the claim against HHS was made only by CBC. For an association to assert representational standing, it must establish that \u201c(a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization\u2019s purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.\u201d <em>Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm\u2019n, </em>432 U.S. 333, 343, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 2441, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977); <em>see Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 511, 515, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2211, 2213, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975); <em>Sierra Club v. Morton, </em>405 U.S. 727, 734-41, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 1365-69, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972). Ms. Gillis, as individual plaintiff and in her capacity as representative of the putative class, alleged that she was eligible to receive free or reduced cost care under Hill-Burton and that one of the defendant hospitals had in fact failed to inform her of the existence of the program as it was obliged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>to do by the Act. However, there was no allegation that she was a member of CBC or that any other CBC member was being individually harmed. Moreover, it is unclear from the description of CBC as an \u201corganization composed of residents of nursing homes, hospitals, relatives, and health professionals concerned with promoting health care,\u201d whether CBC\u2019s membership included hospitals whose interests would be adverse to the claims being brought on their behalf. Consequently, HHS claims, CBC does not satisfy the test for representational standing necessary to assert the claims being made against HHS.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">The agency\u2019s argument rests in large part on its contention that this Court\u2019s consideration of plaintiffs\u2019 claims must be confined to the allegations contained in its first amended complaint. On March 15, 1982, the District Court heard oral argument on HHS\u2019s motion to dismiss, as well as plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend their first amended complaint and the motion of certain hospital defendants for a more definite statement. The court\u2019s memorandum opinion of June 9, 1982, granting HHS\u2019s motion, relied solely on the reasoning of</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\"><em>Davis v. Ball Memorial Hospital, </em>which held that there was no implied cause of action against HHS under Hill-Burton. The question of CBC\u2019s standing is not mentioned,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> although it is noted that the cause of action against HHS was only asserted by CBC. In its memorandum of the same date granting the motions to amend and for a more definite statement, the District Court quotes from plaintiffs\u2019 brief in support of its motion to amend, stating plaintiffs\u2019 reason to be \u201c \u2018to cure possible minor defects in pleading,\u2019 \u201d and notes that \u201cthe proposed Second Amended Complaint contains very slight changes from the First Amended Complaint.\u201d Although the court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend, it ordered that the second amended complaint be redrafted to comply with the motion for a more definite statement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To date, the redrafted complaint has not been served on HHS.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Hence the contention of HHS that this Court must confine its consideration to the first amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">HHS asserts no rule or precedent supporting its argument that this Court must confine itself to the allegations contained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint simply because HHS was not served with the redrafted second amended complaint. Although the situation is certainly an unusual one, we see no reason why we should be so limited. The District Court granted plaintiffs\u2019 request to amend with the proposed second amended complaint before it, simultaneously granting appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss. Thus, the motion to dismiss was entered with the allegations contained in the proposed second amended complaint in mind.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If those allegations were before the District Court, logically they would be before this Court as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">In <em>Brandon v. Holt, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 873, 83 L.Ed.2d 878 (1985), the Court considered whether an action brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 naming only a public official as defendant, which stated that his liability was \u201cin his official capacity,\u201d was tantamount to an action against the entity he represents. The Court held that it was, provided that the entity received notice and an opportunity to respond. \u2014 U.S. at -, 105 S.Ct. at 878, 83 L.Ed.2d at 885-86. The Court also noted that \u201ceven at this late stage of the proceedings, petitioners are entitled to amend their pleadings to conform to the proof and to the District Court\u2019s findings of fact. <em>Moreover, it is appropriate for us to proceed to decide the legal issues without first insisting that such a formal amendment be filed;\u201d </em>because it was plain that plaintiffs were claiming a right to recover damages from the city, \u201crather than the particular individual who occupied that office when the claim arose.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at-, 105 S.Ct. at 877-78, 83 L.Ed.2d at 885 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Similarly, in <em>National Wildlife Federation v. Costle, </em>629 F.2d 118 (D.C.Cir.1980), the court held that it could \u201cconsider issues raised by a summary judgment motion, even where the issues are not raised in the complaint, since <em>the motion may be deemed to have initiated the process of amendment.\u201d </em>629 F.2d at 133 n. 45 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-15\">Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed second amended complaint eliminates many of the arguments asserted by HHS on the standing issue. First, it specifically alleges both that Ms. Gillis is a CBC member, and that other of CBC\u2019s members who are low income persons are being injured in fact by the defendants. Second, it clarifies that no hospitals are members of CBC, and specifically alleges that \u201cCBC has an organization [sic] interest in promoting health care poli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>cies which benefit low income persons.\u201d Moreover, in the second amended complaint the claim against HHS is asserted by Gillis as well as CBC. The District Court did note in its memorandum dismissing HHS that the claim against the agency asserted in plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint was brought only by CBC, and stated in its memorandum granting plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend that their second amended complaint contained only \u201cvery slight changes\u201d from their first amended complaint. Leave to amend against HHS at that stage being discretionary, undoubtedly the court would have permitted the addition of Gillis as a plaintiff against HHS had it not dismissed on the implied cause of action issue and thus been presented with the question of standing. It is not necessary to resolve that question, however, because on the basis of the allegations in the proposed second amended complaint,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> CBC clearly makes a prima facie showing of representational standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">The first part of the test, allegation of injury to individual members, and the second, that the interests being asserted fall squarely within the stated objectives of the organization, are plainly met. <em>See Corum v. Beth Israel Medical Center, </em>359 F.Supp. 909, 914-15 (S.D.N.Y.1973). The third part of the test, whether the nature of the claims \u201crequires individualized proof,\u201d <em>Hunt, </em>432 U.S. at 344, 97 S.Ct. at 2442, is also met. In the context of the Hill-Burton program, representational standing is particularly appropriate, because participating hospitals are only required to provide a finite amount of services each year. No particular eligible individual has a right to care under Hill-Burton. <em>Newsom v. Vanderbilt University, </em>653 F.2d 1100, 1116-22 (6th Cir.1981); <em>see also Lane v. Lincoln County Hospital, </em>537 F.Supp. 114 (E.D. Tenn.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Nevertheless, HHS argues that CBC\u2019s individual members\u2019 \u201cstatus and interests are too diverse and the possibilities of conflict too obvious to make the association an appropriate vehicle to litigate the claims of its members.\u201d <em>Associated General Contractors v. Otter Tail Power Co., </em>611 F.2d 684, 691 (8th Cir.1979). It makes two arguments in this regard. The first, that the suit conflicts with the interests of member hospitals, since it relies on the ambiguous wording of the first amended complaint, is resolved if the second amended complaint is taken into account. Their second argument is more problematic. It is that since the relief being sought might involve substantial costs to defendant hospitals, the suit conflicts with the interests of CBC member health care workers to whom these costs might be passed on in the form of lower salaries, and CBC member patients seeking care and ineligible for coverage under Hill-Burton, to whom these costs might be passed on in the form of higher charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">Although there is a theoretical conflict between CBC members posited by HHS, it would not seem to be the type that should deprive an association of representational standing. <em>See National Constructors Ass\u2019n v. National Electrical Contractors Ass\u2019n, </em>498 F.Supp. 510, 520-21 (D.Md. 1980). First, the adverse effects to certain members of the relief being sought are both speculative and indirect. Second, once an organization has alleged actual injury to \u201cits members, <em>or any one of them,\u201d Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. at 511, 95 S.Ct. at 2211 (emphasis added), it may then argue on behalf of the \u201cpublic interest.\u201d <em>Sierra Club v. Morton, </em>405 U.S. at 737-38, 92 S.Ct. at 1367-68. Virtually any relief involving the expenditure of money that benefits some but not all of an organization\u2019s members potentially means that that money will be unavailable to or in part exacted from the remainder of the membership. By joining an organization dedicated to a particular goal in the public interest, members indicate a willingness to make certain sacrifices productive of that goal. Carried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>to its logical extreme, evaluation of representational standing in terms of the adverseness of remote interests of discrete members would seriously undermine the ability of individuals through organizations to achieve public interest objectives through the legal system. <em>Cf. NCAA v. Califano, </em>622 F.2d 1382, 1391-92 (10th Cir. 1980) (where one or more members of association support bringing suit, association has standing absent showing that more members oppose than support association\u2019s position).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-13\">B. IMPLIED CAUSE OF ACTION UNDER HILL-BURTON</p>\n<p id=\"b643-14\">The Hill-Burton provision pertaining to enforcement is 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300s-6.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-15\">The Secretary shall investigate and ascertain, on a periodic basis, with respect to each entity which is receiving financial assistance under this subchapter or which has received financial assistance under subchapter IV of this chapter or this subchapter, the extent of compliance by such entity with the assurances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>required to be made at the time such assistance was received. If the Secretary finds that such an entity has failed to comply with any such assurance, the Secretary shall report such noncompliance to the health systems agency for the health service area in which such entity is located and the State health planning and development agency of the State in which the entity is located and shall take any action authorized by law (including an action for specific performance brought by the Attorney General upon request of the Secretary) which will effect compliance by the entity with such assurances. An action to effectuate compliance by the entity with any such assurance may be brought by a person other than the Secretary only if a complaint has been filed by such person with the Secretary and the Secretary has dismissed such complaint or the Attorney General has not brought a civil action for compliance with such assurance within six months after the date on which the complaint was filed with the Secretary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Since the statute on its face does not expressly grant a right of action against the Secretary to compel it to effectuate compliance, the court in <em>Davis v. Ball Memorial Hospital </em>applied the four factor test of <em>Cort v. Ash, </em>422 U.S. 66, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to determine whether a private remedy is implicit in the statute.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It concluded that no such remedy was implied, and persuasively so. <em>See </em>640 F.2d at 44-46. In particular, it emphasized that implying \u201ca private right of action to compel a federal agency to enforce provisions of an Act resembling this one would allow individuals to circumvent the procedural limitations of the legislative enactment.\u201d 640 F.2d at 46 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">In <em>Newsom, </em>this Court noted the similarity between the enforcement mechanisms established by Congress in the 1972 amendments to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5, and Hill-Burton, in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300s-6 (filing of complaint with agency; private right of action upon dismissal of complaint, expiration of six months, or earlier upon receipt of express authorization; etc.). 653 F.2d at 1108. In the ease of both Title VII and Hill-Burton, in providing for a private right of action in lieu of agency enforcement, the objective of Congress was to provide an <em>alternative </em>avenue of relief for individuals adversely affected by agency inaction, dalliance or backlog. <em>Compare Occidental Life Insurance Co. v. EEOC, </em>432 U.S. 355, 362-66, 97 S.Ct. 2447, 2452-54, 53 L.Ed.2d 402 (1977) (review of legislative history of Title VII private right of action) <em>with Newsom, </em>653 F.2d at 1120-21 n. 5 (review of legislative history of Hill-Burton enforcement provision). Hence, those courts addressing the question have held that there is no implied cause of action under Title VII to compel enforcement action by the EEOC. <em>See Ward v. EEOC, </em>719 F.2d 311, 313 (9th Cir.1983); <em>Stewart v. EEOC, </em>611 F.2d 679, 682 (7th Cir.1979); <em>Gibson v. Missouri Pacific R.R. Co., </em>579 F.2d 890, 891 (5th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 921, 99 S.Ct. 1245, 59 L.Ed.2d 473 (1979); <em>Feldstein v. EEOC, </em>547 F.Supp. 97, 99 (D.Mass.1982). Similarly, to the extent that plaintiffs seek to compel HHS to investigate, ascertain and effect compliance, we agree with the <em>Davis </em>court that there exists no implied cause of action under Hill-Burton and their claim against HHS was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>C. CAUSE OF ACTION UNDER THE APA</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">\u201cRegardless of whether a statute implies a private right of action, administrative actions thereunder may be challenged under the APA unless they fall within the limited exceptions of that Act.\u201d <em>Glacier Park Foundation v. Watt, </em>663 F.2d 882, 885 (9th Cir.1982). In <em>Davis, </em>plaintiffs seem to have asserted a claim based on the APA only indirectly or belatedly, arguing that \u201cthe differences between a private right of action under the Hill-Burton Act and the ... APA are inconsequential.\u201d The court refused to consider whether their claim was reviewable under the APA, describing the circumstances of its introduction as a \u201cglib treatment of the jurisdictional basis of [the] lawsuit,\u201d \u201cinconsistent with the basic notice requirements of judicial practice,\u201d and altering, at a late stage in the litigation, \u201cthe entire theory of their action with a mere wave of the hand.\u201d 640 F.2d at 47. In the instant case, HHS argues that since plaintiffs failed to assert a claim under the APA in their first amended complaint, such a claim is not properly before this Court. However, as noted above, this Court may properly consider the allegations contained in the second amended complaint, in which a claim under the APA was alleged.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Nor can it be said that plaintiffs\u2019 APA claim was raised at a late stage in this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">An agency action,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> to be reviewable under the APA, must be a \u201cfinal agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704. HHS\u2019s failure to enforce compliance with Hill-Burton assurances is not reviewable under this standard. First, inaction under \u00a7 300s-6 does not constitute a \u201cfinal agency action.\u201d Neither Title VII nor Hill-Burton empowers the agency charged with enforcement to make binding administrative determinations regarding alleged violations. <em>See Newsom, </em>653 F.2d at 1107-08. Comparably to HHS, \u201c[t]he EEOC\u2019s negligence or inaction in the internal processing of a complaint has no determinate consequences because such actions are merely preparatory to a lawsuit by either the EEOC or the charging party in federal court; only the district court may fix liability.\u201d <em>Ward, </em>719 F.2d at 313-14 (citation omitted); <em>see Stewart, </em>611 F.2d at 682-84. Second, plaintiffs in the instant case do not satisfy the \u201cno other adequate remedy in a court\u201d requirement, since they may still sue defendant hospitals. <em>Cf Ward, </em>719 F.2d at 314; <em>Stewart, </em>611 F.2d at 683-83; <em>Hall v. EEOC, </em>456 F.Supp. 695, 701 (N.D. Cal.1978). In fact, they were expressly authorized to do so by HHS\u2019s issuance of a \u201cright to sue\u201d letter based upon its determination that it would be \u201cunable to issue a decision on [plaintiffs\u2019] complaint or otherwise take appropriate action within six months.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 124.511(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">However, plaintiffs also claim that HHS has failed to carry out its \u201cmonitoring\u201d as well as its \u201cenforcement\u201d function. They rely in part upon the dissent in <em>Davis, </em>which distinguished the agency\u2019s \u201chighly discretionary\u201d duty to enforce from its non-discretionary duty to monitor compliance. 640 F.2d at 47-48 (Fairchild, C.J., dissenting). Analytically, \u201cmonitoring\u201d would encompass those duties prescribed by statute or regulation associated with the first sentence of \u00a7 300s-6, which requires that: \u201cThe Secretary shall investigate and ascertain, on a periodic basis, with respect to each entity which is receiving financial assistance ..., the extent of compliance by such entity with the assurances required to be made at the time such assistance was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>received.\u201d The remainder of \u00a7 300s-6 clearly pertains to \u201cenforcement,\u201d beginning with the phrase: <em>\u201cIf </em>the Secretary finds that such an entity has failed to comply with any such assurance\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">The APA does not apply to \u201cagency action [that] is committed to agency discretion by law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">Whether a particular agency decision is committed to agency discretion depends, broadly speaking, on whether there is law to apply in making and reviewing the decision, which in turn depends, we have said, on \u201cpragmatic considerations as to whether an agency determination is the proper subject of judicial review.\u201d <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. SEC, </em>606 F.2d 1031, 1043 (D.C.Cir.1979). Among the important considerations are \u201cthe need for judicial supervision to safeguard the interests of the plaintiffs[,] the impact of review on the effectiveness of the agency in carrying out its congressionally assigned role[,] and the appropriateness of the issues raised for judicial review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1044.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-6\"><em>Investment Co.

While the scope of the FTCA discretionary function exception is much broader than that of the APA,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the Court\u2019s analysis is instructive in determining whether inaction by HHS in \u201cmonitoring\u201d and \u201cenforcing\u201d compliance with Hill-Burton assurances is a \u201cproper subject of judicial review\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-13\">The FAA\u2019s implementation of a mechanism for compliance review is plainly discretionary activity of the \u201cnature and quality\u201d protected by \u00a7 2680(a). When an agency determines the extent to which it will supervise the safety procedures of private individuals, it is exercising discretionary regulatory authority of the most basic kind. Decisions as to the manner of enforcing regulations directly affect the feasibility and practicality of the Government\u2019s regulatory program; such decisions require the agency to establish priorities for the accomplishment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>of its policy objectives by balancing the objectives sought to be obtained against such practical considerations as staffing and funding. Here, the FAA has determined that a program of \u201cspot-checking\u201d manufacturer\u2019s compliance with minimum safety standards best accommodates the goal of air transportation safety and the reality of finite agency resources. Judicial intervention in such decisionmaking through private tort suits would require the courts to \u201csecond-guess\u201d the political, social, and economic judgments of an agency exercising its regulatory function. It was precisely this sort of judicial intervention in policy-making that the discretionary function exception was designed to prevent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">\u2014 U.S. at -, 104 S.Ct. at 2768, 81 L.Ed.2d at 678. Similar concerns were noted by the court in <em>I CL </em>In holding that the FDIC\u2019s declining to decide the merits of ICI\u2019s petition requesting that the agency declare a plan to sell mutual fund shares unlawful, was not reviewable under the APA, the court noted the extent of the FDIC\u2019s regulatory responsibilities and credited the agency\u2019s' assertion that the exercise of those responsibilities \u201cwould be severely disrupted if every person seeking FDIC action on a petition seeking enforcement action could invoke judicial review of a simple FDIC refusal to consider the merits of the petition.\u201d 728 F.2d at 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Similar deference to administrative discretion is appropriate in the instant case. \u201c[T]he authority conferred upon the Secretary under the Hill-Burton Act is very broad____ Congress expressly delegated to the Secretary the authority to set standards of compliance with the Act\u2019s goals ____\u201d <em>American Hospital Ass\u2019n v.

The regulations pertaining to investigation and enforcement of Hill-Burton assurances specifically incorporate the weighing process postulated by the Court in <em>Varig Airlines, </em>stating that the Secretary may dismiss a complaint without a finding as to compliance, \u201cbased on priorities for the disposition of complaints that are established to promote the most efficient use of enforcement resources.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 124.-511(a)(4) &amp; 124.606(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-16\">Even if the Secretary has failed to \u201cmonitor\u201d facilities by requiring periodic submission of \u201cdata and information which reasonably supports ... compliance,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300s,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and such inaction constitutes a \u201cfinal agency action\u201d for purposes of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704, plaintiffs cannot satisfy the second prerequisite to review under \u00a7 704 that \u201cthere is no other adequate remedy in a court.\u201d The regulations provide that the reporting and record maintenance requirements imposed on participating facilities run to the public as well as the Secretary. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 124.510(b)(1) &amp; 124.605(b)(1).

Regan, </em>709 F.2d 1521 (D.C.Cir.1983) (en banc), plaintiffs brought suit directly against the Secretary of the Treasury and Director of the Office of Revenue Sharing (ORS) to compel them to monitor compliance with and enforce the nondiscrimination obligation of local government entities attendant upon receipt of revenue sharing funds. The Revenue Sharing Act was amended by Congress in 1976 to provide for a private cause of action against local government entities to enforce this obligation, conditioned upon the exhaustion of administrative remedies. Pub.L. No. 94-488, \u00a7 7, 90 Stat. 2349 (codi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>fied as amended at 81 U.S.C. \u00a7 6721). The court held that no cause of action could be implied from the Act directly against the Secretary and ORS, 709 F.2d at 1525-31, and that although their inaction was \u201cfinal\u201d as regards \u00a7 704, the private remedy provided by 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 6721 was \u201cadequate,\u201d and hence such inaction was unreviewable under the APA. <em>Id. </em>at 1531. The court rejected appellant\u2019s argument that \u201c[i]f the ORS pursued complaints adequately, funded units would comply with the law sooner, ... and the need for appellants to resort to expensive, time-consuming section [6721] suits would diminish.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1532. <em>Cf.

The court reasoned that broad declaratory and injunctive relief against the government would place the court in the position thereafter of \u201csupervis[ing] the ORS\u2019s handling of virtually every alleged violation\u201d of the Act, that it was doubtful whether such an approach would be more effective than several private suits, and that \u201cit would empower one district judge to act as supreme supervisor of the ORS\u2019s enforcement activities \u2014 a role more appropriately reserved for the Executive under the oversight of Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This reasoning is equally applicable in the instant case. Neither inconvenience nor a speculative disincentive to entity compliance render resort to the private suit remedy available to enforce Hill-Burton assurances inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">In concluding that appellants\u2019 claim against HHS in the instant case is not reviewable under the APA, we do not hold that the agency\u2019s performance as administrator of the Hill-Burton program is entirely immune from judicial review. \u201cWhen agency recalcitrance is in the face of a clear statutory duty or is of such magnitude that it amounts to an abdication of statutory responsibility, the court has the power to order the agency to act to carry out its substantive statutory mandates.\u201d <em>Public Citizen Health Research Group v.

There is nothing whatsoever in the pleadings or record of this case to support an assertion that HHS has totally abdicated its statutory responsibility; in fact, just the opposite is true.

No such motions are involved here. No request to have the judgment certified under rule 54(b) was made. However, no just reason for delay can exist after the final judgment as to all parties has been entered. <em>Compare Jeteo, </em>473 F.2d at 1231 (\"Mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s command that practical, not technical, considerations are to govern the application of principles of finality, ... we decline appellee\u2019s invitation to exalt form over substance by dismissing this appeal.\" (citations omitted)) <em>with Jackson v.

Since the amendment of rule 4, the Third and Fifth Circuits have held that premature notice of appeal continues to invoke appellate jurisdiction except in the specific circumstances prescribed in the rule.

Despite the clear language of the Court in <em>Passenger Corp., </em>the problem would not appear to be quite that simple.

HHS clearly recognizes the difference, arguing in its brief, despite its reference to <em>Passenger Corp., </em>that whether CBC has standing to maintain an action under the Article III case or controversy requirement is distinct from whether it has standing to bring an action under Hill-Burton or the APA if such a cause of action exists.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b640-9\">. An examination of the record of the preliminary hearing before the District Court reveals that there was no significant objection by any of the defendants, including HHS, to plaintiffs' motion to amend.

If the Secretary determines that he will be unable to issue a decision on a complaint or otherwise take appropriate action within the six month period, he may, based on priorities for the disposition of complaints that are established to promote the most effective use of enforcement resources, or on the request of the complainant, dismiss the complaint without a finding as to compliance prior to the end of the six month period____</p>\n<p id=\"b643-22\">(b) <em>Enforcement. </em>(1) If the Secretary finds ... that a facility did not comply with the requirements of this subpart, he may take any action authorized by law to secure compliance, including but not limited to voluntary agreement or a request to the Attorney General to bring an action against the facility for specific performance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b644-5\">.

It is noteworthy in this regard that the quoted requirement of \u00a7 300s is directed to assisted entities rather than the Secretary.

It is clear from this and other recent references to <em>Adams </em>that appellants\u2019 reliance on that case is misplaced. First, the D.C.
