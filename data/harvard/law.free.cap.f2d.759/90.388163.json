The Tavoulareases alleged that they were defamed by articles in the <em>Post </em>which stated, among other things, that William Tavoulareas, as President and Chief Executive Officer of Mobil Oil Corporation (\u201cMobil\u201d), had used his influence to \u201cset up\u201d his son Peter in the shipping business, and then had diverted some of Mobil\u2019s shipping business to him. The basic theme of the article was that William Tavoulareas had misused his position and corporate assets to benefit his son. The case was submitted to the jury, which was instructed, in accordance with standards constitutionally required for public figures, that defendants could be held liable only if they published false matter with \u201cactual <em>malice\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., with knowledge of its falsity or reckless disregard of whether it was false or not. The jury returned verdicts for the plaintiffs. The trial judge then ruled on motion that the evidence was insufficient to support such a verdict and entered judgment notwithstanding the verdict (\u201cn.o.v.\u201d) for the defendants. <em>Tavoulareas v. Washington Post Co., </em>567 F.Supp. 651 (D.D.C. 1983). After a careful and independent review of the entire record in the case, we conclude that the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs was sufficient to \u201cestablish [] actual malice with convincing clarity,\u201d <em>Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 1967, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984), and accordingly reverse the grant of the judgments n.o.v. as to the <em>Post </em>defendants and defendant Piro, and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings. We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment n.o.v. with respect to defendant Golden because of his lack of responsibility for the publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">I. Background Facts</p>\n<p id=\"ABr\">The business relationships that gave rise to this case began in 1974, when Mobil bought a 30 percent interest in the Saudi Arabian Maritime Company (\u201cSamareo\u201d), a joint venture that had been formed a short time before by Fairfield Maxwell Ltd. and members of a powerful Saudi Arabian family, the Alirezas. The Alirezas were the majority shareholders in Samareo. Mobil bought a <em>minority </em>interest in Samareo because, at that time, Mobil believed the Saudi government was going to give strong oil shipping preferences to Saudi-owned shippers. Ultimately, however, these preferences were never adopted by the Saudi government.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">The Samareo partners agreed to hire an outside firm to manage the ships that Samareo would operate. Mobil suggested Atlas Maritime Company, a new venture being formed by Greek shipping executive George Comnas. Comnas had previously worked for the Greek maritime firm of C.M. Lemos &amp; Co., where Peter Tavoulareas, a 24-year-old graduate of the Master of Business Administration program at Columbia University, <em>was </em>also employed as a junior executive. Peter had first approached Lemos in August, 1972 with respect to employment and by January 1, 1973 had started working in the shipping business with C.M. Lemos &amp; Co. (Trial Transcript (Tr.) 2385, 2387, 2451).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">Mobil owned a fleet of oil tankers. It wanted some of those ships to be operated under Samarco\u2019s name in order to get the expected shipping preference. Mobil agreed to \u201cbareboat charter\u201d its ships <em>{i.e., </em>charter the ships empty and unmanned) to Samareo, which would in turn \u201ctime charter\u201d them <em>{i.e., </em>charter the vessels complete with crews and provisions) back to Mobil.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Mobil thus in a sense was \u201cchartering\u201d its own ships to itself and essentially obtaining its crews and provisions through Samarco.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In admiralty law \u201cfor many, if not most, purposes the bareboat charterer is to be treated as the owner\u201d of the chartered vessel. <em>Reed v. The Yaka, </em>373 U.S. 410, 412, 83 S.Ct. 1349, 1352, 10 L.Ed.2d 448 (1963). Thus, the contractual arrangement placed considerable responsibility upon Samarco for Mobil\u2019s ships. Samarco, for its part, obtained crews and provisions through its management firm, Atlas.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Comnas, in setting up Atlas, asked two young coworkers at Lemos, Peter Tavoulareas and Ares Emmanuel, to join him as partners. When Peter joined Atlas in August 1974, his father William notified Mobil\u2019s Conflict of Interest Committee and formally removed himself from taking part in <em>decisions </em>regarding Atlas.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Mobil Committee found no impropriety in the arrangement, which was fully disclosed to the Mobil Board of Directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Comnas was forced out of Atlas a year later, in 1975, ostensibly because of self-dealing, fraudulent practices, and dissatisfaction with his performance on the part of Mobil and the Saudis. He was placed on Mobil\u2019s payroll as a consultant, and Atlas reimbursed Mobil for his salary. Mobil sent Harmon Hoffmann,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a Mobil shipping executive, to act as interim head of Atlas. <em>Hoffmann was offered Comnas\u2019 share of Atlas stock </em>(Tr. 4151), but turned down the offer to become an equity partner, and after six months returned to Mobil. Peter Tavoulareas and Emmanuel then assumed the management duties of Atlas. Atlas prospered during the succeeding years; by 1979 it apparently was operating 17 ships, including 7 for Samarco, only 4 of which were Mobil\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-13\">The Mobil-Samarco-Atlas relationship\u2014 and specifically the Tavoulareas-Atlas connection \u2014 was explained to Mobil shareholders in a 1976 letter. At about the same time, a party or parties sent anonymous letters to a number of newspapers, alleging that the arrangement violated the federal securities laws. One of those letters went to reporter Robert Woodward of the <em>Post. </em>Woodward, along with reporters for several other newspapers, investigated the anonymous charges; but none of them apparently found any wrongdoing, and no stories were published. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which obtained a copy of one of the letters, launched an informal investigation and called upon William Tavoulareas to testify in non-public proceedings. The SEC found no impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-14\">Evidence presented by the plaintiffs showed that Mobil did <em>not </em>exert control over Samarco, in which it was a minority shareholder, and that all of the decisions relating to Atlas were approved by the controlling Saudi partners. The arrangement was fully disclosed to Mobil\u2019s Conflicts of Interest Committee, Mobil\u2019s Board of Directors, and to the company\u2019s shareholders. Evidence indicated that Mobil and its shareholders had derived economic benefits from the Samarco-Atlas arrangement because Atlas operated the Mobil ships more cheaply than could Mobil.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-15\">The article at issue in this case had its genesis five years after the creation of Atlas and three years after disclosure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>the shareholders. In October, 1979, Samuel \u201cSandy\u201d Golden, a reporter for <em>The Montgomery </em>[Maryland] <em>Journal, </em>met Philip Piro, a physician who was married to William Tavoulareas\u2019 daughter. Piro was in the midst of a less than amicable divorce proceeding. Piro told Golden about the Atlas transactions. Golden testified that Piro told him that Mobil Oil president William Tavoulareas had set up his son Peter in the business, and that it had made Peter an \u201covernight millionaire\u201d (Tr. 166). Piro mentioned that Woodward had previously investigated the story.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Golden, who had been angling for a job at the <em>Post </em>for some time, sensed a story. He unsuccessfully called Woodward several times and finally left a message that he \u201chad a story about the president of Mobil setting up his son to become an overnight millionaire\u201d (Joint Appendix (J.A.) 786). Woodward, by then an editor at the <em>Post, </em>assigned reporter Patrick Tyler to return Golden\u2019s call. Tyler called Golden. Golden told Tyler that he had a hot source for the Tavoulareas story. - Tyler agreed that if Golden\u2019s source led to a big story they would share a <em>Post </em>byline. The two reporters met at The Owl restaurant in Baltimore, where they jointly interviewed Piro. Tyler apparently was pleased with Piro\u2019s evidence; on leaving the restaurant he remarked that it\u2019s \u201cnot every day you knock off one of the seven sisters.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">At this point, the two reporters began following separate trails. Golden concentrated on getting more information from Piro and conducted several telephone interviews with him. Although Golden repeatedly assured Piro that he was not recording them, he taped several of the conversations. Golden also began seeking \u201cpossible enemies\u201d of Tavoulareas, <em>i.e., </em>those with a \u201cmotive for revenge\u201d and \u201cwith a reason to say bad things about Mr. Tavoulareas\u201d (J.A. 815). In his search, he met Peter Stockton, an investigator for Rep. John Dingell, Chairman of the House of Representatives Subcommittee on Energy and Power. Stockton moonlighted as an employee of CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d television show. Golden believed that Stockton, who had something of a reputation as a crusader, \u201chate[d] people with money.\u201d Golden played the Piro tapes for Stockton, who at some point relayed Golden\u2019s information to Congressman Dingell. Stockton later contacted Tyler and passed other information to him. Dingell wrote to the SEC seeking an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Tyler, meanwhile, tracked down Comnas and met with him in New York. Comnas, who initially requested anonymity, allegedly told Tyler about the Atlas arrangements. The <em>Post </em>contends that Comnas was the major source for its stories. (Since Comnas did not testify at trial and Tyler is a reporter who does not use tape recorders, only Tyler\u2019s own account of the conversations is available.) Tyler also talked to John Kousi, an executive of Fairfield Maxwell, Ltd., one of the Samarco partners. Parts of Kousi\u2019s deposition were placed into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">Tyler also tried to interview William Tavoulareas and other Mobil executives, but generally was rebuffed. Witnesses for the plaintiffs stated that they were wary of talking with Tyler because in an earlier story on the oil shortage he had misrepresented statements made by Mobil executives. Tavoulareas, however, agreed to give written answers to questions that Tyler would submit in writing, which was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">Tyler wrote the story, and the <em>Post </em>submitted it to its editing process. During editing, several pieces of material were deleted that were favorable to Mobil and Tavoulareas, chiefly opinions of various persons in and out of Mobil (1) that the Atlas arrangement had benefitted the company, and (2) that William Tavoulareas had not been directly involved in Atlas. The <em>Post </em>copy editor assigned to the story, Christine Peterson, read it, considered its implica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>tions, and wrote a memorandum to other editors that she found it \u201cimpossible to believe\u201d that William Tavoulareas had arranged the Atlas affair in order to benefit his son. Tyler responded with a memo in which he acknowledged that \u201ca good editor might say that part of our case against Tavoulareas seems tenuous,\u201d and noted that a couple of \u201ckey points\u201d were based on a single source \u2014 presumably Comnas. The <em>Post </em>editors did not alter the story in response to Peterson\u2019s memo, and the story, after clearance from the lawyers, was published.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">When the article appeared, Tyler was given sole byline credit for it, but Golden received designation as a \u201cSpecial Correspondent\u201d who had \u201ccontributed\u201d to the story.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The first article \u2014 which is reprinted as an Appendix to this opinion \u2014 appeared on November 30, 1979.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It bore the headline \u201cMobil Chief Sets Up Son in Venture,\u201d and its essential theme is made clear from its beginning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">Mobil Oil Corp. president William P. Tavoulareas set up his son five years ago as a partner in a London-based shipping management firm that has since done millions of dollars in business operating Mobil-owned ships under exclusive, no-bid contracts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The article detailed the transactions that led to the creation of Samarco and Atlas. Although the article contained a great deal of innuendo,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the defamatory picture it conveyed is based upon certain factual allegations contained therein. Specifically, it alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">1. William Tavoulareas \u201cset up his son ... as a partner\u201d in Atlas, a company to which William and Mobil would divert a great deal of business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-11\">2. \u201cAs the formation of Atlas was being planned in April 1974, [William] Tavoulareas personally urged [Comnas] that his son be included as an equity partner in Atlas.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-12\">3. Although he had told the Mobile board that he recognized the potential conflict of interest and would not personally be involved in dealings with Atlas, it was nevertheless \u201cthe elder Tavoulareas [who] dispatched one of his senior shipping executives, Herman F. Hoffmann, [sic] to London to help run Atlas\u201d after Comnas left the firm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-13\">The core allegations \u2014 baldly stated as facts in the article \u2014 were that William Tavoulareas set up Peter in Atlas and then dispatched a Mobil employee and used Mobil resources to bail out Atlas when Comnas was forced out. Without these \u201cfacts,\u201d the story would be nothing more than a report that Mobil had business dealings with a small company in which its president\u2019s son had a part interest \u2014 hardly page 1 material.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-14\">These core \u201cfacts\u201d formed the foundation on which the implications of the article rested. In a memo to his superiors at the <em>Post </em>(J.A. 2488-91), Tyler characterized the story as dealing with the \u201cincredibly fancy corporate footwork\u201d undertaken by Tavoulareas and Mobil to (1) \u201cingratiate itself with the Saudis,\u201d and (2) \u201cset up the son of Mobil\u2019s president in a shipping business when business was bad and the business, therefore, stood little chance of prospering without Mobil\u2019s help.\u201d In the memo, he called it a \u201cstor[y] of nepotism, reward without merit and favoritism by those who wield vast amounts of power.\u201d He continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-15\">... Mobil \u2014 which originally turned down a chance to join Samarco \u2014 changed its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>mind after it dawned on Mobil\u2019s president that such a partnership would justify creation of a small management firm at a time when Tavoulareas\u2019 son was aspiring to such a career and was already at work with one of the Greek shippers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">The story showed, wrote Tyler, \u201cthat Mobil\u2019s decisions in this case were not made for the traditional business reasons, or for the reasons stated by Mobil.\u201d In specific response to Peterson\u2019s assertion that it was \u201cimpossible to believe that Tavoulareas alone pould put together [the Samareo-Atlas] scheme for the sake of his son\u2019s business career, or that he would want to,\u201d he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-5\">Samarco can be seen as nothing more complicated than a slight diversion from Mobil in the way it moved its crude oil from point A to point B. The question of \u201cwhy\u201d Mobil\u2019s president would want to orchestrate such a diversion when it would benefit his son\u2019s business career is begging things a little.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJ5\">Tyler\u2019s interpretation of the article\u2019s implications was echoed by Peterson, who apparently read the story to suggest that \u201cTavoulareas alone ... put together [the Atlas-Samarco] scheme for the sake of his son\u2019s business career.\u201d As a whole, she wrote, the story was about the use of $680,000-a-year of Mobil\u2019s assets as a \u201cplaything for an indulged son.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The interpretations of Tyler and Peterson reflect fairly accurately the defamatory implications that an average reader would draw from the story: (1) that William Tavoulareas, using his position as a principal officer of Mobil, \u201cset up\u201d his son in Atlas; (2) that a primary motive for Mobil\u2019s participation in the Atlas deal was to benefit Peter Tavoulareas;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (3) that William Tavoulareas, although claiming to have isolated himself from business dealings with Atlas, nevertheless directly participated in important matters and personally channelled a Mobil employee and resources to help Atlas; and (4) that Tavoulareas and Mobil may have violated the securities laws by failing to disclose Peter\u2019s involvement in Atlas.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Ultimately, the basic implication was that Tavoulareas improperly used his position and the resources of Mobil to benefit his undistinguished 24-year-old son. All of these defamatory implications are based on the statements of \u201cfact\u201d identified above.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-13\">After the first publication, William Tavoulareas denied the story and demanded a retraction. The <em>Post </em>has steadfastly refused to retract it and presently asserts that the \u201cstory was in fact true.\u201d Brief of <em>Post </em>at 18. Other publications picked up the story, which enjoyed a brief flurry in the press. It does not appear, however, that either the Mobil shareholders or the Securities and Exchange Commission <em>ever </em>found any impropriety in the transactions at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-14\">William and Peter Tavoulareas brought two actions: one for libel against The Washington Post Company<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and several individuals (collectively, the <em>\u201cPost </em>defendants\u201d), including Tyler, Golden, and Woodward (No. 83-1605),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and one for slander and its foreseeable republication against Piro (No. 83-1604). The two actions were consolidated. After trial, the jury returned verdicts in which they awarded damages that indicated they necessarily determined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-15\">1. In the November 30 article the <em>Post </em>defendants defamed William Tavoulareas. The premise of the article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>was false and was published with knowledge or reckless disregard of its falsity. The jury awarded Tavoulareas $250,000 in compensatory damages and $1,800,000 in punitive damages against the <em>Post </em>defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">2. The <em>Post </em>defendants did <em>not </em>defame Peter Tavoulareas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">3. Piro defamed both William and Peter Tavoulareas. The jury awarded compensatory damages of $5,000 to William and $1,000 to Peter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">After receipt of the verdicts, the district court granted judgments n.o.v. for Piro and for the <em>Post </em>defendants against William Tavoulareas. The trial court found that Tavoulareas was a public figure and that there was no proof that the defendants had acted with actual malice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">The article in question falls far short of being a model of fair, unbiased, investigative journalism. There is no evidence in the record, however, to show that it contained knowing lies or statements made in reckless disregard of the truth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXV\">567 F.Supp. at 654. The district court affirmed the jury verdict in favor of Peter Tavoulareas against Piro.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">On appeal, the parties have argued two issues. First, whether William Tavoulareas is a public figure, requiring application of the actual malice standard of <em>New York Times v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964)? And second, whether there is sufficient evidence in the record to support a finding of actual malice? On review, we consider the second of these issues and, in addition, inquire whether the charge that William Tavoulareas \u201cset up\u201d his son in the manner alleged, and certain implications reasonably flowing from the specifically pleaded defamatory allegations, were defamatory and false. Because we find, after review of the whole record, that the evidence was sufficient to demonstrate \u201cclearly and convincingly\u201d that the article was defamatory and false and that the defendants acted with actual malice \u2014 and hence to meet the <em>New York Times </em>standard \u2014 we do not reach the issue whether Tavoulareas was a \u201cpublic figure.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">II. The Legal Standard</p>\n<p id=\"AkG\">The constitutional standard of liability for public figures, as established by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>the Supreme Court in <em>New York Times </em>and restated in <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974), is well settled. A public figure cannot recover for defamatory falsehoods, no matter how damaging and how utterly baseless, unless he can show \u201cactual mal<em>ice\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., establish by <em>\u201cclear and convincing proof </em>that the defamatory falsehood was made with <em>knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard for the truth.\u201d Gertz, </em>418 U.S. at 342, 94 S.Ct. at 3008 (emphasis added). The Court consistently has refused to apply objective standards to determining actual malice; no matter how unreasonable the defamatory statement, the defendant cannot be held accountable unless he \u201cin fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication.\u201d <em>St. Amant v. Thompson, </em>390 U.S. 727, 731, 88 S.Ct. 1323, 1325, 20 L.Ed.2d 262 (1968). At issue, then, is the <em>state of mind </em>of the defendants.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Proof of mental state very often \u201cdepends ... on the credibility of the witnesses, which can best be determined by the trier of facts after observation of the demeanor of the witnesses during direct and cross-examination.\u201d <em>Morrison v. Nissan Motor Co., </em>601 F.2d 139, 141 (4th Cir.1979) (cases cited); <em>accord, Mutual Fund Investors, Inc. v. Putnam Management Co., </em>553 F.2d 620, 624 (9th Cir.1977). Thus, in the ordinary case, federal courts are reluctant to decide state of mind issues in summary fashion. <em>See, e.g., Morrison, </em>601 F.2d at 141. It is not that summary disposition is disfavored when the issue is the mental state of the defendant; rather, the very nature of the inquiry is frequently so bound up with the weighing of credibility that courts, as a practical matter, will only infrequently find the fact's regarding mental state so crystal-clear that a reasonable jury could reach only one conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">A few courts have argued that the public interest in fostering free debate requires that summary disposition be used especially freely in defamation cases \u2014 that it should, in fact, be the \u201crule,\u201d rather than the \u201cexception.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Oliver v. Village Voice, Inc., </em>417 F.Supp. 235, 237 (S.D. N.Y.1976); <em>Guitar v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., </em>396 F.Supp. 1042, 1053 (S.D.N. Y.), <em>aff'd, </em>538 F.2d 309 (2d Cir.1976). Summary judgment, in particular, is said to be necessary because the suit itself, not merely the unfavorable verdict, could \u201cchill\u201d protected speech: Due to the possibly overwhelming expense of even a successfully defended defamation action, the threat of litigation itself may cause potential defendants to steer far wider of the unlawful zone and act as self-censors. <em>See, e.g., New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 279, 84 S.Ct. 710, 725, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964) (quoting <em>Speiser v. Randall, </em>357 U.S. 513, 526, 78 S.Ct. 1332,1342, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958)) (\u201c[Critics] tend to make only statements which \u2018steer far wider of the unlawful zone.\u2019 \u201d). The theory is that frivolous suits should be ended quickly by summary proceedings. By analogy, it could be argued that \u201c[t]he policies governing the propriety of summary judgment presumably apply to motions for directed verdict and for judgment n.o.v.\u201d R. Sack, Libel, Slander, and Related Problems 557 (1980). But that is not the case. Whatever value <em>summary judgment </em>has in sparing defamation defendants the expense of actually going to trial, there is no such value in <em>judgments n.o.v., </em>for they come into being <em>after </em>the trial is over and virtually all of the expense has been incurred. Strictly in terms of court costs and legal fees, the \u201cchill\u201d is the same whether judgment after trial is based on a jury verdict or a judgment n.o.v.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">In any event, the general proposition that summary proceedings are favored in defamation law has been seriously undercut by recent Supreme Court pronounce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>ments. The Court, recognizing the critical role credibility frequently plays in assessing mental state, has acknowledged that \u201cproof of \u2018actual malice\u2019 ... does not readily lend itself to summary disposition,\u201d and expressed \u201csome doubt\u201d that summary judgment should be considered the \u201crule\u201d rather than the \u201cexception\u201d in defamation cases. <em>Hutchinson v. Proxmire, </em>443 U.S. 111, &amp; 120 n. 9, 99 S.Ct. 2675, 2680 n. 9, 61 L.Ed.2d 411 (1979); <em>see also Liberty Lobby, Inc. v. Anderson, </em>746 F.2d 1563,1570 (D.C. Cir.1984).

The question thus is whether the evidence and the reasonable inferences derived from it, when examined in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, establishes by <em>clear and convincing evidence </em>that the defendants acted with knowledge that the charge was false or with reckless disregard of its truth or falsity-</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">But a court evaluating a defamation verdict which significantly involves First Amendment considerations must be far less deferential to the verdict of the jury. The Supreme Court held in <em>New York Times v. Sullivan </em>that in public figure defamation cases courts \u201cmust \u2018make an <em>independent examination of the whole record,\u2019 </em>... so as to assure [themselves] that the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.\u201d 376 U.S. at 285, 84 S.Ct. at 729 (quoting <em>Edwards v. South Carolina, </em>372 U.S. 229, 235, 83 S.Ct. 680, 683, 9 L.Ed.2d 697 (1963) (emphasis added). This principle has been consistently followed by the Court in subsequent cases. <em>See, e.g., St. Amant v. Thompson, </em>390 U.S. 727, 732-33, 88 S.Ct. 1323,1326, 20 L.Ed.2d 262 (1968); <em>Greenbelt Cooperative Publishing Ass\u2019n v. Bresler, </em>398 U.S. 6, 11, 90 S.Ct. 1537, 1540, 26 L.Ed.2d 6 (1970). The rule has been recognized and followed by the courts of appeals. <em>See Guam Federation, supra, </em>492 F.2d at 442 (recognizing duty to \u201cmake an independent evaluation of the whole record\u201d) (quoting <em>Edwards v. South Carolina, </em>372 U.S. 229, 235, 83 S.Ct. 680, 683, 9 L.Ed.2d 697 (1963)); <em>Alioto, </em>519 F.2d at 780 (court must examine record and evaluate evidence itself on issue of actual malice).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed that rule in <em>Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984). The court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-13\">The question whether the evidence in the record in a defamation case is of the convincing clarity required to strip the utterance of First Amendment protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>is not merely a question for the trier of fact. Judges, as expositors of the Constitution, <em>must independently decide whether the evidence in the record is sufficient </em>to cross the constitutional threshold that bars the entry of any judgment that is not supported by clear and convincing proof of \u201cactual malice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AY\"><em>Id. </em>104 S.Ct. at 1965 (emphasis added). This is the standard that controls our review of the record in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The issue <em>Bose </em>presents in the present context is whether we are to apply our independent judgment to each separate fact determination that forms the basis for the ultimate conclusion of \u201cactual malice,\u201d or rather only to the ultimate conclusion of clear and convincing proof of \u201cactual malice.\u201d For a number of reasons, we think the latter is the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">First, the Court\u2019s expression of its holding in <em>Bose </em>is phrased only in terms of the ultimate issue; and certiorari had been granted only \u201cto consider whether the Court of Appeals erred when it refused to apply the clearly erroneous standard of Rule 52(a) to the District Court\u2019s \u2018finding\u2019 of actual malice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1955. Admittedly, independent review of the ultimate issue, of course, could be thought to subsume independent review of the preliminary factual issues on which it is based. But as detailed below, the Supreme Court discussed extensively the distinction between purely factual findings and so-called ultimate facts to repel such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">Second, the court of appeals decision affirmed in <em>Bose </em>had <em>not </em>questioned the fact-finder\u2019s preliminary factual determinations. The issue under review was whether it could properly be found defamatory, under an \u201cactual malice\u201d standard, for the defendant to print that the loudspeakers manufactured by the plaintiff caused musical instruments to sound as though they were wandering \u201cabout the room.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court noted, the court of appeals had accepted all the district court\u2019s factual findings, observing \u201cthat it \u2018was in no position to consider the credibility of witnesses and must leave such questions of demeanor to the trier of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1955 (quoting 692 F.2d at 195). The Supreme Court noted with approval this refusal of the court of appeals to second-guess credibility findings of the factfinder. <em>Id. </em>at 1958.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Court likewise did not question them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-11\">We may accept all of the purely factual findings of the District Court and nevertheless hold as a matter of law that the record does not contain clear and convincing evidence that Seligson or his employer prepared the loudspeaker article with knowledge that it contained a false statement, or with reckless disregard of the truth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 1967. What both the court of appeals and the Supreme Court held was that <em>in the reviewing court\u2019s own judgment, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>these accepted preliminary facts did not support <em>the ultimate conclusion </em>of clear and convincing proof of actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">It is entirely clear, then, that <em>Bose </em>does not <em>hold </em>that any factual determination other than the ultimate conclusion may be independently reviewed. The only question is whether it <em>suggests </em>so. One indication that it does not is the following statement in the opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">Rule 52(a) commands that \u201cdue regard\u201d shall be given to the trial judge\u2019s opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses; the constitutionally-based rule of independent review permits this opportunity to be given its due.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1959. Unless one attributes to this statement the unthinkable obfuscation that \u201cpermitting the opportunity to be given its due\u201d includes ignoring the factfinder\u2019s credibility determination and making an independent judgment, this must mean that <em>de novo </em>review does not apply to those preliminary factual determinations based on credibility. Since this typically includes most preliminary factual determinations, there would be little sense in preserving the \u201cindependent judgment\u201d rule for the remainder.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">That <em>Bose </em>addresses only the ultimate question of actual malice is shown, thirdly, by its reliance upon the distinction between questions of fact (which are governed by Rule 52(a)) and questions of law (which are for the court). \u201cAt some point,\u201d the Court says, \u201cthe reasoning by which a fact is \u2018found\u2019 crosses the line between application of those ordinary principles of logic and common experience which are ordinarily entrusted to the finder of fact into the realm of a legal rule upon which the reviewing court must exercise its own independent judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1960 n. 17. And again: \u201cWhen the standard governing the decision of a particular case is provided by the Constitution, this Court\u2019s role in <em>marking out the limits of the standard </em>through the process of case-by-ease adjudication is of special importance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1961 (emphasis added). Such descriptions, and such reliance upon the law-fact distinction, makes sense as applied to the ultimate issue of whether, given certain facts, the constitutional standard of \u201cactual malice\u201d has been met. The Court\u2019s statements in <em>Bose </em>would make little sense if applied to such preliminary issues as whether the reporter was told thus-and-so by a particular source.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">In sum, if the Court\u2019s statement in <em>Bose </em>that \u201cFirst Amendment questions of \u2018constitutional fact\u2019 compel this Court\u2019s <em>de novo </em>review,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1964 n. 27, is not limited to the <em>ultimate constitutional fact (e.g., </em>whether the writing was \u201cobscene,\u201d whether there was a \u201cclear and present danger,\u201d or, in the context of the present case, whether there was \u201cactual malice\u201d), then we see no rational stopping point short of holding that all factual issues in a First Amendment case are for the court. To embrace that kind of <em>de novo </em>review, as advocated by the dissent, would eviscerate the role of the jury and, in effect, vest appellate courts with original jurisdiction in libel actions. There is no indication that <em>Bose </em>was meant to set forth such a sweeping proposition. Indeed, its frequent references to the continuing applicability of Rule 52(a) would be incomprehensible on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">This searching review of the evidence is fully harmonious with the established rule that in evaluating such evidence, all reasonable inferences must be granted to the plaintiff. The <em>Guam Federation-Alioto </em>line of cases correctly applied the <em>New York Times </em>requirement of re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>view of the entire record, and nothing in <em>Bose </em>indicates that they are no longer good law.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Moreover, neither <em>New York Times </em>nor <em>Bose </em>suggests that a district court or a court of appeals is to substitute its assessment of credibility or its general appraisal of the evidence for that of the jury. Courts reviewing the determinations of a factfinder \u2014 be it judge or jury \u2014 are not to examine the evidence of the plaintiffs and that of the defendants and decide which to believe. That is the function of the fact-finder. Rather, they must carefully examine the evidence, draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict of the jury, and then determine whether that evidence demonstrates clearly and convincingly that the defendant acted with actual malice.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">With the Supreme Court\u2019s admonitions in mind, and cognizant of our duty to \u201cexercise [our] independent judgment and determine whether the record establishes actual malice with convincing clarity,\u201d <em>Bose, </em>at 1967, we turn to the required extended examination of the evidence as it relates to that issue. Such independent inquiry convinces us that the evidence is sufficient to clearly and convincingly establish actual malice, which the jury found existed on the part of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">Before we begin our actual malice discussion, though, we first consider two issues necessary to reinstating the jury verdict, namely the defamatory character of the article and proof of falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">III. Defamation and Falsity</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">1. <em>Defamatory Character of the November 30 Article</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">Statements do not constitute actionable defamation merely because they are false. They must be demonstrated to be defamatory to the plaintiff. As the district court instructed the jury, consistent with the standard in the District of Columbia, a publication is defamatory if it \u201ctends to injure plaintiff in his trade, profession, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>or community standing, or lower him in the estimation of the community or subject him to scorn, ridicule, shame, contempt or embarrassment\u201d (Tr. 4548). <em>See Afro-American Publishing Co. v. Jaffee, </em>366 F.2d 649, 654 (D.C.Cir.1966). The Supreme Court has instructed us that \u201c[a] publication claimed to be defamatory must be read and construed in the sense in which the readers to whom it is addressed would ordinarily understand it.\u201d <em>Washington Post Co. v. Chaloner, </em>250 U.S. 290, 293, 39 S.Ct. 448, 448, 63 L.Ed. 987 (1919). It is clear that while we must consider each portion of the article specified in the complaint, the words should not be considered in isolation; they must be ascribed their plain and natural meaning in the context of the article <em>as a whole. </em>In addition to the plain text, we consider what the article conveys through its structure, implications, and connotations.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">The theme of the <em>Post </em>article here is expressed in its headline \u2014 \u201cMobil Chief Sets Up Son In Venture\u201d and in the lead paragraph \u2014 \u201cMobil Oil Corp. president William P. Tavoulareas set up his son five years ago as a partner in a London-based shipping management firm that has since done millions of dollars in business operating Mobil-owned ships under exclusive, no-bid contracts.\u201d <em>See </em>Appendix. William Tavoulareas maintains that the article reasonably implies that he breached his fiduciary duties to Mobil, that he wasted and misused Mobil assets, and that he wrongfully directed those assets to his son Peter for his benefit (Tr. 4550). The <em>Post </em>attempts to trivialize the import of the phrase \u201cset up\u201d and argues that it was \u201cjust a simple way of describing how something came to be.\u201d Brief of <em>Post </em>at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">The district court, in ruling on the motion for judgment n.o.v., concluded that the term \u201cset up\u201d \u201cmay not be the most felicitous choice of vocabulary that could have been used to describe the situation but ... it cannot be said that it was a lie or a reckless untruth.\u201d 567 F.Supp. at 659. The court similarly rejected, as unreasonable as a matter of law, the conclusion that the article implied that William Tavoulareas put together the whole Mobil-Atlas-Samarco arrangement solely for the sake of his son. <em>Id. </em>at 660. The November 30 article, the court said, also does not impliedly accuse Tavoulareas of misusing Mobil assets. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">We conclude that the district court was in error and hold that both the phrase \u201cset up,\u201d in the context used, and the article in general, defame William Tavoulareas.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Notwithstanding the fact that some statements in the article may imply that Mobil\u2019s involvement with Atlas was purportedly <em>justified </em>on legitimate business grounds, the article could reasonably be read to suggest that William Tavoulareas became involved with Atlas-Samarco primarily to benefit his son. Certainly, this was the interpretation that <em>Post </em>editors Peterson and Tyler gave the article.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Such interpretation by the jury would be wholly justified since in this case the article would have little or no news value if it merely intended to report a legitimate business act. At a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>minimum, the article implies that, irrespective of the motivation for creating the Mobil-Atlas-Samarco relationship, William misused Mobil assets and his position as president to advance his allegedly undeserving son \u2014 an act of corporate nepotism. Indeed, this interpretation of alleged nepotism was recognized by the district court as the basic theme of the article. 567 F.Supp. at 660. The caption and lead paragraph clearly connote this. This lead material sets the tone of the article which is not diminished by subsequent statements. On the contrary, the body of the story lends further support to such conclusion. While portions of the article are true, \u201cthe detain-er may be the more successful when he baits the hook with truth.\u201d <em>Afro-American, </em>366 F.2d at 655. The article\u2019s seemingly detailed support, which gives the impression that it states facts, lends apparent truth to its accusations. The other statements specifically challenged as false, <em>see </em>falsity discussion <em>infra, </em>in similar fashion contribute to the defamatory premise of alleged nepotism.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">We thus conclude that the November 30 article, in its headline and considered as a whole, would reasonably be understood by the average reader in the community as being defamatory in its implication that William Tavoulareas was guilty of corporate nepotism, breached his fiduciary duty to Mobil, and misused Mobil assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">2. <em>Falsity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">As the district court properly instructed the jury, liability for defamation requires, as part of the plaintiff\u2019s case and prior to a finding of actual malice, proof of falsity. <em>Garrison v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 64, 74, 85 S.Ct. 209, 215, 13 L.Ed.2d 125 (1964); <em>New York Times v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964). Because the jury returned verdicts against the <em>Post, </em>Golden, and Piro in favor of William Tavoulareas, it necessarily found that the challenged statements in the November 30 article were false. In granting judgment n.o.v., the trial court found that there was insufficient proof of actual malice and thus did not consider it necessary to address directly the issue of falsity. 567 F.Supp. at 654 n. 9. Tavoulareas maintains that the jury\u2019s finding of falsity \u201cremains undisturbed\u201d on appeal. Brief of Tavoulareas at 17a-17b. The defendants, while on appeal concentrating principally on the actual malice issue, rest on a general statement \u201cthat the story was in fact true.\u201d Brief of <em>Post </em>at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">In the circumstances of this case, the issue of actual malice, which is the major point on appeal, is intertwined with the issue of falsity of the defamatory allegations, since the evidence establishing falsity, and the degree of that evidence, overlaps with and constitutes much of the proof of actual malice. The issue of falsity was briefed and argued before the trial court, and constitutes part of the record that we have reviewed.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The procedural posture of this case, reviewing a grant of judgment n.o.v., makes the question of proof of falsity one of law. We accordingly address the falsity issue, and our subsequent discussion of the issue in connection with malice will implicitly expand upon the same point. For purposes of our review we assume, without deciding, that a showing of falsity requires clear and convincing proof.</p>\n<p id=\"AT7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Conclusions to be drawn from the evidence in this case, particularly with respect to the issues of falsity and actual malice, depend in large part on the determination of the credibility of the principal witnesses.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> As previously detailed, we must view the evidence, with all inferences reasonably to be drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to the party against whom the judgment n.o.v. was ordered, <em>i.e., </em>the plaintiff. <em>Guam Federation of Teachers, Local 1581 v. Ysrael, </em>492 F.2d 438, 439-41 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 872, 95 S.Ct. 132, 42 L.Ed.2d 111 (1974); <em>see </em>discussion and cases cited in Section II <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">On the key charge that William Tavoulareas \u201cset up\u201d his son in the shipping business, the evidence of truth is (1) Comnas\u2019 alleged statement \u2014 as testified by Tyler \u2014 that Comnas had taken Peter into the firm only because William suggested it and (2) Piro\u2019s assertion that William had once said that he had given Peter a \u201cnudge\u201d to get him into the shipping business. As to the first, William Tavoulareas\u2019 testimony flatly contradicted Comnas\u2019 alleged accusation (Tr. 1425), as did William\u2019s prior testimony before the SEC (J.A. 2398-2459). The defendants at trial did not produce Comnas\u2019 deposition testimony, though he was their <em>principal source </em>relied upon for the charges made in the article. Nothing uncovered in the <em>Post\u2019s </em>massive pretrial discovery and none of the <em>Post\u2019s </em>witnesses except defendants Piro and Tyler, provides any basis for the charge that William \u201cset up\u201d Peter. As to Piro, Golden testified that at his first meeting with him, Piro told him that \u201cWilliam Tavoulareas had set up his son in a shipping company that made him an overnight millionaire,\u201d or \u201cwords to that effect\u201d (Tr. 164-65). Piro never denied he said this at that meeting, but only denied using the words \u201cset up\u201d at the subsequent meeting at The Owl restaurant (Tr. 2897). As to defendant Tyler he is discussed below regarding the \u201csecond allegation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">As to the \u201cnudge\u201d statement, even if it can be considered a reference to Peter\u2019s landing the job at Atlas instead of his first shipping-related job at Lemos, the jury had only Piro\u2019s unsupported recollection of the statement. William flatly denied ever making such a remark to Piro (Tr. 1349). The jury in weighing credibility obviously could accept William\u2019s testimony over Piro\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">The second allegation William Tavoulareas challenges as false is that he \u201cpersonally urged\u201d that Peter be included as an equity partner in Atlas. The statement is unattributed in the article. William Tavoulareas testified that he never urged that his son be included in Atlas (Tr. 1293-94,1296-97, 1433).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Defendants rely on a statement allegedly made in a conversation between Tyler and Comnas for the truth of the statement, <em>but the defendants never introduced Comnas\u2019 deposition at trial</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The conversation was received through Tyler\u2019s testimony (J.A. 979, 981, 1150, 2054, 2074-75, 2498, 2674, 3141, 3143, 3157), which the jury was entitled to weigh and to credit or discredit as it deemed appropriate.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> When pressed to relay what Comnas purportedly said to him, Tyler testified that \u201cI don\u2019t recall\u201d whether Comnas said specifically that \u201cWilliam <em>personally urged </em>him [Comnas] to take his son into the [Atlas] operation,\u201d but stated only that he used \u201cwords to that effect\u201d (J.A. 981). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Piro admitted that he had told Tyler he had \u201cno knowledge\u201d of whether William Tavoulareas had requested or urged that his son be included in Atlas (Tr. 292-93).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The district court, in discussing \u201cactual malice,\u201d indicated that Kousi\u2019s \u201cnepotistic act\u201d comment could be interpreted to support the \u201cpersonally urged-set-up\u201d allegation, 567 F.Supp. at 659. However, as to the issue of falsity, there was no evidence that this comment was based on personal knowledge. <em>See </em>note 45 <em>infra. </em>If the testimony of Tavoulareas is believed and that of the defendants and their witnesses disbelieved, as would have been reasonable for the jury to have found, the allegations are clearly false.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The third allegation in the article was that \u201cthe elder [William] Tavoulareas [personally] dispatched ... Herman [sic] F. Hoffmann ... to help run Atlas.\u201d The defendants rely on three sources for the truth of this statement: (1) Paul Wolfe\u2019s testimony that William Tavoulareas \u201cparticipated\u201d in discussions where it was decided that Hoffmann would replace Comnas (Tr. 1193); (2) Mobil\u2019s November 20, 1979 letter to Tyler stating that William Tavoulareas was involved in <em>Comnas\u2019 departure </em>(J.A. 2345 (Plaintiffs\u2019 Ex. 23)) (presumably, as defendants urge, \u201cto open the door\u201d for Hoffmann\u2019s arrival); and (3) Piro\u2019s testimony that he had overheard Tavoulareas state to Mobil Vice-President Checket \u201cthat he [Tavoulareas] had sent Harmon Hoffmann over to Atlas after Comnas had left\u201d (Tr. 3720-21). The first two of these do not represent a clear assertion that Tavoulareas had any personal hand in deciding that Hoffmann would be dispatched, and are at best very weak circumstantial evidence to that effect. William Tavoulareas testified that he did not personally send Hoffmann to Atlas (Tr. 1440). Paul Wolfe testified that it was <em>he </em>who recommended <em>to Mobil Chairman Rawleigh Warner </em>(in the presence of William Tavoulareas) that Comnas be replaced (Tr. 1069, 1070, 1098, 1186).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Checket denied that the alleged conversation between himself and Tavoulareas ever took place (J.A. 1844-48). Again, if the testimony of Tavoulareas, Wolfe, or Checket is believed, which we conclude reasonable inferences from the record permitted the jury to find, the statement that Tavoulareas personally dispatched Hoffmann is false.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-14\">In conclusion, our review of the record reveals evidence that, when resolved in the light most favorable to the jury verdict, as it must be, demonstrates convincingly that the alleged defamatory statements in the November 30 article are clearly false.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Additionally, our succeeding examination of the record on the \u201cactual malice\u201d question discloses further evidence which, under our prescribed standard of review, demonstrates that the challenged statements are clearly and convincingly false. Rather than to duplicate that discussion here, we refer to our actual malice discussion, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>IY. Reckless Disregard of Truth or Falsity \u2014 Actual Malice</p>\n<p id=\"A7Z\">We first note that the defendants have uniformly denied that they knew what they wrote was false or that they had serious doubts about its truthfulness. They have testified that they honestly believed the stories were true. The defendants argue that \u201c[t]his unimpeached testimony as to the mental elements of actual malice is \u2018dispositive.\u2019 \u201d Brief of <em>Post </em>at 32. The defendants\u2019 apparent claim is that actual malice can be proved only if the reporter or editor confesses to having had actual doubts regarding the truthfulness of the defamatory articles.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">But courts do not labor under such unreasonable rules regarding evidence. As the Supreme Court has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARZ\">The defendant in a defamation action ... cannot ... automatically insure a favorable verdict by testifying that he published with a belief that the statements were true. <em>The finder of fact </em>must determine whether the publication was indeed made in good faith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-5\"><em>St. Amant, supra, </em>390 U.S. at 732, 88 S.Ct. at 1326 (emphasis added). Hence, a defamation plaintiff is not required to accept the word of the defendant as to his state of mind any more than the government or a jury is required to take the word of a criminal defendant that he lacked the intent required for a criminal conviction. In <em>any </em>case where the mental state of the actor is at issue, it can be proved by the <em>cumulation </em>of circumstantial evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">[I]n attempting to meet the test the plaintiff may rely upon \u201cevidence of negligence, of motive and of intent ... for the purpose of establishing, by <em>cumular tion </em>and by appropriate inferences,\u201d the requisite degree of culpability. Mere statements by the defendant of his belief in the truth of a publication will carry the day only if they are not overridden by evidence establishing knowing or \u201creckless\u201d falsity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">R. Sack, <em>supra, </em>at 214 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Goldwater v. Ginzburg, </em>414 F.2d 324, 342 (2d Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 1049, 90 S.Ct. 701, 24 L.Ed.2d 695 (1970)). Although recklessness in the defamation arena requires a showing of subjective doubts, <em>see St. Am-ant, supra, </em>390 U.S. at 731, 88 S.Ct. at 1325, it \u201cis ordinarily inferred from objective facts.\u201d <em>Washington Post Co. v.

As the First Circuit has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-9\">The subjective determination of whether [a defendant] in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of the statement may be proved by inference, as it would be rare for a defendant to admit such doubts____ A court typically will infer actual malice from objective facts ____ These facts should provide evidence of negligence, motive, and intent such that an <em>accumulation </em>of the evidence and appropriate inferences supports the existence of actual malice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-12\"><em>Bose Corp. v.

Each of the major categories of evidence will be discussed in turn, though their order of appearance is not meant to reflect their relative importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-16\">1. <em>The Christine Peterson Memorandum</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-17\">After Tyler wrote his first story, it entered into the <em>Post\u2019s </em>editing process. During the course of that process it was given to copy editor Christine Peterson for editing. After reviewing the article, and prior to publication, Peterson sent a memorandum to assignment editor Peter Milius. The memorandum stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-18\">I\u2019ve read the Mobil story several times, and while I\u2019m impressed with the amount of work the reporter obviously did, I\u2019m still left with an overwhelming sense of So What? Is there any way to give this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>story of high-level nepotism a dollars- and-cents angle? Did Mobil\u2019s shareholders lose anything? Mobil\u2019s customers? <em>Parts of Tyler\u2019s case against Tavoulareas seem tenuous, and the whole </em>\u2014 a <em>$680,00-a-year </em>[sic] <em>plaything for an indulged son, at worst </em>\u2014 just <em>seems like a withered peanut in an 84\" gilded shell. </em>A far more interesting angle, it seems to me, is Mobil\u2019s concern about Saudi preference shipping \u2014 a concern so profound that it led to the formation of an entire dummy corporation. <em>It\u2019s impossible to believe that Tavoulareas alone could put together such a scheme for the sake of his son\u2019s business career, or that he would want to.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">(J.A. 2486) (emphasis added). Peterson, who at the time was still in the employ of the <em>Post, </em>testified at trial that when she used the phrase \u201cimpossible to believe\u201d she did not really <em>mean </em>that the story was \u201cimpossible to believe\u201d \u2014 only that she felt that \u201cthe focus of the story should have been the formation of the company Samar-co in anticipation of preference shipping\u201d (J.A. 1837). Peterson, as a <em>Post </em>employee, was an interested witness, and the jury was entitled to evaluate her testimony accordingly. It was not obliged to credit her subsequent protestations that she did not really mean what she wrote.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Not surprisingly, the district court found the interpretation offered by the defendants to be \u201cstrained.\u201d 567 P.Supp. at 655. A reasonable reading of the memorandum is that (1) Peterson read the article as saying that William Tavoulareas led Mobil into the Samarco-Atlas venture substantially as a means of benefitting his son, and (2) she found the charges in the article, as she wrote, \u201cimpossible to believe.\u201d This is the district court\u2019s independent evaluation of the facts as set forth in the article.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">The district court, relying heavily on what it felt to be Peterson\u2019s relatively minor role in the editing process<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and the fact that she testified that she had done no independent research on the story, found that she was merely \u201cexpressing her uninformed opinion that she found the story hard to believe.\u201d (Her actual appraisal was that the article was <em>\u201cimpossible </em>to believe.\u201d) The district court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-11\">If Ms. Peterson had investigated the article\u2019s substance and sources and thereafter had expressed a similar statement of doubt as to the article\u2019s veracity, plaintiff\u2019s argument might prevail. Plaintiff, however, has offered no evidence to this effect. The actual malice test focuses on the state of mind of the author and publisher of the allegedly libelous statements. Ms. Peterson\u2019s memorandum <em>does not show that those who were responsible for the article\u2019s substance entertained any doubts whatsoever about its accuracy.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">567 F.2d at 655 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">The district court\u2019s conclusion, however, depends entirely upon the court\u2019s finding that copy editors at the <em>Post </em>have <em>no responsible </em>role in preparing articles for publication. The court\u2019s opinion implicitly credited the defendants\u2019 testimony and its reasonable inferences. Yet, the character of the Peterson memorandum and the responses it evoked within the <em>Post </em>organization indicate that her job involved more than mere proofreading. It is undisputed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>that copy editors are responsible for so-called \u201cstyle\u201d editing (which involves control over the exact language that will be used in the article) and for checking at least some of the facts in a story. <em>See </em>note 31 <em>supra. </em>Although at trial she described her position as having a very limited role, Peterson in her memorandum apparently felt free to question the substance of an article, indicate the direction it should take, and suggest substantive changes \u2014 the sort of things that persons who <em>did </em>have responsibility would do. Moreover, as we shall see, those <em>Post </em>employees who unquestionably had final responsibility for the article\u2019s content took her comments seriously and did not treat them as the remarks of someone poking in where she did not belong. Thus, it is not clear that even Peterson\u2019s ordinary duties gave her no responsibility for the article\u2019s content, and a jury reasonably could infer from Peterson\u2019s memorandum and the responses it evoked that her job was more responsible than she claimed.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">But exclusive concentration on Peterson\u2019s ordinary responsibilities is in any event misplaced. The <em>Post </em>cannot avoid liability merely by pointing to responsibilities assigned in the newspaper\u2019s organizational chart. That an employee\u2019s or agent\u2019s job duties are so limited is relevant but not dispositive. Peterson\u2019s memorandum to Milius, and the reaction of other editors to it, permitted the jury to find that at least one <em>Post </em>editor who exercised some responsibility for the story had a serious doubt about the accuracy of the charge made in the article that William Tavoulareas, as president of Mobil Oil Corporation, improperly used his office to \u201cset up\u201d his son in Atlas.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">But even if the district court was correct, and Peterson had only a minor role in the process, her memorandum is still relevant because of the objections it raised. The issue is not whether the memorandum <em>alone </em>proves clearly and convincingly that the article was published with actual malice; it is whether it is evidence that, taken in conjunction with other evidence, tends to prove that fact clearly and convincingly. It does. Peterson\u2019s appraisal of the story gains force from the reasonableness of its interpretation and conclusion. Thus, looked at in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, the memorandum indicates that, prior to publication, serious doubts about the accuracy of the article had been voiced within the <em>Post\u2019s </em>editorial staff and communicated to those who prepared the article. The memorandum was written to Milius, an editor who apparently <em>did </em>have responsibility for the substantive aspects of the story. Milius apparently gave the Peterson memorandum enough credence to send it to Tyler for his response. Tyler thus learned that at least one editor doubted the correctness of his central premise. Tyler wrote a memorandum responding to Peterson\u2019s which was directed to yet another <em>Post </em>editor, Bill Greider, who also had authority over the substance of the article. Though alerted to the \u201csensitive\u201d nature of the story, Greider testified that he had no \u201cspecific recollection\u201d of reviewing with Tyler any of his documents or notes (J.A. 1887-88, 1895-97). Thus, at the very least, reporter Tyler and editors Milius and Greider were aware of Peterson\u2019s misgivings and may have recognized the merit in her analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">Tyler\u2019s memorandum to Greider responded specifically to Peterson\u2019s statement that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>the story was \u201cimpossible to believe. He acknowledged that \u201c[bjecause we base a couple of key points in the story on one source, I can see why a <em>good editor </em>might say that part of our case against Tavoulareas seems tenuous.\u201d (Emphasis added.) But he defended his reliance on that single source \u2014 presumably Comnas \u2014 because of the source\u2019s \u201cbackground, position in the company and overall credibility\u201d (J.A. 2489-90). (As anyone with passing familiarity with the matters here at issue would have known, Comnas\u2019 background was in fact checkered and his credibility highly suspect. <em>See </em>section IY.7.B. <em>infra.) </em>Tyler was far more concerned with Peterson\u2019s statement that the article was \u201cuninteresting\u201d than her assertion that it was \u201cimpossible to believe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">In our opinion it is clear that a jury reasonably could infer from the Peterson memorandum and its surrounding circumstances that (1) serious doubts were circulating within the <em>Post\u2019s </em>newsroom while the article was being prepared, (2) at least three responsible individuals who participated in reviewing the substance of the article (four, if Peterson\u2019s participation is found to have been sufficiently responsible) were aware of such doubts, and (3) the article was published without apparent additional investigation and without substantial change. This evidence <em>supports </em>the conclusion that the defendants had reason to believe that the story was false and that they acted recklessly in publishing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">2. <em>The Defendants\u2019Motivation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The plaintiffs in this case produced evidence which, they argue, demonstrates that (1) one defendant, Piro, had strong personal ill-will toward the plaintiffs; (2) enthusiastic reporters Tyler and Golden were out to \u201cget\u201d the elder Tavoulareas; and (3) the <em>Post </em>had a policy favoring sensational ex-pos\u00e9s. The plaintiffs argue that this evidence \u2014 the first two elements of which demonstrate common law malice \u2014 provides a <em>motive </em>to publish derogatory information without regard to falsity, and hence is evidence that the defendants acted knowingly or recklessly in publishing their falsehoods. The defendants argue that <em>actual </em>malice, not common law malice, is required in defamation cases and that the evidence of motive is therefore irrelevant. The district court did not address this issue specifically in its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">It is clear, as the defendants argue, that common law malice is not the equivalent of actual malice in the defamation context, and that common law malice alone will not support a finding of actual malice. <em>Beckley Newspapers Corp. v. Hanks, </em>389 U.S. 81, 82, 88 S.Ct. 197, 198, 19 L.Ed.2d 248 (1967) (per curiam); <em>Henry v. Collins, </em>380 U.S. 356, 357, 85 S.Ct. 992, 993, 13 L.Ed.2d 892 (1965) (per curiam). Similarly, the mere fact that a newspaper has a general policy favoring sensational or even muckraking stories does not, in itself, prove that a defendant acted with actual malice. <em>Martin Marietta Corp. v. Evening Star Newspaper Co., 417 </em>F.Supp. 947, 959 (D.D.C.1976). But, contrary to the assertions of the defendants, it is equally well settled that the presence of common law malice or evidence that a newspaper followed a sensationalistic policy, because it provides a <em>motive </em>for knowing or reckless falsehood, is <em>evidence </em>of actual malice. <em>See, e.g., Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, </em>388 U.S. 130, 169, 87 S.Ct. 1975, 1999, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094 (1967) (Warren, C.J., concurring) (defendant had adopted a \u201cprogram of \u2018sophisticated muckraking,\u2019 designed to \u2018provoke people, make them mad\u2019 \u201d) (footnote omitted); <em>Goldwater v. Ginzburg, </em>414 F.2d 324, 342 (2d Cir.1969) (\u201cevidence of ... motive and intent\u201d may help establish actual malice), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 1049, 90 S.Ct. 701, 24 L.Ed.2d 695 (1970); <em>Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, </em>692 F.2d 189, 196 (1st Cir.1982) (same), <em>aff'd, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984); <em>Cochran v. Indianapolis Newspapers, Inc., </em>175 Ind.App. 548, 560, 372 N.E.2d 1211, 1220 (1978) (desire to \u201cget\u201d plaintiff is \u201crelevant and admissible <em>as evidence </em>in the determination of whether defendant possessed a state of mind highly conducive to reckless dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>regard of falsity\u201d); R. Sack, <em>supra, </em>at 214 n. 168 (\u201cAlthough common law actual malice \u2014 spite or ill-will \u2014 is not equivalent to or sufficient to prove constitutional \u2018actual malice,\u2019 evidence as to the former is admissible to prove the latter.\u201d). As the Supreme Court of West Virginia explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah7\">[W]hen <em>[Associated Press v. Walker, </em>388 U.S. 130, 87 S.Ct. 1975, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094 (1967)] and <em>Curtis </em>are read together, they still stand for the proposition that <em>personal motives on the part of a newspaper, </em>or participation by a newspaper in a plan or scheme to injure, <em>is evidence of recklessness and willful disregard for truth </em>which may be considered along with other evidence on the question of actual malice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><em>Sprouse v.

The mere existence of a preconceived plan to \u201cget\u201d the subject of a defamatory story does not prove that the publisher acted knowingly or recklessly in publishing false information. But it is beyond question that one who is seeking to harm the subject of a story \u2014 whether motivated by simple ill will <em>{Cochran), </em>or partisan political considerations <em>{Sprouse), </em>or otherwise laudable concern for the safety of the nation <em>{Ginzburg </em>), or a mere desire to attract attention and boost circulation <em>{Butts) </em>\u2014 is more likely to publish recklessly than one without such motive.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> We turn, then, to the evidence of the defendants\u2019 motive to \u201cget\u201d the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\"><em>Philip Piro. </em>Piro, who had gone through a very difficult divorce from William Tavoulareas\u2019 daughter, harbored strong feelings against his father-in-law. The district court in fact found that Piro</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaB\">was openly hostile to the Tavoulareas family and undoubtedly harbored a considerable amount of ill will towards them. In addition, Tyler testified that he was very skeptical about Piro\u2019s reliability because much of the information he supplied was inaccurate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">567 F.Supp. at 657. That finding is eminently supported by the record.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Knowledge by the <em>Post </em>of Piro\u2019s evident personal animosity against the Tavoulareases was a circumstance, which in combination with other evidence, was probative of a mental state conducive to the reckless disregard of falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\"><em>Patrick Tyler. </em>Reporter Tyler, unlike Piro, had little reason for <em>personal </em>animus against the Tavoulareases. The plaintiffs\u2019 evidence purports to demonstrate that Tyler wanted to \u201cget\u201d Mobil and the Tavoulareases, not for reasons of ill will but simply for the sake of a big story and because of Tyler\u2019s general bias against the oil industry. The plaintiffs rely on the following evidence:</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">1. Tyler, in a previous front-page story on the 1979 oil shortage (co-written with another reporter, Neumann) allegedly had seriously misstated the response of at least one Mobil official to Tyler\u2019s questions. That official wrote a letter to the editor, published a month later by the <em>Post, </em>in which he claimed he was \u201castounded\u201d at the reporters' implication that he had been unable to offer an explanation of the reason for the shortage, an implication he called \u201coutrageous.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> He wrote that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>\u201cexpect[ed] more responsible reporting\u201d than that reflected in the story.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">2. Golden\u2019s notes show that after the <em>initial </em>joint interview of Piro, Tyler remarked that \u201c[i]t is not every day you knock off one of the seven sisters\u201d (J.A. 789).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">3. During the Piro interview, Tyler asked Piro whether \u201che knew of a family member who would rifle [Tavoulareas\u2019] safe and [x]erox documents]\u201d (Tr. 179). The question was referred to during one of Golden\u2019s conversations with Piro; from the tape that was played to the jury, it appears that Piro believed that Tyler was joking, but Golden seemed to consider that the question was serious. Indeed, Golden later reminded Piro that Tyler had asked him (Piro) \u201cto commit a crime.\u201d Ex. 308-034801 (Side 2); (J.A. 821). Even the dissent is struck by the \u201ctroubling\u201d nature of this evidence. Dissent at 156. If made seriously, which a reasonable jury could conclude it was, this indicates that Tyler was so interested in getting Tavoulareas or Mobil that he would risk arranging a burglary and safe cracking, <em>i.e., </em>committing a felony to secure evidence. This is indicative of a very reckless state of mind and constitutes evidence of a plan to \u201cget\u201d Tavoulareas; the evaluation of this testimony was for the jury, who could reasonably infer the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">4. After Tyler saw the Peterson memorandum, which referred to \u201cTyler\u2019s case against Tavoulareas,\u201d he wrote his own memo to the editors, acknowledging that he could \u201csee why a <em>good </em>editor might say that part of <em>our case against Tavoulareas </em>seems tenuous\u201d (J.A. 2489) (emphasis added). The plaintiffs interpret this as an indication that Tyler conceived of himself as a sort of journalistic prosecutor, building a case against Tavoulareas, not a reporter attempting to accurately report f\u00e1cts.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-13\">5. After the article appeared, Mobil issued a statement denying the allegations in the story. Tavoulareas went to the <em>Post\u2019s </em>office to protest and requested a retraction, which was refused (J.A. 1439-42). A few days after the story appeared, Tyler talked to Golden on the telephone; Tyler told Golden that \u201c[t]he Post laughed at the Mobil statement\u201d; the <em>Post, </em>said Tyler, \u201cblew [Tavoulareas] out of the water,\u201d and sent him \u201chome with his tail between his legs\u201d (J.A. 857-58).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-14\">The evidence produced by the plaintiffs paints a picture of a reporter who, in developing and writing what he described as his \u201cstor[y] of nepotism, reward without merit and favoritism by those who wield vast amounts of power\u201d (J.A. 2488), knowingly adopted an adversarial stance toward Tavoulareas. Such a mindset, which the jury could reasonably have found, is highly probative of whether he acted knowingly or recklessly in writing his falsehoods.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-15\"><em>Sandy Golden. </em>Golden, like Tyler, had no apparent personal animosity toward the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>plaintiffs. He was then working for a small suburban newspaper, and the evidence shows that he badly wanted a job at the <em>Post. </em>In a telephone interview with Piro \u2014 Golden tape-recorded it although he expressly told Piro that he was not doing so \u2014 he explained his motivation for the Tavoulareas story:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-4\">Obviously, I\u2019m trying to work myself into a job at the <em>Post </em>through this story, and that\u2019s all well and good.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Ex. 308-034805 (Side 1). Golden expected to get <em>some </em>compensation from the <em>Post </em>\u2014$50 or $100 \u2014 but immediate money was not his chief motivation. <em>Id. </em>Rather, the Tavoulareas story was to be his ticket to at least a <em>Post </em>byline, and perhaps a <em>Post </em>job offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The Golden-Piro tapes, relevant to the issue of intent, were played for the jury. The jury thus heard Piro and Golden speculating about what Mobil Chairman Rawleigh Warner would do when the story broke, and Piro\u2019s obvious pleasure at Golden\u2019s suggestion that the elder Tavoulareas would be fired.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The jury also heard Golden\u2019s reference to a United States Senator whom Tavoulareas had offended as a \u201cpossible enemy\u201d who would be willing to \u201ctalk\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">Q Now, on this tape that we have just listened to a U.S. Senator was identified as a possible enemy. Those were your words with the words \u201cpossible enemy\u201d; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-8\">A That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-9\">Q Did you mean by that a person who had a motive for revenge against the plaintiff, William Tavoulareas?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-10\">A I meant somebody would have a reason to talk about Mr. Tavoulareas, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-14\">Q A reason to say bad things about Mr. Tavoulareas?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-15\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-16\">(J.A. 815.)</p>\n<p id=\"b190-17\">In sum, the evidence showed that Golden was an ambitious young reporter looking for his big break. He was anxious to take part in a \u201cmajor\u201d investigative story and to earn a <em>Post </em>byline. His willingness to engage in activities that are, at best, highly questionable <em>(e.g., </em>surreptitiously recording Piro\u2019s conversations and playing them back to third parties) and the almost exclusive focus of his investigation on \u201cenemies\u201d <em>(e.g., </em>Piro and Stockton) who would tend to be biased sources for the story, is evidence that his primary motive in working on the story was to get a <em>byline </em>on a <em>Post </em>story. As discussed above, such evidence of motive has considerable bearing on whether or not he acted with actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-18\"><em>The Post. </em>The <em>Post </em>is a newspaper which seeks, among other things, hard-hitting investigative stories. Robert Woodward, its Assistant Managing Editor at all times relevant to this case, testified that he regularly conducted staff meetings at which he \u201cdescribe[d] the kind of stories [he] was looking for\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-19\">Q. Did you tell them you were looking for stories that would go on the front page, big, significant stories?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-20\">A. Not all significant stories go on the front page. I tried to describe the kind of coverage we should have and how we should direct our efforts, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-21\">. Q. Did you tell them you were looking for stories with impact?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-22\">A. Not precisely that word.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Q. In any of these discussions did you ever use a term such as \u201cI\u2019m looking for something called a holy shit story\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">A. Yes, I did....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">(J.A. 2176.) What Woodward meant in exhorting his reporters to come up with the \u201choly shit\u201d stories is not exactly clear, but a reasonable inference is that Woodward, as editor, wanted from his reporters the same kind of stories on which he built his own reputation: high-impact investigative stories of wrongdoing.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> During these meetings with reporters, Woodward also tried to imbue them with the same spirit to which he attributed his success:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">Q. ... Have you attempted to communicate some of the experiences and perhaps values that you had in your years as a reporter to those working for you after you became assistant managing editor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">A. I try.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">Q. Did you once describe your approach to being a reporter with words like, \u201cI guess you have to have a compulsive need to succeed. You have to be insecure and to want desperately to please your boss\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-10\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">(J.A. 2178.) From Woodward\u2019s testimony it was proper for the jurors to infer that the <em>Post </em>put some pressure on its reporters to come up with \u201choly shit\u201d stories \u2014 a category into which the Tavoulareas story (described by Peterson as one of \u201chigh-level nepotism\u201d in the corporate context) presumably fit. Regardless of whether one chooses to characterize this policy as conducive to \u201chard hitting investigative journalism,\u201d or (to borrow Chief Justice Warren\u2019s description of the policy of <em>The Saturday Evening Post </em>in <em>Butts) </em>\u201csophisticated muckraking,\u201d it certainly is relevant to the inquiry of whether a newspaper\u2019s employees acted in reckless disregard of whether a statement is false or not.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-14\">3. <em>Resolution of Inferences Adverse to the Plaintiffs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-15\">It is settled that in a situation where the facts are ambiguous, the mere selection of the most damaging inference by the reporter does not, <em>alone, </em>indicate actual malice. In <em>Time, Inc. v. Pape, </em>401 U.S. 279, 91 S.Ct. 633, 28 L.Ed.2d 45 (1971), the Court held that <em>Time </em>magazine\u2019s resolution of one such ambiguity in the light most damaging to the plaintiff did not amount to actual malice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-16\">Time\u2019s omission of the word \u201calleged\u201d amounted to the adoption ,of one of a number of possible rational interpretations of a document that bristled with ambiguities. The deliberate choice of such an interpretation, though arguably reflecting a misconception, was not <em>enough </em>to create a jury issue of \u201cmalice\u201d under <em>New York Times.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-17\"><em>Id. </em>at 290, 91 S.Ct. at 639 (emphasis added). As stated by the Court, this holding makes obvious sense; since the focus of the malice inquiry is <em>subjective, </em>not <em>objective, </em>the mere selection of a single damaging inference is ordinarily not <em>sufficient </em>to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>actual malice. The question is whether the reporter believed that the selected inference was true.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">The defendants argue from <em>Pape </em>that the <em>consistent </em>selection of the inferences most damaging to the Tavoulareases would be irrelevant to the issue of actual malice. Brief of <em>Post </em>at 62. Such an assertion, however, is entirely inconsistent with the <em>subjective </em>nature of the malice inquiry. One who publishes a story containing a damaging inference which he knows or seriously suspects is false is not shielded by the fact that what he wrote was objectively a reasonable inference. Certainly, a defendant\u2019s selection of a reasonable inference from among a number of ambiguities, whether damaging or not, may be evidence that he acted without malice. But a defendant\u2019s selection of the most damaging inference \u2014 an inference which is, in fact, false \u2014 may be probative of a determination to incorrectly describe the plaintiff, place him in the most damaging light, and thereby with other evidence demonstrate a state of mind that is probative of a reckless disregard for truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\"><em>Pape </em>offers no support for the defendants\u2019 analysis of the editorial conduct here. The Supreme Court explicitly stated only that choices made by reporters in the face of ambiguities were not <em>enough </em>to prove actual malice \u2014 it did <em>not </em>say that they were entirely <em>irrelevant </em>to the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">This conclusion is buttressed by the Fifth Circuit\u2019s holding in <em>Rebozo v. Washington Post Co., 637 </em>F.2d <em>375 (5th </em>Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 964, 102 S.Ct. 504, 70 L.Ed.2d 379 (1981). In <em>Rebozo, </em>the defendant reporter (Kessler) had written that the plaintiff (Rebozo) had \u201ccashed $91,500 in stolen stocks ... after he was told by an insurance investigator it was stolen.\u201d 637 F.2d at 377. A memorandum written by the reporter acknowledged that it was not entirely clear <em>who </em>had actually cashed the stocks, but that one inference was that it was Rebozo, a close friend and associate of President Nixon. The charge that it was Rebozo who had cashed the stocks made it a front page story. In passing on whether summary judgment was proper for the defendants, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-8\">This memorandum, <em>plus the fact that Kessler resolved the uncertainty expressed in it in such a way as to cast plaintiff Rebozo in the worst possible light and to make for Kessler a front-page story of an episode which otherwise might not have commanded any significant attention, </em>when taken in a light most favorable to Rebozo, could amount to <em>evidence </em>of the reporter\u2019s reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the assertion____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 382 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">The defendants call <em>Rebozo </em>\u201canomalous,\u201d and argue that its holding is \u201cutterly inconsistent with <em>Pape.\u201d </em>The district court considered that <em>Rebozo </em>\u201cis arguably inconsistent\u201d with <em>Pape, </em>and stated that \u201c[i]n the absence of any further guidance on the issue from this Circuit or the Supreme Court, this Court is not prepared to consider saving the verdict in this case on the basis of the holding in <em>Rebozo.\" 567 </em>F.Supp. at 658. This reasoning appears rooted in two misconceptions. The first\u2014 implicit in the opinions of the district court here and the dissent, <em>infra, </em>and the briefs of the defendants \u2014 is that the plaintiff must have at least one piece of evidence which, <em>by itself, </em>proves actual malice. This has been refuted previously. The plaintiff may clearly and convincing prove actual malice by a cumulation of many pieces of evidence, no one of which, by itself, is clear and convincing. Though \u201c[a] brick is not a wall,\u201d E. Cleary, McCormick\u2019s Handbook on the Law of Evidence \u00a7 185 (2d ed. 1972), many bricks are.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">The second misconception, which perhaps follows naturally from the first, is the contention that <em>Rebezo </em>must have held that deliberate slanting or consistent selection of damaging inferences was a piece of evidence which <em>in and of itself </em>would prove actual malice. But <em>Rebozo </em>merely held that resolution of ambiguities in the most damaging light <em>\u201ccould amount to evidence </em>of the reporter\u2019s reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the asser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>tion,\u201d <em>id. </em>(emphasis <em>added) </em>\u2014 i.e., some evidence of actual malice. Since <em>Pape </em>simply held it was not <em>enough </em>evidence to demonstrate actual malice, the two cases are fully consistent. There is thus no question of \u201csaving\u201d the verdict solely through the logic expressed in <em>Rebozo. </em>Evidence of deliberate slanting and consistent selection of damaging inferences may constitute probative evidence of actual malice and must be examined and evaluated, not ignored, in conjunction with all of the other circumstantial evidence produced by the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">In sum, to the extent that the facts known to the defendants, like those in <em>Re-bozo, </em>were susceptible of more than one possible interpretation, the numerous instances in which the defendants selected the most damaging \u2014 and most sensational \u2014 alternative is <em>some </em>evidence which a jury, and an appellate court on review, can evaluate in determining whether publication was made with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">4. <em>Suppression of Information Favorable to the Plaintiffs</em></p>\n<p id=\"ANd\">The plaintiffs also presented evidence that the defendants had information which put the transactions involved in a light more favorable to the plaintiffs and Mobil, and which was deliberately excised or suppressed during the writing and the editing of the story in order to strengthen the \u201ccase against\u201d the Tavoulareases. The district court examined several of these pieces of information which were known to Tyler but were not included in the story:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">1. Lewis Lapham, an outside director of Mobil, told Tyler that the Mobil board had \u201cconsistently reviewed the relationship between Mobil and Atlas and ... was <em>completely satisfied with all aspects of it\u201d </em>567 F.Supp. at 658 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\">2. Lapham told Tyler \u201cthat he did not believe that plaintiff [William Tavoulareas] played a personal role in Atlas and that at key board meetings plaintiff would leave the room to facilitate the opportunity for more open discussion of the subject.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-10\">3. There was considerable evidence that \u201cMobil profited significantly from [the Samarco-Atlas] relationship and that Atlas was not merely a fly-by-night organization set up solely for Peter\u2019s benefit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659. Both John Kousi, a Samarco director, and Comnas, the defendants\u2019 main source for the <em>Post </em>article told Tyler that Atlas could run Mobil\u2019s ships more cheaply than the oil company could.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">Early drafts of the story <em>did </em>contain some of this information, but it was <em>eliminated </em>from the final version during the editing process. One early draft, for example, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-12\">During these briefings [on Atlas-Samarco dealings] by Warner, Lapham said, Tavoulareas would leave the room. Lapham said he still believes Warner\u2019s account of events and rejects any suggestion that Tavoulareas took a personal role in Atlas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-13\">\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to any of that,\u201d Lap-ham said. \u201cIt was explained to the satisfaction of the board.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-14\">(J.A. 2528). The defendants argue that while Lapham\u2019s specific words were cut out, the point he made was not. But proof of the point was placed on weaker grounds. As a substitute for Lapham\u2019s <em>specific statement </em>that Tavoulareas went so far as to leave the room during board discussions of Atlas, and that there was \u201cnothing to [the suggestion that Tavoulareas took a personal role in Atlas],\u201d the defendants point to the following passage from the article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Mobil chairman Warner says he assured directors in board meetings that Tavoulareas \u201cdoes not participate in any decisions regarding Mobil\u2019s business with Atlas.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Thus, the article substituted an \u201cassurance\u201d by Warner (an inside director) for a concrete statement by Lapham (an outside director) \u2014 a substitution that considerably weakens the point, particularly when an underlying theme of the <em>Post </em>article was that Tavoulareas\u2019 mere position as president constituted internal corporate influence that implicitly affected the Atlas operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Next, in place of Lapham\u2019s direct statement that the Mobil board \u201cwas completely satisfied\u201d with the Samarco-Atlas relationship, the article stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">The Mobil board of directors was told from the outset about the Atlas arrangement but was assured that company president Tavoulareas was not involved in his son's venture in any way.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Thus, instead of a direct assertion of an unimpeached <em>outside </em>director that the board had investigated and were \u201ccompletely satisfied,\u201d the article states merely that the director was simply \u201cassured\u201d by an unidentified \u201csome one\u201d that there was no impropriety. This clearly understates the force of the information provided by Lapham.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">Lapham\u2019s statements that the board had \u201cconsistently reviewed\u201d the Atlas arrangements and that he was convinced that William Tavoulareas had played no personal role in Atlas were simply ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">The <em>Post </em>article also disregarded other evidence that tended to describe the arrangement in a light more favorable to the plaintiffs and to Mobil. In evaluating the economic impact of the arrangement, for example, the defendants ignored the information from Kousi (whose favorable comments were deleted during the editing process) and even the comment furnished by their principal source, Comnas, that the Atlas arrangement saved Mobil money (J.A. 2501). The defendants contented themselves with allusion to \u201cmillions of dollars in business\u201d and \u201cexclusive, no-bid contracts,\u201d which strongly implied that Mobil was being exploited and gouged by an <em>irregular </em>arrangement in which Tavoulareas had \u201cset up\u201d his son. Similarly, the story failed to include or refer to two internal Mobil memoranda which were prepared at the time the Samarco-Atlas arrangement was created and which Tyler had in his possession. One memorandum instructed Mobil personnel that all business dealings with Atlas were to be conducted at \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d; the other, written by William Tavoulareas himself, specifically directed Vice President Wolfe to bypass Tavoulareas and report directly to Chairman Warner on any Samarco-Atlas matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">Thus, it. is apparent that the district court had a firm basis for stating that Tyler \u201cattempted to understate\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 side of the story, <em>i.e., </em>slanted the story against the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The court, however, concluded that such slanting did not \u201cshow that [Tyler] acted in reckless disregard of the truth\u201d 567 F.Supp. at 659 (footnote omitted). Tavoulareas, wrote the district court, \u201ccannot force <em>The Post </em>to include facts that he believes to be important.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This is true. But the issue here is whether evidence of selective reporting of particular facts in order to slant the story, to present an essentially untruthful and highly damaging picture, is <em>relevant </em>to the defendants\u2019 state of mind at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>the time the article was published. Unquestionably, a writer of an article who knowingly suppresses the facts that would prove its falsity is more likely to have doubts about the accuracy of his defamatory story than one who either has no such knowledge or has endeavored to present the facts fairly. The writer who suppresses favorable facts is more likely to suspect that his version is not substantially true. Hence, courts have held repeatedly that the choices of <em>which </em>facts to report <em>is </em>relevant to the question of actual malice. <em>See, e.g., Time, Inc. v. Ragano, </em>427 F.2d 219, 221 (5th Cir.1970) (failure to include fact that plaintiff was attorney when implication of article would lead people to believe he was organized crime figure); <em>Wasserman v. Time, Inc., </em>424 F.2d 920, 922 (D.C.Cir.) (same), <em>cert. denied, </em>398 U.S. 940, 90 S.Ct. 1844, 26 L.Ed.2d 273 (1970); <em>Montandon v. Triangle Publications, Inc., </em>45 Cal.App.3d 938, 943-44, 120 Cal.Rptr. 186, 189 (omission of key fact in otherwise truthful statement held evidence of reckless disregard of truth), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 893, 96 S.Ct. 193, 46 L.Ed.2d 126 (1975); <em>Indianapolis Newspapers, Inc. v. Fields, </em>254 Ind. 219, 259 N.E.2d 651, 662 (time discrepancy known to reporter and witnesses\u2019 repudiation of key fact mentioned only once during series of articles held evidence of actual malice), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 930, 91 S.Ct. 187, 27 L.Ed.2d 190 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Similarly, deliberate slanting is further evidence of a purpose to \u201cget\u201d the plaintiff and is thus probative of actual malice. The desire to place a plaintiff in a bad (and sensational) light is indicative of a state of mind conducive to acting in reckless disregard of the truth. This evidence of motive, without more, does not prove actual malice. But, as demonstrated previously, it defies logic to argue that it is not <em>relevant. See Butts, supra, </em>388 U.S. at 169, 87 S.Ct. at 1999 (Warren, C.J., concurring); <em>Goldwater v. Ginzburg, supra, </em>414 F.2d at 336-37; <em>Airlie Foundation, Inc. v. Evening Star Newspaper Co., </em>337 F.Supp. 421, 424 n.9 (D.D.C.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">The editorial process by which the defendants selected which facts they would print, and which they would suppress, was a factor the jury could take into account in reaching its conclusion as to actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">5. <em>\u201cPersonally Dispatched\u201d: The Checket Conversation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">One of the allegations made in the article was that William Tavoulareas had <em>personally </em>\u201cdispatched\u201d Mobil shipping executive Harmon Hoffmann to Atlas following the resignation of Comnas. It is undisputed that <em>Mobil </em>made Hoffmann available to serve as interim head of Atlas, but Tavoulareas asserts that he personally did not send Hoffmann. The article\u2019s claim that Tavoulareas participated personally obviously undercuts the statements of Mobil officials that he removed himself from dealing with Atlas. The assertion in the article hence is a key point in the \u201ccase against\u201d Tavoulareas that the defendants attempted to make in the article.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">Tyler, in his testimony, claimed that he based this assertion on (1) Piro\u2019s statement that he overheard a conversation on an airplane between Tavoulareas and Mobil Vice President Everett Checket in which Tavoulareas said that \u201che had sent\u201d Hoffmann to Atlas, and (2) Checket\u2019s \u201cconfirmation\u201d of that conversation (J.A. 2089-90). The district court, in evaluating this point, ignored Piro\u2019s evidence (it had already found him to be unreliable) and cited as the basis of the statement only Tyler\u2019s \u201cnote of a conversation he had with ... Checket that <em>confirmed </em>that the plaintiff had stated that he sent Hoffmann to Atlas.\u201d 567 F.Supp. at 661 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>According to Checket, however, he <em>never </em>\u201cconfirmed\u201d this point. In his deposition, read to the jury, he stated that he did not \u201crecall ... any conversations in that regard having taken place on an airplane\u201d (J.A. 1844). He was asked, \u201cWhat did William Tavoulareas say to you, if anything, on the subject of Harmon Hoffman[n]\u2019s departure for Atlas?; he replied, <em>\u201cHe did not say anything to me about it\u201d </em>(J.A. 1846) (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-4\">\u201cQUESTION: Do you recall if Mr. Tyler asked you if on that plane trip William Tavoulareas told you that Hoffmann had been sent to London to get things in shape? That was the nature of Tyler\u2019s question to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">\u201cANSWER: No, that was not the nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">\u201cQUESTION: He did not ask you a question about a plane ride with Mister\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">\u201cANSWER: He did ask about the plane ride. He did ask about the conversation with reference to Mr. Hoffmann going to London to be with Atlas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">\u201cQUESTION: Did you say to Mr. Tyler that you were somewhat familiar with that conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">\u201cANSWER: <em>No.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">(J.A. 1847-48) (emphasis added). In other words, Tyler\u2019s notes stated that Checket had <em>confirmed </em>a point which Checket had in fact <em>denied. </em>The district court recognized the discrepancy. It stated, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeZ\">Tyler may, therefore, have been negligent in transcribing Checket\u2019s statement but plaintiff introduced no evidence that would show that Tyler deliberately falsified this document.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">567 F.Supp. at 661 n. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">This observation erroneously adopts the inference from the evidence that defeats rather than supports the jury\u2019s verdict\u2014 and the less plausible inference to boot. The defendants argue that the <em>only </em>possible inference that can be drawn from this conflict is that Tyler acted in good faith but was negligent. But the record does not contain any support for the suggestion of negligence. One of Tyler\u2019s specific purposes in calling Checket on the telephone was to inquire about the conversation on the airplane. It seems difficult to believe that a reporter could <em>accidentally </em>note that a source had <em>confirmed </em>a key point when, in fact, he had <em>denied </em>it. It is more plausible that either Tyler or Checket was being less than truthful about their conversation. Looking at the conflict in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, as we must, it is clearly possible that Tyler deliberately falsified his notes. The jury observed Tyler\u2019s demeanor on the stand, and it heard Checket\u2019s deposition. Under such circumstances credibility was a factor for the trier of fact. It was inappropriate for the district court to resolve the credibility factor against the plaintiffs in granting a judgment n.o.v. <em>See </em>note 14 <em>supra. </em>Our evaluation of the entire record does not compel us to discredit Checket\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-15\">6. <em>The SEC Paragraphs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-16\">Plaintiff William Tavoulareas contends <em>on appeal </em>that the defendants\u2019 \u201ccase against\u201d him included further defamations in the November 30 article, <em>i.e., </em>that as part of the article Tyler, through statements of purported \u201cfact,\u201d implied that \u201cMobil officials\u201d violated federal securities laws by failing to report Atlas activities to the SEC and Mobil shareholders:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-17\">That [Mobile-Atlas-Samarco] relationship [involving father and son] is not illegal, but securities law requires that Mobil officials report it fully to their stockholders. Mobil claims it did, but that is in dispute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-18\">Mobil officials did not tell their stockholders about the son\u2019s involvement in Atlas until two years later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>U.S. securities law requires that corporate officials disclose the details of business transactions between companies and relatives of the companies\u2019 executives. The law was designed to protect shareholders from business decisions based on favoritism.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">In recent days, the SEC has reopened its investigation into the role Mobil\u2019s president played in his son\u2019s partnership in Atlas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-6\"><em>See </em>Appendix. The district court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">Among the general, non-specific allegations of the first article which you may consider in connection with your <em>evaluation of the specific charges </em>the <em>[Post </em>] defendants stated that federal securities law requires Mobil officials to report the relationship of William and Peter Tavoulareas as father and son to Mobil Corporation\u2019s shareholders____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-8\">... This [SEC] regulation requires a corporation to report transactions involving the son of an officer or director only if the son lives in the same household as the officer or director.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-9\">It is for you to determine whether the Post accurately reported that the regulation had been violated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">(Tr. 4557-58) (emphasis added). The district court instructed the jury that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArK\">in determinpng] whether the <em>[Post </em>] articles are libelous, you are to consider each portion of the article, which plaintiffs have <em>specified </em>as libelous in the context of the articles as a whole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">(Tr. 4548) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">William Tavoulareas\u2019 original complaints did not <em>specifically </em>allege these SEC paragraphs as libelous. Prior to trial he moved the district court, on the basis of evidence adduced during discovery, to amend his complaints to include the specific SEC paragraphs mentioned above. The district court denied the motion, and the plaintiff was thus limited to those <em>specific </em>allegations pleaded in the original complaints (J.A. 707-08). Thus, contrary to Tavoulareas\u2019 contentions, it is clear that these paragraphs cannot serve as the basis of liability, and that was the effect of the court\u2019s instruction \u2014 such \u201cnon-specific allegations\u201d could only be considered in connection with \u201cthe evaluation of the specific charges\u201d (Tr. 4557-58). The defendants therefore correctly argue that these statements of alleged SEC violations are not properly before this court <em>as a basis of liability. </em>Brief of <em>Post </em>at 44-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-14\">But as the district court ruled in a pretrial order to plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend the complaints, evidence of libels not <em>specifically </em>pleaded in the complaints are nonetheless admissible as to issues such as \u201cthe state of mind of defendants or as to some other issue related to those defamations pleaded <em>specifically </em>in the original complaints\u201d (J.A. 708) (emphasis added). We note that during trial <em>both </em>parties introduced evidence relating to these alleged SEC violations, though some dealt with allegations regarding the December 1, 1979 article. Both parties also argued the relevance of this evidence to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-15\">In sum, we decline to hold \u2014 as the trial judge declined to permit the jury to find \u2014 that the allegations regarding SEC violations could be a basis for recovery; but these allegations could properly be considered by the jury as evidence of the malice of the defendants with regard to those specific allegations that were the basis for recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-16\">7. <em>Reliability of Sources</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-17\">Plaintiffs next argue that the defendants\u2019 heavy reliance on two sources \u2014 Comnas and Piro \u2014 whom the defendants knew or should have known were biased and unreliable, in itself demonstrated reckless disregard for the truth. It is settled that \u201crecklessness may be found where there are obvious reasons to doubt the veracity of the informant or the accuracy of his reports.\u201d <em>St. Amant v. Thompson, supra, </em>390 U.S. at 732, 88 S.Ct. at 1326. If the defendants had reason to doubt the truthfulness and accuracy of Comnas and Piro, and still relied on their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>representations, that fact may be taken into consideration by the jury in determining actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">A. <em>Piro</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Defendants do not attempt to argue that they could properly have relied on Piro for key allegations. His willingness to speak from ignorance and his obvious bias against the Tavoulareases are self-evident. Instead, the defendants argue that they really <em>didn't </em>rely on him, although he was quoted and cited several times in the article. The district court, in granting the judgment n.o.v., stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">The fact that Dr. Piro may have been an unreliable informant is irrelevant, however, because he was not a primary, or even a secondary, source for the November 30 article. He may have been the person who rekindled <em>The Post\u2019s </em>interest in the Atlas story but, because of Tyler\u2019s skepticism, <em>The Post </em>relied on other sources as authority for <em>many of </em>Piro\u2019s remarks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">567 F.Supp. at 657 (emphasis added). This seems an over generous evaluation of the reliance on Piro that is self-evident in the article.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">It appears from the record and from the story that at least two very significant allegations of \u201cfact\u201d in the story are based <em>entirely </em>on Piro. First:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">Philip Piro, a Baltimore eye surgeon and former son-in-law to the elder Tavoulareas, who is now estranged from the family, said Tavoulareas expressed his interest at the time [Atlas was being created] as \u201cgiving Peter a little nudge to get him along.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">The obvious import of this paragraph is that <em>William Tavoulareas had admitted he had \u201cset up \u201d his son. </em>In its context, it is used to support the allegation, made several paragraphs earlier, that Tavoulareas had \u201cpersonally urged\u201d that Peter be included as a partner in Atlas; it is used almost as an admission on the part of Tavoulareas. And the <em>sole </em>basis for this statement is Piro. The <em>Post </em>and the district court are therefore in error in asserting that Piro was not relied on for very substantial portions of the defamatory allegations. In fact, the direct implication of Piro\u2019s statement formed the underlying theme for the entire article and was set out in the headline because it represented the basic charge in the article. The tremendous importance of a headline, as acknowledged by the <em>Post </em>editors at trial, was argued to the jury (Tr. 4348).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-13\">In addition, it is clear from the preceding discussion in section IV.5. that Piro was the <em>only </em>source Tyler had for the charge that Tavoulareas \u201cpersonally dispatched\u201d Hoffmann to Atlas. This charge similarly acts as an alleged admission by William Tavoulareas that he played a very substantial role in Atlas. Tyler thus relied on Piro\u2019s unsupported word even in the face of what the jury could find to be directly contradictory evidence from Checket.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-14\">Even the \u201cpersonally urged\u201d allegation on which the whole story turns is based in part on Piro. It is among a list of \u201cfacts\u201d attributed to \u201ca source close to the Tavoulareas family <em>[i.e., </em>Piro] and those familiar with the formation of Atlas <em>[i.e., </em>Comnas].\u201d The defendants now assert that while these facts in the article were specifically attributed to Piro, he was in reality <em>not </em>their source.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-15\">On the contrary, the jury was entitled to find from the assertions made in the stories themselves that the defendants relied wholly on Piro for the \u201clittle nudge\u201d comment and partially on him for the \u201cpersonally urged\u201d statement. They could find that they relied on him entirely for the \u201cpersonally dispatched\u201d allegation. The jury was not, nor are we, required to credit Tyler\u2019s <em>post hoc </em>assertions that he did not rely on a source that he actually quoted in the story as the basis for the statement. Given Piro\u2019s ignorance of the Mobil-Samar-co-Atlas relationship and personal animus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>against William \u2014 which Tyler and the <em>Post </em>acknowledge and with which they were familiar (Brief of <em>Post </em>at 57 n. 47) \u2014 reliance on him for crucial facts could be probative of actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">B. <em>Comnas</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">According to Tyler, the <em>key source </em>for the story was Comnas.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Since (1) the Post <em>did not introduce Comnas\u2019 deposition at trial, </em>(2) Tyler did not record his conversations, and (3) Tyler\u2019s notes, as demonstrated by the Checket incident, are not particularly reliable, it is difficult to tell exactly what he told Tyler. Assuming that he <em>did </em>tell Tyler that it was pressure from William Tavoulareas which led him to include Peter, the plaintiffs argue that reliance on Comnas as a source was itself evidence of actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">According to the defendants, Comnas was the chief source for the allegation that Tavoulareas \u201cset up\u201d Peter by \u201cpersonally urging\u201d his inclusion in Atlas. It does not appear that Tyler and Golden had any other source (except Piro, whom they vigorously disclaim for this allegation); it is not supported by Tavoulareas\u2019 SEC testimony, or by Kousi,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> or by anyone else within or without the companies involved. In the absence of such corroboration, the absence and credibility of Comnas become crucial.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">The plaintiffs argue that Tyler and Golden knew from their investigations that Comnas had been thrown out of Atlas for fraudulent practices. At trial, Piro testified that he told Tyler and Golden that \u201cGeorge Comnas had been caught in some fraud involving Atlas, that he was forced to withdraw and that if Comnas ever gave Peter and Atlas any trouble Comnas would be reported to the tax authorities\u201d (J.A. 1857-58). Kousi had heard talk that Comnas was \u201ccorrupt,\u201d had been \u201cdischarged\u201d from Exxon after he was \u201cinvolved in a scandal in Italy,\u201d and that the Samarco directors did not oppose his removal from Atlas (J.A. 1990-91).<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Kousi\u2019s deposition does not specifically indicate whether or not he passed this information along to Tyler. Tyler testified that he had specifically <em>asked </em>Kousi about Piro\u2019s suggestion that Comnas had been involved in fraud, and that Kousi \u201csaid he knew of no allegations of wrongdoing as to George Comnas\u201d (J.A. 2121-22). But Kousi, on the other hand, stated that he answered Tyler\u2019s questions at the time \u201ctruthfully and accurately, to the best of my recollection\u201d (J.A. 1926). This is another instance where Tyler\u2019s testimony varies from that of his alleged informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">The defendants apparently do not dispute they had been told by Piro that Comnas had been engaged in some fraud at Atlas (J.A. 1857-1858). Tyler was aware of this in November 1979, and hence, even by the defendant\u2019s standards, <em>infra, </em>this was sufficient knowledge to require Tyler to make an adequate investigation of Comnas\u2019 credibility. Brief of <em>Post </em>at 53. The defendants argue that they checked on Comnas through other sources, and had good reason to believe that he was credible. Specifically, they point to (1) Comnas\u2019 \u201cWho\u2019s Who\u201d listing, which indicated that he was an experienced shipping executive; (2) Wil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>liam Tavoulareas\u2019 SEC testimony, at which Tavoulareas \u201cnever hinted at any improprieties,\u201d and stated \u201cthat Mobil \u2018had every confidence in the world\u2019 in Comnas\u201d; (3) Mobil Vice President Paul Wolfe\u2019s failure to say anything bad about Comnas when interviewed by Tyler; and (4) the <em>alleged </em>statement of Kousi (offered by Tyler) that they knew nothing discreditable about Comnas. Tavoulareas\u2019 testimony and the statements of Wolfe and Kousi (if Tyler\u2019s recounting of his conversation with Kousi is believed) certainly might provide some basis for finding that reliance on Comnas\u2019 essentially uncorroborated statement about the \u201cset up\u201d charge was reasonable. But the issue is what the reporters knew or suspected. Piro\u2019s statements alerted them to the possibility that Comnas had been engaged in illegal activities. Even without confirmation by Kousi, these statements certainly provide a basis for finding that the defendants knew Comnas had been involved in unsavory business practices and his credibility accordingly was suspect. Tyler\u2019s memorandum in response to Peterson\u2019s stated, with obvious reference to Comnas, \u201ca couple of <em>key points </em>[were based on this] one source.\u201d (Emphasis added.) However, <em>after Tyler learned of allegations of dishonesty, </em>Comnas\u2019 credibility could hardly be supported by relying on no more than a \u201cWho\u2019s Who\u201d listing, a failure of Paul Wolfe in his interview with Tyler to volunteer anything bad about Comnas (though not specifically asked), and William Tavoulareas\u2019 failure (again when \u25a0 not specifically asked) to charge Comnas with fraud and his statement in. SEC hearings of \u201chaving every confidence\u201d in Comnas. The only other alleged verification was Tyler\u2019s version of the statement by Kousi, which the jury was entitled to discredit by Kousi\u2019s own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Moreover, there is other evidence in the record which provides a basis for finding personal animus on the part of Comnas known to the reporters. It is undisputed that Tyler knew that Comnas was forced out of Atlas. The plaintiffs claim it was due to fraud and dissatisfaction with his performance; the defendants imply that it was to give Peter Tavoulareas a bigger share of the business. Under either scenario, Comnas could not be expected to be fair and impartial regarding those who had forced him to leave Atlas. It appears undisputed that Comnas did not have good relations with <em>any </em>of the Samarco partners.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">The district court in its opinion found specifically that \u201cTyler was fully aware of the allegations of Mobil\u2019s and/or Samarco\u2019s dissatisfaction with Comnas\u2019 business prowess.\u201d 567 F.Supp. at 657 n. 12. The court discounted this knowledge entirely, on the ground that lack of business acuihen \u201cwould not appear to reflect poorly on [Comnas\u2019] credibility as a source.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But while inability to manage a business effectively is not exactly a crime of moral turpitude, the question is whether Comnas had a readily apparent motive to lie. In this case it is not difficult to discern that he had such motive, and such motive could be considered by the jury in determining whether Tyler recklessly relied upon his assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">The defendants assert that even if they knew of facts that would impeach Comnas\u2019 veracity, his \u201cpossible animus toward appellant does not preclude the Post from reporting what Comnas said.\u201d Brief of <em>Post </em>at 56. As stated, this is a truism, for \u201ceven <em>if ... </em>[spoken] out of hatred, utterances honestly believed contribute to the free interchange of ideas and the ascertainment of truth.\u201d <em>Garrison v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 64, 73, 85 S.Ct. 209, 215, 13 L.Ed.2d 125 (1964). But it assuredly does <em>not </em>follow that, as the defendants maintain, \u201creliance on such a source cannot as a matter of law permit an inference of actual malice.\u201d The defendants, curiously enough, cite for this proposition <em>St. Amant </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number><em>v. Thompson, supra, </em>a case in which the Supreme Court held specifically that reliance on questionable sources <em>would </em>be evidence of actual malice, although it found the evidence in that case insufficient. <em>St. Amant </em>plainly does not support the defendants\u2019 position.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Reliance on the unsupported word of obviously biased sources for key allegations is <em>evidence </em>which a jury is entitled to consider in evaluating the existence of actual malice.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> This court on review is similarly entitled to consider this evidence. There was evidence in this case from which a jury could determine that Comnas was ousted from Atlas for engaging in irregular business activities, that Tyler was aware of such activities, and that Tyler had doubts about his veracity. Yet Tyler disregarded these doubts in giving vent to Comnas\u2019 allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">8. <em>Other Indicia of Actual Malice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">There is other evidence present in this case which has been held in other cases to constitute evidence relevant to the issue of actual malice, and in our review of the record we give such evidence the same probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">First, the article clearly charged William Tavoulareas with corporate nepotism, strongly hinted that the Samarco-Atlas arrangement involved misuse of corporate assets and that Tavoulareas and Mobil had been less than candid with Mobil shareholders. The defendants certainly were aware that such charges would have a serious impact on the reputation of William Tavoulareas and might accomplish their expressed intent, in effect, to \u201cget\u201d him.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Knowledge of the harm likely to follow publication of a story is relevant to whether it was published with actual malice. <em>Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, </em>388 U.S. 130, 170, 87 S.Ct. 1975, 1999, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094 (1967) (Warren, C.J., concurring) (\u201cknowledge of the harm that would likely result from publication of the article\u201d is relevant to actual malice determination); <em>see Mahnke v. Northwest Publications, Inc., </em>280 Minn. 328, 160 N.W.2d 1, 9-10 (1968) (\u201cgravity of the charges in this story was a factor to be considered by the jury in assessing the conduct of the defendant\u201d on the issue of \u201cactual malice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">Second, the defendants were under no time constraint in preparing their story. This was not a fast-breaking news story; the events at issue had occurred years earlier. There was no significant deadline pressure.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The defendants had ample time to search for corroboration of Comnas\u2019 statements. Actual malice may be more difficult to prove when a defamatory falsehood is published under heavy deadline pressure. The converse is equally true. Falsehoods uttered at leisure are more likely to be deliberate than those published in haste. Absence of time pressure in this case is evidence that the jury could fairly consider. <em>See Carson v. Allied News Co., </em>529 F.2d 206, 211 (7th Cir.1976) (grant of summary judgment reversed; story was not \u201chot news\u201d and \u201cdefendants were not bedeviled by an early deadline\u201d); <em>Goldwater v. Ginzburg, supra, </em>414 F.2d at 339; R. Sack, <em>supra, </em>at 215-16. <em>See also Vandenburg v. Newsweek, Inc., </em>507 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>1024, 1026 (5th Cir.1975) (\u201cwhen the story is not \u2018hot news,' as is the case here, the investigation must be more thorough\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Third, after the story had been published, the <em>Post </em>steadfastly refused to retract the story, and refused to print a letter from Tavoulareas setting forth his position. The Supreme Court held in <em>New York Times </em>that \u201cfailure to retract upon [the plaintiff\u2019s] demand ... is ... not <em>adequate </em>evidence of [actual] malice for constitutional purposes.\u201d 376 U.S. at 286, 84 S.Ct. at 729 (emphasis added). This is unquestionably true. The mere refusal to retract is not sufficient evidence, <em>by itself, </em>to prove actual malice. The defendants then take the next giant step and argue that it is entirely irrelevant. But the very language used by the Court \u2014 \u201cis not <em>adequate </em>evidence\u201d \u2014 flatly refutes the assertion that refusal to retract may not be <em>some </em>evidence of actual malice. The Court's language makes no sense under the defendants\u2019 construction of the law. The correct view, as stated by the Fifth Circuit, is that \u201c[u]nder certain circumstances evidence [of a refusal by a publisher to retract a statement after it has been demonstrated to him to be both false and defamatory] ... might be relevant in showing recklessness at the time the statement was published.\u201d <em>Golden Bear Distributing Systems of Texas v. Chase Revel, Inc., </em>708 F.2d 944, 950 (5th Cir.1983) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 580A comment d (1977)).<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">9. <em>The Defendants\u2019Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"A5m\">The defendants place a great deal of emphasis on three factors which were presented to the jury and to which the jury evidently did not give controlling significance: the defendants had (1) \u201cdone exhaustive research,\u201d (2) \u201cgiven William and Peter Tavoulareas and Mobil ample opportunity to comment,\u201d and (3) \u201creported the Tavoulareases\u2019 and Mobil\u2019s viewpoint at great length\u201d in the story. Brief of <em>Post </em>at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\"><em>The Reporters\u2019 \u201cExhaustive\u201d Work. </em>Tyler worked on the story over a 30-day period. It is clear from the record that both he and Golden expended at least a fair amount of time on research. The details of his investigation were presented at some length to the jury. But the amount of effort put into a story is only one piece of evidence on the issue of actual malice. As the district court recognized, \u201c[a] reporter cannot shield himself from a charge of reckless disregard merely by showing that he invested a large amount of time and effort on an article's preparation.\u201d 567 F.Supp. at 654. The expenditure of considerable time and effort on a story may be evidence of a reporter\u2019s good faith belief in what he writes. It may, on the other hand, merely be evidence of a dogged and thorough attempt to \u201cget\u201d the subject. Its evaluation is a matter for the trier of fact, and what the reporters did and did <em>not </em>investigate assume critical importance. When obviously biased sources are involved, obtaining <em>reliable </em>corroboration is the name of the game.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\"><em>The Plaintiffs\u2019 Refusal to Cooperate with Interviews. </em>The defendants repeatedly attempted to interview the plaintiffs and Mobil officials. They were repeatedly rebuffed. The defendants correctly point to these attempts as some evidence of their lack of actual malice. But this evidence obviously is not dispositive, for even one who wrote what he knew or suspected to be false may have sought to interview the subject of his story.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">Implicit in this argument by the defendant is the apparent belief that .plaintiffs should not be heard to complain about a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>publication when they have refused the opportunity to be interviewed. But individuals cannot be compelled to speak with reporters; their decision to exercise their right to remain silent does not strip them of their remedies for defamatory falsehoods. William Tavoulareas cannot force a newspaper to publish his views. No more can that newspaper force Tavoulareas to speak by holding the sword of defamatory falsehood over his head.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\"><em>Inclusion of Denials. </em>The defendants also stress that denials by Mobil and Tavoulareas were included in the story. Inclusion of such denials is evidence tending to show the absence of actual malice. The jury and this court on review are entitled to evaluate it. But mere publication of a denial by the defamed subject does not absolve a defendant from liability for publishing knowing or reckless falsehoods. As the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has noted, \u201can astonishing number of people are convicted of charges they deny, and the denial does not set them right in the public mind. A denial often leads piquancy to the story, and printing one would be an easy escape from liability, if that were all there was to it.\u201d <em>Morgan v. Bulletin Co., </em>369 Pa. 349, 353, 85 A.2d 869, 872 (1952). <em>See also Dempsey v. Time, Inc., </em>43 Misc.2d 754, 252 N.Y.S.2d 186, 189, <em>aff'd, </em>22 A.D.2d 854, 254 N.Y.S.2d 80 (1964); <em>Cobbs v. Chicago Defender, </em>308 Ill.App. 55, 31 N.E.2d 323 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">10. <em>Some of Defendants\u2019 Suggested Inferences from the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">From the foregoing analysis we think it is clear that the evidence, together with all inferences favorable to the plaintiffs that can reasonably be drawn therefrom, establishes by clear and convincing proof that the defendants acted in reckless disregard of whether the charges were false or not, <em>i.e., </em>with actual malice. In evaluating the possible inferences to be drawn from the evidence, we have necessarily been required to pass upon their reasonableness. We are not required, though, to evaluate the defendants\u2019 inferences and accordingly prove them false. Our review commands only that we evaluate the inferences most favorable to the plaintiff, examine them for their reasonableness, and determine whether they support a finding that the plaintiffs have clearly and convincingly demonstrated actual malice. This we have done.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">The dissent nonetheless charges that our review does not consider relevant interpretations of the evidence. <em>See </em>Dissent at 158. To the extent the dissent suggests that we should accept or discredit evidentiary inferences advanced by the defendants, we note the following inferences\u2014 central to the defendants\u2019 case \u2014 which the defendants in argument submitted to the jury but which the jury obviously did not believe.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">First: that after admitting \u201cwe don\u2019t know the words back and forth,\u201d the defense <em>suggested </em>that William Tavoulareas told Comnas \u201cIf you want the [Mobil] business, take Peter in with you\u201d (Tr. 4424). This inference is based on no more than mere speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-13\">Second: that William Tavoulareas used $100,000 of Mobil funds to \u201c[g]et George Comnas out of Atlas, <em>because once you have George Comnas out of Atlas, it is there for Peter Tavoulareas to take over with his partner, Ares Emmanuel\u201d </em>(Tr. 4441) (emphasis added). This is equivalent to arguing that William Tavoulareas purposely used $100,000 of Mobil funds to force Comnas out of Atlas to permit Peter to \u201ctake over.\u201d However, <em>Comnas\u2019 shares were offered to Hoffmann, not Peter </em>(Tr. 4151).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-14\">Third: that Tyler\u2019s suggestion to Piro, \u201cHey, maybe we should get somebody to rifle Tavoulareas\u2019 safe\u201d was a joke and not a serious suggestion (Tr. 4461). Yet Golden, who was present at The Owl restaurant when Tyler made this suggestion, testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>that he believed Tyler was asking Piro \u201cto commit a crime\u201d (Tr. 216).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Fourth: that \u201cthe Peterson memorandum adds up to ... <em>precisely nothing </em>in this case\u201d (Tr. 4474) (emphasis added). Suggesting that the jury draw this inference from the Peterson memorandum represents a refusal to otherwise meet this important issue and left the jury free to weigh this evidence in the plaintiffs favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Fifth: that defendants also asked the jury to rely on the <em>credibility </em>of Comnas and conclude \u201cthat Tavoulareas, personally, urged Comnas to take Peter on as a partner\u201d (Tr. 4490). On Comnas\u2019 credibility, Tyler and Woodward, particularly Tyler, testified that they did not have to check on George Comnas\u2019 credibility because they relied on statements William Tavoulareas and Paul Wolfe had made about Comnas and his career before he went into Atlas. In response, William Tavoulareas testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">To use me as a basis for saying Comnas was a man of credibility and competence I think is just unbelievable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\">Now, exactly the same situation happens with Paul Wolfe. Paul Wolfe says when we first hired him [Comnas] we thought he was good. We found out he couldn\u2019t perform.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">And you people yourselves have heard what Paul Wolfe has said. And what about Kousi? What did Kousi say? Kousi said he was bad, he was over his-head. He increasingly got disillusioned with him and he said <em>he solicited a bribe on the Japanese deal and he was mixed up in the Italian Exxon scandal.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-9\">Could you read that testimony as saying it\u2019s an endorsement? If his other sources are as good as those three sources, I\u2019m amazed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">(Tr. 4152-53) (emphasis added). The foregoing testimony greatly weakens the inferences that can <em>reasonably </em>be drawn by the defendants to rebut the plaintiff\u2019s case. When the principal reliance for the story was Comnas, the refusal of the defendants to introduce Comnas\u2019 deposition left the jury free to discount the truthfulness of the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">In sum, on final argument the defense suggested a number of inferences to be drawn from the evidence which the jury obviously did not consider to be <em>reasonable </em>in the face of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. Our review sees no error in that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">11. <em>Summary</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-13\">In sum, then, the jury clearly could find that the article was both false and defamatory. As to the defendants\u2019 state of mind with which they published the story, the jury was faced with the following evidence:</p>\n<p id=\"b204-14\">* The story on its face alerted the defendants to the fact that its potential harm to William Tavoulareas\u2019 reputation was great.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-15\">* The article was not \u201chot news,\u201d and the defendants were under no significant time constraints in publishing it, yet it contained misstatements of fact and law and defamatory implications.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-16\">* The defendants were motivated by a plan to \u201cget\u201d the plaintiffs, and deliberately slanted, rejected and ignored evidence contrary to the false premise of the story, generally resolving ambiguities in the light most damaging to Tavoulareas.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-17\">* The <em>Post </em>defendants relied on sources of questionable credibility for major portions of the defamatory allegations; and the defendants possessed information which should have alerted them to the credibility problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-18\">* Tyler\u2019s notes of interviews on some points reflect exactly the opposite of what he was told by the interviewees, and in the case of Checket, at least, he cited as a \u201ccorroborating\u201d source one who had in fact flatly denied the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-19\">* During the editing phase of the article, substantial doubts regarding the accuracy of the article\u2019s central theme were voiced by at least one editor (Peterson) who worked on the article; the Peterson memorandum was circulated to Tyler and to the editors directly responsible for the article. There is no claim or any evidence that any effort was made to address those doubts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>and no substantial changes were made in response to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">* The defendants have steadfastly refused to retract their story or even to print the plaintiffs letter in their letters to the editors column.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">From our review of the entire record we conclude that the direct and circumstantial evidence, taken as a whole, supports a finding that the plaintiffs have demonstrated, clearly and convincingly, that the falsehoods contained in the article were published not merely through negligence or inadvertence, but with reckless disregard of whether they were false or not, <em>i.e., </em>with actual malice. A judgment n.o.v. was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">V. The Verdict Against Piro</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Plaintiffs William and Peter Tavoulareas sued defendant Dr. Piro for slander and its foreseeable republication. Piro was charged with making the following slanderous statements concerning William Tavoulareas: (1) William had arranged for Peter\u2019s first job with C.M. Lemos &amp; Co.; (2) William (as President of Mobil) had set up his son Peter as a partner in Atlas Maritime Co.; (3) William had described his interest at the time as \u201cgiving Peter a little nudge to get along\u201d; and (4) after the departure of Comnas, William dispatched one of his senior shipping executives to London to help run Atlas. Complaint, <em>Tavoulareas v. Piro, </em>Civ. No. 80-2387 (D.D.C. Sept. 19, 1980); J.A. 89, 90.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> The jury returned verdicts in favor of both plaintiffs. The district court then granted the judgment n.o.v. in favor of Piro against Tavoulareas (although it affirmed the jury verdict for Peter). The court found that although Piro had little or no idea how Atlas and Samarco came about and what role the Tavoulareases played in them, his false and defamatory statements were not uttered with, actual malice (J.A. 766-67).<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> From the legal analysis set forth previously, it is apparent that this conclusion with respect to actual malice is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">Piro\u2019s position seems to be that ignorance of truth or falsity, far from amounting to actual malice, actually <em>negates </em>such a finding. He claims that he knew little about Atlas and did not comprehend the complexities of the transactions (Brief of Piro at 10), hence his false and defamatory statements were not uttered with actual malice. Thus, he posits that only a <em>known </em>falsehood is actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-13\">This position is wholly untenable. The uttering of <em>reckless </em>falsehoods may support a finding of actual malice. Uttering defamatory statements with no idea whether they are true or false is <em>by definition </em>acting with reckless disregard of truth or falsity. <em>See Varnish v. Best Medium Publishing Co., </em>405 F.2d 608, 612 (2d Cir.1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>394 U.S. 987, 89 S.Ct. 1465, 22 L.Ed.2d 762 (1969).<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Piro\u2019s admission that he had little or no knowledge of the Atlas-Samarco-Mobil relationship (Tr. 2899-2928), taken in conjunction with all the circumstantial evidence of his state of mind, entitled the jury to find that he acted with reckless disregard of whether the charges were false or not, and supports our conclusion on review that the jury verdict was based on clear and convincing evidence. Thus, the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>n.o.v. must be set aside and the jury verdict for William Tavoulareas reinstated against defendant Piro.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">VI. The Verdict Against Golden</p>\n<p id=\"Aq_9\">To be liable for defamation, defendant Golden, in addition to the actual malice and falsity requirements, must have <em>published </em>or knowingly participated in publishing the defamation. The plaintiffs do not seriously argue that Golden himself took any part in the <em>actual </em>writing or editing of the Tavoulareas article, or that he exercised any influence or control over the <em>Post </em>defendants\u2019 handling of the material. There is, moreover, no evidence that Golden read the article before publication or knew what its final contents would be. While he participated in the investigation, his participation was limited to initially sparking the <em>Post\u2019s </em>investigation, furnishing such initial information as he had received, conferring with Tyler on the course of the investigation, and supplying one source for the article. He played no role in the actual preparation of the story. Hence, his liability, if any, depends upon whether his participation in the story was significant enough, and was rendered with sufficient knowledge, to make him liable for the <em>Post </em>defendants\u2019 defamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Responsibility for publication is a factual question which is normally for the jury to resolve. <em>Skeoch v. Ottley, </em>377 F.2d 804, 808 (3rd Cir.1967). It is an infrequent issue in defamation cases, because normally it is fairly clear who wrote, edited, or published the statement in question. The courts of the District of Columbia have had little occasion to discuss the issue and have not adopted a formal test for determining the quantum of participation in a defamatory article necessary for liability. Yet, whatever that quantum may be, we think the First Amendment precludes its descending to the level of Golden\u2019s demonstrated participation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">As our earlier discussion shows, it was available for the jury to find that the elements of information which Golden contributed to the story were so flimsily substantiated that reliance upon them evidenced reckless disregard of whether they were false or not. What made the final publication reckless, however, was not simply use of that information, but also use of that information in the face of <em>known </em>substantial contradicting evidence exonerating Tavoulareas, which gave rise to serious doubts about the truthfulness of the story. Since Golden had no editorial authority on the <em>Post, </em>it was not his responsibility to know of the contradictory evidence, nor did the testimony establish how much of it, if any, he in fact knew. It cannot be considered \u201creckless disregard\u201d to gather and bring to a newspaper\u2019s attention allegations of wrongdoing made by others (even by incredible witnesses, so long as their statements are not affirmatively known to be false) to form part of a story that is to be investigated in full by the newspaper\u2019s large and skilled investigative staff. As far as appears, that was the extent of Golden\u2019s participation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>here. To hold Golden responsible <em>as a principal </em>for the <em>final </em>publication would have the effect of drying up sources of information, no single one of which may be adequate to support a responsible story.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The same conclusion obtains if we treat Golden\u2019s liability as that of an aider or abettor \u2014 assuming, without deciding, that such an analysis applies to a tort that is not \u201cintentional\u201d in the strictest meaning of that word, but is based upon \u201creckless disregard\u201d as defined for purposes of libel law. In our recent decision in <em>Halberstam v. Welch, </em>705 F.2d 472, 477 (D.C.Cir.1983), we set forth the following analysis to be used in civil aiding-abetting cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">Aiding-abetting includes the following elements: (1) the party whom the defendant aids must perform a wrongful act that causes an injury; (2) the defendant must be generally aware of his role as part of an overall illegal or tortious activity at the time that he provides the assistance; [and] (3) the defendant must knowingly and substantially assist the principal violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">We used a similar approach in <em>Investors Research Corp. v. SEC, </em>628 F.2d 168, 178 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 919, 101 S.Ct. 317, 66 L.Ed.2d 146 (1980). Without applying all the factors of this analysis, we note immediately that there is no evidence that the second of these factors (the defendant\u2019s \u201caware[ness] of his role as part of an overall illegal or tortious activity\u201d) was satisfied with regard to Golden. That is so even if \u201creckless disregard\u201d is an adequate substitute for \u201cawareness,\u201d since, as we have just discussed in connection with Golden\u2019s liability as a principal tort-feasor, there is inadequate evidence of reckless disregard on his part as well. There is in this record no evidence that Golden knew of the defects in the <em>Post\u2019s </em>investigation and of the in-house handling of the additional material that was collected. He never knew what the <em>Post\u2019s </em>article would say before he read it in the newspaper. There is no evidence that Golden and Tyler talked in advance about what premise or theme the article would take. Because of these insufficiencies of evidence, liability cannot be imposed upon Golden as an aider or abettor. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment n.o.v. entered in his favor by the district court must therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">. VII. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">Since it is apparent from a review of the entire record that the evidence was sufficient to demonstrate that the article was published in reckless disregard of its falsity, the judgments n.o.v. entered for Piro and the <em>Post </em>defendants are reversed. In our opinion this is a case where the record demonstrates that a properly instructed jury found liability, that clear and convincing evidence supports its verdict so far as liability is concerned, and that it was improper for the trial court to reweigh the jury\u2019s findings on credibility and arrive at a judgment n.o.v. The judgment n.o.v. for Golden is affirmed for reasons set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">The jury awarded William Tavoulareas $250,000 in compensatory damages and $1,800,000 in punitive damages against the <em>Post. </em>Post trial motions were made by the defendants in the district court, including motions for a new trial and motions to have the amount of compensatory damages reduced and the award of punitive damages set aside, or in the alternative, reduced. These motions were denied without prejudice when the judgments n.o.v. were granted. Those rulings are not before this court, and we have no occasion to pass on them at this time. However, because we reinstate the jury verdict with respect to the <em>Post </em>defendants and Dr. Piro, the district court on remand must reconsider these related motions. At this time we express no opinion on the issues raised by these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">The case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings not inconsistent with the foregoing opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">\n<em>Washington Post, November 30, 1979, Page A-l</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">MOBIL CHIEF SETS UP SON IN VENTURE</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Management Firm is Used to Operate Oil Company Ships</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">By Patrick Tyler</p>\n<p id=\"AAM\">Washington Post Staff Writer</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">Mobil Oil Corp. president William P. Tavoulareas set up his son five years ago as a partner in a London-based shipping management firm that has since done millions of dollars in business operating Mobil-owned ships under exclusive, no-bid contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">Tavoulareas\u2019 son, Peter, was a 24-year-old shipping clerk in 1974, making $14,000 a year. Today, with the help of Mobil, he owns 45 percent of Atlas Maritime Co., which operates 17 ships worldwide.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">Mobil, the second largest oil company, provided Atlas with some of these ships\u2014 among them Mobil-owned supertankers\u2014 under management agreements that allowed Atlas to go into business with a minimal amount of capital.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">Mobil also initially provided Atlas with office space in Mobil\u2019s corporate offices in London and loaned Atlas a Mobil shipping vice president when Atlas\u2019 own top shipping executive resigned in 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">[5] Mobil leased back the ships it provided Atlas, thus creating work for Atlas at a time when the shipping industry was severely depressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-14\">The leasing was handled through an intermediary company, Samarco, of which Mobil owns 45 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-15\">According to one source, Peter Tavoulareas put up no investment capital for his initial 25 percent share of Atlas. Moreover, the lucrative Mobil contracts, along with other managerial assistance, provided by Mobil, helped make Atlas an overnight success. Peter Tavoulareas, now 30, maintains a highly affluent life style, including a home in one of London\u2019s most fashionable districts, a Rolls Royce and a summer home on Long Island.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-17\">The creation of Atlas was a marked departure from Mobil\u2019s historical practice of managing its own fleet of crude oil tankers through its shipping and transportation division.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-18\">Atlas was created to handle the day-today management work for Samarco, a complex shipping partnership that Mobil negotiated in 1974. The other partners included a prominent Saudi Arabian merchant family and a member of the Saudi royal family. [10] Samarco \u2014 Saudi Maritime Co. \u2014 was set up as a way to share shipping revenues among the partners, but the company existed largely on paper, according to one of its original directors, John D. Kousi.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-19\">The complicated transactions between Mobil and Atlas and Samarco are not especially unusual in the intricate world of international oil \u2014 except perhaps for the presence of father and son. That relationship is not illegal, but securities law requires that Mobil officials report it fully to their stockholders. Mobil claims it did, but that is in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-20\">Beyond the legal questions, however, the story of Mobil\u2019s president and his son offers a rare glimpse into corporate behavior at the top of one of the largest publicly held international oil companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-21\">The Mobil board of directors was told from the outset about the Atlas arrangement but was assured that company president Tavoulareas was not involved in his son\u2019s venture in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-22\">Mobil officials did not tell their stockholders about the son\u2019s involvement in Atlas until two years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-23\">[15] After initial press inquiries in the fall of 1976, Mobil board chairman Rawleigh Warner, Jr. disclosed in a special letter to stockholders that Peter Tavoulareas \u201cis one of the principals\u201d of Atlas.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-24\">That disclosure prompted an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in early 1977, but the inquiry was dropped after confidential sworn testi-</p>\n<p id=\"AvK\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>mony was taken from the elder Tavoulareas.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">U.S. securities law requires that corporate officials disclose the details of business transactions between companies and relatives of the companies\u2019 executives. The law was designed to protect shareholders from business decisions based on favoritism.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">In recent days, the SEC has reopened its investigation into the role Mobil\u2019s president played in his son\u2019s partnership in Atlas.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Mobil chairman Warner says he assured directors in board meetings that Tavoulareas \u201cdoes not participate in any decisions\u201d relating to Mobil\u2019s business with Atlas.</p>\n<p id=\"AkA\">[20] But a source close to the Tavoulareas family and those familiar with the formation of Atlas said Mobil\u2019s president was involved personally in several key decisions and actions relating to Atlas, among them:</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">\u2022 Tavoulareas personally recruited two shipping executives, one an outside consultant and the other a Mobil vice president, for Atlas. One of them set up and ran Atlas for more than a year. The other managed it for a time.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">\u2022 The Mobil president helped negotiate the arrangement whereby the Saudi shipping partnership, Samarco, would turn over all of its management business to Atlas. Mobil officials acknowledged this in a statement last week to The Post.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">\u2022 As the formation of Atlas was being planned in April 1974, Tavoulareas personally urged that his son be included as an equity partner in Atlas. However, in the Mobil statement, Tavoulareas denies this. \u201cMr. Tavoulareas asserts that he did not initiate this arrangement,\u201d the statement said.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">\u2022 The elder Tavoulareas played a personal role in forcing the resignation in 1975 of Greek shipping executive George D. Comnas, who had been recruited a year earlier by Tavoulareas to set up Atlas. The resignation followed several personal disputes between Comnas and Tavoulareas\u2019 son. Mobil\u2019s statement said \u201cMr. Tavoulareas played a minor role ... in the arrangements made when Comnas departed from Atlas. Since it was on Mobil\u2019s recommendation \u2014 including Mr. Tavoulareas\u2019 ... [that Comnas set up Atlas], it was logical that Mr. Tavoulareas participate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-13\">[25] The elder Tavoulareas was not available for an interview, but through a spokesman acknowledged that the basic idea to set up Atlas was his and that he recommended Comnas set it up. But he denied that he urged that his son be accepted as a partner and stated that he divorced himself from Mobil\u2019s business with Atlas after his son joined the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-14\">Comnas, according to Marquis Who\u2019s Who, completed a 30-year career with Exxon in 1968 and was president of Mediterranean and African subsidiaries for Exxon during his last years there. In the five years before he formed Atlas, Comnas, 66, was managing director and chairman of the board of C.M. Lemos &amp; Co. Ltd. of London, reportedly the largest of the Greek shipping firms.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-15\">One of Mobil\u2019s partners in Samarco said that the involvement of Peter Tavoulareas was accepted without objection because it was assumed that other Atlas managers were competent to run the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-16\">\u201cClearly it was a nepotistic act,\u201d said Kousi, one of the original directors of Samarco. \u201cAt his age [Peter was 24 in 1974] he wasn\u2019t a genius, nor was he terribly experienced in shipping. You couldn\u2019t expect a lot from someone with that level of experience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-17\">Philip Piro, a Baltimore eye surgeon and former son-in-law to the elder Tavoulareas, who is now estranged from the family, said Tavoulareas expressed his interest at the time as \u201cgiving Peter a little nudge to get him along.\u201d Tavoulareas, through a spokesman, said he does not recall making the remark.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-18\">[30] In 1973, a year before young Tavoulareas became a partner in Atlas, he was making $14,000 a year as a clerk in the London office of Greek shipping magnate Lemos. Sources said that job also was arranged by his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Before that, the Mobil president\u2019s son was graduated from St. Johns University in New York, where his father sits on the board of trustees, and later received a master\u2019s in business administration from Columbia University.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">In an early interview, Peter Tavoulareas said that his partnership in Atlas did not represent \u201covert favoritism\u201d and that his responsibilities in the company revolved around \u201cfinancing.\u201d Peter Tavoulareas said that he was asked by Comnas to join Atlas and was offered an equity interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">In a later interview, Peter Tavoulareas would not comment further. \u201cI\u2019ve answered all of the questions you\u2019re going to get from me. Atlas has nothing to do with Mobil [in some early editions \u2018Saudis\u2019], it has nothing to do with Samarco and it has nothing to do with the Saudis. Atlas is none of your damn business.\u201d He then hung up.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">In recent weeks, Mobil has not responded to Washington Post requests for interviews with company officials familiar with Atlas and its operations. The first such request was made Nov. 8. Mobil\u2019s vice president for public affairs, Hebert Schmertz, said Nov. 16. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying no and we're not saying yes.\u201d Still later, Schmertz said the request was \u201cunder consideration.\u201d In a letter to The Post Nov. 12, another Mobil spokesman, John Flint, said, \u201cWe understand that you have been advised that this matter has been examined by several reporters for The Washington Post and New York Times, and apparently they found no basis to do a story.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">[35] The Post did make a brief inquiry into Atlas in 1976, but received assurances from Mobil executives that Mobil\u2019s president had maintained a completely \u201chands off\u201d attitude toward Atlas. The Post began a new inquiry two months ago, based on new information about Atlas.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">Mobil\u2019s Schmertz eventually requested that questions be dictated so that Mobil could respond in writing. This was done and Mobil responded to these questions Nov. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">Several sources who agreed to discuss the details of this episode if their identities were protected were intimately familiar either with Mobil\u2019s shipping operations or with the attempts by Mobil\u2019s president to secure a position for his son in the upper strata of the business world.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">The story of international finance, shipping and oil politics begins with the 1973 Arab oil embargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">In the wake of the oil cutoff, Mobil officials learned that a prominent Saudi merchant company, Haji Abdullah Alireza &amp; Co., was interested in extending Saudi influence from the production of oil to its transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-13\">[40] Mobil officials believed at the time that a shipping partnership with the Saudis might yield preferential treatment in the loading of crude oil at Saudi ports.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-14\">In his 1976 message to stockholders, Mobil\u2019s Warner said, \u201cSamarco was formed in anticipation ... of [Saudi] flag preference regulations applicable to exports of petroleum from that country and, also, in anticipation of ... favorable financing from Saudi Arabian sources.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-15\">Mobil and its partners in the venture acknowledge now that neither the preference laws nor the financing for ships materialized.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-16\">\u201cThe business reasons were wrong, they didn\u2019t prove out,\u201d says Kousi, whose company sold out its interest in Samarco to Mobil two years ago. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t see the anticipated benefits,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-17\">But at the time Samarco was formed, Mobil officials felt \u201cpreference shipping was much more a threat,\u201d according to the Mobil statement. Samarco, however, in which Mobil initially held a 30 percent interest and now holds a 45 percent interest, existed mostly on paper. The real work of the partnership would be performed by the management company, Atlas.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-18\">[45] \u201cThere was no staff or offices for Samarco,\u201d said Kousi. \u201cIt needed no real offices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-19\">The negotiations between Mobil executives and the Saudi partners in Samarco <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>took all of 1974. After the partnership agreement was struck in December, Mobil issued a brief press release saying, \u201cSamarco has engaged the services of Atlas Maritime ... to manage the operation of Samarco\u2019s fleet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">In its statement last week, Mobil acknowledged that \u201cAtlas was created in anticipation of managing Samarco\u2019s business.\u201d Atlas was created in July 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Mobil president Tavoulareas, the statement continues, was involved in the \u201cpolicy aspects of participating in Samarco and the concept of Atlas\u201d during those negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Mobil\u2019s first goal when it entered the talks in January 1974 was to steer the Saudis away from the partnership they had formed with a New York-based shipping concern, Fairfield-Maxwell Ltd. The Saudis had approached Fairfield-Maxwell after Mobil initially rejected the joint venture idea.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">[50] \u201cThe initial invitation from the Saudis was turned down ... consistent with our normal policy of providing our own transportation and not permitting preference shipping,\u201d Mobil said last week.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">But Mobil officials said they subsequently perceived a greater threat from preference shipping. Sources said Mobil then dispatched two negotiators to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia to push Mobil as a partner. One of the negotiators was Mobil\u2019s Mideast agent, W. Jack Butler, and the other was the Greek shipping executive, Comnas, who was recruited personally by Tavoulareas to advise Mobil on how to set up an independent shipping concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">By April, the talks on Samarco had progressed far enough that the management arm of the partnership was being planned by Tavoulareas, who recommended to the partners that Comnas be tapped for the job. Late in April, according to one knowledgable source, Tavoulareas personally urged that his son become a partner in Atlas. Sources said that shortly thereafter, the issue of young Peter\u2019s involvement was raised with Mobil chairman Warner, who said he raised the issue with the directors and won their approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">In its statement, Mobil said, \u201cIt was George Comnas who asserted that he would like Peter Tavoulareas and one other associate at Lemos, a major shipping company, to join him in the management of Atlas. Mr. Tavoulareas asserts that he did not initiate this arrangement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-12\">Nevertheless, the other Lemos employe who came to Atlas with young Tavoulareas, an experienced insurance clerk named Ares D. Emmanuel, was given only employe status'while Peter Tavoulareas was made a 25 percent partner. Within a year, Tavoulareas would become a 45 percent partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-13\">[55] After Atlas became fully operable in late 1974, the time came for Samarco to begin acquiring ships for Atlas to manage. However, contrary to Mobil\u2019s hopes when it formed the partnership, the Saudis were unwilling to provide any investment funds or financing for ships. '</p>\n<p id=\"b211-14\">Mobil said in its statement that an unspecified amount of \u201ccapital contribution\u201d was made by each partner when Samarco was formed. One of the partners, the son of Crown Prince Fahd, heir to the Saudi throne, apparently had a special arrangement. Said Mobil: \u201cThe prince\u2019s share was financed by loan, which he must repay before he receives any financial benefits in the company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-15\">As a result, in early 1975, Mobil provided Samarco\u2019s first vessel from its own fleet. The ship, a supertanker, had been launched as the Mobil Mariner, but was renamed the Saudi Glory, presumably to reflect the interests of the Saudi partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-16\">The Saudi Glory was turned over to Atlas by Mobil under a \u201cbareboat\u201d lease through Samarco, meaning the structure of the tanker, without crew, fuel or stores, was rented to the Saudi partnership and its management arm. However, because Samarco and Atlas had no funds with which to pay such a rental fee, the ship was leased back to Mobil simultaneously.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Under this arrangement, Atlas agreed to operate the vessel for Mobil, hire crews, arrange for fueling and handle small maintenance chores. All major repairs were Mobil\u2019s responsibility. Thus Mobil paid Atlas the cost of operating the ship plus an unspecified margin of profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">[60] Mobil\u2019s executive vice president for Mideast transportation, Paul J. Wolfe, said in an early interview that Atlas\u2019 basic management fee was $600,000 a year and included an escalation clause. Other sources said the fee would escalate with the cost-of-living index and also after Atlas acquired more than 10 ships.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Peter Tavoulareas said the management fee was $680,000 for 1976, when Atlas was operating six ships.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">The firm\u2019s income for subsequent years is not known, but one knowledgeable source said that Atlas was structured so that profits would increase dramatically as more ships were acquired, because overhead costs for staff and office space were relatively fixed.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">Because Mobil operates its own ship management arm within the Mobil organization, it could have managed the Samarco fleet itself, company officials acknowledged.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">But Mobil officials claim that there could have been a conflict of interest for any one of the Samarco partners to manage the ships owned by all of the partners. Mobil\u2019s statement said:</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">[65] \u201cMobil did not want to manage Samarco or to set up a Samarco management company, as there could be a conflict of interest between Mobil and Samarco when chartering ships in or out for either company. Neither of the Saudi partners had experience to qualify them to manage. Fairfield-Maxwell could have had a similar conflict. Accordingly, it was prudent to have an independent third-party managing company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-11\">Mobil officials said a study was done of management fees in the shipping industry as a guide to setting Atlas\u2019 fees. But the company acknowledged that there were no bids.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-13\">\u201cShip management arrangements are difficult to assess on a bid basis ... From Mobil\u2019s experience, the overriding selection criteria for such operations is the prospect of good, safe performance and access to low-cost dependable crews,\u201d the company\u2019s statement said.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-14\">(Atlas has lost one ship, the Atlas Titan, which exploded and burned last May at Setubal, Portugal, during a tank-cleaning operation, according to Lloyd\u2019s of London. The ship was sold for scrap in July.)</p>\n<p id=\"b212-15\">According to Mobil\u2019s statement, one advantage derived from using Atlas as a management company came from Atlas\u2019 \u201cability to use low-cost Greek crews unavailable to Mobil or to other, similar non-Greek companies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-16\">[70] Kousi, Mobil\u2019s partner at the time, reacted to that statement by saying, \u201cWho didn\u2019t [have access to low-cost Greek crews]? That\u2019s a phony argument.\u201d Kousi said that virtually all companies who have international subsidiaries, such as Mobil, have access to low-cost crews of Greek and other nationalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-17\">It is not clear from maritime records how many ships Mobil supplied to Atlas under the contract arrangement. The records show that in March 1978, Mobil was the registered owner of an oil tanker named the Yanbu that was under Atlas\u2019 control. And, last October, Mobil supplied to Atlas another tanker named the Solon, records show.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-18\">The second of the ships that were turned over to Atlas in 1975 was also a Mobil ship. The 250,000-ton supertanker, launched as the Mobil Supplier, according to Federal Maritime Commission records, was renamed the A1 Haramain.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-19\">The third ship, also Mobil\u2019s, was launched as the Elena and became the A1 Rowdah.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-20\">Presently, Mobil officials said in their statement that they have chartered \u201ccertain tankers\u201d to Samarco \u201cand chartered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>most of these back from Samarco on a time charter basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">[75] Of the 17 ships Atlas reportedly operates worldwide, Mobil said seven are run for Samarco and four of those ships are owned by Mobil.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Less than a year after this corporation was set up to manage the fleet assembled by Mobil with the Saudis, Atlas underwent an internal struggle in which Peter Tavoulareas and one of his employes, Emmanuel, took over control of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Comnas, who had been recruited by Mobil to set up Atlas and run it, resigned in mid-1975. Mobil\u2019s Wolfe explained the Greek shipping executive\u2019s departure by saying that Samarco's directors had grown dissatisfied with his performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Kousi, who was on the Samarco board at the time, declined to discuss Comnas\u2019 departure in detail. He did say that it was not Samarco\u2019s board that was dissatisfied, but rather, \u201cMobil basically was dissatisfied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">Sources familiar with the situation said that Peter Tavoulareas had several personal disputes with Comnas and shortly thereafter, his father, William Tavoulareas, intervened, Mobil acknowledged that Tavoulareas played a minor role by \u201cassuring a settlement that was fair and equitable to both parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">[80] That settlement reportedly included Mobil paying Comnas a substantial retainer as an independent marine consultant for several years.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">The relationship between the Mobil president and Atlas also was exemplified by his response when Atlas was left without a seasoned shipping executive in control after Comnas departed.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">Almost immediately, according to Piro and other sources, the elder Tavoulareas dispatched one of his senior shipping executives, Herman F. Hoffmann, to London to help run Atlas.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-13\">Said Kousi: \u201cMobil had suggested Comnas so it was natural for Mobil to step forward and to feel an obligation to meet whatever vacuum they thought existed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-14\">Mobil gave this account in its statement: \u201cSince Mobil had. originally recommended G. Comnas to Samarco, we felt an obligation to Samarco to maintain quality management of their operations. We made Hoffmann ... available as an interim manager of Atlas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-15\">[85] During this period, Hoffmann was given the opportunity to take over Atlas permanently, but he declined. While he remained at Atlas, Mobil officials said, Hoffmann\u2019s salary \u201cwas pro-rated in proportion to his time. Atlas reimbursed Mobil for that portion relating to Atlas duties, plus all related expenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-16\">\n<em>Special correspondent Sandy Golden contributed to this report.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b168-7\">. \u201c[S]ome 12 or 14 other [oil] companies [were] establishing similar organizations ...\u201d (Tr. 1090).

We note, however, that the public figure determination in this case would not be free from difficulty. The Supreme Court has defined two classes of public figures. \"General public figures\u201d are those who are always, for every purpose, to be considered public figures; the class is small and specifically limited to those who have \"general fame or notoriety in the community.\u201d <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 351-52, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 3013, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974). The district court rejected the suggestion that William Tavoulareas was an all-purpose public figure; in the absence of any evidence that William Tavoulareas was a household word prior to the <em>Post\u2019s </em>accusations, that determination appears correct. More common than general public figures, however, are \u201climited public figures,\" <em>i.e., </em>those who are public figures only with regard to certain issues. They are those who have \"thrust themselves to the forefront of <em>particular public controversies </em>in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 345, 94 S.Ct. at 3009 (emphasis added). The district court found that William Tavoulareas was a limited public figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">The framework for analyzing limited public figures was set forth by this court in <em>Waldbaum v. Fairchild Publications, Inc., </em>627 F.2d 1287 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 898, 101 S.Ct. 266, 66 L.Ed.2d 128 (1980). The court must (1) define the precise controversy involved, (2) analyze the plaintiffs role in the controversy, and (3) determine if the defamatory material was germane to the plaintiffs participation in the controversy. <em>Id. </em>at 1296-98. The difficulty in this case is finding any \u201cparticular public controversy\u201d regarding the Mobil-Atlas-Samarco arrangement <em>which existed before Tyler\u2019s story was published. </em>A defendant obviously cannot create a controversy by publishing defamatory falsehoods and then escape liability by pointing to the resulting furor as evidence of a public controversy. The <em>Post </em>in its brief has proffered several \"controversies\u201d to which its article might be \"germane,\u201d but without deciding the issue we note that on this record these are either virtually non-existent <em>(e.g., </em>the alleged \"pre-existing public controversy\" over the Mobil-Samarco-Atlas arrangements) or apparently unrelated to the subject of nepotism within Mobil <em>(e.g\u201e </em>the \u201cdebate\u201d between energy conservationists and those favoring increasing oil imports, or the alleged public controversy over Mobil continuing to obtain oil from Saudi Arabia).

Id. </em>This court has implicitly recognized this principle in <em>Lebron v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., </em>749 F.2d 893, 897 (D.C.Cir.1984). Even the dissent confesses that the \"[credibility of a witness may be the most compelling case for deferring to the factfinder.\" Dissent at 149. The factfinder here was the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b178-8\">. It would not be valid to argue that the obfuscatory reading must be adopted or else the fact-finder's credibility-based determination <em>on even the ultimate issue itself </em>would have to be accepted, thus destroying the core holding of the case. It is possible for a credibility determination to conclude the ultimate issue <em>for </em>the defendant (which would not of course trigger any requirement of independent review) but not <em>against </em>him. Only the defendant can testify of his own knowledge as to his state of mind. Thus, the jury may choose to believe the defendant\u2019s assertion that he did not know the falsity of the statement; it would not be permitted to consider the conclusory statement of someone else that he did.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b179-5\">. As the dissent notes, <em>see </em>Dissent at 146, 148, the Supreme Court in <em>Bose </em>stated that judges must make \"an independent assessment ... of the evidence germane to the actual malice determination.\" <em>Bose, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1967 n. 31. But the Court was not announcing some novel rule. It noted expressly that the rule in <em>Bose, </em>which originally was used for defamation cases in <em>New York Times v. Sullivan, </em>had been applied \"uncounted times before.\" <em>Bose, </em>at 1966. The <em>Guam Federation-Alioto </em>line of cases was decided in light of this standard. <em>See Guam Federation, supra </em>492 F.2d at 442; <em>Alioto, </em>519 F.2d at 780. The <em>Bose </em>court did not even mention these cases, much less cast any doubt upon their continued vitality. Absent some clear signal from the Court, we are reluctant to read <em>Bose </em>as overruling, <em>sub silentio, </em>such a well-reasoned and well-established line of authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b179-6\">. We make it clear that in no way will jury verdicts in libel cases be protected by indulging in unreasonable inferences on appeal. No set of inferences could transfigure an otherwise inadequate factual record into a clear and convincing finding of actual malice. The inferences drawn must be reasonable. <em>Schneider v. Chrysler Motors Corp., </em>401 F.2d 549, 555 (8th Cir.1968) (\"plaintiff ... is not entitled to the benefit of unreasonable inferences, or inferences at war with undisputed facts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Moreover, as our discussion indicates, in performing our constitutionally prescribed function we conduct our own independent review of the whole record under the mandate recently reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in <em>Bose </em>in conjunction with the established rule for awarding a judgment n.o.v. While fully embracing the independent review standard, the dissent ignores the important fact that we are reviewing a jury verdict set aside by a judgment n.o.v. This is revealed in the dissent\u2019s curious and frequent citations to the \"findings\u201d of the trial judge and the dissent\u2019s suggestions that those \"findings\u201d somehow control our review. <em>See e.g\u201e </em>Dissent at 151, 152, 156, 157, 159, 160, 161-62. The dissent thus takes two wholly contradictory positions. It is precisely <em>because </em>this court is <em>independently reviewing </em>the whole record that it cannot be bound by any \"findings\u201d of the trial judge where, as in this case, the case was tried to a jury, not to the trial court. The trial judge reviewed the evidence once. Now this court must undertake anew that same review independently of the review already conducted by the district court judge. To be bound in the manner suggested by the dissent would \u201ccabin\" our review and render it meaningless, <em>see </em>Dissent at 146, requiring of this court the impossible task of independent review while still being bound by the district court\u2019s findings in support of the judgment n.o.v. Thus the standard of review the dissent proposes is impossible to follow; it contradicts not only Supreme Court precedent, but itself as well, and could not be followed without espousing the most blatant solecisms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b180-5\">.

Thus, its sole source of truthfulness is Comnas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b182-12\">. Comnas\u2019 motivation to offer Peter a position in Atlas may not have been that William had urged it, as appellees assert occurred, but could easily have been that Comnas hoped by doing so he would curry favor with Peter's father, as appellant argues.

Contrary to any hints by the dissent, our conclusion as to falsity does not \"ignore\u201d any evidence presented at trial. For example, regarding the statements made to Tyler by Wolfe and Kousi, and Tavoulareas\u2019 own SEC testimony, as explained here and as amplified <em>infra </em>in the actual malice discussion, Wolfe merely confirmed that when Mobil began to form an independent shipping company Tavoulareas was involved in recruiting Comnas, and Kousi had no personal knowledge to support his statement that the hiring of Peter Tavoulareas by Comnas was a \"nepotistic act.\" The jury was entitled to find that such circumstantial evidence was clearly outweighed by William Tavoulareas' SEC testimony, which \u2014 far from providing evidence that he \"set up\u201d his son \u2014 denied any role in setting up Peter, and by the testimony of the plaintiffs and other Mobil officers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b185-7\">. The fact that a witness is an employee of a litigant is in itself reason for discounting his evidence.

Woodward and Greider concurred. Woodward testified that Comnas was the <em>Post's </em>\"key witness\" and that \u201c[s]o much of this seems to hinge on George Comnas\u201d (J.A. 2181, 2193). Greider testified that Comnas was a \u201cvery important source\u201d and the \"principal source\u201d for the story (J.A. 1895, 1904).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b199-10\">. The defendants rely heavily on John Kousi\u2019s opinion, quoted in the story, that Peter's involvement in Atlas was a \"nepotistic act.\u201d But while Kousi\u2019s deposition (used at trial) acknowledges his use of that phrase, it contains no supporting facts to demonstrate the basis for Kousi\u2019s statement that William Tavoulareas was involved in setting up Peter in Atlas, and provides no support for the assertion that William personally urged Comnas to bring Peter in as a partner. It is clear from his deposition that he had no particular knowledge of how Peter originally came to be involved in Atlas, and he did not purport to offer more than his <em>opinions </em>on the subject. Those opinions, while possibly relevant, provided no evidentiary foundation for Comnas\u2019 assertion that William \"personally urged\u201d that his son be included in Atlas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b199-14\">.

There was further evidence, introduced through Kousi's deposition, that Comnas was unable to get along with the Saudi partners in Samarco, that he had denigrated the educability of Saudis, and that <em>none </em>of the Saudi partners considered Comnas capable of running Atlas adequately (J.A. 1991-94).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b201-9\">. Again, as with most circumstantial evidence, reliance on the unsupported testimony of biased witnesses is not sufficient <em>in and of itself </em>to prove actual malice, but must be considered with the totality of the other evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b201-10\">.

To hold that it was exculpatory would exalt the time pressure excuse into an absolute defense in every case.

It is likewise true that refusal to retract may, in certain circumstances, be evidence that there was <em>no </em>actual malice: the refusal may show that the publisher believed and still believes that the falsehood was true. That a particular piece of evidence may point both ways, however, does not mean that it is not evidence. The reasonableness of the refusal <em>(e.g., </em>how strong was the showing of falsity?) might be some indication of which inference was more likely. When a given fact is susceptible of two reasonable inferences, it is for the jury to determine which one it will adopt. <em>See Time, Inc. v.

In reinstating the verdict for William Tavoulareas against defendant Piro, we note an issue not raised by the parties \u2014 namely, the issue of \"republication liability.\u201d William Tavoulareas had sued Dr. Piro not only for slander, but for republication libel as well (the <em>Post\u2019s </em>printing of the slanders Piro uttered to the <em>Post </em>reporters). The jury returned a general verdict in favor of William Tavoulareas. Should the verdict be based in part on a finding of republication libel, it poses no problem on our review. The maker of a slanderous statement may be held accountable for its republication if such republication was reasonably foreseeable. L.

Here, Piro conveyed his slanders to Golden and Tyler, whom he knew to be newspaper reporters. Under the circumstances here it was reasonably foreseeable that as reporters they might republish the statements in a news story. Accordingly, there is no need to require proof that Piro knowingly participated in the <em>Post\u2019s </em>republication. As our following discussion of the liability of reporter Golden suggests, we distinguish, for purposes of republication liability, between the liability of the maker of the statement and the liability of one who republishes those statements, here to a reporter for possible use in a story that will presumably be investigated further.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b213-17\">J.

Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 270, 84 S.Ct. 710, 721, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964). In my judgment, the majority opinion strays far from this fundamental commitment, vastly increases journalistic liability, and mistakenly rejects the carefully reasoned opinion of Judge Gasch. I dissent from almost all of the majority opinion; I concur only in the judgment affirming the judgment notwithstanding the verdict for defendant Golden.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-36\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b214-37\">It is helpful to review the salient facts that are not in dispute. In 1974 Mobil became a substantial partner with prominent Saudis and another company in a joint venture called SAMARCO, a shipping concern. William Tavoulareas, Mobil\u2019s president and the advocate of close cooperation with the Saudis, played a major role in conceiving and preparing Mobil\u2019s participation in SAMARCO. Mobil and its partners agreed that Atlas Trading Company, which had been formed, according to Mobil, \u201cin anticipation of managing SAMARCO\u2019s business,\u201d Record Excerpts (RE) 2344, would manage SAMARCO\u2019s ships; many of those ships would be leased from Mobil. In the spring of 1974 William Tavoulareas personally recruited George Comnas to manage SAMARCO\u2019s ships through Atlas. At the time Tavoulareas knew that his son, Peter, worked for Comnas. Soon after Comnas took control at Atlas, Peter left his $14,000 a year job to become a major partner at Atlas. All of these facts are undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-39\">After researching the story for a month, <em>Washington Post </em>reporter Patrick Tyler wrote an 85-paragraph article about the Mobil-SAMARCO-Atlas relationship and Tavoulareas\u2019 role in it. More than 20 paragraphs of the article reported Mobil\u2019s version of the events in question. Tavoulareas challenges three statements and one implication in the article: the statement that he \u201cset up\u201d his son and \u201cpersonally urged\u201d his inclusion as a partner, the statement that he \u201cpersonally dispatched\u201d an executive to Atlas after Comnas\u2019 departure, the statement that Mobil \u201cprovided\u201d ships to Atlas, and the possible implication that Tavoulareas engineered the transaction solely to benefit his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-40\">Assuming that Tavoulareas is a public figure, <em>see </em>discussion in text at 162-165 <em>infra, </em>the question before this court is whether these statements and the claimed implication are stripped of their First Amendment protection because they were false, defamatory, and published with knowledge or reckless disregard of their falsity. Since I find that the evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>the record falls far short of establishing clear and convincing proof of knowledge or reckless disregard of falsity, I view that question as dispositive. For, even if the statements are false and defamatory, without such clear and convincing proof of knowledge or recklessness, the First Amendment unquestionably protects the challenged expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">II. Legal Standard</p>\n<p id=\"ANj\">A. <em>Overview</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The majority opinion achieves no less than an ambitious, wide-ranging revision of libel jurisprudence. The majority accomplishes this revision in two ways. First, it counts, as elements of actual malice, factors that are completely impermissible considerations in reaching the daunting conclusion that the First Amendment does not apply to the challenged expression. These factors include criticism of a newspaper\u2019s emphasis on attention-getting stories, majority opinion (maj. op.) at 120-121; condemnation of the career ambitions of young journalists, <em>id. </em>at 119-120; challenges to a newspaper\u2019s resolution of reasonable ambiguities, <em>id. </em>at 121-123; and rejection of editorial judgments about the information to be included in an article that clearly reports both sides of a disputed story, <em>id. </em>at 123-125. Indeed, the majority appears to criticize what it takes to be the general climate in journalism today. It goes so far as to attach some opprobrium to a newspaper\u2019s policy of \u201c \u2018hard-hitting investigative journalism,\u2019 \u201d maj. op. at 121, and, too, emphasizes the need to deter \u201cthe least responsible journalists\u201d who might \u201cscoop their more careful colleagues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 131 n. 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">In my judgment, we do not sit, even in reviewing a libel verdict, as some kind of journalism review seminar, offering our observations on contemporary journalism and journalists. Our mission is to see that the First Amendment is vigorously protected and that libel verdicts not supported by clear and convincing evidence do not stand. The majority\u2019s use of these impermissible factors as evidence of actual malice seriously undermines that mission. The majority stresses that we should suspend judgment on each of its factors because, after all, \u201c \u2018a brick is not a wall.\u2019 \u201d Maj. op. at 122 (citation omitted). But when a particular factor is so insubstantial and so inappropriate to the weighty First Amendment matters before us, it clearly is not even a brick.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">Second, the majority dramatically narrows our well-established constitutional responsibility to conduct an independent review of the record in these First Amendment cases. The nature of that review is critically important, and the majority seeks to reduce it to a pro forma, mechanical ratification to be undertaken only after the pieces of evidence have already been uncritically labelled \u201cindicia of actual malice\u201d and \u201ccumulated.\u201d The majority\u2019s determined effort to constrict our constitutionally mandated inquiry will be discussed in detail below.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">Through these two devices, the majority manages to reinstitute a jury verdict of libel in this case. In a brief aside at the last moment, the majority dangles the possibility that this excessive $2.05 million verdict may ultimately be reduced in further proceedings. Maj. op. at 137. And that is at least some comfort, given that these damages seem clearly disproportionate to any possible rendering of the <em>Post\u2019s </em>conduct and Tavoulareas\u2019 injury. But it is, of course, the libel verdict itself, not merely the amount of damages, that chills First Amendment expression. Indeed, a majority of this court recently recognized that a libel suit itself has the potential to chill. <em>See Ollman v. Evans, </em>750 F.2d 970, 991 n. 44 (D.C.Cir.1984) <em>(en banc)', id. </em>at 993 (Bork, J., concurring). And in a statement that aptly summarizes the problems with the majority\u2019s approach in this case, three members of the <em>Oilman </em>court joined Judge Bork\u2019s statement that \u201c[i]t is not merely the size of damage awards but an entire shift in the application of libel laws that raises problems for press freedom.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 996-997. In short, our central inquiry is whether there is clear and convincing evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>dence of reckless falsity; the possibility of reduced damages does not remedy the problems in the majority\u2019s decision, or the distortion that it works on our constitutionally mandated independent inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">This is not a case that lends itself to easy capsulization. The record \u2014 which we are constitutionally charged to review \u2014 includes some nine volumes and 3400 pages in the Joint Appendix submitted to us, and that appendix contains only record excerpts. The issues are many and varied, touching on.countless subdoctrines in the often baroque field of libel jurisprudence. But despite the vastness of the record and the number and complexity of the issues, our responsibility is fundamental, all-important, and inescapable: we must determine whether the First Amendment protects the challenged expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">To discharge this responsibility, it is necessary for the court \u2014 and this dissent \u2014 to examine the varied issues and the complex record with extreme care. With respect to the majority\u2019s use of impermissible factors, I will discuss each impermissible factor in turn as part of a systematic analysis of the elements that, in the majority\u2019s view, are sufficient to reinstate the verdicts. However, the nature of the independent review that is our constitutional responsibility\u2014 and that the majority transforms into a pale imitation of its former self \u2014 must be considered in detail at the outset.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">B. <em>The Constitutional Responsibility of Independent Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">In <em>Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984) (hereinafter cited only to 104 S.Ct.), the Supreme Court vigorously reaffirmed the <em>New York Times </em>requirement of independent appellate review for determinations of actual malice. The Court stated unequivocally, \u201cJudges, as expositors of the Constitution, must independently decide whether the evidence in the record is sufficient to cross the constitutional threshold that bars the entry of any judgment that is not supported by clear and convincing proof of \u2018actual malice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1965. Specifically, the Court noted that this responsibility extends to \u201can independent assessment * * * of the evidence germane to the actual malice determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1967 n. 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-12\">This case concerns the exercise of that independent review in considering a challenge to a trial judge\u2019s decision to grant a j.n.o.v. In the majority\u2019s rendering, our review in this situation becomes a process in which we resolve all inferences in favor of the plaintiff, reject conflicting evidence supporting the defendant, reflexively label inferences \u201cindicia of actual malice,\u201d \u201ccumulate\u201d these malice-laden inferences, and then ask whether actual malice has been clearly and convincingly established. In my judgment, this approach assumes its conclusion, narrowly cabins our review, and deprives the media of the protection that <em>New York Times </em>and <em>Bose </em>sought to confer \u2014 a vigorous judicial review to ensure that verdicts based on less than clear and convincing evidence of actual malice will not stand. It thus reduces the safeguards for the \u201cjournalistic independence\u201d that this court has stressed. <em>McBride v. Merrell Dow &amp; Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 727 </em>F.2d 1460, 1466 (D.C.Cir.1983).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-13\">According to the majority, <em>New York Times </em>and <em>Bose </em>create some kind of distinction between the \u201cmanner\u201d and \u201cstandard\u201d of evaluating evidence. This distinction, articulated in two Ninth Circuit decisions, is, of course, nowhere to be found in the Supreme Court\u2019s frequent admonitions to \u201cmake an independent examination of the whole record,\u201d <em>see, e.g., Old Dominion Branch No. 496, Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Letter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number><em>Carriers v. Austin, </em>418 U.S. 264, 282, 94 S.Ct. 2770, 2780, 41 L.Ed.2d 745 (1972). Since the majority seeks to enthrone it as the law of the circuit, however, the distinction bears some attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">In the majority\u2019s view, - \u201c \u2018[t]he <em>standard </em>against which the evidence must be examined is that of <em>New York Times </em>and its progeny. But the <em>manner </em>in which the evidence is to be examined in the light of that standard is the same\u2019 \u201d as in all other challenges to j.n.o.v. determinations. Maj. op. at 105 <em>(quoting Guam Federation of Teachers, Local 1581 v. Ysrael, </em>492 F.2d 438, 441 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,. </em>441 U.S. 962, 95 S.Ct. 132, 42 L.Ed.2d 111 (1974) (emphasis by the <em>Guam </em>court)). Thus the majority concludes that \u201cthe evidence and the reasonable inferences derived from it\u201d should be \u201cexamined in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 106, and that the j.rno.v. posture of the cas\u00e9 requires that \u201call reasonable inferences must be granted to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108. Critically, this presumption in granting inferences even applies to inferences that .the majority has determined are \u201cindicia of actual malice\u201d \u2014 reliance on unreliable sources, resolution of ambiguities against the plaintiff, and so forth. These inferences are then \u201ccumulated.\u201d Only <em>after </em>these inferences have been granted in favor of the plaintiff and cumulated, the majority reasons, does the <em>New York Times/Bose </em>responsibility of independent review come into play, and the question is whether these cumulated inferences prove actual malice by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">This approach renders the independent appellate review promised by <em>Bose </em>a mirage. Independent review of the record devolves into review of the pool of pre-selected inferences that cut against the defendant. It comes as no surprise, then, that, at the point for the majority\u2019s exercise of independent review, the outcome has already been largely decided against the defendant. This is far from the independent review envisioned by <em>Bose \u201cto </em>preserve the precious liberties established and ordained by the Constitution.\u201d 104 S.Ct. at 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The majority\u2019s method of analyzing the evidence and permissible inferences conflicts with Supreme Court decisions requiring an independent review of the record. In <em>Bose </em>itself the decision turned on the inference to be drawn from the finding that a witness was not telling the truth in failing to understand the difference between two phrases: the Supreme Court rejected the inference, drawn by the trier of fact, that the witness recognized the difference at the time of publication, and'the Court drew its own inference that the testimony was part of the witness\u2019 \u201ccapacity for rationalization.\u201d 104 S.Ct. at 1966. As the majority notes, maj. op. at 107, the <em>Bose </em>Court relied on the \u201cpurely factual findings\u201d of the trial judge, 104 S.Ct. at 1967; as the majority fails to note, the Court rejected, as part of its independent inquiry, an inference drawn by the trial judge that was freighted with actual malice implications.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\"><em>Bose </em>was far from the first case in which the Court emphasized that the constitutional responsibility of independent review encompasses far more than the majority\u2019s exercise in ritualistic inference granting. In <em>Time v. Pape, </em>401 U.S. 279, 91 S.Ct. 633, 28 L.Ed.2d 45 (1971), the Court drew its own inference about the character of a government report described by the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 286-290, 91 S.Ct. at 637-639. Though reviewing a directed verdict \u2014 which has the same standard as a j.n.o.v., <em>Vander Zee v. Karabatsos, </em>589 F.2d 723, 726 (D.C.Cir.1978) \u2014 the Court never suggested that its independent review of the evidence in the record should be structured by automatic resolution of malice-laden inferences against the moving party. In its independent evaluation of actual malice determinations, moreover, the Supreme Court has repeatedly stressed that its review is \u201can independent examination of the record <em>as a whole,\u201d Beckley Newspapers Corp. v. Hanks, </em>389 U.S. 81, 82, 88 S.Ct. 197, 198, 19 L.Ed.2d 248 (1967) (emphasis added), not merely the bits and \u2022 pieces which support \u201cindicia of actual malice.\u201d Finally, in other constitutional areas in which the Supreme Court has exercised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>independent review the Court has not undertaken the kind of selective reading of the record and automatic inference assumption that the majority employs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Nor has the Court relied on a purported distinction between the \u201cmanner\u201d and \u201cstandard\u201d of evaluating evidence in reviewing the record. In <em>Bose </em>the question before the Court was the very similar question of whether Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a) \u2014 which provides that findings of the trial court<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> may only be set aside if \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d \u2014 governed a determination of actual malice. The Court did not turn to some manner/standard distinction. Rather, in emphasizing the differences between questions of fact and questions of mixed fact and law the <em>Bose </em>Court emphasized the delicate judgments involved and the necessity of giving a narrow reading to the realm of pure fact in certain circumstances. \u201cWhere the line [between fact and law] is drawn varies according to the nature of the substantive law at issue. Regarding certain largely factual questions in some areas of the law, the stakes \u2014 in terms of impact on future cases and future conduct \u2014 are too great to entrust them finally to the judgment of the trier of fact.\u201d 104 S.Ct. at 1960 n. 17.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Instead of relying on a supposed distinction between the manner and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>standard of evaluating evidence, the Court framed the judicial responsibility more forthrightly \u2014 \u201can independent assessment * * * of the evidence germane to the actual malice determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1967 n. 31.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Similarly, the majority\u2019s emphasis on some great divide between \u201ceach separate fact determination that forms the basis for the ultimate conclusion of \u2018actual malice\u2019 \u201d and \u201cthe ultimate conclusion of clear and convincing proof of \u2018actual malice,\u2019 \u201d maj. op. at 107, also distorts <em>Bose. </em>The majority\u2019s central contention is that the <em>Bose </em>emphasis on the difference between the scope of Rule 52(a) and the scope of our independent, constitutional review corresponds to the majority\u2019s own distinction between \u201cpreliminary factual determinations\u201d and \u201cultimate\u201d facts. Maj. op. at 108. But that is simply not how <em>Bose </em>delineates the difference between Rule 52(a) (which applies to factual questions) and our independent review (which applies to constitutionally mixed questions of fact and law). The Court emphasized that Rule 52(a) applies to the \u201cmany findings of fact [in a libel case] <em>that are irrelevant </em>to the constitutional standard of <em>New York Times v. Sullivan,\u201d </em>104 S.Ct. at 1967 n. 31 (emphasis added). Our independent review, in contrast, extends to \u201cthe evidence germane to the actual malice determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Clearly, the inferences labelled \u201cindicia of actual malice\u201d are <em>relevant </em>and <em>germane </em>to the constitutional inquiry; indeed, they are essential to it. Thus they are appropriately within the scope of our independent appellate review, rather than within the scope of Rule 52(a). Far from \u201cvestpng] appellate courts with original jurisdiction in libel actions,\u201d maj. op. at 108, that Supreme Court-identified \u201crational stopping point,\u201d <em>id., </em>ensures that we may discharge our constitutional responsibility and see that the decision not to extend the First Amendment to challenged expression is limited, in these cases, to those instances in which there is <em>clear </em>and <em>convincing </em>evidence supporting the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">I believe that the <em>Bose </em>Court meant what it said, and that we must undertake an independent assessment of the evidence germane to the actual malice determination \u2014 not merely a ratification of the preselected inferences supporting an actual malice conclusion. To be sure, we must recognize that \u201cthe presumption that attaches to factual findings is stronger in some cases than others.\u201d 104 S.Ct. at 1959. Credibility of a witness may be the most compelling case for deferring to the factfinder; applying inferences that are labelled \u201cindicia of actual malice,\u201d however, may be the least, for it directly affects the independent assessment of the evidence germane to actual malice that <em>Bose </em>requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">In my judgment, Judge Gasch\u2019s well-reasoned opinion, <em>see Tavoulareas v. Washington Post Co., </em>567 F.Supp. 651 (D.D.C. 1983), decided before <em>Bose, </em>is far closer to <em>Bose\u2019s </em>conception of independent review and sensitivity to First Amendment values than the majority\u2019s opinion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For it seems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>clear to me that if evidence in the record is to be considered probative of actual malice, the judge must answer two questions. First, can this be the type of evidence which the Supreme Court has found may be probative of actual malice? Second, if so, does the evidence <em>in this case </em>contribute to a finding of knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of truth or falsity? Failing to address these two questions seems to me to shirk this court\u2019s responsibility to undertake an independent examination and assessment of the record.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">With these principles in mind, and without the blinders of automatic assumption of malice-laden inferences and their consequent cumulation, I review the evidence in the record to determine if it contains clear and convincing evidence of actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">III. Actual Malice</p>\n<p id=\"ABP\">As noted, our constitutional responsibility requires a careful evaluation of \u201cthe evidence germane to actual malice.\u201d <em>Bose, supra, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1967 n. 31. In this case, and in view of the majority\u2019s opinion, that obligation requires an unusually extended discussion. Nonetheless, an independent examination of the record reveals that most of the factors cited by the majority fail to raise even a substantial question about knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of truth or falsity. Two factors do pose a more substantial question \u2014 the Peterson memorandum and the reliability of sources. Even those factors, however, do not, in my mind, rise to the level of clear and convincing evidence of knowledge of falsity, or reckless disregard of truth or falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">Before considering the lengthy list of factors that comprises the majority\u2019s actual malice analysis, it is helpful to focus on the statements that are the putative basis for Tavoulareas\u2019 lawsuit and the $2.05 million verdict, and on the materials that were before the <em>Post </em>defendants at the time of the article. For the majority\u2019s list of factors is only relevant insofar as it contributes to an understanding of whether the defendants published those statements with knowledge or reckless disregard of their falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">A. <em>The Challenged Statements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">For each of the three statements and the implication that Tavoulareas challenges, I will briefly review the statement and the <em>Post\u2019s </em>supporting materials.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This relationship, never adequately explored by the majority, is an important backdrop for the majority\u2019s wide-ranging conclusions about the reportage at issue. The ultimate question for purposes of this actual malice analysis, it should be remembered, is the <em>Post </em>defendants\u2019 state of mind in reviewing this material \u2014 the degree to which the defendants acted with knowledge or reckless disregard of falsity \u2014 not the accuracy of the statements themselves.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>1. <em>Tavoulareas \u201cset up\u201d his son and \u201cpersonally urged\u201d his inclusion in Atlas. </em>Tavoulareas challenges two descriptions of his role in establishing the MobilSAMARCO-Atlas relationship: in the headline and the first paragraph the <em>Post </em>reported that Tavoulareas \u201cset up his son\u201d; in the 23rd and 52nd paragraphs it reported that Tavoulareas \u201cpersonally urged\u201d his son\u2019s inclusion as a partner in Atlas.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">In support of the first characterization Tyler and the <em>Post </em>had various information before them at the time of publication. As Judge Gasch observed, \u201c[W]hile [Tavoulareas] may contest the ultimate truth of some of this information, he does not dispute the fact that Tyler had this material in his possession at the time he wrote the story.\u201d 567 F.Supp. at 659.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Tyler had obtained a copy of Tavoulareas\u2019 1977 SEC testimony in which Tavoulareas testified (1) that, in early 1974, he knew that his son worked as an assistant to George Comnas, (2) that he played a major role in the creation of Mobil\u2019s role in SAMARCO, (3) that he went to London in the spring of 1974 to interest Comnas in managing SAMARCO\u2019s ships through Atlas, and (4) that his son soon became a major partner in Atlas. RE 2051-2053, 2398-2460. Judge Gasch was so impressed with the significance of this information that he concluded, \u201c[Tavoulareas\u2019] own 1977 SEC testimony provided Tyler with a sufficient basis for this allegation.\u201d 567 F.Supp. at 659. In addition to the SEC testimony, former SAMARCO director John Kousi, whose credibility is not in dispute, told Tyler that the hiring of Peter Tavoulareas was \u201cclearly a nepotistic act.\u201d RE 1163-1166, 1237, 1927-1928. Mobil executive vice president Paul Wolfe also confirmed in response to Tyler\u2019s questions that Tavoulareas was involved in planning SAMARCO and Atlas and in recruiting Comnas. RE 2344-2345. Finally, George Comnas, whose credibility is fiercely disputed, told Tyler that Tavoulareas asked him to bring Peter Tavoulareas into Atlas and that Tavoulareas later asked him to resign in return for a consultant\u2019s position with Mobil. RE 981, 989.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">In support of the second characterization Tyler had Comnas\u2019 statement and the contextual corroboration provided by Tavoulareas, Kousi, and Wolfe about Tavoulareas\u2019 deep involvement in the formation of the Mobil-SAMARCO-Atlas relationship, as well as his personal recruitment of Comnas at a time when he knew Comnas was in business with his son. The Tavoulareas SEC testimony and the Wolfe letter did deny that Tavoulareas personally urged Peter\u2019s inclusion; the <em>Post </em>reported this denial four times, including both points at which the \u201cpersonally urged\u201d statement was made. U1\u00cd 23, 25, 32, 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">2. <em>Tavoulareas \u201cdispatched\" Hoffmann to run Atlas. </em>In the 82nd paragraph the <em>Post </em>reported that, after Comnas\u2019 departure from Atlas, \u201cthe elder Tavoulareas dispatched one of his senior shipping executives, Herman F. Hoffmann to London to help run Atlas.\u201d As Judge Gasch found, Tavoulareas \u201capparently participated to some extent in the discussion that led to Hoffmann\u2019s temporary assignment at Atlas.\u201d 567 F.Supp. at 661. Mobil had informed Tyler of this participation. Wolfe wrote that Tavoulareas personally negotiated the settlement for Comnas\u2019 departure, that Tavoulareas played a role, which Wolfe described as \u201cminor,\u201d in the arrangements after Comnas\u2019 departure, and that an unspecified \u201c[w]e\u201d sent Hoffman to Atlas. RE 2345. In its discussion of the \u201cdispatched\u201d statement as part of its list of factors, the majority dismisses this evidence. <em>See </em>text at 158-159 <em>infra. </em>In addition to the Wolfe letter, Tyler had Piro\u2019s comments and his own version of the Cheeket conversation, the credibility of both of which is vigorously disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>3. <em>Mobil \u201cprovided\u201d ships to Atlas. </em>Tavoulareas claims that the <em>Post\u2019s </em>reference to ships \u201cprovided\u201d by Mobil to Atlas was published with reckless disregard or knowledge of its falsity. His objection is apparently rooted in the view that use of the word \u201cprovided\u201d suggested a direct relationship between Mobil and Atlas instead of the actual relationship \u2014 that Mobil bareboat-chartered vessels to SAMARCO and time-chartered them back and that Atlas managed the vessels. However, the <em>Post </em>article did describe the full, complex transaction. 1111 6, 58-59, 74. Furthermore, Kousi had emphasized to Tyler that control of ships effectively passed from Mobil to Atlas. RE 1940. Finally, Wolfe wrote that \u201cAtlas was created in anticipation of managing SAMARCO\u2019s business\u201d and that Mobil beneficially owned four of the seven ships operated by Atlas on behalf of SA-MARCO. RE 2344-2346.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">4. <em>The implication that Tavoulareas engineered the entire Mobil-SAMARCOAtlas arrangement for the benefit of his son. </em>Tavoulareas also argues that \u201cthe article\u2019s primary implication was * * * that plaintiff misused Mobil assets by engineering the entire Mobil-Samarco-Atlas arrangement for the benefit of his son.\u201d Brief for appellant at 25-26. Judge Gasch rejected this contention because \u201c[t]he article * * * did not say that William Tavoulareas put together the Mobil-Atlas-Samarco arrangement solely for the sake of his son. * * * [T]he article specifically stated * * * that Samarco and Atlas were created for certain political and economic reasons. The nepotism discussed in the article clearly had its origin in a legitimate business opportunity.\u201d 567 F.Supp. at 660 (footnote omitted). It is undisputed that the article reported Mobil\u2019s business reasons for entering into the SAMARCO-Atlas relationship \u2014 its belief that \u201ca shipping partnership with the Saudis might yield preferential treatment * * * [and] \u2018favorable financing from Saudi Arabian sources.\u2019 \u201d 111140-41 <em>(quoting </em>1976 Mobil message to stockholders).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">These, then, are the statements and supporting materials that form the core of the $2.05 million verdict and the majority\u2019s determination that the First Amendment does not protect the Post\u2019s article.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">B. <em>Factors Lacking Any Probative Weight</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">With these challenged statements and their supporting materials in mind, we can turn to the numerous factors that constitute the majority\u2019s actual malice analysis. Most of the factors cited by the majority completely lack probative weight for a finding of knowledge or reckless disregard of falsity. These insubstantial factors include the majority\u2019s comments about the defendants\u2019 motivation, the defendants\u2019 editorial process (the claimed omission of information and resolution of ambiguities), the disputed Checket conversation, and sundry \u201cother indicia of actual malice\u201d (the defendants\u2019 refusal to retract, the lack of deadline pressure, and the knowledge of harm).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">It is important to consider these factors in detail, for they are so insubstantial and inappropriate that they should not receive any weight. The time and effort required to analyze them, by the majority and by this dissent, should not give them a weight that they lack on their merits. These factors simply fail to amount to bricks for the wall that the majority seeks to build.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">1. <em>Defendants\u2019 motivation. </em>The majority recognizes that \u201ccommon law malice is not the equivalent of actual malice in the defamation context,\u201d but argues that \u201cthe presence of common law malice or evidence that a newspaper followed a sensationalistic policy, because it provides a <em>motive </em>for knowing or reckless falsehood, is <em>evidence </em>of actual malice.\u201d Maj. op. at 117 (emphasis in original). The majority elaborates that a journalistic policy of \u201c \u2018hard hitting investigative journalism,\u2019 or * * * \u2018sophisticated muckraking,\u2019 * * * certainly is relevant to the inquiry of whether a newspaper\u2019s employees acted in reckless disregard of whether a statement is false or not.\u201d Maj. op. at 121-22.</p>\n<p id=\"ANc\">The notion that a policy of muckraking and hard-hitting investigative journalism is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>somehow evidence of actual malice is deeply troubling, contrary to the nation\u2019s tradition of a free and aggressive press, and entirely unsupported by precedent. I will address this startling revision of the actual malice notion in connection with the majority\u2019s use of it in its analysis of the <em>Post.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">A more fundamental problem, however, is whether ill will may be considered evidence of actual malice. The Supreme Court has emphasized that relying on the ill will of the speaker to establish actual malice in a libel case has a chilling effect on vibrant discussion in a free society. \u201cDebate on public issues will not be uninhibited if the speaker must run the risk that it will be proved in court that he spoke out of hatred; even if he did speak out of hatred, utterances honestly believed contribute to the free interchange of ideas and the ascertainment of truth.\u201d <em>Garrison v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 64, 73, 85 S.Ct. 209, 215, 13 L.Ed.2d 125 (1964). <em>See also Greenbelt Cooperative Publishing Ass\u2019n, </em>398 U.S. 6, 10-11, 90 S.Ct. 1537, 1540, 26 L.Ed.2d 6 (1970) (same). On numerous occasions the Supreme Court has also emphasized that \u201cill will toward the plaintiff, or bad motives, are not elements of the <em>New York Times </em>standard,\u201d <em>Rosenbloom v. Metromedia, Inc., </em>403 U.S. 29, 52 n. 18, 91 S.Ct. 1811,1824 n. 18, 29 L.Ed.2d 296 (1971) (Brennan, J., plurality opinion); <em>Old Dominion Branch No. 496, Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Letter Carriers v. Austin, supra, </em>418 U.S. at 281, 94 S.Ct. at 2779, and that jury instructions that include ill will as an element of actual malice are \u201cconstitutionally insufficient.\u201d <em>Rosenblatt v. Baer, </em>383 U.S. 75, 84, 86 S.Ct. 669, 675, 15 L.Ed.2d 597 (1966). <em>See Beckley Newspapers Corp. v. Hanks, supra, </em>389 U.S. at 82, 88 S.Ct. at 198; <em>Henry v. Collins, </em>380 U.S. 356, 357, 85 S.Ct. 992, 993, 13 L.Ed.2d 892 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">In the majority\u2019s view, the force and reach of these emphatic holdings are limited to establishing that, although ill will alone does not establish actual malice, it is nonetheless probative of actual malice. In my judgment, such a view conflicts with the important principle articulated in <em>Garrison </em>\u2014 that debate will be inhibited if trials and liability may turn on the extent to which the speaker\u2019s feelings toward the subject of the speech may have strayed from a fiercely guarded neutrality. The difference between the recognized chilling effect of the speaker\u2019s \u201crisk that it will be proved in court that he spoke out of hatred,\u201d <em>Garrison, supra, </em>when the proof is <em>equivalent </em>to actual malice, and the effect of such risk when the proof is merely <em>evidence </em>of actual malice seems to me insubstantial. The powerful insight underlying <em>Garrison </em>and subsequent decisions suggests that ill will should not, in any circumstances, be considered probative of actual malice. <em>See Ryan v. Brooks, </em>634 F.2d 726, 731 n. 4 (4th Cir.1980) (\u201cmalevolence, ill-will or spite * * * is irrelevant in First Amendment cases\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Even if ill will may be probative of actual malice in certain circumstances, however, I am convinced that the evidence which the majority claims to rely on in this case is utterly unable to provide any probative force for a finding of knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of truth or falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">(a) <em>The </em>Post. The majority describes the <em>Post </em>as <em>\u201ca </em>newspaper which seeks, among other things, hard-hitting investigative stories.\u201d Maj. op. at 121. For the majority, this journalistic concern becomes the beginning of evidence of actual malice: \u201cRegardless of whether one chooses to characterize this policy as conducive to \u2018hard-hitting investigative journalism,\u2019 or * * * \u2018sophisticated muckraking,\u2019 it certainly is relevant to the inquiry of whether a newspaper\u2019s employees acted in reckless disregard of whether a statement is false or not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">This conclusion represents a sharp departure from the principles of free and vigorous discussion that have been the touchstone of First Amendment jurisprudence. It is a conclusion fraught with the potential to shrink the First Amendment\u2019s \u201cmajestic protection,\u201d <em>Bose, supra, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1961. In our society speech may be controversial and contentious; words may be intended to arouse, disturb, provoke, and upset. For a primary \u201cfunction of free speech under our system of government is to invite dispute. It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger.\u201d <em>Terminiello v. Chicago, </em>337 U.S. 1, 4, 69 S.Ct. 894, 896, 93 L.Ed. 1131 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">Muckraking \u2014 a term developed when writers like Lincoln Steffens, Ida Tarbell, and Upton Sinclair relentlessly exposed pervasive corruption<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u2014 may be seen to serve that high purpose even if it offends and startles; so, too, hoping that readers will react in colorful terms to front page stories fits comfortably within the traditions of a free press and a nation that has nothing to fear from an aroused citizenry. As Justice Brand\u00e9is observed, \u201cLike the course of the heavenly bodies, harmony in national life is a resultant of the struggle between contending forces.\u201d <em>Gilbert v. Minnesota, </em>254 U.S. 325, 338, 41 S.Ct. 125, 129, 65 L.Ed. 287 (1920) (Brand\u00e9is, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-12\">Scant authority supports the majority\u2019s remarkable innovation in First Amendment jurisprudence. The majority cites Chief Justice Warren\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, </em>388 U.S. 130, 162, 87 S.Ct. 1975, 1995, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094 (1967) (Warren, C.J., concurring in result), and his reference to \u201c \u2018sophisticated muckraking,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 169, 87 S.Ct. at 1999 <em>(quoting Saturday Evening Post </em>announcement). This is a slim reed indeed to support the majority\u2019s expansive construction. Chief Justice Warren\u2019s comment is ambiguous and of dubious precedential value.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> No federal court has ever relied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>muckraking as an indication of actual malice, and the Supreme Court has not even mentioned it since <em>Butts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In stark contrast to fundamental First Amendment principles and the clear and convincing evidence of actual malice required by Supreme Court cases from <em>New York Times </em>to <em>Bose, </em>the majority is prepared to give at least some probative weight to a newspaper\u2019s emphasis on attention-getting stories. \u201cWoodward, as editor, wanted from his reporters the same kind of stories on which he built his own reputation: high-impact investigative stories of wrongdoing. * * * From Woodward\u2019s testimony it was proper for the jury to infer that the <em>Post </em>put some pressure on its reporters to come up with \u2018holy * * * \u2019 stories.\u201d Maj. op. at 120-21. Such is the basis for the majority\u2019s arresting conclusion that the <em>Post\u2019s </em>policy contributes to a finding that its \u201cemployees acted with reckless disregard of whether a statement is false or not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 122. This deep hostility to an aggressive press is directly contrary to the mandates of the Supreme Court and the spirit of a free press. Indeed, the majority itself acknowledges that a central objective of <em>New York Times </em>is served by a newspaper \u201cacting as watchdog for the public.\u201d Maj. op. at 122 n. 39. Yet that recognition is flatly inconsistent with the majority\u2019s holding that the <em>Post\u2019s </em>policy of \u201chard-hitting investigative journalism\u201d somehow helps to establish recklessness. <em>Id. </em>at 121. In my judgment, neither a newspaper\u2019s muckraking policy nor its hard-hitting investigative journalism should <em>ever </em>be considered probative of actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">(b) <em>Tyler. </em>Similarly, even if motive may be probative of actual malice, the facts in the record do not support the majority\u2019s finding that Tyler revealed a motive that would represent an indication of actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Conceding that Tyler \u201chad little reason for <em>personal </em>animus,\u201d the majority concludes that Tyler wanted \u201cto \u2018get\u2019 Mobil and the Tavoulareases * * * for the sake of a big story and because of [his] general bias against the oil industry.\u201d Maj. op. at 118 (emphasis in original). The majority relies on four statements of Tyler and the fact that Mobil had publicly taken issue with a story Tyler had previously written. None of these bits of evidence is substantial enough to suggest a motive indicative of actual malice. Three of the four statements seem well within the scope of a working journalist\u2019s vernacular. He speculated that the impact of the story might be to \u201cknock off one of the seven sisters,\u201d RE 789, he referred to his article in part as a \u201ccase against Tavoulareas,\u201d RE 2489, and he characterized a session between Tavoulareas and <em>Post </em>editors as one in which the <em>Post </em>\u201cblew [Tavoulareas] out of the water.\u201d RE 857-858. These statements do reveal that Tyler, in conversation and in a memorandum, sometimes betrayed a less than Diogenes-like demeanor, but that is hardly sufficient to find the statements probative of actual malice. The fourth statement \u2014 that Tyler asked Piro about a source who could gain access to Tavoulareas\u2019 safe \u2014 is more troubling. But however reprehensible a journalistic practice, such a request is in no sense indicative of a motive suggesting a knowledge of falsity or a reckless disregard of truth or falsity; indeed, if he was not joking it is evidence that Tyler sought documentary support, however objectionably. Finally, to hold that objections by a major company to a reporter\u2019s coverage of it is probative of a motive suggesting actual malice serves to chill the kind of aggressive journalism that the First Amendment should foster and that the majority itself recognizes as \u201ca vital service * * * protected by the <em>New York Times </em>actual malice standard.\u201d <em>Maj. op. at 121 n. 39. The record contains evidence that Tyler\u2019s assignment to the piece was rooted in the fact that his area </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number><em>of expertise was the energy business, rather than any motive to \u201cget\u201d Tavoulareas and Mobil. RE 2157-2158.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">(c) <em>Golden. </em>The majority also found that evidence indicating Golden\u2019s \u201cprimary motive in working on the story was to get a <em>byline </em>on a <em>Post </em>story,\u201d represents \u201cevidence of motive [that] has considerable bearing on whether or not he acted with actual malice.\u201d Maj. op. at 120 (emphasis in original). The question before this court is whether Golden acted with knowledge of falsity, or reckless disregard of truth or falsity. A desire to succeed and advance, in the journalistic or any profession, does not pose an inherent conflict with the requirements of professional rigor. Even if Golden was, as the majority asserts, \u201can ambitious young reporter looking for his big break,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 120, that ambition seems to me completely irrelevant to the question of knowledge or reckless disregard of falsity; the majority\u2019s holding places any reporter who reveals personal ambition in a more vulnerable position. This is not \u201cthe breathing space that gives life to the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Bose, supra, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">(d) <em>Piro. </em>Piro\u2019s animosity toward the Tavoulareas family is clear. To the extent that the majority focuses solely in this factor on Piro\u2019s motivation, it is, of course, only relevant to the determination of Piro\u2019s actual malice. To the extent that the majority also means for this motivation to be relevant to the <em>Post </em>defendants\u2019 state of mind, the majority seeks to count Piro\u2019s motivation in its \u201ccumulation\u201d twice: as discussed below, the majority also counts it in its \u201creliance on sources\u201d section, <em>see </em>text at 162 <em>infra; </em>maj. op. at 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">2. <em>The </em>Post\u2019s <em>editorial decisions. </em>The majority continues its reliance on unsupported and impermissible factors when it offers two conclusions about the <em>Post\u2019s </em>editorial policy as indicia of actual malice\u2014 that the <em>Post </em>failed to include certain information available to it and that the <em>Post </em>consistently resolved ambiguities in the light most damaging to Tavoulareas. As Judge Gasch found, according these conclusions probative weight conflicts sharply with the record in this case and with controlling Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">(a) <em>Failure to include certain information. </em>The majority rejects Judge Gasch\u2019s conclusion that the supposed omission of certain information failed to- \u201cshow that [Tyler] acted in reckless disregard of the truth,\u201d 567 F.Supp. at 659. <em>See </em>maj. op. at 125. But the majority misconstrues the holding below, for it writes as though the court had held that suppression of information is <em>never </em>relevant to an actual malice inquiry. <em>See id. </em>at 125-26. Judge Gasch explicitly recognized that \u201cif the defendants possessed information that showed that some of the article was incorrect, ignoring it would constitute actual malice.\u201d 567 F. Supp. at 657. Judge Gasch carefully and properly examined the claimed omissions and determined that the disputed material had been substantially included; as a result, <em>in this case, </em>the claimed omissions were not probative of actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">An independent review of the record confirms this conclusion. The majority maintains that three sets of facts were omitted: comments by Mobil outside director Lewis Lapham, information about the benefits of the SAMARCO-Atlas relationship, and internal Mobil memoranda. On the Lapham comments Judge Gasch found: \u201cDespite the fact that the November 30 article did not contain this exact information, it did include at least three paragraphs that conveyed almost everything that Lapham had said.\u201d 567 F.Supp. at 658. The differences that the majority points to, maj. op. at 123-24, are hardly substantial enough to be indicative of knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of truth or falsity. The differences largely amount to whether the <em>Post </em>should have included a board member\u2019s report of his belief in the Mobil chairman\u2019s assurances about the SA-MARCO-Atlas relationship along with its report of the Mobil chairman\u2019s assurances. To hold such a difference probative of actual malice \u2014 even probative \u201ccumulatively\u201d\u2014 not only is illogical but thrusts this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>far too deeply into the nuances of editorial discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The majority\u2019s reliance on the other two claimed omissions is similarly misplaced. The absence of information on the benefits of the SAMARCO transaction lacks any probative weight as an indication of actual malice. \u201cThe November 30 article simply did not relate whether the establishment of Atlas was a good or bad business decision.\u201d 567 F.Supp. at 659. The majority emphasizes that the <em>Post </em>alluded to \u201c \u2018millions of dollars in business\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018exclusive, no-bid contracts,\u2019 \u201d maj. op. at 124; both allusions were undeniably true. Similarly, the substance of the Mobil memoranda \u2014 the Mobil executive vice president\u2019s announcement of arm\u2019s length dealings with SA-MARCO and Tavoulareas\u2019 statement that he would not be involved in SAMARCO-Atlas matters \u2014 were, as Judge Gasch found, \u201cessentially summarize[d]\u201d in the <em>Post </em>article. 567 F.Supp. at 659 n. 15. Instead of adding that the Mobil executive vice president wrote that dealings were arm\u2019s length, the <em>Post </em>said only that the Mobil chairman told the Board about the arrangements and Tavoulareas\u2019 non-involvement; instead of adding that Tavoulareas wrote the executive vice president to disassociate himself from SAMARCO-Atlas, it reported Tavoulareas\u2019 statement that he had disassociated himself. Such variations seem well within the editor\u2019s \u201cinevitabl[e] * * * set of choices,\u201d <em>Time, Inc. v. Pape, </em>401 U.S. 279, 286, 91 S.Ct. 633, 637, 28 L.Ed.2d 45 (1971), and it would greatly shrink the \u201cconstitutional zone of protection,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 291, 91 S.Ct. at 640, afforded by the <em>New York Times </em>principles to hold such judgments even partially probative of actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">(b) <em>Resolution of ambiguities. </em>Similarly, the argument that the <em>Post </em>consistently resolved ambiguities in the light most damaging to the plaintiff and that this process was at least partially probative of actual malice is supported neither by the governing precedents and principles nor by an independent examination of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">The majority premises its discussion about the resolution of ambiguities on its view that, \u201cto the extent that the facts known to the defendants * * * were susceptible of more than one possible interpretation, the numerous instances in which the defendants selected the most damaging\u2014 and most sensation \u2014 alternative is <em>some </em>evidence which a jury, and an appellate court on review, can evaluate in determining whether publication was made with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\u201d Maj. op. at 123 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">It is a remarkable feat to reinterpret <em>Time, Inc. v. Pape, supra, </em>to establish that reasonable resolution of ambiguities may be probative of actual malice, so long as the resolution is not the sole piece of evidence. The majority accurately quotes the penultimate sentences from <em>Pape, </em>maj. op. at 122. Despite the majority\u2019s italicization of one word, however, <em>Pape </em>contains no hint that reasonable resolution of ambiguities should have <em>some </em>probative weight in establishing knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of truth or falsity. The majority\u2019s reinterpretation undermines the central thrust of <em>Pape </em>\u2014 the deference to be accorded \u201cpossible rational interpretations\u201d of a situation that \u201cbristle[s] with ambiguities,\u201d 401 U.S. at 290, 91 S.Ct. at 639,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> because of the \u201calmost infinite variety of shadings\u201d and \u201cinevitabl[e] * * * set of choices\u201d with confront publishers. <em>Id. </em>at 286, 91 S.Ct. at 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">Nor does invocation of cumulation provide the support that <em>Pape </em>does not. Indeed, in <em>Bose </em>the Court specifically refused to give probative weight to a rational interpretation of an ambiguous situation even in conjunction with other pieces of evidence: \u201cadoption of the language chosen was \u2018one of a number of possible rational interpretations\u2019 of an event \u2018that bristled with ambiguities\u2019 and descriptive challenges for the writer. * * * The choice of such lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>guage, though reflecting a misconception, does not place the speech beyond the outer limits of the First Amendment\u2019s broad protective umbrella.\u201d <em>Bose, supra, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1966 <em>(quoting Pape). See also Ryan v. Brooks, supra, </em>634 F.2d at 733 (finding resolution of ambiguities in light most damaging to plaintiff not probative of actual malice even in conjunction with other pieces of evidence). <em>Pape </em>and <em>Bose </em>thus establish that rational interpretations of ambiguous situations do not contribute to a finding of actual malice.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Whether or not the majority\u2019s view is accepted, however, it is at least clear that some sustained consideration of the relevant interpretations and the underlying events to which they refer is required to evaluate the -resolution of ambiguities. The majority makes no such serious effort to evaluate the interpretations at issue; indeed, it does not even identify them. Rather, the majority is content to assert that there was a <em>\u201cconsistent </em>selection of the inferences most damaging to the Tavoulareases,\u201d maj. op. at 121 (emphasis in original), without specifying which inferences and what they were inferring. Such a blanket, unexplained assertion is far from the rigorous, independent evaluation of the record required by <em>New York Times </em>and subsequent decisions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">3. <em>The Checket conversation and the \u201cdispatch\u201d of Hoffmann. </em>The majority-cites a conflict between the Tyler and Checket accounts of the substance of their conversation as an indicium of actual malice. Maj. op. at 125-26. According to the majority, this conflict is probative of actual malice because the Checket conversation is the only source besides Piro for the article\u2019s statement that Tavoulareas \u201cpersonally dispatched\u201d Hoffmann to Atlas. The majority concludes, \u201c[I]t is clearly possible that Tyler deliberately falsified his notes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126. The majority thus rejects Judge Gasch\u2019s conclusion that \u201cTyler may * * * have been negligent in transcribing Checket\u2019s statement but plaintiff introduced no evidence that would show that Tyler deliberately falsified this document.\u201d 567 F.Supp. at 661 n. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">The majority\u2019s emphasis on the Checket conversation is misguided. For the undisputed evidence in the record reveals that the Checket conversation \u2014 under either version \u2014 was far from Tyler\u2019s sole source for the conclusion that Tavoulareas \u201cpersonally dispatched\u201d Hoffmann. As found by Judge Gasch, Tavoulareas \u201capparently participated to some extent in the discussions that led to Hoffmann\u2019s temporary assignment at Atlas.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 661. The majority simply ignores this finding. Yet the evidence in the record fully supports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Judge Gasch\u2019s determination. Wolfe wrote to Tyler that \u201cMr. Tavoulareas played a minor role * * * in the arrangements made when G. Comnas departed from Atlas. Since it was on Mobil\u2019s recommendation (including Mr. Tavoulareas\u2019), because of long personal acquaintance with G. Comnas, that he negotiate with SAMARCO it was logical that Mr. Tavoulareas participate to the extent of assuring a settlement that was fair and equitable to both parties * * *. Since Mobil had originally recommended G. Comnas to SAMARCO, we felt an obligation to SAMARCO to maintain quality management of their operations. We made H. R. Hoffmann * * * available as an interim manager of Atlas.\u201d RE 2345.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In the face of this undisputed statement <em>by Mobil </em>\u2014 acknowledging that Tavoulareas played a role, albeit \u201cminor,\u201d in Comnas\u2019 departure, and then shifting to \u201cwe\u201d without distinguishing Tavoulareas\u2014 the majority\u2019s emphasis on the Checket conversation is plainly mistaken.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">4. <em>Other indicia of actual malice. </em>The majority cites three \u201cother indicia of actual malice\u201d \u2014 the <em>Post\u2019s </em>failure to retract, the lack of deadline pressure, and the knowledge of the harm the article would cause. All three are of questionable legal force; even if all three were valid indicia of actual malice, the evidence in the record does not support a finding that they were indicia of actual malice in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">In considering the <em>Post\u2019s </em>refusal to retract the majority argues that \u201c[t]he correct view\u201d is that \u201c \u2018[ujnder certain circumstances evidence [of a refusal by a publisher to retract a statement after it has been demonstrated to him to be both false and defamatory] ... might be relevant in showing recklessness at the time the statement was published.\u2019 \u201d Maj. op. at 132 (brackets in. original; citation omitted). The majority brushes aside the Supreme Court\u2019s view in <em>New York Times </em>that a refusal to retract was not probative of actual malice by arguing that the Court\u2019s use of the word \u201cadequate\u201d meant only that refusal to retract could not be the <em>sole </em>evidence. <em>Id. </em>The majority fails to mention, however, that the Court was considering the refusal to retract along with other claimed pieces of evidence. <em>See New York Times, supra, </em>376 U.S. at 286-87, 84 S.Ct. at 729.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Similarly, the majority does not mention that, in <em>Bose, </em>the Court did not even consider the publisher\u2019s refusal to retract, which it had mentioned in its statement of facts, 104 S.Ct. at 1953, when it considered <em>all </em>of the possible facts which might lead to a determination of actual malice. <em>Id. </em>at 1965-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">Even if the majority\u2019s view is accepted, however, there is no evidence in the record to support the view that there had been the necessary demonstration to the <em>Post </em>of falsity and defamation. The majority does not pause to explain when and how such a demonstration \u2014 essential, under the majority\u2019s formulation, if refusal to retract is to be considered an indicium of actual malice \u2014 was made. In addition, the <em>Post </em>reported Mobil\u2019s response in two articles (on December 1 and December 4) as well as additional facts provided by Mobil (on December 7). RE 2559, 2561, 2562.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">The majority also argues that the absence of deadline pressure was \u201cevidence that the jury could fairly consider\u201d because \u201c[t]he defendants had ample time to search for corroboration of Comnas\u2019 statements.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Maj. op. at 131. Even if such a relationship between deadlines and constitutional principles were established,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the evidence in the record does not support a finding that the timing of <em>this </em>article was probative of actual malice. First, as will be discussed <em>infra, </em>Comnas\u2019 statements had largely been corroborated by other sources. Second, Tyler\u2019s investigative efforts over the course of the month that he spent researching this article establish considerable efforts to corroborate. Third, since Mobil gave no indication of further cooperation, it is difficult to see what further efforts Tyler should have undertaken. Fourth, despite the majority\u2019s comment about the \u201c[ajbsence of time pressure,\u201d maj. op. at 131, undisputed evidence in the record suggests substantial time pressure \u2014 Tyler had learned both that a congressional committee would soon go public with the relevant information and that the <em>New York Times </em>was also investigating the story. RE 1100, 1126. Under the majority\u2019s own terms, then, the timing of publication in this case does not amount to evidence of actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Finally, the majority alludes to \u201c[kjnowledge of the harm likely to follow publication\u201d as an indication of actual malice. Maj. op. at 131. In contrast, in a series of cases in which serious harm was obvious the Supreme Court has not even mentioned knowledge of harm as a possible factor probative of actual malice. <em>See, e.g., St. Amant v. Thompson, </em>390 U.S. 727, 88 S.Ct. 1323, 20 L.Ed.2d 262 (1968) (allegation of corruption); <em>Time, Inc. v. Pape, supra, </em>401 U.S. 279, 91 S.Ct. 633, 28 L.Ed.2d 45 (allegation of police brutality). Furthermore, if knowledge of harm has any probative weight it must be slight, for an inquiry into knowledge of harm diverts from the central inquiry into knowledge of falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">C. <em>Potentially Probative Factors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The majority argues that we must consider the indicia of actual malice as cumulative circumstantial evidence, but since the indieia analyzed above are unsupported, either in the governing legal principles or in the record, cumulation of them is equally without weight. Our inquiry must focus, therefore, on the two potentially probative sources \u2014 the Peterson memorandum and the reliability of sources. These factors may be bricks, but they utterly fail to build the majority\u2019s wall: they fail to establish, by clear and convincing evidence, knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of truth or falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">1. <em>The Peterson memorandum. </em>Judge Gasch considered the Peterson memo at length. The majority, however, misconstrues his analysis of the inferences that could reasonably be drawn from it. Undertaking the required review of the record, Judge Gasch concluded that \u201c[tjhere is <em>no evidence whatsoever </em>to show that Ms. Peterson had any \u2018inside\u2019 information about Tyler\u2019s sources or research that would enable her to know, or even suspect, that the story was inaccurate. She was merely expressing her uninformed opinion that she found the story hard to believe.\u201d 567 F.Supp. at 655 (emphasis added). The majority fails to offer a shred of evidence which contradicts this finding. Instead, it seeks to emphasize the jury\u2019s right to disbelieve Peterson\u2019s testimony. But even if Peterson\u2019s testimony is disbelieved, the rejection of her testimony clearly fails to provide affirmative evidence that her opinion was informed, rather than uninformed. <em>See Bose, supra, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1966 (\u201cdiscredited testimony is not considered a sufficient basis for drawing a contrary conclusion\u201d); <em>Moore v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio R. Co., </em>340 U.S. 573, 576, 71 S.Ct. 428, 429, 95 L.Ed. 547 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">There is no evidence in the record to support the view that Peterson\u2019s opinion was informed. Indeed, the memo as a whole makes clear that Peterson had <em>no </em>knowledge of sources and research beyond what she had read in the article. RE 2486-2487. Furthermore, the undisputed evidence in the record does establish that Ty<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>ler produced a point-by-point rebuttal to the Peterson memo for Greider, the senior editor ultimately responsible for the article. RE 2487-2491. Under these circumstances the thrust of the trial court\u2019s analysis was eminently correct; the evidence in the record did not support the view that Peterson\u2019s memo proved the <em>Post\u2019s </em>knowledge of falsity, or reckless disregard of truth or falsity. At most, it shows that the editor with ultimate decisionmaking responsibility had before him two paragraphs raising doubts from an editor \u2014 in what\u00e9ver role\u2014 who had no independent knowledge of the subject or sources and the lengthy rebuttal, as well as the article itself, from a reporter who had previously written about energy issues and who had spent a month of research on the subject and sources. The inference of actual malice \u2014 or even a substantial indication of actual malice \u2014 that the majority seeks to draw is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">To be sure, the majority does not quite claim that the Peterson memo itself provides clear and convincing proof of knowing or reckless falsity. Plainly, the memo could not bear such interpretation.. Instead, the majority seeks to impute some additional weight to the memo through the coloration of other pieces of evidence. Maj. op. at 116. But, as discussed, the majority\u2019s \u201cother evidence,\u201d <em>id., </em>consists largely of totally impermissible and insubstantial considerations \u2014 a newspaper\u2019s reputation, a journalist\u2019s ambition, the reasonable resolution of ambiguity, and the like. These inappropriate factors cannot bolster the Peterson memo and give it some added force; the memo must be evaluated without the distortion of such unacceptable considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Since the evidence in the record does not support a view that Peterson\u2019s opinion was informed, and since the evidence in the record establishes that Tyler and the <em>Post </em>editors engaged in far more extensive preparation and investigation than Peterson, the Peterson memo fails to assume the probative weight adopted by the majority and properly rejected below.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">2. <em>The reliability of sources. </em>The majority correctly notes that \u201c[rjeliance on the unsupported word of obviously biased sources for key allegations is <em>evidence </em>which a jury is entitled to consider in evaluating the existence of actual malice.\u201d Maj. op. at 131 (emphasis in original). The validity of this general proposition is clear. <em>See St. Amant v. Thompson, supra, </em>390 U.S. at 732, 88 S.Ct. at 1326. But in this case the evidence in the record does not support the necessary finding that the defendant relied on \u201cthe unsupported word of obviously biased sources for key allegations.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">(a) <em>Comnas. </em>\u201c[Rjeliance upon George Comnas,\u201d Judge Gasch concluded, \u201c* * * does not come close to approaching the level of recklessness required by the Supreme Court.\u201d 567 P.Supp. at 656. The majority rejects this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">The majority argues that the evidence in the record supports a finding that Tyler had reason to doubt Comnas\u2019 veracity. Relying primarily on Tyler\u2019s awareness of allegations that Comnas left Atlas because of dissatisfaction over his business performance, it thus rejects Judge Gasch\u2019s conclusion that such awareness did not necessarily constitute reliance on an obviously unreliable source. True to its method, the majority discards the evidence in the record mitigating the view that reliance on Comnas was an act of recklessness. As Tyler knew, Tavoulareas had told the SEC that \u201cour people had every confidence in the world\u201d in Comnas. RE 2446. Similarly, on Mobil\u2019s behalf Paul Wolfe wrote Tyler of Tavoulareas\u2019 \u201clong personal acquaintance with G. Comnas\u201d and \u201cMobil\u2019s recommendation\u201d of Comnas. RE 2345. Tyler had also read Comnas\u2019 testimony to congressional investigators, which corresponded to his statements to Tyler. RE 2129-2131, 2467-2745. The majority maintains that Tyler must have known of rumors about Comnas being involved in scandals. However, except for Piro\u2019s statement the majority is unable to point to a shred of evidence suggesting Tyler\u2019s knowledge of these rumors. Instead, it asserts that Kousi must have told Tyler of rumors involving Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>\u00f1as even though Kousi never offered such testimony. Maj. op. at 129. As Judge Gasch found, Tyler\u2019s knowledge of Comnas\u2019 background, placed in the context of the evidence in the record rather than the majority\u2019s skewed presentation, fails to assume the great probative weight that the majority seeks. <em>Cf St. Amant v. Thompson, supra, </em>390 U.S. at 733, 88 S.Ct. at 1326 (reliance on a dissident union member\u2019s comments about the union leadership did not amount to \u201cevidence in the record of [the dissident\u2019s] reputation for veracity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Critically, whatever Tyler\u2019s knowledge of Comnas\u2019 background, the majority finds an \u201cabsence of * * * corroboration\u201d for Comnas\u2019 statements. Maj. op. at 129. However, as Judge Gasch found, \u201c[M]uch of Comnas\u2019 information was independently verified by other sources whose credibility even the plaintiff does not now challenge.\u201d 567 F.Supp. at 656. For instance, the majority directs its attention to Comnas as the source of the <em>Post </em>statement that \u201cTavoulareas \u2018set up\u2019 Peter by \u2018personally urging\u2019 his inclusion in Atlas.\u201d Maj. op. at 129. Yet the evidence in the record is clear that former SAMARCO director Kousi, whose credibility has not been challenged, told Tyler that the hiring of Peter was a \u201cnepotistic act.\u201d RE 1165, 1237, 1927-1928. The majority summarily and unjustifiably rejects this evidence because Kousi\u2019s deposition contained \u201cno supporting facts\u201d for this conclusion. Maj. op. at 129 n. 45. Given Kousi\u2019s position, knowledge, and undisputed veracity, his comment should be credited as corroboration of Comnas; it is at least a significant piece of evidence that compels greater attention and weight than the majority accords it. Furthermore, as noted, Comnas\u2019 statement was also at least partially corroborated by Tavoulareas\u2019 SEC testimony about his recruitment of Comnas and knowledge of Comnas\u2019 business relationship with his son. RE 2424-2425. On behalf of Mobil, Wolfe also confirmed that Tavoulareas had played a major role in establishing SAMARCO and Atlas and in recruiting Comnas. RE 2344-2345. The record thus shows that Tyler corroborated the major pieces of information provided by Comnas. The use of questionable sources does not contribute to a finding of actual malice when the writer \u201cused nothing from it that was not also found in his other sources.\u201d <em>Ryan v. Brooks, supra, </em>634 F.2d at 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">(b) <em>Piro. </em>Judge Gasch found that Piro \u201cwas not a primary, or even a secondary, source for the November 30 article.\u201d . 567 F.Supp. at 657. In contrast, the majority points to three statements for which it claims that Piro was an important source. The various sources for two of these statements \u2014 that Tavoulareas \u201cpersonally dispatched\u201d Hoffmann and that he \u201cpersonally urged\u201d Peter\u2019s inclusion as a partner\u2014 have been discussed at length. The third statement \u2014 that Tavoulareas expressed an interest in \u201cgiving Peter a little nudge to get him along\u201d \u2014 was specifically attributed to Piro; Piro\u2019s estrangement from the family was clearly noted; and Tavoulareas\u2019 denial was fully reported. 1129. Moreover, the record is clear that Tyler chose not to use information provided by Piro which he could not corroborate from other sources. Under these circumstances, the quoting of Piro failed to establish a reliance on unreliable sources that carries significant probative weight in establishing actual malice by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">\n<em>Summary</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Tyler and the <em>Post </em>editors had various sources of information before them supporting a belief in each of the challenged statements. Most of the factors cited by the majority are insubstantial or inappropriate; the Peterson memo and the reliance on sources simply do not establish clear and convincing evidence of knowledge or reckless disregard of falsity. In short, the majority\u2019s \u201cwall\u201d is a house of cards that collapses under the rigorous scrutiny demanded by precedent and principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">IV. Tavoulareas\u2019 Status as a Limited Purpose Public Figure</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">The actual malice standard, of course, must be met only if Tavoulareas is a public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>figure, or for punitive damages if he is a private person. <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 328, 342, 350, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 3008, 3012, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974). <em>Gertz </em>also established two types of public figures: <em>general purpose, </em>those of \u201cgeneral fame or notoriety in the community, and pervasive in the affairs of society,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 352, 94 S.Ct. at 3013, and <em>limited purpose, </em>those who \u201chave thrust themselves to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 345, 94 S.Ct. at 3009.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Judge Gasch determined, on the basis of this circuit\u2019s controlling opinion in <em>Waldbaum v. Fairchild Publications, Inc., </em>627 F.2d 1287 (D.C.Cir.1980), that Tavoulareas was a limited purpose public figure. Though the majority finds it unnecessary to reach the issue because of its conclusion that the defendants acted with actual malice, it expresses reservations about this determination. <em>See </em>maj. op. at 103 n. 12. I believe that Judge Gasch\u2019s analysis was eminently sound and fully supported by the evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\"><em>Waldbaum </em>sets forth the standards for determining public figure status. \u201c[T]he general public figure is a rare creature,\u201d 627 F.2d at 1292, because general public figure status must be supported by \u201c \u2018clear evidence of general fame or notoriety in the community, and pervasive involvement in the affairs of society.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id (quoting Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., supra, </em>418 U.S. at 352, 94 S.Ct. at 3013). Limited public figure status is determined by a three-prong test: (1) \u201cthe court must isolate a public controversy,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1296, (2) \u201cthe court * * * must analyze the plaintiff\u2019s role in it,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1297, and (3) \u201cthe alleged defamation must have been germane to the plaintiff\u2019s participation in the controversy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1298.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">Judge Gasch determined that all three prongs of the <em>Waldbaum </em>test were met. For the first prong \u2014 the public controversy requirement \u2014 he concluded, \u201c[T]he Court is convinced that defendants have established the existence of a public controversy over Mobil\u2019s (and William Tavoulareas\u2019) business dealings in Saudi Arabia and also over Mobil\u2019s (and William Tavoulareas\u2019) role in SA-MARCO and its business \u2014 through SAM ARCO \u2014 with Atlas <em>prior </em>to the publication of <em>The Post\u2019s </em>two articles on the subject.\u201d Memorandum Opinion of District Court in Civil Action No. 80-3032 filed July 26,1982 (Mem.Op.) at 7, RE 715 (emphasis in original). The evidence submitted by the defendant leaves no doubt that Tavoulareas eagerly sought and obtained the public spotlight to advocate views on relations with Saudi Arabia,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and to feature Mobil\u2019s efforts in Saudi Arabia, including the SA-MARCO relationship.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This controversy\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Mobil\u2019s dealings with Saudi Arabia in general and SAMARCO in particular \u2014 -thus clearly met the <em>Waldbaum </em>standard for establishing a public controversy. \u201c[T]he issue was being debated publicly and * * * it had foreseeable and substantial ramifications for non-participants,\u201d 627 F.2d at 1297 \u2014 as Tavoulareas repeatedly stressed in his public remarks. \u201cIn coming forward to play a prominent role in a heated controversy he rendered himself a public figure\u2014 someone who might expect public commentary both admiring and, as is not uncommon when passions run high and substantial interests are at stake, of a hurtful and perhaps unfair nature.\u201d <em>McBride v. Merrell Dow &amp; Pharmaceuticals, Inc., supra, </em>717 F.2d at 1466.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">The second and third prongs are sufficiently indisputable as to merit only brief discussion. The second prong concerns Tavoulareas\u2019 role in the public controversy: \u201cWilliam Tavoulareas undeniably played an important role at least in the conception of Samarco as a joint American-Saudi Arabian Shipping concern and in the formulation of the idea for an independent ship management company in the nature of Atlas. He also is the chief architect of Mobil\u2019s special relationship with the Saudi Arabians.\u201d Mem. Op. at 7, RE 715. Similarly, the third prong is also clearly satisfied: \u201c[T]he alleged defamation unquestionably concerned one aspect of the overall Mobil-Saudi Arabian relationship or, more narrowly, of the specific Mobil-Atlas-Samarco relationship.\u201d Id.<footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Furthermore, Tavoulareas\u2019 leadership on a broad range of public issues is at least noteworthy. He has taken great pride in the role of public advocate and has urged others to follow his, and Mobil\u2019s, lead.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> This leadership role has been especially conspicuous on energy issues.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Such leadership is particularly significant because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Tavoulareas commands media attention and space virtually at will. Indeed, Tavoulareas has relished Mobil\u2019s extensive publicity operation, including its ability to purchase response space in major newspapers. <em>See </em>RE 393. He thus has the capacity for \u201cself-help\u201d that the Supreme Court has recognized as an important attribute of a public figure. <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., supra, </em>418 U.S. at 344, 94 S.Ct. at 3009.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">It is instructive to compare Tavoulareas and Mobil with the plaintiff and his company in <em>Waldbaum. </em>The court judge Waldbaum to be a limited purpose public figure because Waldbaum \u201c \u2018did not become merely a boardroom president whose vision was limited to the balance sheet. He became an activist, projecting his own image and that of the cooperative far beyond the dollars and cents aspects of marketing.\u2019 \u201d 627 F.2d at 1300 <em>(quoting </em>District Court). On a far broader scale and with far more success, Tavoulareas also became an activist and projected an image far beyond the dollars and cents of oil marketing.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">V. Golden</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">I concur in the judgment affirming the j.n.o.v. with respect to Golden. I concur, however, not only because I share the publication concerns raised in the majority opinion, but also because I am convinced that the record does not contain clear and convincing evidence of actual malice on Golden\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">VI. Piro</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">Tavoulareas claims that three of Piro\u2019s statements are false and defamatory: (1) that William Tavoulareas set up his son as a partner in Atlas; (2) that William Tavoulareas arranged for Peter\u2019s first job with C.M. Lemos <em>&amp; </em>Company; and (3) that Tavoulareas dispatched a senior executive to help run Atlas. Brief for appellant at 29.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">The majority again misconstrues Judge Gasch\u2019s opinion. Judge Gasch, while noting that Piro poses \u201ca more difficult question of the existence of actual malice\u201d than the <em>Post </em>defendants, Memorandum-Order of District Court in Civil Action No. 80-2387 filed May 29, 1983, at 2 n. 2, RE 766, properly emphasized the lack of clear and convincing evidence of knowledge or reckless disregard of falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-13\">In stating that Tavoulareas set up his son, Piro knew that Peter Tavoulareas had received a lucrative job in a concern that was involved in a business relationship with Mobil, which William Tavoulareas headed. RE 907. The majority ignores this knowledge. As a result the majority misconceives the meaning of Piro\u2019s ignorance of the complexities of the Mobil-SA-MARCO-Atlas transactions. For the point is not that statements made in ignorance are automatically protected; rather, the point is that the ignorance, <em>in conjunction with his knowledge, </em>did not provide evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>dence of knowledge or reckless disregard of falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">For the statement about Peter\u2019s job, Piro knew that Lemos was a friend of the Tavoulareas family and that Peter obtained a job at his firm. RE 899. Indeed, in his SEC testimony Tavoulareas testified that he played no role in Peter getting the job, but conceded that Lemos \u201cwas a personal friend\u201d and \u201cmust have known he was my son.\u201d RE 2414. Though Piro did not know any further details, this ignorance, considered with his knowledge, does not provide the necessary affirmative evidence of actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Finally, the statement about dispatching an executive poses the hardest question, but it also fails to establish actual malice. Piro said that he overheard Tavoulareas telling Checket he had personally dispatched Hoffmann. RE 2089-2090. Checket testified that he did not recall this conversation. RE 1844. Yet even if Checket\u2019s testimony is believed and Piro\u2019s disbelieved, there is no affirmative evidence that Piro knew of or recklessly disregarded falsity. As <em>Bose </em>stresses, 104 S.Ct. at 1966, disbelieving Piro\u2019s testimony is not affirmative evidence of the contrary proposition. The record contains no clear and convincing evidence that Piro\u2019s statement about the Checket conversation was based on actual malice, rather than on any number of possible other explanations\u2014 such as a misunderstanding or a mistake. Thus the third statement also fails to meet the high standard for actual malice emphasized in <em>Bose. </em>Though it is a far closer case for Piro than for the <em>Post </em>defendants, Tavoulareas has failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that Piro\u2019s statements were made with knowledge or reckless disregard of falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">VII. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The central question is whether the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of free speech protects the disputed statements published by the <em>Post. </em>Tyler knew that Tavoulareas personally recruited his son\u2019s business associate to run a Mobil-conceived company and that Tavoulareas\u2019 son ultimately landed a lucrative partnership at the company; he wrote that Tavoulareas \u201cset up\u201d his son. Tyler knew that Tavoulareas personally participated in the arrangements for a transition in leadership at the Mobil-conceived company; he wrote that Tavoulareas \u201cpersonally dispatched\u201d the Mobil executive who assumed command of the company. Tyler knew that the Mobil plans called for Mobil ships to be managed by the Mobil-conceived company after being leased to SAMARCO; he wrote that Mobil \u201cprovided\u201d ships to the company. These statements emerged in the course of an extensively researched 85-paragraph story, fully a fourth of which recounted Mobil\u2019s version of the disputed events. I have no doubt that the Constitution protects these statements in the circumstances under which they were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">This is an extremely important First Amendment case. If this excessive jury verdict on these mundane, flimsy facts is upheld, the effect on freedom of expression will be incalculable. The message to the media will be unmistakable \u2014 steer clear of unpleasant news stories and comments about interests like Mobil or pay the price. Thus we will have created a class of untouchables and abandoned our \u201cprofound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.\u201d <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, supra, </em>376 U.S. at 270, 84 S.Ct. at 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-10\">.

In <em>Bose </em>the Court rejected the notion that a different standard might apply to a jury trial. 104 S.Ct. at 1964, n. 27. Notably, two of the three <em>Bose </em>dissenters emphasized that their dissent was from the Court\u2019s conclusion about a <em>bench </em>trial. They conceded that a <em>jury </em>verdict of actual malice \u2014 as in the instant case \u2014 would compel independent appellate review. <em>See id. </em>at 1969 n. 2 (Rehnquist, L, dissenting) (\u201cThe fact-finding process engaged in by a jury rendering a general verdict is much less evidence to the naked eye and thus more suspect than the fact-finding process engaged in by a trial judge who makes written findings * * *.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">Appellant\u2019s argument that the j.n.o.v. violates the Seventh Amendment is meritless. The constitutionality of j.n.o.v. determinations has long been settled. <em>See Neely v. Martin K.

In contrast to the apparent ease of the majority\u2019s distinction between the \"manner\" and \u201cstandard\u201d of evaluating evidence, the <em>Bose </em>Court recognized the \"vexing nature\u201d of the necessary distinction between questions of fact and mixed questions of fact and law. 104 S.Ct. at 1960. <em>See also Pullman-Standard v.

Even if <em>Bose </em>did not impose a special responsibility of independent review in this case, I might find that the majority\u2019s approach violates longstanding principles for construing and evaluating inferences. \"Inference is capable of bridging many gaps,\" <em>Galloway v. United States, </em>319 U.S. 372, 386, 63 S.Ct. 1077, 1085, 87 L.Ed. 1458 (1943), but the inference must be reasonable and supported in the record. <em>Id. See also Bechtel v.

In \u201ccumulating\" inferences, moreover, a court should be especially vigilant in determining whether the inferences are supported by the record. <em>Cf. People v.

As the majority notes, Tavoulareas also points to securities law allusions as false and defamatory, but, since those allusions were not specifically pleaded, they are not before the court as possibly libellous statements. <em>See </em>maj. op. at 127; <em>see also </em>note 16 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b220-15\">. The majority, of course, necessarily discusses and decides falsity as well as actual malice. In doing so, it \u201dassume[s] without deciding\u201d that falsity, like the other elements of the constitutional inquiry, must be shown by clear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>convincing proof. Maj. op. at 112. The majority\u2019s reticence is puzzling. Like actual malice, falsity must be shown by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See </em>Franklin &amp; Bussell, <em>The Plaintiff\u2019s Burden in Defamation: Awareness and Falsity, </em>25 Wm. &amp; Mary L.Rev. '825, 864 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b221-10\">. I emphasize again that Judge Gasch\u2019s opinion is instructive, not because of a legal principle of deference, but because of its analytical insight and clarity. <em>See </em>note 6 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b223-6\">. Indeed, Justice Brennan, the author of the \"actual malice\u201d standard in <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964), once suggested that jury instructions be framed strictly in terms of \u201cknowing or reckless falsity\" to avoid confusion of \"actual malice\u201d in the First Amendment sense with common law malice. <em>Rosenbloom v. Metromedia, Inc., supra </em>note 4, 403 U.S. at 52 n. 18, 91 S.Ct. at 1824 n. 18 (Brennan, J., plurality).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The majority\u2019s contention that the question is analogous to the distinction between motive and intent in a murder prosecution, maj. op. at 118 n. 34, utterly misses the point. For the point in excluding ill will as an element of proof in actual malice is the <em>Garrison </em>principle that the admission of such proof chills free speech. It thus rests on important First Amendment concerns. No such principle bears in the murder analogy.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">As authority the majority cites two decisions from other circuits, two state cases, and a commentator. Maj. op. at 117-118. One of the decisions from another <em>circuit </em>\u2014 Bose <em>Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., </em>692 F.2d 189, 196 (1st Cir.1982), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984) \u2014 did not concern any allegation of ill will. To the extent that the decisions, and the commentary that recites them, conflict with the reading of <em>Garrison </em>set out above, I necessarily disagree with their interpretation and agree with <em>Ryan v. Brooks, </em>634 F.2d 726 (4th Cir.1980). Furthermore, one of the most cited opinions of this circuit on actual malice emphasized the difference between common law malice and the requisite <em>New York Times </em>knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of truth or falsity. \"Malice, under the <em>pre-Times </em>practice, was equated with hostility, vindictiveness or negligent disregard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>of reputation. Under the <em>Times </em>test false statements made with these motives alone are not actionable; malic[e] may be shown only through knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of truth or falsity.\u201d <em>Washington Post Co. v. Keogh, </em>365 F.2d 965, 967 (D.C.Cir.1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 1011, 87 S.Ct. 708, 17 L.Ed.2d 548 (1967). Nothing in <em>Keogh </em>suggested that <em>pre-Times </em>malice should be considered probative of actual malice under <em>Times.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">The majority also cites <em>Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, </em>388 U.S. 130, 87 S.Ct. 1975, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094 (1967). <em>Butts </em>relates to the muckraking point, which is discussed in detail in text at 153\u2014 55 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b224-8\">. <em>See </em>S.

Chief Justice Warren\u2019s comment provides little support for several reasons. First, the Chief Justice was quoting the magazine\u2019s self-description rather than setting forth a standard for evaluating probativeness of actual malice. Second, in reciting the <em>Saturday Evening Post\u2019s </em>self-definition he did not explicitly find such a policy probative of actual malice, and he subsequently recounted other evidence clearly probative of actual malice. Third, whatever the meaning of his reference, it is unclear how many Justices shared his view. No other Justice joined that part of his opinion. Justice Harlan\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>plurality opinion mentioned \"sophisticated muckraking,\u201d 388 U.S. at 158, 87 S.Ct. at 1993, but that analysis is structured by a standard of reasonable care, rather than actual malice. Justices Brennan and White agreed that Chief Justice Warren\u2019s opinion presented evidence supporting a judgment of actual malice, but their agreement was in very general terms. <em>Id. </em>at 172, 87 S.Ct. at 2000 (Brennan, J., concurring in result).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b227-7\">. <em>Pape </em>refers to a document that bristles with ambiguity, but <em>Bose </em>makes clear that <em>Pape </em>applies to ambiguous situations and events as well. 104 S.Ct. at 1966.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b228-5\">.

The majority apparently attaches some weight to this reference, but declines to elaborate on the significance this reference is supposed to assume within the majority\u2019s grand scheme of \u201ccumulation.\u201d Clearly, the reference adds nothing to a finding of knowing or reckless falsity. Virtually all of the sentences are completely accurate. The parties dispute whether the relevant securities regulation would have applied to Tavoulareas. It is undisputed, however, that a congressional hearing specifically addressing this question of securities law resulted in a debate between top SEC officials about whether full disclosure requirements would have attached even without the son living in the same household. <em>See Securities Law and Corporate Disclosure Regulations, 1982: Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, </em>97th Cong., 2d Sess. 261-62 (1982). It is also undisputed that the <em>Post </em>reported Mobil's claim that it had fully compiled with securities law. jf 11. The <em>Post\u2019s </em>description of a point of securities law so murky that top SEC officials could not agree on it hardly amounts to the significant role the majority seeks \u2014 evidence that contributes to a finding of clear and convincing proof of actual malice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b229-7\">.

Having decided \u201cnot [to] reach the issue,\" maj. op. at 103, the majority cannot resist offering, in wholly conclusory terms, an assumption that flies in the face of precedent and logic. The majority\u2019s apparent view is that the third prong of <em>Waldbaum </em>is probably not satisfied because the controversy over SAMARCO is not germane to Tavoulareas\u2019 prominent public role as an outspoken advocate of Mobil\u2019s special relationship with Saudi Arabia. <em>Id. </em>at 103, n.12. This is akin to arguing that a vigorous public advocate of, for instance, night flights into National Airport would not be a public figure for purposes of a controversy involving a particular night flight for which the advocate bore substantial responsibility.
