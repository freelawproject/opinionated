By interlocutory appeal, appellant challenges a district court order refusing to confirm and vacating an arbitration award following a prior order staying litigation pending arbitration. We hold that such an order is not immediately appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-24\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b766-25\">In 1980, Dr. Francisco Cabral disappeared at or near California\u2019s Russian Gulch State Park. Although no body was found, the doctor \u2014 insured by plaintiff Sentry Life \u2014 was presumed dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-26\">Sentry paid insurance proceeds to Mrs. Cabral, the doctor\u2019s beneficiary, after executing an agreement with her providing for the repayment, with interest, of all proceeds should her husband prove not to have died. The agreement further provided that any dispute concerning Mrs. Cabral\u2019s repayment obligation would be submitted to binding arbitration. While not a signatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>to the agreement, defendant Borad, Mrs. Cabral\u2019s attorney, had negotiated the agreement prior to Sentry\u2019s conditional payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">In 1981, Dr. Cabral was discovered alive.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sentry immediately demanded repayment from Mrs. Cabral. Her refusal prompted the current litigation. Upon learning that Borad had received most of the proceeds furnished Mrs. Cabral in satisfaction of attorney fees, Sentry amended its complaint to include Borad as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Arguing that he was entitled to have Sentry\u2019s claims against him arbitrated in the course of the arbitration by Sentry against Mrs. Cabral, Borad successfully moved the district court to stay litigation pending arbitration. The arbitrator rendered an award in Borad\u2019s favor, and Borad moved in district court for confirmation. Sentry opposed the motion on the ground that Sentry\u2019s claims were never arbitrable in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The district court denied confirmation, vacated the arbitration award, and set the action for trial. On Borad\u2019s motion, we stayed further proceedings by the district court pending disposition of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">\u201cThe first Judiciary Act of 1789 ... established the general principle that only final decisions of the federal district courts would be reviewable on appeal. Because rigid application of this principle was found to create undue hardship in some cases, however, Congress created certain exceptions to it. One of these exceptions, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1), permits appeal as of right from \u2018[interlocutory orders of the district courts ... granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions ____\u2019\u201d <em>Carson v. American </em>Brands, <em>Inc., </em>450 U.S. 79, 83, 101 S.Ct. 993, 996, 67 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981) (citations, footnote, and original emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">Under <em>Carson, </em>the district court\u2019s order refusing to confirm and vacating Borad\u2019s arbitration award is immediately appealable under \u00a7 1292(a)(1) only if: (1) it has the practical effect of \u201crefusing or dissolving\u201d an injunction; (2) it might have a \u201cserious, perhaps irreparable, consequence;\u201d and (3) it can be \u201ceffectively challenged\u201d only by immediate appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 83-84, 101 S.Ct. at 996-997. None of these criteria is met here.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-13\">The only other case to address the question before us arose in the District of Columbia\u2019s court system. In <em>Brandon v. Hines, </em>439 A.2d 496 (D.C.1981), the court held that an interlocutory order vacating an arbitration award, following the trial court\u2019s earlier stay of the litigation, is immediately appealable. <em>Id. </em>at 508-09. The court reasoned that if a refusal to stay litigation pending arbitration is tantamount to refusing an injunction, and is therefore immediately appealable, a denial of a motion to confirm an arbitration award should also be appealable since, in both instances, the court orders the parties out of the arbitration process and into trial. <em>Id. </em>at 508. Further, if the original stay had the practical effect of an injunction, the subsequent order refusing to confirm should be treated as an order \u201cdissolving\u201d that injunction. <em>Id. </em>We do not find this reasoning of <em>Brandon </em>persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-14\">It is true that we have held that a stay of litigation pending arbitration may be appealable \u201cas an interlocutory order granting an injunction.\u201d <em>Lake Communications, Inc. v. ICC Corp., </em>738 F.2d 1473, 1476 (9th Cir.1984); <em>accord Salinas Cooling Co. v. Fresh Fruit &amp; Vegetable Workers, Local P-78-A, </em>743 F.2d 705, 706-07 (9th Cir.1984). We cannot accept the view, however, that the district court\u2019s order here had the practical effect of \u201cdissolving\u201d an injunction. The litigation was only stayed, in the first place, <em>pending </em>arbitration. When the arbitration proceedings ended, the stay ended. The stay was not \u201cdissolved\u201d by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>Under the Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 le\u00ed <em>seq., </em>a district court is empowered to stay trial of an action <em>\u201cuntil ... </em>arbitration has been had____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 3 (emphasis added). Borad has had that opportunity to arbitrate. An arbitration award, however, is not self-executing. <em>Alascom, Inc. v. ITT North Electric Co., </em>727 F.2d 1419, 1422 (9th Cir.1984) (citing 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 9). While an arbitration award \u201cgenerally receive[s] deferential review by the courts,\u201d <em>Carpenters\u2019 Local Union No. 1478 v. Stevens, </em>743 F.2d 1271, 1275 (9th Cir.1984), deference is not abdication. In refusing to confirm and vacating Borad\u2019s award, the district court has exercised its statutory prerogative of independent, if deferential, review under the Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9-10<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 review implicitly contemplated, given the statute, in the court\u2019s initial order staying litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">In sum, the district court\u2019s order refusing to confirm and vacating the arbitration award did not have the \u201cpractical effect\u201d of \u201cdissolving\u201d an injunction. The initial order staying litigation, while itself tantamount to \u201can ... order granting an injunction,\u201d <em>Lake Communications, </em>738 F.2d at 1476, simply permitted arbitration to proceed; it did not abrogate the district court\u2019s statutory authority to determine whether circumstances warranted confirmation or vacation of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">In addition, we find that neither of the remaining two elements of the <em>Carson </em>test is met by the district court\u2019s order. Concerning the second element, Borad contends that he will suffer irreparable harm if he is compelled to go to trial without this appeal being decided, since he has already tried this case before an arbitration panel and prevailed. He relies on our decision in <em>Alascom, Inc., </em>727 F.2d at 1422.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">In <em>Alascom, Inc., </em>we noted the consequences visited upon the party seeking arbitration, when a court grants a stay of arbitration. We observed that the party is denied the \u201cinexpensive and expeditious means by which the parties had agreed to resolve their disputes,\u201d and that \u201cthe advantages of arbitration \u2014 speed and economy \u2014 are lost forever.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But there is a significant difference between refusing to send a case to arbitration in the first place (the concern in <em>Alascom, Inc.), </em>and refusing to confirm an arbitration award that already has. been rendered. In the latter case, the parties have not been denied their chosen method of dispute resolution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They have fully arbitrated their dispute and the case is back in the district court. Postponing an appeal until after a trial in the district court certainly will cause some expense and delay, but these costs should be compared to the expense and delay that could result if we allowed appeal at this point in such cases. <em>Cf. Shearson Loeb Rhoades, Inc. v. Much, </em>754 F.2d 773, 778 (7th Cir.1985) (district court\u2019s remand to arbitrator to calculate damages would impose shorter delay on parties than would allowing immediate appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-12\">In short, we find no irreparable injury here. Borad had the arbitration he sought. He may prevail in the district court. If not, he can still present the arbitrability issue on appeal from the district court\u2019s final judgment. This result neither frustrates the arbitration process nor intrudes impermissibly into it. It also respects the long-standing federal policy against piecemeal appeals. <em>Catlin v. United States, </em>324 U.S. 229, 233-34, 65 S.Ct. 631, 633-34, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945); <em>Newton v. National Broadcasting Co., </em>726 F.2d 591, 592 (9th Cir.1984) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-13\">Similarly, the district court\u2019s order refusing to confirm and vacating Borad\u2019s award cannot be \u201ceffectively challenged\u201d only by interlocutory appeal. In <em>Carson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>the Court noted that if the order refusing to enter the parties\u2019 consent decree were not immediately appealable, a party \u201cmight be legally justified in withdrawing its consent to the agreement once trial is held and final judgment entered____\u201d <em>Id. </em>450 U.S. at 87, 101 S.Ct. at 998. By contrast, the present order can be effectively challenged on appeal from final judgment. Should this court find, at that time, that the district court erred in refusing to confirm and vacating the arbitration award, the matter can be readily remanded with instructions to reinstate the award. Unlike the consent decree at stake in <em>Carson, </em>Borad\u2019s arbitration award is not dependent upon Sentry\u2019s acquiescence.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Because we find that the district court\u2019s order fails to fall within the narrow exception set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1), defendant\u2019s appeal is</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">DISMISSED.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b767-11\">. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Cabral again disappeared, and his whereabouts were unknown at the time of trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b768-9\">. Section 9 of the Act authorizes application to the appropriate district court for an order confirming an arbitration award. 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 9.
