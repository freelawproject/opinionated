The District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> found that the payments had been induced by fraud on the part of Burney and entered judgment in favor of the company. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-22\">On June 11, 1976, Burney, who was in financial difficulty, left his home in Helena, Arkansas, and traveled to other states, eventually ending up in Florida. He referred to himself as \u201cJohn Bruce\u201d and purported to marry another woman, leaving behind him his wife and children. He falsified records and concealed his true identity. More than five years later, Burney returned, but only after some $470,000 had been paid out by Southern Farm Bureau Life Insurance Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-23\">Burney\u2019s principal argument on appeal is that he made no representation to the company, or indeed to anyone in or near Helena. He simply went away, and whatever false representations of identity he may have made were made to others, for example, his new \u201cwife\u201d and his new employer. We believe the District Court properly rejected this contention. Burney\u2019s deliberate acts, including a continuous course of misrepresentation of his own identity, created <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>the situation that led directly to the payments by the company. Whether he is legally responsible is a question of state law, on which we normally defer to the views of the district courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">We deem further discussion of the case unnecessary. The District Court\u2019s well reasoned opinion, 590 F.Supp. 1016 (E.D. Ark.1984), amply covers the subject, and we affirm on that basis. See 8th Cir. R. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-24\">. The Hon.
