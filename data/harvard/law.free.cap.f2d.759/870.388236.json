Henry alleged a cause of action for improper procedures in connection with his employment termination, defendant Delta Air Lines was granted summary judgment. On appeal, plaintiff claims the district court should have held that he did not have a full and fair hearing before the System Board of Adjustment (Board), and that his case should be remanded for a new hearing before the Board because: (1) one Board member was biased against him and guilty of \u201cfraud and corruption\u201d under the Act; (2) the Board improperly denied Henry\u2019s attorney access to his personnel file for use at the Board hearing; and (3) he was denied due process by the Board and the district court erred in not properly applying due process principles as an appropriate standard of review. We affirm for the reasons set forth by the district court in portions of its opinion quoted below.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-9\">Briefly, plaintiff Henry was a commercial airline pilot employed by Delta from 1957 to December 8, 1980, when he was terminated for numerous incidents of misconduct. Because of the nature of these incidents, Delta asked him to undergo psychological and psychiatric testing. Henry agreed after consulting with his union, the Airline Pilots Association (ALPA).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">The first doctor Henry saw observed that he had problems dealing with authority and recommended psychotherapy. Four subsequent evaluations by doctors specializing in aviation psychiatry failed to agree on a diagnosis. Henry only provided Delta with the reports of the two doctors who stated that he had no psychiatric illness. Delta then returned plaintiff to active duty with a warning against future misbehavior. After the fifth incident of misconduct after being reinstated, however, he was fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-11\">Plaintiff sought ALPA\u2019s assistance after his discharge. ALPA\u2019s Contract Administrator, Robert H. Drew, outlined various options. Henry\u2019s termination was upheld at the first stage of the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-12\">Next Henry submitted his case before the System Board, an RLA-created entity, where Attorney James S. Berger was appointed to represent him. After carefully reviewing all his files, Berger decided to challenge Henry\u2019s termination on the ground that his overall record did not justify termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-13\">Berger kept Henry informed during the five days of System Board hearings. Henry stated he had confidence in the way his case was presented. He never requested a medical defense and Berger did not believe such a defense either necessary or appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-14\">The System Board upheld Henry\u2019s termination on May 20, 1984. Subsequently, he sought more medical help and was diagnosed as suffering from a Paranoid Personality Disorder, which had probably existed since 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-15\"><em>Opinion of the District Court </em>IV. <em>Full and Fair Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b941-16\">\u201cHenry asks this Court to vacate the award of the Systems Board and remand the case for another hearing. The scope of judicial review of cases arising under the RLA is \u2018among the narrowest known to the law.\u2019 <em>Diamond v. Terminal Railway Alabama State Docks, </em>421 F.2d 228, 233 (5th Cir.1970). The findings of the Board are final and conclusive and subject to an extremely limited review by the fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>eral courts. <em>Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n, Inter. v. Eastern Airlines, Inc., </em>632 F.2d 1321 (5th Cir.1980). A Board\u2019s order can be set aside only if the plaintiff can assert one of the three grounds set forth in 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(q). These grounds are the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-4\">1) Failure of the [Board] to comply with the requirements of [the Act]; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-5\">2) Failure of the order to conform, or confine itself, to matters within the scope of the [Board\u2019s] jurisdiction; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-6\">3) Fraud or corruption by a member of the [Board] making the order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">The Fifth Circuit has recently stated that \u2018an award must be enforced, without judicial review of the evidence, if it draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.\u2019 <em>Johns-Manville Sales v. Intern. Ass\u2019n of Machinists, </em>621 F.2d 756, 758 (5th Cir.1980). This Court\u2019s review of the Board\u2019s award will proceed applying these principles of limited review.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">\u201cHenry\u2019s first argument is that he was denied a full and fair hearing under Section 157 of the RLA because one of the Board\u2019s members, Mr. Rox, was biased against him. This argument overlaps with Henry\u2019s argument that the Board\u2019s award violated Sec-' tion 153(q) of the Act because of fraud and corruption by a member of the Board.4 Henry contends that Rox was biased against him because Rox had been involved with Henry\u2019s case since 1970. Mr. Rox was directly involved in Henry's termination and was the immediate superior to Mr. Smith, one of the other Board members. Henry argues that because of Rox\u2019s prior involvement with his case, Rox was biased against Henry even before the hearing commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">\u201cHenry also claims that Rox\u2019s actions at the hearings denied him a full and fair hearing and that because of his conduct the Board\u2019s award should be vacated because of fraud and corruption. Henry claims that Rox dominated the proceedings \u2018with an adversarial attitude and personal disdain for [Henry], obviously influencing the other members of the Board____\u2019 Plaintiff\u2019s Brief at 15. Henry cites various statements made by Rox that Henry claims show Rox\u2019s hostile attitude. Rox referred to Henry's evidence as \u2018frivolous\u2019 and referred to Mr. Berger as \u2018rude and improper.\u2019 And, Mr. Rox asked Mr. Berger to refrain from making so many objections because such objections would increase the cost of making a transcript of the proceedings. Henry concludes that this Court should vacate the Board\u2019s award because of Mr. Rox\u2019s conduct and alleged biases.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">\u201cHenry\u2019s argument overlooks the important fact that the members of the Adjustment Board are not supposed to be neutral arbitrators. The Boards are made up of employer representatives and labor union representatives. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 153. If there is a deadlock, there are provisions in the Act for the designation of a neutral person to act as a referee and break the deadlock. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(c). Therefore, many courts have held that a plaintiff cannot challenge the Board\u2019s award on the grounds that one of the Board Members was a company executive who had previous dealings with the plaintiff. <em>See e.g., Farris v. Alaska Airlines, Inc., </em>113 F.Supp. 907, 910 (W.D. Wash.1953); <em>Arnold v. United Airlines, Inc., </em>296 F.2d 191 (7th Cir.1961). The Court in <em>Farris </em>stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-13\">It is true that the Board Members knew of the occurrences leading up to plaintiff\u2019s discharge before the formal hearing was conducted____ But Board Members are not jurors; the Board is bipartisan rather than impartial and disinterested; and foreknowledge, which plaintiff considers a ground for vitiating the proceeding, is actually a usual, if not necessary, attribute of an arbitration under the Railway Labor Act. <em>Farris </em>at 910.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0q\">\u201cApplying these principles to the present case, this Court holds that it cannot vacate the Board\u2019s award merely because Mr. Rox was a Delta executive who had prior dealing with Henry. In addition, Henry has not shown that Mr. Rox\u2019s behavior during the proceedings was egregious enough to warrant a reversal by this Court of the Board\u2019s decision. The statements made by Mr. Rox clearly do not rise to the level of fraud or corruption nor do they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>lead to the conclusion that Henry was denied a fair hearing within the meaning of the RLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">\u201cHenry also claims that the Board\u2019s award must be vacated because the Board refused to order Delta to turn over Henry\u2019s personnel file to Henry. Henry argues that this file contained substantial evidence of his odd behavior and that such evidence could have affected the Board\u2019s decision. This evidence consisted primarily of memos written by several Delta executives reflecting concerns as early as 1970 that Henry was exhibiting suspect behavior that could prove dangerous both to the airline and its passengers. And, Henry points to two letters in the file written by Delta passengers praising Henry and his job performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">\u201cHenry\u2019s argument must fail for several reasons. First, he nowhere indicates the source of his \u2018right\u2019 to see his personnel file. Secondly, and more importantly, Henry\u2019s argument does not fit into any of the three categories listed in 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(q). As noted earlier, this Court can only vacate an award based on a violation of one of these categories. Furthermore, this Court feels that the evidence contained in Henry\u2019s file could not have affected the Board\u2019s decision. Therefore, Henry\u2019s argument that the Board\u2019s award must be vacated before he was denied access to his personnel file must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">\u201cHenry\u2019s last argument is that the System Board denied him due process of law by failing to recognize and consider his medical disorder. This argument is without merit because the Supreme Court has held that judicially created challenges to System Board\u2019s awards must fail. In <em>Union Pac. R.R. v. Sheehan, </em>439 U.S. 89, 99 S.Ct. 399, 58 L.Ed.2d 354 (1978), the Court stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-8\">The dispositive question is whether the party\u2019s objections to the Adjustment Board\u2019s decision fall within any of the three limited categories of review provided for in the Railway Labor Act. Section 153 First (q) unequivocally states that the \u2018findings and order of the [Board] shall be conclusive on the parties\u2019 and may be set aside only for the three reasons specified therein. We have time and again emphasized that this statutory language means just what it says. <em>Id. </em>at 93, 99 S.Ct. at 402.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">Therefore, <em>Sheehan </em>precludes judicially created due process challenges to System Board awards and Henry\u2019s argument based on due process concerns is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">\u201cIn sum, this Court finds that Henry has not raised a material issue of fact as to the correctness of the Board\u2019s decision____ Accordingly, defendant Delta Airline\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to all issues is hereby GRANTED. 585 F.Supp. 376, 381-383.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-14\">4 The defendants argue that \u00a7 157 does not apply to the present case. Because this Court finds that Henry was not denied a fair hearing, this Court need not reach that difficult issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b943-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
