LANIER ANDERSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">This securities case requires us to consider what conduct makes one a \u201cseller\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 12(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because we conclude that appellant was not a \u201cseller\u201d of the securities in question, we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment with respect to appellee\u2019s \u00a7 12(2) claim. Appellant has also been found liable under Alabama securities laws. We conclude that the legal sufficiency of these latter claims depends on important questions of state law that have not been ruled upon by the courts of Alabama. Accordingly, we certify these questions to the Alabama Supreme Court for instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b910-11\">Foster, plaintiff below, invested in a Texas limited partnership in December, 1980 (Texas Partners \u201980, Ltd., hereafter \u201cTexas Partners\u201d). Texas Partners\u2019 ostensible business purpose was to develop oil and gas wells. In fact, no substantial drilling operations were undertaken on behalf of the partnership, and Foster lost the amount he invested.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-16\">Foster bought his interest from Minnick, sole shareholder and president of Minnick Resources Management, Inc., which was the general partner in Texas Partners.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The only party involved with Texas Partners that defended before the district court and the only party opposing Foster before this court is Jesup &amp; Lamont Securities Co. (\u201cJesup &amp; Lamont\u201d), a New York securities dealer whose name appeared on the Texas Partners offering document.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-17\">Jesup &amp; Lamont first became involved in the offering in June of 1980 when its president, Curd, and its vice-president, Thors, met with Minnick to discuss the firm\u2019s participation. Minnick and Jesup &amp; Lamont subsequently entered into an agency agreement whereby the firm promised to use its \u201cbest efforts\u201d to sell interests in Texas Partners. Jesup &amp; Lamont was to receive a ten percent commission for interests it sold, and a two percent commission for interests sold by Minnick. Jesup &amp; Lamont was not required by the agreement to sell any interests, but only to use its best efforts in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-18\">Following the initial meeting with Min-nick, Curd inquired of Minnick\u2019s former employers and of his banker about Min-nick\u2019s standing in the investment community. These references were favorable, and reported that Minnick \u201chad a reputation of being successful in oil and gas.\u201d 4 Rec. at 347. Jesup &amp; Lamont did not investigate other particulars about Minnick, such as how he had fared in specific oil and gas deals or his standing with trade creditors. Jesup &amp; Lamont also did not investigate the particulars of the Texas Partners un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>dertaking, such as the status of the partnership\u2019s leases or the financial feasibility of the planned drilling operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">The Texas Partners venture went forward and an offering memorandum was prepared for use in the sale of interests in the partnership. Minnick testified by deposition that he drafted the offering memorandum, but that it was reviewed by a lawyer at Shea &amp; Gould, a New York law firm that represented Minnick in the proposed offering. Shea &amp; Gould was also general counsel to Jesup &amp; Lamont. Jesup &amp; Lamont had no role in the drafting or printing of the offering memorandum, the cost of which was borne by Minnick. Three hundred copies were printed and delivered to Minnick, who sent thirty copies to Jesup &amp; Lamont.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">The offering memorandum comprises sixty pages of text and nine exhibits. The cover of the memorandum displays the limited partnership\u2019s name at the top and Jesup &amp; Lamont\u2019s name, address, and phone number at the bottom, with the notation that the firm is a member of the New York Stock Exchange.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The same general information about Jesup &amp; Lamont is presented on the first inside page and a legend appears in two places early in the document stating that \u201cThese Limited Partnership Interests are being primarily distributed through Jesup &amp; Lamont Securities Co., Inc.\u201d Pl.Ex. 1. In the text of the offering memorandum is the information that Texas Partners and Jesup &amp; Lamont had entered into a best efforts selling arrangement, and that \u201cIn addition, other persons may receive commissions for selling Interests, including Minnick Resources Management, Inc.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. The offering memorandum is dated July 30, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">Jesup &amp; Lamont and Minnick rescinded their sales agency agreement shortly after this date.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In his deposition, Minnick testified that he had been unhappy with Jesup &amp; Lamont\u2019s performance. At trial, Curd testified that Jesup &amp; Lamont had decided \u201cthe item was basically not marketable.\u201d 4 Rec. at 348. Although the principals agreed to rescind the best efforts agreement, they disagreed about who should pay for the offering documents. Minnick wanted Jesup &amp; .Lamont to pay the printing costs because the firm\u2019s lack of success had resulted in rescission of the agreement. Jesup &amp; Lamont took the position that it had no responsibility to pay because the agreement only required \u201cbest efforts,\u201d which the firm felt it had given. There is no dispute in the record that Minnick told Curd he was going to remove Jesup <em>&amp; </em>Lamont\u2019s name from the document. Min-nick testified he attempted to do so for several offering documents by using scissors to cut out at least some of the references to Jesup &amp; Lamont. Jesup &amp; Lamont did not attempt to have Minnick surrender to the firm the offering documents in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">Foster was first introduced to Texas Partners by his accountant, Jordan, who had met Minnick in May of 1980. Jordan testified by deposition that he traveled to New York in November of 1980 on business not related to Texas Partners, but which involved Jesup &amp; Lamont. Jordan took advantage of this opportunity to question Curd about Minnick\u2019s prior activities. Curd reassured him about Minnick even though, unknown to Jordan, Jesup &amp; Lamont had already withdrawn from the Texas Partners offering. Jordan testified that at the November meeting, Curd told him \u201cWe are involved in this offering document and we know of nothing that would effect [sic] our relationship with Mr. Minnick.\u201d 3 Rec. at 195. At trial, Curd denied the occurrence of the meeting at which this statement allegedly was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">Minnick and Foster were brought together for the first time by Jordan at a meeting attended by the three in Jordan\u2019s Alabama office in late December of 1980. The meeting lasted for one to two hours and focused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>on Foster\u2019s possible purchase of an interest in Texas Partners. Foster questioned Min-nick about his background and about the particulars of the undertaking. Minnick made representations about the amount of money that had already been raised by Texas Partners, and told Foster that the money was to be used in drilling numerous wells. Foster was given a copy of the offering memorandum, which bore Jesup &amp; Lamont\u2019s name. He testified he studied the document after the meeting and relied on it in eventually deciding to buy one-half of an interest in Texas Partners. Foster did not communicate directly with anyone at Jesup &amp; Lamont before he invested in Texas Partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">The specific representations in the offering memorandum Foster said he relied on that later proved false were: (1) that Jesup &amp; Lamont was involved in the offering; (2) that the proceeds of the offering would be used by Texas Partners in development drilling for oil and gas; (3) that the general partner, Minnick Resources Management, Inc., would contribute five percent of the drilling costs; and (4) that investments would be refunded if a minimum amount were not raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Jordan\u2019s association with Minnick continued after Foster\u2019s purchase. Jordan learned from work he did for the drilling company, Pyron Exploration and Drilling Corp., that Texas Partners had not raised the required minimum in investments. Further, Jordan discovered that the money raised by Texas Partners had not been applied to development drilling as promised. When Jordan notified Foster of these facts, Foster called Minnick, who assured him that the money he had invested would be refunded. When Minnick failed to refund his money, Foster filed suit in federal district court claiming violations of both state and federal securities laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">\n<em>Proceedings Before the District Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">Foster presented four counts in his first complaint. In Count I, he claimed damages for the sale of an unregistered security, which is made unlawful by \u00a7 5 of the Securities Act of 1933,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and actionable by \u00a7 12(1) of that Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court dismissed this federal registration claim as time barred and that decision has not been appealed. Count I also stated a registration claim under Alabama law. We discuss this latter claim in the section of this opinion addressed to certification of controlling state law questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">In Count II, Foster claimed damages for the sale of a security by means of false written or oral communications in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 17 and 12(2) of the 1933 Act<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and in violation of various Alabama code sections. The district court dismissed Foster\u2019s federal \u00a7 17 claim on the ground that the section does not afford a private right of action. That decision has not been appealed. Jesup &amp; Lamont\u2019s liability founded on \u00a7 12(2) of the 1933 Act is the main subject of this opinion. The state law claims raised in Count II are discussed below, where we certify questions to the Alabama Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">In Count III, Foster alleged violation of \u00a7 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and of Rule 10b-5 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As construed by the courts, these provisions provide a cause of action for fraudulent practices undertaken in connection with the purchase or sale of a security. Finally, in Count IV, Foster sought compensatory and punitive damages for common law deceit. Foster learned after he filed his complaint that Jesup &amp; Lamont and Minnick had rescinded their sales agency agreement before he invested in Texas Partners. He subsequently amended his complaint to exclude Jesup &amp; Lamont as a defendant with respect to Counts III and IV relating to fraud under \u00a7 10(b) of the Exchange Act and for common law deceit. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>Thus, there are no federal or state claims against Jesup &amp; Lamont under Counts III or IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">The only federal claim, the \u00a7 12(2) claim in Count II, and the several state law claims in Counts I and II were tried before a jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Alabama. Foster testified in his own behalf and introduced into evidence the pretrial depositions of Jordan and Minnick. Foster also presented an expert witness, Krebs, a former Alabama securities commissioner who testified about the customary duty of underwriters to control distribution of offering documents in private offerings. Jesup &amp; Lamont presented two witnesses in its own behalf at trial \u2014 Curd, its president, and Thors, its vice-president and syndicate manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">The case was submitted to the jury on special interrogatories, all of which were answered unfavorably to Jesup &amp; Lamont.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The district court entered judgment against Jesup &amp; Lamont based on the jury\u2019s answers, and Jesup &amp; Lamont subsequently appealed from the judgment and from denial of its various post-trial motions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">\n<em>Foster\u2019s Section 12(2) Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Axm\">The sole federal securities law claim against Jesup &amp; Lamont remaining at trial was brought under \u00a7 12(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The only element of that claim at issue here is whether Jesup <em>&amp; </em>Lamont was a \u201cseller\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 12(2). The section provides that \u201c[a]ny person who ... offers or sells a security ... by means of a prospectus or oral communication, which includes an untrue statement of a material fact ... shall be liable to the person purchasing such security from him.\u201d 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 <em>771(2) </em>(West 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">At first blush, Jesup &amp; Lamont appears plainly beyond the reach of \u00a7 12(2). The firm did not sell anyone an interest in Texas Partners and had no direct contact with Foster. Moreover, Foster actually bought his interest from Minnick, who met with Foster and touted the security to persuade him to invest. Courts have generally recognized, however, that defendants who do not actually sell the security in question may nonetheless be liable under \u00a7 12.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">In delimiting the scope of \u00a7 12, authority controlling in this circuit<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> has sought to determine whether a defendant\u2019s role \u201cconstituted him a seller for purposes of that section.\u201d <em>Junker v. Crory, </em>650 F.2d 1349, 1360 (5th Cir. July 17, 1981). Liability of secondary participants has been held to depend on whether \u201cthe injury to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>the plaintiff flow[ed] directly and proximately from the [defendant\u2019s] actions.\u201d <em>Hill York Corp. v. American International Franchises, Inc., </em>448 F.2d 680, 693 (5th Cir.1971) (quoting <em>Lennerth v. Mendenhall, </em>234 F.Supp. 59, 65 (N.D.Ohio 1964)). Section 12 will reach those \u201cwhose participation in the buy-sell transaction is a substantial factor in causing the transaction to take place.\u201d <em>Pharo v. Smith, </em>621 F.2d 656, 667 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">In <em>Hill York, </em>\u00a7 12 liability attached to defendants who engineered a franchise sales scheme, but who did not execute the sales in question. Through the sales scheme, capital was attracted to corporations that purportedly would market restaurant franchises. Shares in the corporations were marketed by means of sales brochures that omitted to inform buyers that similar operations by the same defendants were targets of pending SEC investigations. 448 F.2d at 690. Even though the defendants had not sold to the plaintiffs, the court in <em>Hill York </em>considered them to have been \u201cthe motivating force\u201d behind the sales scheme:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-5\">They sought out the original incorporators of Florida Franchise and then trained them to solicit additional capital for the corporation. They provided the sales brochures designed to secure this additional capital. They rendered advice on every aspect of the corporate formation and subsequent development. In fact, the defendants did everything but effectuate the actual sale.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 693. Given this pervasive involvement of the defendants, the court had little difficulty concluding that \u201cthe plaintiffs would not have purchased this stock had the defendants not traveled to Florida carrying their bag of promotional ideas,\u201d <em>id., </em>and that consequently the defendants were \u201cpersons who sold or offered to sell\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 12. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">In <em>Junker, </em>\u00a7 12(2) liability attached to a lawyer who suggested a merger between two related corporations. The lawyer attended shareholders\u2019 meetings of the disappearing corporation and urged approval of the merger terms. The merger was consummated to the detriment of a minority shareholder, a result that would have been apparent in advance had the two corporations been properly valued. The court in <em>Junker </em>found the evidence sufficient to establish that the lawyer was a \u201ckey participant\u201d and an \u201cactive negotiator\u201d in the transaction, and the court concluded that he was therefore brought within \u201cthe scope of the seller definition under Section 12(2).\u201d 650 F.2d at 1360.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">Finally, in <em>Crop v. Campbell, </em>624 F.2d 709 (5th Cir.1980), the court declined to hold a tax lawyer liable as a \u00a7 12(2) seller after a real estate investment he recommended failed to produce expected tax benefits. The court relied on the fact that the lawyer did not make representations concerning the project\u2019s advisability, except as a tax matter, and further that the lawyer did not prepare the sales brochure or attempt to persuade the plaintiffs to invest in the project. <em>Id. </em>at 714. The court also observed that the plaintiffs decided to invest only after talking with the project\u2019s developer and obtaining independent advice. <em>Id. </em>The court in <em>Crop v. Campbell </em>concluded that \u201c[a]pplying these findings to the \u2018seller\u2019 concept ... we cannot say that the defendant\u2019s participation in this transaction proximately caused the plaintiffs\u2019 injury, or that they would not have purchased the security \u2018but for\u2019 his actions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">Foster presented sufficient evidence in the present case to establish that he relied on Jesup &amp; Lamont\u2019s apparent role in the offering when he decided to invest in Texas Partners. There is no dispute that Jesup &amp; Lamont\u2019s name was prominently displayed on the offering document Minnick gave to Foster. In weighing this fact, we have been mindful that the identity of an underwriter associated with an offering often affects particular investment decisions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>Jesup &amp; Lamont held itself out in the Texas Partners offering document as the \u201cbest efforts\u201d underwriter for the offering, and of course we must assume that the jury credited Foster\u2019s testimony that he relied on the existence of that relationship in deciding to invest in Texas Partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\">We have concluded, however, that Jesup &amp; Lamont\u2019s role as an underwriter and Foster\u2019s reliance on that fact are insufficient to make the firm a \u201cseller\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 12. The different schemes of liability provided in \u00a7 11 and \u00a7 12 of the 1933 Act show that Congress did not intend \u00a7 12 to make underwriters liable simply because they are underwriters. Section 11 extends liability to \u201cevery underwriter with respect to [a given] security,\u201d 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 77k(a)(5) (West 1981).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Section 12, on the other hand, extends liability only to one who \u201coffers or sells a security.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 <em>Til. </em>Further, a seller under \u00a7 12 is liable only to \u201cthe person purchasing such security from him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If an underwriter were a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in the sale of a security simply by virtue of an investor\u2019s reliance on the underwriter\u2019s participation in a given offering, underwriters would always be subject to liability as \u00a7 12(2) \u201csellers\u201d. The fact that Congress made every underwriter liable in \u00a7 11, but not in \u00a7 12, suggests that underwriters are not to be liable under \u00a7 12 solely by virtue of their status as underwriters.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Since \u00a7 12 does not provide for underwriter liability <em>per se, </em>an underwriter must also be a seller of the security in question to be liable under the section. This view is consistent with cases holding that where there is more than one underwriter of an issue, each underwriter may be liable under \u00a7 12 only to plaintiffs to whom it sold. <em>In re ltel Securities Litigation, </em>89 F.R.D. 104, 121 (N.D.Cal.1981); <em>see also Unicom Field, Inc. v. The Cannon Group, Inc., </em>60 F.R.D. 217, 222-23 (S.D.N.Y.1973). Presumably, other underwriters in a multiple underwriter offering might also be \u00a7 12(2) \u201csellers,\u201d but to support this result, our precedent would require that their participation be a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in the particular sale in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">The Texas Partners offering document, on which Foster relied, presented a sales arrangement contemplating more than one seller. The offering memorandum said: \u201cIn addition, other persons may receive commissions for selling Interests, including Minnick Resources Management, Inc.\u201d Pl.Ex. 1 at 4. There is no dispute that Foster actually bought his interest from Minnick. On these facts, we conclude that something more than Jesup &amp; Lamont\u2019s apparent role as underwriter must be shown to make the firm liable under \u00a7 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">Foster presented the deposition testimony of his accountant, which tended to show something more than mere underwriter status on the part of Jesup &amp; Lamont. Jordan\u2019s testimony was sufficient to prove that Curd reassured the accountant about Minnick even after Jesup &amp; Lamont had withdrawn from the offering. As noted, Curd was alleged to have said \u201cWe are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>involved in this offering document and we know of nothing that would effect [sic] our relationship with Mr. Minnick.\u201d 3 Rec. at 195. We have carefully considered the likely impact of this statement on Foster\u2019s decision to buy, and we have concluded as a matter of law that the statement does not amount to the active participation in a sale that is necessary for Jesup &amp; Lamont to be liable as a \u00a7 12 \u201cseller\u201d.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">We note that there was no direct communication between Foster and Jesup &amp; Lamont, and that the only communication between Jesup &amp; Lamont and the accountant, Jordan, was a single, casual comment concerning the firm\u2019s involvement with the offering and its continued good opinion of Minnick. The statement was not addressed directly to the merit of Texas Partners or to the critical question of whether to invest in the venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">The primary role Minnick played in the transaction further persuades us that Jesup &amp; Lamont was not a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in the sale. Minnick met with Foster in Alabama in the final days of 1980 to discuss Texas Partners at length. In this face-to-face meeting, Foster questioned Minnick about his background and about the proposed offering. While such an encounter is no substitute for an underwriter\u2019s independent investigation, the meeting in this case appears to have given Foster sufficient confidence in Minnick and in Texas Partners that he did not see a need to confer further with Jesup &amp; Lamont.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">Having concluded that the role of underwriter <em>per se </em>is not sufficient, by itself, to impose liability under \u00a7 12, we also conclude on the basis of the totality of the circumstances in this case, that the very limited additional involvement in the form of the single comment to Foster\u2019s accountant is not sufficient \u201cparticipation in the buy-sell transaction ... [to be] a substantial factor in causing the transaction to take place.\u201d <em>Pharo v. Smith, </em>621 F.2d at 667. The extensive and active involvement in bringing about the buy-sell transaction which was present in <em>Hill York </em>and <em>Junker </em>has simply not been shown on these facts. This case is more similar to <em>Croy v. Campbell, </em>in which the defendant did not attempt to persuade the plaintiff to buy, and in which the plaintiff invested his money only after meeting the developer himself and otherwise obtaining independent advice. The court in <em>Croy v. Campbell </em>decided the defendant in that case was not a \u00a7 12(2) seller, and we reach the same conclusion with respect to Jesup &amp; Lamont in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">\n<em>Other Federal Issues on Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AhL\">Jesup &amp; Lamont asks us to review three of the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. First, the district court allowed Krebs, a former Alabama securities commissioner, to testify for Foster that customarily in a private offering the underwriter is responsible for controlling the offering documents. Krebs testified further that Jesup &amp; Lamont had been reckless and had failed to comply with industry standards in its management of the Texas Partners documents. Jesup &amp; Lamont argues that this testimony was not relevant to any issue before the jury and that the testimony unfairly prejudiced its case by confusing the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-13\">We believe the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting testimony about customary duties of underwriters in private offerings. The evidence concerned the manner in which offering documents are normally controlled and thus was relevant in determining whether Jesup &amp; Lamont was a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in the sale, the federal standard, or whether Jesup &amp; Lamont \u201cmaterially aided\u201d the sale, the state standard discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-14\">Jesup &amp; Lamont also objected to the admission of Foster\u2019s testimony about reliance on Jesup &amp; Lamont\u2019s name. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>believe the testimony is relevant to whether the misrepresentation of Jesup &amp; Lamont\u2019s role was material,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and we therefore conclude that its admission was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Finally, Jesup &amp; Lamont objected to limits the district court placed on its cross-examination of Foster. Jesup &amp; Lamont sought to explore the tax motives behind Foster\u2019s investment in Texas Partners. The district court allowed Jesup &amp; Lamont to establish that one factor motivating Foster\u2019s investment decision was anticipated tax benefits. The court prevented Jesup &amp; Lamont from questioning Foster about the specific amounts he had deducted. We believe these rulings were well within the district court\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">\n<em>Certification of Determinative State Law Questions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">We turn therefore to the various state law claims against Jesup &amp; Lamont since we have concluded that the firm is not subject to liability as a \u00a7 12(2) seller under federal law. As noted, Counts I and II remained against Jesup &amp; Lamont in Foster\u2019s amended complaint, and Foster alleged violations of Alabama law in each of these counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">In Count I, Foster claimed damages for the sale of an unregistered security, which is made unlawful by \u00a7 8-6-4 of the Alabama Code,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and which is made actionable by \u00a7 8-6-19<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> (\u201cSection 19\u201d or \u201c\u00a7 19\u201d). Section 19 extends liability to one who \u201csells or offers to sell\u201d a security, and also to \u201cevery broker-dealer or agent who materially aids in the sale.\u201d Ala.Code \u00a7 8-6-19(a), (b) (West 1984). The district court instructed the jury that \u201cmaterially aided\u201d is equivalent to \u201csubstantial factor.\u201d 4 Rec. at 489. At trial, Foster objected to this instruction. Because the jury returned a verdict in favor of Foster, that objection is moot. However, with respect to the issue of exactly how much evidence is legally sufficient to support the jury verdict, Foster contends on appeal that less participation is needed to meet Alabama\u2019s \u201cmaterially aided\u201d standard than is needed to show that a defendant was a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in a sale and thus a \u201cseller\u201d under federal law. Apparently, Foster bases his argument on the language of \u00a7 19, which refers to \u201cthe nonseller who is so liable.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Unlike federal \u00a7 12, which limits liability to sellers, the Alabama provision imposes liability on a broader range of participants in securities transactions. In this respect, \u00a7 19 is similar to \u00a7 11 of the 1933 Act,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> which also lists specific participants who are subject to liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-13\">We have found no Alabama case discussing the level of participation required for secondary liability under \u00a7 19. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>this point has become determinative in the present case, we certify the following question to the Alabama Supreme Court for instruction pursuant to Ala.R.App.P. 18:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Asu\">Question One: Has a securities firm \u201cmaterially aided\u201d an unlawful sale of a security within the meaning of Alabama Code \u00a7 8-6-19(b) under the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-4\">(a) The firm\u2019s name was displayed prominently on an offering document used in connection with the sale, and the firm was presented in the document as the issue\u2019s primary best efforts underwriter, even though the firm had withdrawn from the offering;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-5\">(b) The buyer relied on the firm\u2019s participation in the offering in reaching his decision to purchase an interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-6\">(c) There is substantial evidence in the record from which we must infer that the jury found that an underwriter customarily is responsible for controlling distribution of the offering documents in a private offering;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-7\">(d) The firm\u2019s president told the buyer\u2019s accountant that the firm was \u201cinvolved\u201d in the offering document after the firm had rescinded its agreement to help sell the security;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-8\">(e) The buyer did not directly communicate with the brokerage firm in reaching his decision to invest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-9\">(f) The buyer met with the promoter of the issue to discuss the promoter\u2019s background and to discuss various business aspects of the venture before deciding to invest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-10\">(g) The buyer delivered his check to the promoter in exchange for the security.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">Count II of Foster\u2019s complaint contains two state law claims for damages based on the sale of a security by means of false written or oral communications. The first of these is grounded on Ala.Code \u00a7 8-6-19(a)(2). We believe that the disposition of this Alabama claim would be determined by the same question we have certified above with respect to Foster\u2019s state law registration claim. The viability of each of these claims depends on the Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s application of the \u201cmaterially aided\u201d standard to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-13\">Foster\u2019s other basis under state law for his Count II false communication claim is Ala.Code \u00a7 8-6-17.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The district court treated this section as affording a private right of action and concluded on the basis of an analogy to federal Rule 10b-5 actions that scienter must be shown to support recovery under the section. Jesup &amp; Lamont contends on appeal that the section does not afford a private right of action, while Foster appeals contending that an action under the section does not require scienter. We have found no Alabama case addressing either of these questions. Because they may determine Foster\u2019s right to recover if he is not successful with his other claims under Alabama law, we certify the following additional questions to the Alabama Supreme Court for instruction under Ala.R.App.P. 18:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-14\">Question Two: Does Alabama Code \u00a7 8-6-17 afford a private right of action?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-15\">Question Three: If a private cause of action is available under Alabama Code \u00a7 8-6-17: (a) is proof of scienter necessary to maintain the action? and (b) would severe recklessness meet the scienter requirement? <footnotemark>25</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>The particular phrasing used in the certified questions is not to restrict the Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s consideration of the problems involved and the issues as the Alabama Supreme Court perceives them to be in its analysis of the record certified in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">We have concluded that Jesup &amp; Lamont was not a \u201cseller\u201d of an interest in Texas Partners, and consequently we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment holding the firm liable under \u00a7 12(2) of the Securities Act of 1938, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 <em>I'll </em>(2) (West 1981). We have certified three questions of Alabama securities law to the Supreme Court of Alabama for instruction pursuant to Ala. R.App.P. 18. Accordingly, our final decision with respect to Poster\u2019s state law claims will await answer from the Alabama Supreme Court. The several other claims on appeal are without merit.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, AND QUESTIONS OF STATE LAW CERTIFIED TO THE ALABAMA SUPREME COURT.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>EXHIBIT \u201cA\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">TEXAS PARTNERS \u201980 LTD.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">Jesup &amp; Lamont Securities Co., Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">ESTABLISHED 1877</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">100 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10017</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">TELEPHONE (212) 573-6800 TELEX 233478 62890</p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">MEMBER</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE, INC.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b910-13\">. 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 77/(2) (West 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b910-14\">.

We postponed ruling on Foster\u2019s motion to dismiss appeal No. 83-7573, which was based on the ground that the judgment appealed from is not a final judgment. Foster argues that the district court\u2019s judgment of September 30, 1983, is not a final judgment because the question of attorneys\u2019 fees was not decided. <em>See, e.g., C.I.T. Corp. v.

We note, however, that the district court entered an order awarding attorneys\u2019 fees on March 16, 1984, and that both Foster and Jesup &amp; Lamont filed timely notices of appeal from that order. Given this state of the record, we conclude that the jurisdictional challenge to Jesup <em>&amp; </em>Lamont's appeal is moot, and consequently we do not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b913-14\">. 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 77/(2) (West 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b913-15\">.
