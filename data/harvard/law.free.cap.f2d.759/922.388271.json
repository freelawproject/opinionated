Specifically, we are presented with contentions pressed by certain mining companies and an electric utility that their facilities were improperly included by the Environmental Protection Agency on a nationwide list of priority sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9601 <em>et seq. </em>(1982) (\u201cCERCLA\u201d or \u201cthe Act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b995-21\">CERCLA was designed to address the growing problem of inactive hazardous waste sites throughout the United States. The Act authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) to respond to the release of both \u201chazardous substances\u201d and those \u201cpollutants or contaminants\u201d the release of which may present \u201can imminent and substantial danger to the public health or welfare,\u201d as those terms are defined in the Act. A response by EPA can be of two kinds: removal, or remedial action. Removal actions involve the actual cleanup of a release, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601(23). Remedial actions are those actions consistent with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>permanent remedy to prevent or minimize the release of hazardous substances. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 9601(24).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">To enable EPA to respond to those sites most urgently in need of cleanup, EPA is required under section 105(8)(B), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9605(8)(B), to compile the National Priorities List (\u201cNPL\u201d) of releases or threatened releases throughout the United States. The petitioners in these consolidated eases object to the placement of their respective facilities on the NPL and advance various arguments as to why the EPA\u2019s actions were purportedly in error. This opinion addresses the contentions of petitioners Eagle-Picher Industries, Inc., Homestake Mining Company, United Nuclear Corporation, Cotter Corporation, and Virginia Electric and Power Company (Vepco) that CERCLA was not intended to authorize EPA to place sites that produce mining wastes or fly ash on the NPL.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We will also address the claims by three petitioners, Homestake Mining Corporation, United Nuclear Corporation, and Cotter Corporation, that the EPA cannot lawfully place sites on the NPL that are currently regulated by their respective States pursuant to agreements with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we deny the petitions for review as to the specific contentions addressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">Petitioners first claim that mining wastes and fly ash are not \u201chazardous substances\u201d within the meaning of CERCLA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The pivotal term, \u201chazardous substance,\u201d is defined rather elaborately in section 101(14) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601(14):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Af4\">\u201c[Hazardous substance\u201d means (A) any substance designated pursuant to section 1321(b)(2)(A) of title 33, (B) any element, compound, mixture, solution, or substance designated pursuant to section 9602 of this title, (C) any hazardous waste having the characteristics identified under or listed pursuant to section 3001 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act [42 U.S.C. 6921] (but not including any waste the regulation of which under the Solid Waste Disposal Act [42 U.S.C. 6901 <em>et </em>seq.] has been suspended by Act of Congress), (D) any toxic pollutant listed under section 1317(a) of title 33, (E) any hazardous air pollutant listed under section 112 of the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7412], and (F) any imminently hazardous chemical substance or mixture with respect to which the Administrator has taken action pursuant to section 2606 of title 15. The term does not include petroleum, including crude oil or any fraction thereof which is not otherwise specifically listed or designated as a hazardous substance under subparagraphs (A) through (F) of this paragraph, and the term does not include natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas, or synthetic gas usable for fuel (or mixtures of natural gas and such synthetic gas)....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-12\">Petitioners ground their claim on the parenthetical clause found in subclause (C) of this complex provision, which expressly re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>fers for its definitional purposes to several other federal statutes. That parenthetical clause applies by its terms to petitioners, inasmuch as both mining wastes and fly ash have been suspended from regulation under the Solid Waste Disposal Act (which includes the subsequently passed statute known as \u201cRCRA\u201d). <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6921(3)(A)(i), 6921(3)(A)(ii) (1982). From this exclusion, petitioners draw the conclusion that mining wastes and fly ash are thus excluded as well from CERCLA\u2019s definition of \u201chazardous substances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">Notwithstanding its superficial appeal, petitioners\u2019 argument suffers from a mortal flaw, namely that their interpretation does not comport with the plain meaning of the entire statutory provision. As EPA notes,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a substance is a \u201chazardous substance\u201d within the meaning of CERCLA if it qualifies under <em>any </em>of the several subparagraphs of section 101(14). The exception for mining wastes and fly ash is found only in a parenthetical clause in sub-paragraph (C). The ordinary, straightforward reading of that exception is that it applies only to subparagraph (C), not to any of the other five subparagraphs. Had Congress intended to exempt mining wastes and fly ash from the entirety of section 101(14), it obviously could have placed the exemption at the beginning or end of the section, not in one of the several subparagraphs. Indeed, this is precisely what Congress did do with respect to other specific substances. At the conclusion of section 101(14), a <em>general exception </em>from the definition of \u201chazardous substance\u201d is carved out for petroleum and natural gas products. Had Congress intended to create a similarly broad exception for mining wastes and fly ash, the Legislature readily could have placed that exception alongside the petroleum and natural gas exceptions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-14\">Petitioners argue that such an interpretation must be rejected for two reasons: <em>first, </em>that the interpretation would render meaningless the exception in subparagraph (C), and <em>second, </em>that the legislative history of CERCLA clearly shows that the subparagraph (C) exception was meant to exempt totally such wastes from the term \u201chazardous substance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b997-15\">As to the first argument, petitioners observe that EPA labels as \u201chazardous substances\u201d the mining wastes and fly ash produced by petitioners because those wastes contain substances, such as arsenic, cadmium, and selenium, which are regulated under one or more of the several environmental statutes referred to in section 101(14).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Petitioners claim that virtually all mining wastes and fly ash contain at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>least trace amounts of substances that qualify as \u201chazardous substances\u201d under one of section 101(14)\u2019s subparagraphs. Thus, they argue, EPA\u2019s interpretation would render all or virtually all mining wastes and fly ash CERCLA-covered \u201chazardous substances,\u201d with the effect of denuding the exception in subparagraph (C) of any efficacy whatsoever. Since, petitioners argue, courts should under settled principles reject a proffered statutory interpretation which renders any part of the statute meaningless where a reasonable alternative interpretation exists, we should be constrained to embrace their proposed construction which breathes life into all of CERCLA\u2019s definitional provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">Unfortunately for petitioners, they have cited nothing in CERCLA, its legislative history, or the record in this case demonstrating that all or virtually all mining wastes and fly ash have constituents which are \u201chazardous substances.\u201d We have nothing more than petitioners\u2019 bare assertions on this point. Likewise, petitioners have presented nothing demonstrating that Congress was of the view that all or almost all mining wastes and fly ash contain hazardous substances.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is quite possible that Congress was unconvinced that enough was known about mining wastes and fly ash for EPA to decide that those substances, as a general rule, posed a threat to the environment, but at the same time Congress may have been willing to bring any mining wastes and fly ash found to contain \u201chazardous substances\u201d within the ambit of section 101(14). Without a showing that Congress believed that the regulation of mining wastes and fly ash under other subparagraphs of section 101(14) would render the exception in sub-paragraph (C) meaningless, we are disinclined to reject the plain meaning of section 101(14).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">Petitioners\u2019 second argument relies most heavily upon a single sentence extracted from the Senate Report on S. 1480, the Senate version of CERCLA. That Report is particularly pertinent because the definition of \u201chazardous substance\u201d originated in the Senate bill. The Senate Report discussed specifically what substances would be \u201chazardous substances\u201d under what was destined to become the critical provision for our case, section 101(14) of CERCLA. In its discussion of subparagraph (C), the Report stated: \u201cIt should be noted that any substance or material for which regulation is specifically suspended by Act of Congress under the Solid Waste Disposal Act is excluded from designation as a hazardous substance for the purpose of S. 1480, notwithstanding the presence in such substance of any hazardous or toxic chemical.\u201d S.Rep. No. 848, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 28 (1980). Petitioners argue that this sentence clearly demonstrates that the Senate, which placed the exception in subparagraph (C), intended, the exception completely to exempt mining wastes and fly ash from CERCLA\u2019s coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-10\">It is beyond reasonable debate that the language of the Senate Report is clear, and that the import of that language is that the exception set forth in subparagraph (C) extends, as it were, throughout all of section 101(14). But, as we noted above, the language of section 101(14) is itself quite clear and, in our view, indicates that the exclusionary exception should be limited to sub-paragraph (C). Each side to this dispute has earnestly attempted to demonstrate that the language purportedly supportive of the other side\u2019s position is, upon analysis, ambiguous. EPA claims that since the sentence in the Senate Report is found in the context of a discussion of subparagraph (C), the sentence \u201cspeaks only to the question whether mining wastes (and other \u2018suspended\u2019 wastes) are CERCLA \u2018hazardous substances\u2019 <em>because they are regulated under RCRA.\u201d </em>EPA Brief at 73 (em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>phasis in original).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Petitioners argue, in contrast, that the placement of the exception in subparagraph (C), rather than alongside the general exception, is \u201cimmaterial.\u201d Joint Brief for Petitioners at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">We can accept neither side\u2019s argument as carrying the day. Although the sentence in the Senate Report is indeed located in the discussion of subparagraph (C), as EPA emphasizes, the sentence nonetheless unambiguously states, as petitioners emphasize, that any suspended substance \u201cis excluded from designation as a hazardous substance for the purpose of S.1480.\u201d S.1480 was the entire proposed bill, not just subparagraph (C). On the other hand, we cannot dismiss the placement of the exception as utterly irrelevant. If a rational draftsman had indeed intended that the exception encompass all of section 101(14), he or she would presumably have placed that exception at the end of the section, along with the petroleum and natural gas exceptions. The draftsman would not, in the face of general exceptions, have relegated a purported general exception to the odd location of a parenthetical provision in a solitary subclause.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-11\">We thus are faced with a conflict between the language and structure of the statute, on the one hand, and one portion of its legislative history on the other. It is clear to us that when such a conflict exists, the statute must control. It was, after all, section 101(14) that was enacted by Congress and became law. If there were very clear legislative history indicating that Congress had an intent contrary to that expressed in the statute,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>and </em>particularly if application of the language would lead to an irrational result that Congress could not have intended, courts might well be justified in departing from the clear language and structure of the statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But as we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>demonstrated above,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> both the language and carefully crafted structure of section 101(14) do not render any part of CERCLA meaningless, nor does the resulting construction lead to an unreasonable result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">Finally, even if we did not feel compelled to adopt the plain meaning of section 101(14), we would have to reach the same result, because in this situation, we are not persuaded that the legislative history evidences Congress\u2019 clear intent. The best case to be made for petitioners, upon analysis, is that when one examines the statute and the specific part of the legislative history upon which they rely, it becomes unclear as to what Congress\u2019 intent actually was. However, when Congress\u2019 intent is unclear, settled principles of law require us to determine whether EPA\u2019s interpretation is sufficiently reasonable for us to accept that interpretation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">Our discussion of section 101(14), <em>supra, </em>demonstrates to our satisfaction that EPA\u2019s interpretation is eminently reasonable. Indeed, it would be impossible to call EPA\u2019s interpretation unreasonable when the plain, straightforward meaning of section 101(14) is that the exemption in subparagraph (C) applies to that subparagraph, and when that plain meaning does not lead to an irrational result. Therefore, based upon the clear language of section 101(14), we conclude that the exception set forth in section 101(14)(C) does not prevent a substance from being labelled a \u201chazardous substance\u201d if it falls within another subparagraph of section 101(14).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">Petitioners, however, do not end their argument there. To the contrary, they claim that EPA has no authority under CERCLA to classify certain wastes as \u201chazardous substances\u201d merely because one or more of their constituent elements fall within one or more of the subparagraphs of section 101(14). Petitioners argue that mining wastes and fly ash must be <em>specifically </em>listed under one or more of the subparagraphs if they are properly to be deemed \u201chazardous substances\u201d under the statute. If it were otherwise, they claim, virtually all mining wastes and fly ash would constitute \u201chazardous substances,\u201d because, in their view, virtually all contain at least trace amounts of \u201chazardous substances\u201d; and the result, petitioners contend, would then be that the exclusion in subparagraph (C) would be rendered meaningless. However, as we previously stated,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> petitioners have failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>to cite any evidence in the legislative and administrative records that would allow us to conclude that virtually all mining wastes and fly ash would, under EPA\u2019s approach, fall within section 101(14), or that this result would violate Congress\u2019 intent. Accordingly, EPA was, in our view, acting fully within its power when it construed as \u201chazardous substances\u201d mining wastes and fly ash produced by the petitioners in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">Our definitional inquiry does not end, however, with ascertaining the meaning of \u201chazardous substance\u201d under CERCLA. For even if petitioners were to prevail on this branch of their argument, the further question would still be presented whether EPA could properly classify petitioners\u2019 mining wastes and fly ash as \u201cpollutants or contaminants,\u201d and thereby render them eligible for inclusion on the NPL on that basis. Under section 105 of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9605, EPA is required to compile the NPL as a priority list of releases or threatened releases of \u201chazardous substances\u201d <em>or </em>\u201cpollutants or contaminants.\u201d A \u201cpollutant or contaminant\u201d is broadly defined in section 104(a)(2), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9604(a)(2); the term refers to, basically, any substance which may reasonably be anticipated to cause harm to the environment.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> EPA is authorized to respond to the release or threatened release into the environment of a \u201cpollutant or contaminant\u201d that may present \u201can imminent and substantial danger to the public health or welfare,\u201d under section 104(a)(1), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9604(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-8\">In its response to petitioners\u2019 comments in the rulemaking proceeding with respect to CERCLA\u2019s definitional reach, EPA stated that, while it was convinced that mining wastes constituted \u201chazardous substances\u201d under the statute, the agency was even more persuaded that such wastes were \u201cpollutants or contaminants\u201d \u2014 a conclusion which would independently render mining sites eligible for inclusion on the NPL. 48 Fed.Reg. 40658, 40663 (1983). Unconvinced by EPA\u2019s reasoning, the mining waste petitioners maintain here that Congress intended entirely to exempt mining wastes from regulation under CERCLA through the exception contained in section 101(14). Arguing from this premise, petitioners urge that it would be illogical to conclude that Congress intended to allow this exception to be nullified by the \u201cpollutant or contaminant\u201d provision, which is designed to cover dangerous substances that have not been captured by the \u201chazardous substance\u201d provision.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In essence, the mining waste petitioners fashion a variation of their recurring theme that EPA\u2019s interpretation would render meaningless the exception created by section 101(14)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-9\">We have already concluded that the section 101(14)(C) exception applies only to that subparagraph, not to the other five subparagraphs; in consequence, the mining petitioners\u2019 argument obviously must fail here as well. Even assuming <em>arguendo, </em>however, that section 101(14)(C) totally ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>empted mining wastes from the coverage of \u201chazardous substances,\u201d we would not be persuaded that mining wastes cannot constitute \u201cpollutants or contaminants.\u201d First, different consequences flow if a substance constitutes a \u201chazardous substance,\u201d as opposed to a \u201cpollutant or contaminant.\u201d Under section 107, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607, the owner of a facility may be liable for cleanup of a release of a \u201chazardous substance,\u201d but not for the cleanup of a release of a \u201cpollutant or contaminant.\u201d Thus, it would in no wise be meaningless for a substance to be exempted from the former classification and yet fit within the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Second, at the conclusion of the \u201cpollutant or contaminant\u201d definition set forth in section 104(a)(2), we find a familiar exclusion \u2014 for petroleum products \u2014 which is highly similar to the general exception set forth at the conclusion of the \u201chazardous substance\u201d definition found, here as we have already seen, in section 101(14). If Congress were indeed of the view advanced by petitioners, namely that an exception in section 101(14) also exempted substances from the reach of section 104(a)(2), then surely it would have discerned no need tediously to set forth yet again a petroleum exception at the end of section 104(a)(2). To the contrary, the petroleum exception, under this view, would have been mere surplusage. We thus are constrained to conclude that a substance must be explicitly excluded from section 104(a)(2) in order to be exempted from the definition of \u201cpollutant or contaminant.\u201d Inasmuch as no such exception for mining wastes is set forth, mining wastes can, in our view, indeed constitute \u201cpollutants or contaminants\u201d and thus trigger potential inclusion on the NPL.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">Moving to a second line of attack, the mining petitioners and Vepco argue that even if their wastes are \u201cpollutants or contaminants,\u201d EPA cannot place their facilities on the NPL unless the agency first determines that their respective sites could, under reasonably foreseeable circumstances, present \u201can imminent and substantial danger\u201d to the public health and welfare. Petitioners\u2019 argument is premised on the fact that EPA is statutorily authorized under CERCLA to respond to a release or threatened release of a \u201cpollutant or contaminant\u201d only if the agency determines that the release may present \u201can imminent and substantial danger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">EPA is unmoved by this analysis. The agency suggests that all that may be needed to justify inclusion of a site on the NPL is \u201csome minimum degree of confidence that the site may someday be eligible for Fund-financed remedial action.\u201d EPA Brief at 85. The agency points out that the NPL is not in itself remedial action \u2014 inclusion on the NPL requires no cleanup nor any other action by site owners.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Instead, the NPL is simply a rough list of priorities, assembled quickly and inexpensively to comply with Congress\u2019 mandate for the agency to take action straightaway. Utilizing the NPL, EPA will thereafter perform in-depth examinations of each site on the list to determine whether remedial action is necessary. If EPA determines at that later stage that the release of a \u201cpollutant or contaminant\u201d at a particular site does not present \u201can imminent and substantial danger,\u201d then no remedial action will be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">We find these arguments persuasive. The NPL is simply the first step in a process \u2014 nothing more, nothing less. EPA\u2019s position is strengthened, moreover, by the fact that section 105 of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9605, in requiring the President to fashion the national hazardous substance response plan (of which the NPL is a part), makes no mention whatever of \u201cimminent and substantial danger\u201d; instead, it provides that the President \u201cshall establish procedures and standards for responding to releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9605 (1982). This omission strongly sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>gests that the element of \u201cimminent and substantial danger\u201d is not requisite to the threshold agency action of including a particular facility on the NPL.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Vepco, however, observes that section 105(8)(A) of CERCLA mandates that there be developed \u201ccriteria for determining priorities among releases or threatened releases throughout the United States for the purpose of taking remedial action.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9605(8)(A) (1982). Once such criteria are developed, the utility continues, section 105(8)(B) then requires these criteria to be employed in assembling the NPL. Vepco argues that since the criteria for the list must be for the purpose of taking \u201cremedial action,\u201d and since such action with respect to \u201cpollutants or contaminants\u201d can be taken only if there is a determination that the release presents an \u201cimminent and substantial danger,\u201d EPA must therefore be persuaded that a reasonable possibility exists that such a determination will be made before a site can properly be placed on the NPL.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">Upon analysis, we are unconvinced that the words \u201cremedial action\u201d found in section 105(8)(A) can carry the day for Vepco and its co-petitioners. Admittedly, the NPL is assembled by EPA with an eye toward future remedial action; nonetheless, we must keep firmly in mind the modest and limited purposes of the list. In our view, it is well within EPA\u2019s discretion to decide that, for a determination of \u201cimminent and substantial danger\u201d at a site to have any degree of reliability, that assessment would have to be based upon a more detailed, complex and thus rather expensive study all out of proportion to the limited, threshold-like goals of the NPL. It is, in our judgment, entirely reasonable for EPA to decide to await the results of in-depth examinations of specific sites before making a determination of \u201cimminent and substantial danger.\u201d Thus, EPA could properly list petitioners\u2019 sites on the simple basis of those sites\u2019 containing \u201cpollutants or contaminants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">Three petitioners, United Nuclear Corporation, Homestake Mining Company, and Cotter Corporation, own uranium mill tailing facilities; these petitioners champion an argument distinct from those of their fellow petitioners. Specifically, the uranium company petitioners object to EPA\u2019s listing facilities regulated by States pursuant to those States\u2019 agreements with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (\u201cNRC\u201d), while at the same time excluding from regulation facilities directly regulated by the NRC under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2011 <em>et seq. </em>(1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-10\">We pause to observe a few fundamental facts about the pertinent powers of the NRC. The NRC enjoys plenary authority to require cleanup of inactive uranium mill sites that it licenses. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2022 (1982) . The NRC does not, however, license all such sites; instead, the NRC has authority to enter into agreements with individual States whereby those States license the sites within their respective jurisdictions. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2021. Employing the nomenclature used by the parties, we will refer to States which execute such agreements as \u201cAgreement States.\u201d In its final promulgation of the NPL, EPA determined that sites licensed by the NRC should not be included on the NPL, because as we have just seen, \u201cthe NRC has full authority to require cleanup of releases from such facilities.\u201d 48 Fed.Reg. 40658, 40661 (1983) . But with regard to sites regulated by Agreement States, EPA arrived at a contrary decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-13\">When a facility is licensed by a State pursuant to an NRC delegation, the NRC has no authority, short of withdrawing the delegation itself, to enforce conditions of the license or determine that new conditions are necessary. EPA recognizes that the licensing State may be able to ensure cleanup of any release through the license, but has decided to list such sites on the NPL to provide potential Federal authorities if necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 40662.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-15\">The uranium-company petitioners interpose three objections to EPA\u2019s determination in this respect. First, they claim that EPA has no authority under CERCLA to place on the NPL any facility regulated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>either by the NRC or an Agreement State. Petitioners argue that CERCLA is designed to regulate only those sites that truly need response action by EPA, and that sites adequately regulated by the NRC or Agreement States cannot rationally be considered high priority candidates for CERCLA funds and response actions.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Joint Reply Brief of Petitioners at 25-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">This argument is singularly unpersuasive. Congress specifically limited EPA\u2019s power under CERCLA to regulate certain radioactive releases. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601(22)(C).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Congress did not, however, choose specifically to exclude sites such as petitioners\u2019, nor did Congress place any other limitation on EPA\u2019s power to list sites regulated by other, nonfederal governmental entities. Except for specific limitations, EPA enjoys the power to list <em>any </em>site where there is a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance, pollutant or contaminant. We find nothing in CERCLA limiting EPA\u2019s authority to regulate mill tailings facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">Petitioners\u2019 second argument fares no better. They contend that EPA came forward with no rational explanation for its decision to exclude NRC-regulated facilities from the NPL, while at the same time including facilities regulated by Agreement States. Petitioners argue that NRC is not limited to withdrawing its entire delegation of authority to an Agreement State before it can respond, as EPA claims; instead, petitioners assert, the NRC is vested with power under sections 274(j)(l) and 274(j)(2) of the Atomic Energy Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2021(j)(l), 2021(j)(2), to suspend all or part of a State\u2019s delegated authority and take over regulation of a site.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-10\">However, we do not read EPA\u2019s admittedly brief statement so strictly as to mean that NRC had to withdraw its entire delegation of authority to a State before the NRC could act. The fact is that the NRC must withdraw at least some of its delegation of authority before it can directly regulate an Agreement State facility. In our view, it was reasonable for EPA to decide that the NRC would encounter greater difficulty in withdrawing a delegation of authority and directly responding than would EPA in responding under CERCLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-11\">In its filings in this court, EPA more elaborately observes that the NRC cannot, in the case of an Agreement State site, always immediately take over regulation of that facility if state regulation is proving inadequate. In the event of an emergency, EPA maintains, the NRC can temporarily suspend its agreement with the State and take over regulation. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2021(j)(2). But in a non-emergency, the NRC can exercise such authority only after notice and hearing. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2021(j)(l). EPA argues that this procedure would be time-consuming and would thus delay initiation of remedial action. The back-up authority enjoyed by EPA under CERCLA would, in contrast, allow the federal government to act immediately, without the extreme step of revoking the agreement between a State and the NRC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>Petitioners reply that EPA\u2019s latter-day explanation is entirely <em>post-hoe </em>and therefore will not do. They claim that EPA never articulated the non-emergency rationale until it was expounded in its brief. We disagree. This reasoning is readily deducible from EPA\u2019s statement set forth in the Federal Register. Although the NPL is designed to establish priorities for the removal of hazardous substances, as well as priorities for remedial action (actions consistent with a permanent remedy), <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9605(8)(A), 9605(8)(B), EPA has limited its discretion so that it can bring remedial actions only with respect to facilities identified on the NPL. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.68 (1984). No such limitation obtains as to removal actions. If there were an emergency situation at a uranium mill tailings site, and immediate removal were required, EPA could take such action, regardless of whether the site was found on the NPL. <em>See </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.65. Thus, we can properly assume that when EPA spoke of a need for placing a site on the NPL in order to provide federal back-up authority, the agency was necessarily referring to the authority to provide long-range, remedial actions for non-emergencies, since placement on the NPL is of little relevance to emergency action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">Petitioners also argue that EPA\u2019s rationale is inconsistent. If a situation is a non-emergency, they argue, then no immediate action is necessary, and the fact that the NRC will have to engage in notice and hearing procedures before it can act directly is irrelevant to the ultimate issue whether the public and environment are protected. Petitioners also complain that EPA has presented no data to show that the NRC has been unable in the past to insure adequate responses or that it will encounter delays in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">In response to petitioners\u2019 initial point, we simply observe the obvious \u2014 the fact that a situation does not constitute an emergency by no means suggests that rapid response is not desirable. As for the latter argument, we do not believe EPA is obliged to come forward with evidence that the NRC cannot effectively respond to a particular kind of situation. EPA has drawn a perfectly reasonable inference that if notice, hearing, and a withdrawal of delegated authority are necessary before the NRC can act, then it is entirely possible that federal action in such instances could be delayed and that any such delay needlessly could result in environmental damage. We can discern nothing inappropriate in EPA\u2019s deciding to be ready to act just in case such a delay occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">Finally, petitioners argue that no federal back-up is needed for the simple reason that the Agreement States are fully capable of protecting the environment. EPA\u2019s view, they claim, is \u201cin direct conflict with the purposes of the Atomic Energy Act to strengthen and preserve state authority\u201d and reflects \u201ca cynical distrust of the capability or intention of agreement state licensing authorities to address adequately concerns of public health that may arise from the facilities they license.\u201d Joint Brief for Petitioners at 50. We are unable to agree that EPA's readiness to step in just in case Agreement States have difficulty in effecting cleanup is destructive of federalism concerns embodied in the Atomic Energy Act. Indeed, the only Agreement State to intervene in this action\u2014 New Mexico \u2014 has strenuously argued that EPA\u2019s authority to list sites in Agreement States must be upheld. If the Agreement States themselves have no federalism-grounded objection, we are hard pressed to find one.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petitions for review, as to the issues addressed herein, are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b996-7\">.

Within this circuit, the articulation of these themes has varied. In <em>Wilderness Society v. Morton, </em>479 F.2d 842, 855 (D.C.Cir.) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 917, 93 S.Ct. 1550, 36 L.Ed.2d 309 (1973), for example, we stated that</p>\n<p id=\"b999-13\">[o]n occasion we have paid lip service to the rule that where the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous on its face it cannot be controverted by seeking to show inconsistent legislative intent, but we have also faced up to the reality that \"the 'plain meaning\u2019 doctrine has always been subservient to a truly discernible legislative purpose however discerned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b999-14\">(citations omitted). But on further analysis, it is clear that we were not engaging there in what some might perceive as the fashion of the day, namely a quick nod toward the statute before examining the presumptively more enlightening and edifying history of the measure as it wended its way through the process of passage. Rather, we looked in that case beyond the plain language of the statute because it was claimed that the statute\u2019s plain meaning led to an irrational result \u2014 the statute in that case was designed to allow oil companies to build pipelines, but as it turned out, the 25-feet right-of-way that Congress allowed was too small, and thus no large diameter pipelines could be built. Given this context, the rule of <em>Wilderness Society </em>is simply reflective of the sound teaching of <em>Elm City Broadcasting, supra. </em>This, in fact, is precisely the way in which <em>Wilderness Society </em>was subsequently interpreted in <em>Aviation Consumer Action Project, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b999-15\">Other cases, however, employ language so broad as to suggest that legislative history must always be examined, regardless of the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>of the statute. <em>See, e.g., Portland Cement Ass\u2019n v.

Oregon, supra, </em>that resort is not to be made to the legislative history when the statute is clear and fidelity to the plain language does not lead to an irrational result. The statute is, after all, the only measure which is laid before all members of Congress; and the statute is the only true indicator of what the members, collectively, believed the statute said. We must also keep in mind, in this respect, the oft-forgotten, bedrock fact that the President has an indispensable role to play under the Constitution: \"lawmaking [is] a power to be shared by both Houses and the President.\u201d <em>INS v. Chadha, </em>462 U.S. 919, 103 S.Ct. 2764, 2782, 77 L.Ed.2d 317 (1983).
