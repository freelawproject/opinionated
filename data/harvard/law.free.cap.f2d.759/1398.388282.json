We reverse because we conclude that the Secretary must make a final determination within 120 days of receiving an audit alleging violations of CETA. Since the Secretary lacked the authority to make a final determination after 1-20 days from the date of the filing of the audit, we do not reach the merits of Pierce County\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-20\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-21\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-22\">In Case No. 81-CETA-A-88, the Department of Labor Office of Special Investigations (OSI) filed an audit on September 19, 1978, concerning the rehiring of eight CETA public service officers under the Pierce County Public Service program with the Department of Labor grant officer who acts under the authority of the Secretary. The final determination was issued by the grant officer on February 13, 1981, approximately 29 months after the grant officer received the OSI audit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-23\">A formal hearing was conducted on March 10, 1982. The ALJ determined that $108,636 should be disallowed as wages and fringe benefits paid to ineligible participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-24\">In Case No. 81-CETA-A-120 an audit, conducted by the Department of Labor Office of Inspector General (OIG) was received by the grant officer on December 11, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-25\">Nineteen months later, the grant officer made an initial determination. Pierce County then requested an extension to engage in an informal resolution of the matter. A corrected final determination was issued by the grant officer on May 22, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1400\">*1400</page-number>1981, approximately twenty-nine months after receipt of the audit. On April 5, 1983, the AU issued an order disallowing $264,947 and allowing $108,103 in costs. The Secretary adopted both decisions of the AU.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-4\">Pierce County argues that, under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 816(b), the Secretary lacked the authority to order repayment of funds because that statute mandates issuance of a final determination within 120 days from the date the grant officer receives an audit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have recently resolved a similar dispute concerning the interpretation of section 816(b) in <em>City of Edmonds v. Department of Labor, </em>749 F.2d 1419 (9th Cir.1984). In <em>City of Edmonds </em>we held that by enacting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 816(b), Congress intended to preclude any action on an allegation when a final determination is not made within 120 days from receipt of a complaint from an interested citizen or organization. We reversed the decision of the Secretary requiring the City to repay CETA funds because the final determination was issued more than seven months after the period prescribed by the statute for the making of a final determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-5\">It is undisputed in the instant matter that the Secretary failed to make a final determination in each case within 120 days of receiving the audit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-6\">The only pertinent distinction between these matters and the procedural posture of <em>City of Edmonds </em>is that here the investigations were initiated by audits. In <em>City of Edmonds, </em>the investigation resulted from a complaint from an interested person. At oral argument, counsel for the Secretary argued that the 120 day time limitation was not applicable to an investigation triggered by an audit. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-9\">Section 816(b) provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-12\">Whenever the Secretary receives a complaint from an interested person or organization ... or whenever the Secretary has reason to believe (because of an audit, report, on-site review or otherwise) that a recipient of financial assistance under this Act is failing to comply with the requirements of this Act, or the terms of the comprehensive employment and training plan, the Secretary shall investigate the matter. The Secretary shall conduct such investigation and make the final determination ... not later than 120 days after receiving the complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1462-13\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 816(b). It is clear to us, from the plain meaning of the words used in the statute, that Congress intended to compel the Secretary to complete his investigations and make his final determination within 120 days after receiving a complaint from an interested person or organization, or an audit or report which gives him reason to believe that a recipient has received funds in violation of CETA. We are satisfied that in stating that a final determination must be made \u201cnot later than 120 days after receiving the complaint,\u201d Congress did not intend to limit the word \u201ccomplaint\u201d to a formal accusatory pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-14\">The first sentence of section 816(b) makes it clear that Congress intended that the Secretary conduct an investigation upon receipt of a formal or informal report that a recipient of CETA funds has failed to comply with the statute. In <em>Lehigh Valley Manpower Program v. Donovan, </em>718 F.2d 99 (3d Cir.1983), the court interpreted section 816(b) as requiring the Secretary to \u201cissue a final determination with 120 days <em>after becoming aware of a possible violation.\u201d Lehigh Valley Manpower Program v. Donovan, </em>718 F.2d 99, 101 (3d Cir.1983) (emphasis added). We agree with the Third Circuit that the triggering event which starts the 120 investigation period is the awareness by the Secretary of an alleged violation by means of a citizen\u2019s com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1401\">*1401</page-number>plaint, audit, report, on-site review \u201cor otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-4\">Our interpretation of the word complaint is also supported by one of the denotations of the word \u201ccomplaint\u201d and the Secretary\u2019s own regulations. The definitions attributed to the word \u201ccomplaint\u201d include \u201csomething that is the cause or subject of protest or outcry\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary </em>288 (8th ed. 1979). A Department of Labor audit critical of a CETA fund recipient is as much the \u201csubject of protest\u201d as a verbal report of wrong doing made by an interested citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-5\">Further, we note that the Secretary promulgated a regulation to implement the authority conferred by Congress in the 1978 amendments to CETA on April 3, 1979, which supports this interpretation of the statute. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 676.88(e). That regulation, which became effective April 3, 1979, states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1463-6\">(e) <em>Final determination </em>... <em>the Grant Officer shall not later than 120-days after the filing of a complaint (or receipt of a final audit or investigation report in the absence of a complaint), </em>provide each party with a final written notice ... that ... lists any sanctions, and required corrective actions ... The Grant Officer shall also mail a copy of his final determinations to any parties in interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1463-7\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 676.88(e) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-8\">It is well settled that we are required to accord \u201cgreat deference to the interpretation given the statute by the officers or agency charged with its administration.\u201d <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1,16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965); <em>Kunaknana v. Clark, </em>742 F.2d 1145, 1150 (9th Cir.1984) (agency interpretations of a statute are entitled to great deference).</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-9\">In addition, the Secretary issued a guidance manual in 1981 which provides that \u201cThe final determination must be issued by the Grant Officer 120 days from the day the final audit report is received.\u201d \u201cGuide to Audit Resolution and Debt Collection for Prime Sponsors,\u201d <em>E.T. Handbook </em>No. 388 at 30, \u00a7 C, (1981). This deadline was characterized as \u201cnot flexible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-11\">We are also mindful of the fact that in response to this court\u2019s request for supplemental briefing on the impact of the <em>City of Edmonds </em>decision on the power of the Secretary to act on these matters, counsel for the United States Department of Labor, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1463-12\">The Department did not ignore its responsibility to issue a final determination within 120 days of its receipt of an allegation of impropriety in the instant case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAf\">We agree with this characterization of the word \u201ccomplaint\u201d as used by Congress in section 816(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-13\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-14\">In both matters before this court, the Secretary failed to make a final determination within 120 days after receiving an audit containing allegations of impropriety. The delay requested by Pierce County in Case No. 81-CETA-A-120 did not occur until months after the 120 day period had expired. Because the Secretary had no authority to make a final determination due to the lapse of the mandatory time limit, the decision of the Secretary is REVERSED in each matter.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1461-16\">.
