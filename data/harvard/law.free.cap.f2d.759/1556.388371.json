We reverse and remand, holding that under <em>Glover v. Alabama Dept. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1557\">*1557</page-number><em>Corrections, </em>734 F.2d 691 (11th Cir.1984), such fees can be assessed against the State where the State\u2019s interests have been adequately represented at each stage of the proceedings, provided the governmental entity is joined for the purpose of the attorney\u2019s fees determination before it is held liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-5\">In July of 1979 James Leggett, a prisoner in the Florida State Prison, along with another inmate, was found in an unauthorized wing of the prison. After escorting the inmates to a holding cell, correction officer Frederick L. Badger was instructed by his commanding officer to take the prisoners to administrative confinement pending a disciplinary report. On the way to administrative confinement, and while Leggett was held by two other officers, Officer Badger hit, then kicked him in the face while attempting to obtain information from him regarding his possible intoxication from \u201cBuck\u201d, a home-made wine. Leggett brought this 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 action against Badger in his official and individual capacity and against Louie L. Wainwright, Secretary of the Florida Department of Corrections, and Clayton G. Strickland, Superintendent of the Florida State Prison. Leggett maintains that he was suing Badger in his official capacity. That issue was never litigated or compromised by the parties. <em>See Pennhurst State School &amp; Hospital v. Halderman, </em>465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984) (state official cannot be sued in his official capacity for damages). The record clearly shows that attorney\u2019s fees were incurred in an effort to recover damages under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-6\">A jury awarded $1,500 in compensatory damages and $25,000 in punitive damages against Badger in his individual capacity. After additional litigation concerning Leggett\u2019s claim for injunctive relief, to require \u201cuse of force\u201d training for corrections officers, the parties filed a joint status report. Leggett acknowledged the new \u201cuse of force\u201d training procedures as being an improvement over past procedures as well as being reasonable. On the only remaining issue of attorney\u2019s fees the district court held, after an evidentiary hearing, there was no causal connection between this action and the new procedures regarding the use of force by corrections officers, which, if established, would have provided a basis for a larger fees award. Further, the court held that under Fla.Stat. \u00a7 284.38, providing for the Florida Casualty Insurance Risk Management Trust Fund, there is no state authorization to pay attorney\u2019s fees where the officer, employee, or agent has been determined to have caused the harm intentionally. Badger was held liable individually for the $21,250 in attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-8\">Leggett contends on appeal that (1) Badger\u2019s liability in his individual capacity does not preclude an award of attorney\u2019s fees against the State or its agencies; (2) there was sufficient causal connection between this suit and the newly instituted \u201cuse of force\u201d training initiated by the Florida Department of Corrections to award attorney\u2019s fees against the State, and (3) the absence of a fee award against the State would deter similarily situated plaintiffs from seeking enforcement of constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-9\">Pursuant to the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1988, federal courts may award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to prevailing parties in suits under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Hutto v. Finney, </em>437 U.S. 678, 693, 98 S.Ct. 2565, 2574, 57 L.Ed.2d 522 (1978); <em>Fields v. City of Tarpon Springs, Fla., </em>721 F.2d 318, 321 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-10\">In <em>Glover v. Alabama Dept. of Corrections, </em>734 F.2d 691 (11th Cir.1984), this Court followed controlling precedent from the former Fifth Circuit in holding that \u201cattorney\u2019s fees may be awarded against a governmental entity even though the entity is immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment or is not a named defendant in the \u00a7 1983 action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 965. <em>See also Odum v. Clark, </em>748 F.2d 1538, 1542 (11th Cir.1984). The <em>Glover </em>court held that the fact that damages are awarded against a defendant \u201cin [an] individual capacity only does not preclude the assessment of attorney\u2019s fees against the state.\u201d 734 F.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1558\">*1558</page-number>695. Although the former Fifth Circuit held that governmental entities do not have to be joined to be liable for attorney\u2019s fees, <em>Glover </em>changed that rule for this Circuit. There, this Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1620-4\">In order to avoid future controversy over the potential unfairness of assessing attorney\u2019s fees against a governmental entity not a party to a \u00a7 1983 suit, and over the potential conflict of interest between the Government and the public official held liable under \u00a7 1983, we hold that, even if otherwise immune, the governmental entity must be joined in the suit for purposes of the attorney\u2019s fees determination before it may be held liable for attorney\u2019s fees ... we hold that this policy shall be applied as the rule of this Circuit to all cases filed after the date of this opinion. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1620-5\">Accordingly, we reverse and remand this case for joinder of the governmental entity for the purposes of the attorney\u2019s fees determination, and consideration in light of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Glover. </em>In the instant case, the Attorney General has represented this defendant officially throughout these proceedings and before this Court on appeal, except for Badger\u2019s appeal from the damages award, so there would seem to be no need for an additional evidentiary hearing on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees. The district court\u2019s finding that there was no causal connection between Leggett\u2019s action and the new \u201cuse of force\u201d training program was not clearly erroneous. <em>See Fields v. City of Tarpon Springs, Fla., </em>721 F.2d 318 (11th Cir.1983). The district court determined after a lengthy evidentiary hearing on the issue that Leggett\u2019s assault by Badger was one of several significant incidents or circumstances which helped bring about a change in training procedures for corrections officers. The district court did not find the litigation, as distinguished from the incident itself, to be the motivating factor. This decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-6\">Defendant\u2019s claim that Badger\u2019s \u201cbad faith\u201d would preclude an attorney\u2019s fees award against the State is precluded by our holding in <em>Glover. </em>The state statute could not override the federal Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-8\">Leggett\u2019s deterrence claims present no basis for relief in this Court. The federal statute and the prior cases of this Court control this issue without regard to the effect of such law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-9\">AFFIRMED in part and REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
