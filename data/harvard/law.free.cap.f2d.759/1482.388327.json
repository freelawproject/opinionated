The trial court rejected this contention and held her bound by her original answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-20\">We point out that in her complaint, Paragraph 55, she alleged positively that her physicians advised her that the cause of her severe pelvic inflammatory disease was the Daikon Shield. It was undisputed that she saw no physicians between her hospitalization and the filing of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-21\">Thus, the conclusion is inescapable that she knew the alleged cause of her injury more than two years before the filing of her complaint and no genuine issue of material fact remains.</p>\n<p id=\"b1545-22\">The Order Granting Summary Judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
