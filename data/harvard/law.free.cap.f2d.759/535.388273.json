JONES, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, provides that a federal employee may file a civil complaint in district court within thirty days of receipt of notice of \u201cfinal action\u201d by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c). As a matter of first impression in this Circuit, the present consolidated appeal requires us to determine which of several EEOC final decisions represented \u201cfinal action\u201d that would determine each appellant\u2019s last opportunity to resort to district court. Within thirty days of receipt of notice of the EEOC\u2019s initial final decision, each appellant elected to seek reconsideration by the EEOC rather than to file a complaint in district court. Then, each appellant filed her action in district court within thirty days of receipt of notice of the EEOC\u2019s final decision denying her motion to reconsider. The district court dismissed each complaint as untimely. We reverse and hold that the EEOC\u2019s final decision on each appellant\u2019s motion to reconsider was its \u201cfinal action\u201d for the purposes of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">Louise Donaldson and Teresa Middle-brook each charged their employer agency, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), with sex-based employment discrimination. Middlebrook also alleged racial discrimination and unlawful retaliation. The TVA\u2019s Director of Equal Opportunity Compliance (TVA Director) issued a \u201cfinal decision\u201d in each case, which found that the charges lacked merit. The TVA Director\u2019s final decisions informed Donaldson and Middle-brook of their right either to appeal to the EEOC or to file a civil action in district court within specified time periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">Each appellant appealed from the TVA to the EEOC and received the EEOC\u2019s ini.tial \u201cfinal decision\u201d. The EEOC affirmed the TVA Director\u2019s finding that Donaldson\u2019s charges were meritless but reversed the TVA Director by finding that Middle-brook suffered discrimination and reprisal. The EEOC\u2019s notice of each final decision informed each appellant of her right to file a civil action. The notices also informed the appellants and the TVA of their right to move for EEOC reconsideration of the decisions. .While federal employees may seek reconsideration at' any time, federal agencies must move for reconsideration within thirty days of receipt of the EEOC\u2019s final decision-. Within thirty days of receipt of the EEOC\u2019s initial final decision, Donaldson filed a request to have the EEOC reopen her case. A year later, the EEOC denied the request and notified Donaldson that she \u201cmay have a right to file a civil action in the appropriate United States District Court within 30 calendar days from receipt of the decision on the request to reopen and reconsider.\u201d The parties agree that within thirty days of receiving this decision, Donaldson filed her Title VII complaint in district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">Middlebrook\u2019s case took a different turn. The EEOC initially found that the TVA had subjected her to discrimination and reprisal. Within thirty days of receipt of that final decision, Middlebrook moved for the EEOC to reopen her case to reconsider additional remedies. The TVA also filed a timely request to reconsider the finding that it had discriminated against Middle-brook. Fourteen months later, the EEOC denied Middlebrook\u2019s motion to reopen, granted the TVA\u2019s motion, and vacated its initial final decision. The EEOC\u2019s new \u201cfinal decision\u201d found that the TVA had not discriminated against Middlebrook, and informed her \u201cthat she has the right to file a civil action\u201d in district court within thirty days of receipt of the decision. Middle-brook filed this suit within the designated time.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-13\">Neither formal nor informal pronouncements by Congress or the EEOC have es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>tablished when EEOC \u201cfinal action\u201d occurs. Unfortunately, the statute does not define \u201cfinal action.\u201d . <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16; <em>Nordell v. Heckler, </em>749 F.2d 47, 48 (D.C.Cir.1984). The EEOC has promulgated regulations that restate a federal employee\u2019s statutory right to file a civil action following \u201cfinal action\u201d by an agency employer or the EEOC. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1613.281. These provisions define the prerequisites of final action upon a Title VII complaint by an employer agency, but are silent regarding when the EEOC has taken \u201cfinal action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The regulations also provide that the EEOC may, in its discretion, \u201creopen and reconsider any previous decision\u201d but do not establish the relationship between such reconsideration and any previous or subsequent \u201cfinal action.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1613.235. Thus, we must look beyond the statute and regulations to determine when the EEOC\u2019s \u201cfinal action\u201d occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The notices that Donaldson and Middle-brook received indicate that in practice the EEOC has not resolved the question before us. The EEOC\u2019s final decision in each of these cases offered the opportunity to file for reconsideration with the Commission or to file suit in district court. The EEOC\u2019s notices did not inform Donaldson or Middle-brook that they would forfeit their last opportunity to resort to district court by seeking reconsideration. Indeed, the EEOC\u2019s notice following reconsideration again informed Donaldson that she \u201cmay have a right to file civil action,\u201d while Middlebrook was notified that the EEOC\u2019s reconsideration represented \u201cthe final decision in this matter\u201d and that she had \u201cthe right to file a civil action.\u201d Appellants were offered repeated opportunities to file a civil suit. Donaldson and Middlebrook never received notice, however, that the door to district court would close while they were exhausting the administrative remedies available from the EEOC.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">To determine when \u201cfinal action\u201d has occurred, we weigh the need for finality, the remedial purposes of Title VII, and concern for judicial economy. Expeditious and final resolution of Title VII controversies is a significant goal of \u00a7 2000e-16 and the accompanying regulations. Thus, if the EEOC does not act upon a complaint within 180 days, a federal employee may file suit in district court without awaiting an EEOC decision. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1613.-281(d). The regulations also promote this goal by requiring an employer agency to request reopening of an adverse EEOC decision within thirty days of receipt of notice of the decision. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1613.235(b). By contrast, the complaining employee may seek reconsideration at any time. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1613.235(a). The EEOC\u2019s decision upon an employee\u2019s motion for reconsideration will not, without qualification, represent \u201cfinal action\u201d after which the complainant may sue in district court. A rule to this effect would deny finality to any decision of the EEOC. \u201c[A]n aggrieved claimant could revive at any time his claim, however stale, by the simple expedient of filing ... a request to reopen.\u201d <em>Clark v. Goode, </em>499 F.2d 130, 133 (4th Cir.1974). In <em>Clark, </em>the claimant sought to reopen his claim over nine months after he received a decision in his favor on all but one issue; his subsequent civil action was dismissed as untimely. <em>Clark, </em>499 F.2d at 132. <em>See also Hofer v. Campbell, </em>581 F.2d 975, 977-78 (D.C.Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 909, 99 S.Ct. 1218, 59 L.Ed.2d 457 (1979) (claimant who sought reconsideration nine months after decision in his case could not then file suit in district court; following <em>Clark)', Chickillo v. Commanding Officer, Naval Air Engineering Center, </em>406 F.Supp. 807, 809-10 (E.D.Pa.1976), <em>aff'd, </em>547 F.2d 1159 (3d Cir.1977) (nearly seven months after receiving final decision, claimant simultaneously filed suit in district court and sought administrative reconsideration; the district court followed <em>Clark </em>and dismissed the suit as untimely). .</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">Concern for expeditious and final resolution of Title VII claims, however, must be reconciled with consideration of the broad remedial purposes of the statute. \u201c \u2018Mindful of the remedial and humanitarian un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>derpinnings of Title VII and of the crucial role played by the private litigant in the statutory scheme/ \u201d this Court has been \u201c \u2018extremely reluctant to allow procedural technicalities to bar claims brought under the Act/ \u201d <em>Ruiz v. Shelby County Sheriffs Department, </em>725 F.2d 388, 391 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 428, 83 L.Ed.2d 355 (1984) (quoting <em>Harris v. Walgreen\u2019s Distribution Center, </em>456 F.2d 588, 591 (6th Cir.1972)). <em>See also Odomes v. Nucare, Inc., </em>653 F.2d 246, 252 (6th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">While this Court is solicitous towards Title VII claimants, we are also concerned with conservation and effective use of judicial resources. Title VII evinces a policy of favoring both private accommodation between employee and employer and administrative resolution of employment discrimination disputes. Exhaustion of administrative remedies does not require that a Title VII claimant file a motion for reconsideration with the EEOC and await the EEOC\u2019s response before the claimant files suit in district court. EEOC reconsideration is a discretionary remedy that is based upon factual and legal predicates that are not present in every case. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1613.235(a). Our decision today, however, should encourage claimants to invoke this remedy in appropriate circumstances before filing suit. <em>See Nordell v. Heckler, </em>749 F.2d at 49. Concern for judicial economy dictates that we discourage simultaneous judicial and administrative proceedings that may yield conflicting results in a single dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">We have weighed the need for expeditious and final decisions, the remedial purposes of Title VII, and proper concern for judicial economy. As a result, we hold that when a federal employee files a motion to reopen or to reconsider within thirty days of receipt of an EEOC decision, the EEOC\u2019s final decision on that motion is the \u201cfinal action\u201d on the employee\u2019s complaint. Thus, the employee may file suit in district court within thirty days of receipt of notice of this \u201cfinal action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">This rule insures finality. Stale claims such as those in <em>Clark, Chickillo, </em>and <em>Hofer </em>will be barred as untimely. The D.C. Circuit has recognized that <em>Hofer, </em>its own precedent, does not bar a timely suit in district court after receipt of a decision on a motion to reconsider which had been filed within thirty days of the EEOC\u2019s initial decision. <em>Nordell v. Heckler, </em>749 F.2d at 49. We agree with the D.C. Circuit that the Fourth and Ninth Circuits have unduly extended <em>Clark\u2019s </em>concern for finality to govern suits such as Donaldson\u2019s and Middlebrook\u2019s. <em>See id. </em>at 50. Neither <em>Birch v. Lehman, </em>677 F.2d 1006, 1008 (4th Cir. 1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1103,103 S.Ct. 725, 74 L.Ed.2d 951 (1983), nor <em>Mahroom v. Defense Language Institute, </em>732 F.2d 1439, 1440 (9th Cir.1984), weighed all the concerns we consider today; their holdings were expressly and exclusively founded upon a fear that a claimant could deprive any EEOC decision of finality simply by seeking EEOC reconsideration and subsequently filing suit in district court. As discussed above, our holding satisfies this concern while also responding to other, equally weighty, considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">Middlebrook\u2019s case illustrates the contribution of today\u2019s holding to the equity of the statutory scheme. Initially, the EEOC determined that the TVA had both discriminated and retaliated against Middlebrook. Naturally, she did not file suit in district court to challenge the EEOC\u2019s decision in her favor. Within thirty days, however, Middlebrook moved for the EEOC to reopen her case for consideration of additional remedies. The TVA also filed a timely motion that asked the EEOC to reverse its finding that the TVA discriminated and retaliated against Middlebrook. The EEOC denied Middlebrook\u2019s motion for reconsideration, granted TVA\u2019s motion, and reversed the initial final decision. Middle-brook filed suit within thirty days and the district court dismissed her suit as untimely citing <em>Hofer, Clark, </em>and <em>Chickillo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">In essence, the district court found that, under the facts of this case, the EEOC\u2019s reversal of its initial decision in Middle-brook\u2019s favor was not subject to judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>review. The district court would require Title VII claimants who received favorable decisions from the EEOC to file hypothetical lawsuits in district court in anticipation of the possibility that the employer agency might prevail on a motion for reconsideration. Although few claimants would have reason to prosecute such suits to completion, each case would drain the district court\u2019s administrative resources during its pendency. Even if this were not so, we would not require such sophistication of Title VII claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Middlebrook\u2019s case is extreme. Both Middlebrook and Donaldson pursued their claims with alacrity. They deserve their day in court. Upon consideration of all the issues raised in these consolidated appeals, we REVERSE and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
