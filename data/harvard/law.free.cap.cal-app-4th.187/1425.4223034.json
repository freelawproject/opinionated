J.</author>\n<p id=\"b1320-5\">I. THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-6\">This case is important for two reasons. First, it presents a challenging problem in public contracting law: How to distinguish a \u201cnonresponsive\u201d bid from a de facto determination that the bidder is not a \u201cresponsible\u201d bidder. The difference is significant not only to the bidder, but to the taxpaying constituency of the public entity: A truly nonresponsive bid may be summarily denied by a public entity even if the bid is otherwise monetarily the best for the entity. On the other hand, a determination of nonresponsibility entitles the bidder to a hearing where certain minimal elements of due process must be afforded before the contract can be awarded to the next-best bidder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1321-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1429\">*1429</page-number>More particularly, this case illustrates the necessity of following the rule enunciated in 2007 by our Fifth District colleagues in <em>D.H. Williams, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.4th 757 <em>(D.H. Williams). </em>Under the <em>D.H. Williams </em>rule, a public agency cannot reject the bid of the lowest bidder on a public works project on the theory that the <em>bid </em>is \u201cnonresponsive\u201d to the agency\u2019s request for bids when, <em>in substance, </em>the real reason for the rejection is that the agency thinks the lowest <em>bidder is \u201cnot </em>responsible\u201d \u2014 at least not without giving the lowest bidder the chance for a hearing on whether the lowest bidder really is \u201cnot responsible.\u201d On the record before us, because <em>D.H. Williams </em>was not followed, the Irvine Unified School District appears to have paid $800,000 more than necessary to remodel two elementary schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-4\">The second major reason this case is important is that it presents an object lesson in how evidence that, at least on its face, tends to show favoritism\u2014 indeed, on this record, favoritism most foul \u2014 never got squarely presented to, or considered by, the trial court. The reason? An unfortunate combination of trial court calendaring beyond a petitioner\u2019s control, and a public entity\u2019s delay in complying with a request for information. (Readers can judge for themselves, when we recount the facts in detail in pt. II. below, whether \u201cstonewalling\u201d might not be a better word than \u201cdelay.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-5\">Here, one competitor in a bid for a school remodeling contract, for some reason never adequately explained by the public entity, had access to the lowest bidder\u2019s bid information within <em>24 hours of the opening of all the bids. </em>Thus, this competitor was able to present a bid challenge almost immediately to the contracting school district based on the allegation that the lowest bidder had omitted to disclose some licenses with which it or its principals had been associated. And that competitor went on to be awarded one of two contracts up for award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-6\">But when the lowest bidder tried to get a copy of that very same competitor\u2019s bid (as well as that of another company that was awarded the second contract), the school district did not turn over that information until several weeks later. More pointedly, the information was deliberately not made available until <em>after </em>the critical first court hearing in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-7\">And then, when the lowest bidder finally did get the information on its competitors\u2019 bids, it allegedly discovered that its successful competitors had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1430\">*1430</page-number>been guilty of the <em>very same omission with regard to the disclosure of all associated licenses that was the ostensible reason the lowest bidder\u2019s bid was summarily rejected in the first place.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1322-5\">However, when, in the second hearing on the lowest bidder\u2019s main request for relief, the lowest bidder tried to proffer evidence that would show how it had been treated differently from the winning competitors, the school district vigorously objected on the ground that the evidence was submitted too late! It doesn\u2019t take Hamlet to figure out that something rotten happened in this case. In fact, it suspiciously fits George Washington Plunkitt\u2019s definition of \u201chonest\u201d graft \u2014 the use of tips to gain an advantage over one\u2019s rivals in public contracting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-6\">Because this is a long opinion, we include an outline of it in the margin so that readers can see where the various pieces fit.* I.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1431\">*1431</page-number>H. THE HISTORY OF THIS CASE</p>\n<p id=\"Alq7\">A. The Bid Call and Prequalification</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-4\">In late March 2008, the Irvine Unified School District put out what is sometimes called a \u201cbid call,\u201d asking for contractor bids on two elementary school modernization projects, Eastshore and Northwood.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1323-5\">Before bids were submitted, however, there was something called a \u201cprequalification\u201d process. The process is set out in section 20111.5 of the Public Contract Code. Basically, subdivision (a) of the statute gives the governing board of a school district the discretion to require prospective bidders to \u201ccomplete and submit\u201d a \u201cstandardized questionnaire and financial statement,\u201d including \u201ca complete statement of the prospective bidder\u2019s financial ability and experience in performing public works.\u201d Subdivision (b) of the statute requires such districts to \u201cadopt and apply a uniform system of rating bidders on the basis of the completed questionnaires and financial statements, in order to determine the size of the contracts upon which each bidder shall be deemed qualified to bid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-6\">Plaintiff Great West went through the prequalification process for the Eastshore and Northwood projects. On May 1, the District sent Great West a letter saying Great West was indeed qualified to bid on the two projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-7\">B. The Opening of the Bids and the Immediate Challenge to the Lowest Bidder\u2019s Bids</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-8\">Upon the opening of the bids on May 8, it was revealed that Great West was the lowest bidder on both projects. On Eastshore, JRH Construction, the eventual winner, was the third-from-lowest bidder. On Northwood, Construct 1, the eventual winner, was the third-from-lowest bidder. The difference between Great West\u2019s bid and JRH\u2019s on the Eastshore project was about $500,000. The difference between Great West\u2019s bid and Construct l\u2019s bid on the Northwood project was about $300,000.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1323-9\">Great West had given as its license number 673901. But an item in the required bid package had asked: \u201cHave you ever been licensed under a different name or license number?\u201d In the question, there was a footnote after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1432\">*1432</page-number>the word \u201cyou\u201d which defined \u201cyou\u201d to include a contractor\u2019s \u201cowners, officers, directors, shareholders, principals, responsible managing officer (RMO) or responsible managing employee (RME).\u201d Great West had simply answered, \u201cno.\u201d That \u201cno\u201d answer would soon become the ostensible reason the company would not get the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-4\">On May 9, the day after the bids were opened, the vice president of Construct 1 (the eventual winner of the Northwood contract) sent the District a letter challenging the bids of Great West and the second-to-lowest bidder as well. The Construct 1 letter made two points: The letter argued that the two lower bidders had relied on an unreliable subcontractor for certain vapor emission treatment (a point that has no further relevancy to this case) and, more importantly, that Great West had \u201cfailed to disclose that they had previously operated under license #674120 and are also currently operating under license number #756099.\u201d The letter also asserted that Great West\u2019s president, Gary Wolfinger, \u201cwas also listed as the RME under license #376709.\u201d (Readers should remember the May 9 date of Construct l\u2019s letter \u2014 it will resurface as significant 18 paragraphs from now.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-5\">The letter apparently prompted a staff review of Great West\u2019s bid, which resulted in a letter from the District\u2019s director of construction and facilities to Wolfinger of Great West on May 16, 2008. The staff letter made these points;</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-6\">(1) The Contractors\u2019 State License Board Web site listed Great West and Wolfinger as a joint venture under license No. 756099 (referenced in the Construct 1 letter above).</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-7\">(2) Also, the board\u2019s \u201crecords\u201d indicated that Wolfinger had been the responsible managing employee of another company (RJW Construction) \u201calbeit for a short period of time in 1993, under license number 376709\u201d (also referenced in the Construct 1 letter above).</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-8\">(3) Great West was \u201can apparent joint venture partner under the business name of Trans-Pacific Constructors\u201d under license No. 674120.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-9\">The bottom line of the letter (literally) was that District staff were recommending the District\u2019s board \u201creject your bid as non-responsive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1433\">*1433</page-number>As Great West\u2019s opening brief now points out, the staff letter did not invite any response or suggest any opportunity for refutation or denial of its allegations. In any event, the board was due to award the contracts in only four days. The board agenda for the May 20 meeting did not give the amounts bid by Great West and the second-to-lowest bidders. Rather, it merely inserted the word \u201cNon-Responsive\u201d where the monetary amount of the bid would otherwise have been listed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-4\">Great West did manage to submit two letters in response, however, both dated May 20, the date of the board meeting. One letter was from Wolfinger, Great West\u2019s president. The other was from its counsel. (The same counsel represents Great West in this appeal.) Wolfinger\u2019s letter made these points:</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-5\">(1) Great West only operates and functions as a business under license No. 673901 (the one listed in the bid).</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-6\">(2) Great West had in effect been sandbagged by the District on the \u201cother license\u201d question because it had submitted a prequalification package back in April which had a similar question and in which Great West gave the same answer, and that package was approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-7\">(3) The joint venture license number, No. 756099, was a license to perform general engineering work (basically, street utilities) and that \u201clicense had never contracted or functioned as a business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-8\">(4) Wolfinger had merely been the \u201cqualifier\u201d for the RJW firm for 15 days while the RJW firm closed down and Great West started up.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-9\">(5) The Great West and Trans-Pacific joint venture \u201cdid not perform any work or function as a business.\u201d The license was merely obtained to increase Great West\u2019s available bond line.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-10\">For its part, Great West\u2019s counsel\u2019s letter made a legal argument that Great West\u2019s bid was <em>not </em>\u201c \u2018non-responsive.\u2019 \u201d Rather, the letter\u2019s thesis was that the \u201cessence\u201d of the District staff\u2019s proffered rejection of Great West\u2019s bid \u201cgoes to the question of Great West\u2019s responsibility.\u201d In that regard, the letter cited <em>City of Inglewood, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d 861, and quoted the language from page 871 of that decision about the lowest bidder\u2019s right to a hearing when a bid is rejected for nonresponsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-11\">Counsel\u2019s letter also repeated Wolfinger\u2019s points that no \u201cbusiness\u201d was done under the other licenses. And it further asserted that (a) the time for such matters was during the prequalification process already held, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1434\">*1434</page-number>(b) even if there were any <em>mistakes </em>in Great West\u2019s answer, they certainly were not material because they gave no \u201cindication of \u2018untrustworthiness\u2019 on Great West\u2019s part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-4\">C. The District Selects the Third-from-lowest Bidders</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-5\">The staff reports to the board on the two projects did not list the amount bid by Great West or the runner-up for either the Northwood or Eastshore project. The written agenda showed a list of all bidders on the two projects, with the amounts bid by the top two bidders not given, replaced by the words \u201cNon-Responsive.\u201d Thus the very first bidders listed with numbers were Construct l\u2019s $3,316,973 bid on Northwood and JRH\u2019s bid of $3,558,000 on Eastshore.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-6\">Counsel for Great West spoke at the May 20 board meeting, apparently airing, as the meeting\u2019s minutes later expressed it, \u201cconcerns . . . relative to the bid process.\u201d Two members of the five-member board, Mike Parham and Sharon Wallin, both suggested delaying the decision \u201cpending clarification from legal counsel.\u201d Staff, however, \u201creiterated that legal counsel had already validated the district\u2019s position and a delay could jeopardize summer completion due to extremely tight timelines,\u201d and it appears the board agreed with their view.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-7\">And so, on May 20, 2008, the District\u2019s board awarded the Eastshore contract to JRH Construction, based on its bid of about $3.6 million, as opposed to Great West\u2019s bid of not quite $3.1 million. It awarded the Northwood contract to Construct 1 based on its bid of about $3.3 million, as opposed to Great West\u2019s bid of slightly less than $3 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-8\">D. A Disparity in Access to Information Quickly Emerges</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-9\">Great West quickly made the decision to contest the two awards in the court, and went into a fact-gathering mode. And that requires us to return, in our narrative, to Construct l\u2019s May 9 letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-10\">For some reason, never explained in the District\u2019s briefing, Construct 1 got a copy of Great West\u2019s bid (as well as the second-to-lowest bidder\u2019s bid) within 24 hours of the opening of the bids. (The Construct 1 letter opened with the lines, \u201cWe have reviewed the bid packages from both the apparent low bidder and the apparent 2nd place bidder and found [and thereafter detailed the challenge to the vapor emission subcontractor].\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-11\">But Great West was not so favored. On May 21, the day after it lost the two contracts, Great West sent a written request to the District to inspect and copy the bid documents submitted by the two winners, JRH and Construct 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1435\">*1435</page-number>The next day, May 22, Great West\u2019s counsel followed up with the District\u2019s counsel. According to the later declaration of Great West\u2019s counsel, the District\u2019s counsel said he \u201cwould need to \u2018check\u2019 to see if [Great West] could even inspect the documents prior to the passage of ten days under the California Public Records Act.\u201d The matter was left, on May 22, with the thought that the District\u2019s counsel would \u201c \u2018get back\u2019 \u201d to Great West\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-4\">E. Great West Files a Writ Petition Without Receiving the Information It Requested from the District</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-5\">And the next day after that, May 23, Great West filed this case, generally arguing that Great West should have received the awards given to Construct 1 and JRH. But the precise relief requested is worth detailing now.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-6\">Great West did not ask for any sort of money damages for having been unlawfully denied the two contracts. Nor did it, for example, ask for a rescission or revocation of the awarded projects <em>pending </em>a substantive responsibility hearing under <em>City of Inglewood.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1327-7\">Rather, its first two requests for relief were for alternative writs pursuant to section 1087 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Each of those requests was for a writ that would <em>either </em>command the district to \u201cimmediately rescind its unlawful award\u201d of the Northwood and Eastshore projects <em>or </em>\u201calternatively show cause why it has not done so at the time and date specified by this court.\u201d The next prayer was a straight-out request for relief, but was itself framed as an <em>alternative </em>to the alternative writs requested in the first two prayers. (\u201cAlternatively, that this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandamus setting aside the award of the Northwood Project and the Eastshore Project and commanding [the District] to award both projects to [Great West].\u201d) The final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1436\">*1436</page-number>two prayers for relief were boilerplate: costs of proceedings and the standard \u201cfurther relief\u2019 as the court might see proper.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-4\">F. From the Filing of the Petition to the Initial Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-5\">Great West\u2019s petition was filed May 23. The District\u2019s contract with JRH was signed four days later, on May 27. The contract with Construct 1 was signed two days after that, on May 29.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The District issued formal notices to proceed to both companies on May 28. Each notice said \u201ctime is of the essence,\u201d and the \u201cofficial start date of the project is therefore established as June 3, 2008.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-6\">On Monday morning, June 2, Great West applied ex parte for a temporary restraining order pending a full hearing on its petition for a writ of mandate. A hearing was set for the next day, June 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-7\">It was also on June 2 that the District sent letters to Great West on its requests for copies of the winning bids by JRH and Construct 1. In those letters, the District (to quote a document subsequently filed with the court by the District itself) told Great West that the District \u201cagreed to make all of the requested documents available to [Great West] on June 4, 2008.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-8\">There is no explanation in the District\u2019s briefing why the District waited until June 2 to \u201cget back\u201d to Great West on its records request, or why <em>June 4 </em>was selected as the first available date Great West would be able to see copies of the winning bids.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-9\">But in any event, June 4 was convenient for the District. The hearing on Great West\u2019s request for temporary relief took place on June 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-10\">G. The Crucial June 3 Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-11\">It was at the ex parte hearing on June 3 that, in retrospect, seems where Great West\u2019s battle to actually be awarded the two contracts was, from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1437\">*1437</page-number>practical point of view, lost. And that\u2019s ironic, because the result of that hearing was Great West\u2019s getting what its petition asked for \u2014 an alternative writ telling the District to give Great West the contracts or show up in court to explain why not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-4\">A recount of some of the main points of the June 3 ex parte hearing is in order. The trial judge, Frederick P. Horn, opined that he thought the case would come \u201cdown to money damages.\u201d In fact, he didn\u2019t \u201csee the emergency at this point.\u201d But he invited Great West\u2019s counsel to make her case for a writ. One of her arguments was that the District had been unusually late itself in setting the job for a bid. Usually, she argued, such \u201cjobs need long lead times,\u201d so \u201cthey\u2019re not in May.\u201d Counsel for Great West further asserted that the District staff had a \u201churry up and do it now\u201d mindset about the two projects, noting that at the meeting two board members wanted a little bit of time to \u201cconsider\u201d the matter. And she also alluded to the fact that right after Great West had filed its petition on May 23, staff \u201cimmediately went out and tried to get contracts signed.\u201d Counsel\u2019s basic point, though, was that since actual construction was not designated to start until June 23, there was still time for a \u201cfull hearing\u201d to consider the matter and award Great West the contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-5\">A declaration in the District\u2019s opposition papers had made the point that any delay in the two projects could cost the District considerable money. The District\u2019s theory was that if the two projects were not ready by the beginning of the school year, the District would be forced to use temporary classrooms or \u201cother facilities.\u201d The District\u2019s director of construction and facilities in fact opined the cost of \u201cdelay or variation from the present schedule\u201d could be as much as half a million to a million dollars. Not surprisingly then, at the ex parte hearing, counsel for the District saw the case as one where a writ was not appropriate, and Great West\u2019s relief was monetary only, if that.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-6\">The June 3 hearing ended with Judge Horn saying, \u201cI\u2019ll try to get a ruling out on this by the end of the day.\u201d Judge Horn, however, was in the middle of a jury trial, so his decision was not filed until June 12. When it was filed, he used the proposed form order submitted by Great West back when it first filed the petition on May 23 (thus the document has a \u201creceived . . . May 23, 2008\u201d stamp as well as a \u201cfiled . . . June 12\u201d stamp). We quote the order in its entirety, including Judge Horn\u2019s interlineations, in the margin.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Essentially, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1438\">*1438</page-number>told the District to either (1) rescind the award of the contracts made a few weeks earlier in May to the not-lowest bidders and award them to the lowest bidder, Great West, or (2) show up in court on June 30, 2008, to explain why not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-4\">According to the proofs of service in our record, the order was personally served on an attorney with the law firm representing the District at 12:40 p.m. on June 13. It was also served on the secretary to the District board, with copies left for each of the five board members, at 3:35 p.m. on June 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-5\">H. June 12 to July 3: Work Proceeds While Great West Awaits Its Second Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-6\">Despite the alternative writ served on the District, work continued. After June 12, the District carried on as if there was no possibility that the court might grant Great West\u2019s third prayer for a peremptory writ of mandamus requiring that the projects be, in effect, turned over to Great West.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-7\">The District filed its opposition on June 23. The focus of the opposition was the \u201cdue diligence\u201d of the staff in checking with the Contractors\u2019 State License Board that revealed that \u201cGreat West and its principals had been issued different contractor license numbers in the past, none of which were identified in its answer to the bid questionnaire,\u201d hence Great West\u2019s bid was correctly deemed \u201cnonresponsive.\u201d Moreover, the District argued that the writ relief requested was moot on the theory that when the District awarded the contracts a month earlier on May 21, that award was a done deal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-8\">I. Great West Finally Receives Copies of Its Competitors\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-9\">Bids</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-10\">Something else happened in the runup to the June 30 hearing: About June 10, Great West finally received copies of the ultimate winning bids of Construct 1 and JRH. And, at least according to Great West\u2019s review of those bids, Construct 1 and JRH had <em>themselves </em>been guilty of omitting other licenses with which they had been associated. The apparent favoritism shown Construct 1 and JRH became the subject of Great West\u2019s reply brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1439\">*1439</page-number>J. The July 3 Second Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-4\">The hearing scheduled for June 30 did not take place until July 3. And it involved a new judge, Sheila Fell, instead of Frederick Horn. In making her presentation, counsel for Great West raised the issue of the apparent discrepancy in treatment afforded Construct 1 and JRH, and asserted the \u201clogical inference is that there is either favoritism or corruption that is going on . . . .\u201d The District counsel (the same attorney who had been served with the June 12 writ) argued that any \u201cfavoritism and corruption\u201d was not technically \u201cbefore\u201d the court, and said Great West could, if it wanted, \u201cbring a separate matter and raise all those issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-5\">The first part of the hearing centered on the reply brief material, with the court wondering if it might not be better to give the District some extra time to respond to the new material. Counsel for Great West argued that it was the District\u2019s own fault that the timing was so tight (\u201cthey created whatever exigency there is\u201d) and thus if the District were afforded any \u201cadditional time, it should be very short.\u201d In the end, the trial judge determined that she would not consider the \u201cnew material,\u201d though counsel for Great West argued that it really wasn\u2019t a new issue but the \u201cother side of the coin\u201d of the District\u2019s argument that it had discretion to consider Great West\u2019s supposedly false answer \u201cnon-responsive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-6\">In the middle part of the hearing, counsel for the District argued Great West wanted to \u201cpunish the District for doing due diligence and looking at various web sites and discovering it was a falsity in the response because the answer is \u2018yes.\u2019 \u201d When the court observed that \u201ctechnically they were responsive, they answered the question,\u201d District counsel argued that not answering the question \u201ctruthfully\u201d made it nonresponsive. The judge then asked, \u201cWell, but are they not entitled to a hearing thereafter?\u201d And counsel for the District said no \u2014 not when there is a \u201cdetermination of nonresponsiveness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-7\">The dialog between the trial judge and counsel for the District then turned to the state of the work. Counsel for the District allowed that the winning contractors were already \u201ca quarter of the way or a little bit more\u201d done. The balance of the hearing focused on the responsibility-responsiveness dichotomy, with counsel for Great West asserting that the other-license question was a way \u201cto get rid of bidders that you don\u2019t like.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1331-8\">The hearing ended with the trial judge taking the matter under submission, but declaring that, in any event, (1) she wouldn\u2019t consider the new material and thus (2) was \u201cnot going to find corruption or favoritism.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1440\">*1440</page-number>K. Aftermath of the July 3 Hearing: No Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-4\">Twelve days went by, which itself was an obvious message that Great West was not going to have the projects awarded to it. Then, in a minute order dated July 15, the court held: (1) Great West\u2019s bid was nonresponsive and (2) even if Great West had a due process right to a hearing (as would be the case if the rejection were really based on its purported nonresponsibility), all it could get by way of relief would be a <em>hearing, </em>and any relief that such a hearing might afford would not \u201ccorrespond to the injury alleged,\u201d i.e., denial of the contract. The request for a peremptory writ of mandamus was thus denied. We quote the relevant portions of the minute order in the margin.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1332-5\">The July 15 minute order also did this: It sustained objections to the declaration of Great West\u2019s lawyer filed in support of its reply. The sustaining of those objections is noteworthy because it was in the declaration supporting the reply that the whole story finally came out about the District\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s use a neutral word for the moment \u2014 \u201cdelay\u201d in affording Great West copies of its rivals\u2019 bids. On the other hand, the trial court <em>granted </em>Great West\u2019s request for judicial notice of computer printouts from the Contractors\u2019 State License Board which purported to support its claim that JRH and Construct 1 had themselves failed to list every name or license otherwise required in the bid request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-6\">L. A New Hope for Great West: Amending the Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-7\">August passed without a formal judgment being entered against Great West. On September 18, though, there was a case management conference. And by that date in September, Great West\u2019s counsel had come up with the idea of amending the writ petition to allege a cause of action for damages based on the lack of a hearing, combined with the apparent favoritism shown the winning bidders, whose bid packages were (allegedly) just as deficient as Great West\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1441\">*1441</page-number>Nothing began to happen until early October. On October 2, the District submitted a proposed judgment. Eight days later, on October 10, Great West objected to the proposed judgment, asking for a postponement until it could have a motion for leave to amend to add a claim for money damages heard. By this time school had opened, the work had presumably been completed, and Great West explicitly conceded that the relief it had requested back in May was moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-4\">Also on October 10, Great West submitted a formal claim for money damages to the District in anticipation of obtaining leave to assert a money damages claim in civil court. (Obviously Great West was under no illusions that somehow the District might approve its claim.) And five days later, on October 15, Great West filed its anticipated motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-5\">Not surprisingly, the opposition to the motion argued various permutations of the idea that Great West had simply waited too long to make the request. But there was an interesting substantive argument too. Great West had let on that it was planning to appeal from the eventual judgment that would embody the July 15 denial of request for a peremptory writ, which prompted the District to argue that allowing a proposed amendment \u201cbefore pursuing an appeal\u201d would \u201ccause potential confusion and deception which will likely prejudice the District on appeal.\u201d The danger, said the District, was that: \u201cThe Court of Appeal may be confused as to the effect of the amendment where the record, and this Court\u2019s ruling on the Petition, reveals that no action had been taken on Petitioner\u2019s proposed alternative relief for damages.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This danger could require, at a \u201cminimum,\u201d the District to \u201ctake extra measures to explain the logic \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 for the amendment and place an additional burden on the District to ensure that the court of appeal does not take the amendment into consideration in deciding the appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1333-6\">Rather, the District had a \u201cbetter alternative.\u201d It elaborated: \u201cAs was suggested by the District at the September 18, 2008 case management conference, [Great West] should wait until after an appeal to seek leave to amend. By deferring until after an appeal, the parties need not concern themselves with the amendment on appeal; there will be no opportunity for the confusion or deception described above.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1442\">*1442</page-number>Almost two months later, on December 10, 2008, the motion for leave to amend was heard. The most significant point of the oral argument was Great West\u2019s counsel\u2019s plea that, no matter how the court ruled on the request to amend, the court enter its order on the motion to amend prior to the filing of any judgment. (Obviously counsel did not realize that if the motion to amend were granted, there could be no appeal because there would have been a cause of action remaining for disposition. (See <em>Morehart </em>v. <em>County of Santa Barbara, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 743.))</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-4\">M. The Request to Amend is Denied and this Appeal Ensues</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-6\">In a minute order issued one week later on December 19, Great West\u2019s counsel was granted her wish that the order on the motion to amend precede the judgment. Even so, the request to amend was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-7\">The substantive part of the minute order said: \u201cThere was no authority cited in the motion which allows an amendment of a Petition after the trial court has already adjudicated and ruled on the Petition\u2019s merits. The Petitioner\u2019s request is not proper \u2014 it already had the opportunity to amend the Petition prior to the hearing on its merits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-8\">The judgment was filed on December 24, 2008, formally denying the petition for peremptory writ and discharging the alternative writ. Given service of notice of entry of judgment on December 31, 2008, the February 26, 2009 notice of appeal from the judgment and \u201call orders encompassed therein\u201d was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-9\">N. The Positions Taken by the District in Oral Argument at the Court of Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b1334-10\">Not surprisingly, at oral argument in this court, the question of the disparity in information access came up. Counsel for the District said, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d to the question of why a competitor of Great West\u2019s had access to Great West\u2019s bid within 24 hours when Great West had to wait weeks for the same information regarding its competitors.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> He was definitive, however, in saying that upon the bids being opened, the information <em>immediately </em>became public. He was not asked how that position squared with the position taken by a District counsel on May 22 to the effect that the District\u2019s counsel \u201cwould need to \u2018check\u2019 to see if [Great West] could even inspect the documents prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1443\">*1443</page-number>to the passage of ten days under the California Public Records Act.\u201d (Judging by what District counsel said at oral argument in this court, copies of the rival bids should have been at least accessible to Great West\u2019s counsel from May 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-4\">Counsel for the District was also confronted with the alleged disparity of treatment in that the two winning bidders were guilty of the same problem with associated licenses that got Great West\u2019s held nonresponsive. His answer was that the \u201cdue diligence\u201d of District staff entailed checking <em>all </em>bidders prior to the bids being considered by the board. The implication is that, if the matter were actually litigated, the District might be able to refute the merits of Great West\u2019s disparate treatment claim concerning the \u201cother licenses\u201d issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-5\">The answer at oral argument is as close as the District has come to confronting the merits of the issue of disparate treatment vis-a-vis the \u201cother licenses\u201d question. That answer, we will note here (and as also stated by Great West\u2019s counsel at oral argument in this court), is at odds with the argument in the respondent\u2019s brief. There, the District has argued that: \u201cIt is clear, however, that the excluded evidence, on its own, would have been insufficient to demonstrate that the District was arbitrary or capricious, as it would not have shown there were any deviations, much less that the District <em>knew </em>of them at the time the awards were made\u201d (original italics). The emphasis on the word <em>knew </em>in the District\u2019s brief suggests that the District did not check out <em>all </em>bidders prior to awarding the contracts. (Otherwise, the District would have presumably been <em>aware </em>of the alleged \u201cdeviations\u201d in the winners\u2019 bids.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1335-6\">For its part, Great West has asserted (in its opening brief) that something fishy was going on, because it was actually easier, by looking at the state licensing board Web site, to determine that the two rival winning bidders had \u201cother licenses\u201d than it would have been to determine that for Great West. The implication is that the District staff <em>didn\u2019t </em>examine the winners\u2019 bids for the same \u201cassociated license\u201d discrepancies to which it subjected Great West.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1444\">*1444</page-number>III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-4\">A. Mootness of the \u201cNonresponsive\u201d Versus \u201cNonresponsibility\u201d Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-5\">By mid-October 2008, even Great West had to concede its quest for a writ requiring the District to give it the two school contracts had become moot. The modernization work was done. The District says that therefore this court should not decide the propriety of the District\u2019s rejection of Great West\u2019s low bid on the ground that the bid was nonresponsive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-6\">The nonresponsive versus nonresponsible issue is, however, a classic example of an issue capable of repetition yet likely to evade review. Consider; In public contracts of a short lead-time nature, like the ones here, an initial determination by the public agency that the lowest bid is \u201cnonresponsive\u201d allows for a summary rejection of that bid that may readily preclude effective judicial redress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-7\">Within a month, a little month, this case was effectively over as far as any practical possibility that the lowest bidder might actually obtain the contract was concerned. Great West filed its writ petition within three days of the May 20 award. While it probably should have sought to have a hearing on its temporary restraining order immediately, it did manage to arrange for such a hearing on June 4. But even then, there was no decision on its request until June 12 (which, we stress, that <em>wasn\u2019t </em>the trial judge\u2019s fault, a fact which only underscores how hard it was for Great West to obtain any relief in the ordinary course of things), and the ensuing order set a hearing date so late into the construction process that it effectively mooted the requested relief.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1336-8\">The Irvine Unified School District, anticipating the capable-of-repetition-yet-evading-review doctrine, basically asserts (to quote its respondent\u2019s brief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1445\">*1445</page-number>directly) \u201cthe narrow scope of interest is unlikely to reoccur,\u201d in part because Great West has not \u201callege[d] a systematic practice of repeatedly harming the public fisc, only an improper determination regarding the bids of a single contractor, Appellant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-4\">There are three underlying ideas inherent in the District\u2019s formulation. Each is worth examining individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-5\">The first is that this case, involving as it does the question <em>of </em>the difference between a nonresponsive and a nonresponsible bidder, does not implicate an issue of the public interest. But it obviously does. As the <em>D.H. Williams </em>court stated: \u201cSchool districts, like most other public agencies, are required by law to award construction contracts (with certain narrow exceptions) to the \u2018lowest responsible bidder.\u2019 \u201d <em>(D.H. Williams, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.4th at p. 763, citing Pub. Contract Code, \u00a7 20111.) Assuming that Great West is correct that its bid was not \u201cnonresponsive,\u201d then this case represents an example of how the statutory mandate that public contracts be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder could be readily circumvented: The agency simply deems some aspect of the winning bidder\u2019s bid package to be \u201cnonresponsive\u201d in order to award the contract to the next (and perhaps favored) bidder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-6\">The second idea inherent in the District\u2019s argument is that the fact pattern exemplified in this case is \u201cunlikely\u201d to reoccur. Au contraire again. While the details might differ, the basic pattern is pretty simple: By deeming something in a bid package to be \u201cnonresponsive,\u201d a public agency can circumvent public contracting statutes and do so without affording that bidder a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-7\">The third idea is that Great West did not allege any \u201csystematic\u201d practice of harming the public fisc. There is rich irony in the District\u2019s assertion. Besides which, it is plain wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-8\">This record readily gives rise to a reasonable inference of a \u201csystematic\u201d practice of favoritism and \u201charming the public fisc.\u201d For favoritism: The District gave one bidder access to its rivals\u2019 bids immediately, but hemmed and hawed before giving the lowest bidder similar access to its rivals\u2019 bids, then used the delay to prevent the trial court from having to consider that maybe those rivals were guilty of the same offense that ostensibly prompted the rejection of the lowest bidder\u2019s bid.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> For harming the public fisc: The sweaty haste with which the District consummated the contracts with the third-from-lowest bidders, contrasted with the insouciance and delay with which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1446\">*1446</page-number>honored the lowest bidder\u2019s request for records, are all susceptible, of course, of at least an inference that the fix was in from the beginning not to award the contracts to Great West.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-5\">Finally, no less than three cases are on point, all of which establish the need to address the merits of the responsive-responsibility issue here: <em>D.H. Williams, M &amp; B, </em>and <em>Marshall. </em>(In each case, the work was completed by the time the appellate court was able to consider the appeal.) The District simply ignores the first and fails to persuasively distinguish the other two.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1338-6\">Most importantly, the District downplays the major public concern presented by the events in <em>this </em>case. Let us spell it out: Assuming Great West\u2019s position is correct, then a public entity otherwise bound to award a contract to the lowest responsible bidder can, by the simple imperial ukase of declaring a specific answer to a question required on a bid form to be \u201cnonresponsive,\u201d baldfacedly circumvent the public contracting law that requires the contract to be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder. Far from presenting a \u201cnarrow issue,\u201d the case presented here is one is of vital interest to all taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1447\">*1447</page-number>B. The Merits of the \u201cNonresponsive\u201d Versus \u201cNonresponsibility\u201d Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-5\">1. <em>The Importance of the Governing Legislative Text</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1339-6\">For a topic on which there are so many published opinions, the case law bearing on public contract bidding is remarkably consistent. We have found only two cases which might be in even putative tension with each other, and upon examination, they are not even that.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1339-7\">The key to understanding the remarkable consistency in the cases is this: The amount of leeway a public entity has in awarding a contract is governed by the statutory or municipal law framework applying to that contract. (E.g., <em>East Bay Garbage, supra, </em>52 Cal.2d 708 [because state statutes requiring award to lowest responsible bidder applied, contract awarded to second-lowest bidder was void]; <em>Monterey Mechanical, supra, 44 </em>Cal.App.4th 1391 [governing statute set forth exclusive criteria entity could require in bid to satisfy affirmative action goal, ergo sanitation district had no discretionary authority to reject lowest bidder\u2019s bid on ground that bid was not responsive to additional criteria added by district]; <em>Pacific Bell, supra, </em>225 Cal.App.3d 107 [because statute specifically gave state agency discretion in procurement of data processing and telecommunications contracts, agency had discretion to categorically exclude bids that provided for leasing, as distinct from sale, of equipment]; <em>San Diego Service Authority, supra, </em>198 Cal.App.3d 1466 [governing statute for award of contracts for freeway emergency call boxes did not require competitive bidding at all]; <em>R &amp; A, supra, </em>172 Cal.App.3d at p. 1193 [because city charter and not state statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1448\">*1448</page-number>governed award of contract for refreshment stands in city park, city had discretion to conclude that highest bid for right to sell in park was \u201c \u2018unrealistic and contained admitted inaccuracies\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-4\">To be sure, the idea of looking to the governing legislative scheme, whether it be found in state statutes or city charters, might seem pretty self-evident. But this simple idea explains both otherwise inconsistent <em>results </em>in the cases as well as differences in the judicial language used in the respective decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-5\">Thus, where a statute requires a public entity to award a contract to the lowest responsible bidder, the courts have been vigilant in not excusing attempts by public entities to circumvent that requirement. (See, e.g., <em>City of Inglewood, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d 861 [because statute required award to lowest responsible bidder, county had no authority to select a bidder that the city thought was \u201csuperior\u201d where both bidders were still responsible]; <em>East Bay Garbage, supra, </em>52 Cal.2d 708 [because lowest responsible bidder statute applied, city could not prefer second-to-lowest bidder]; <em>Marshall, supra, </em>119 Cal.App.4th 1241 [school district had no authority to bypass competitive bidding required by governing statute under the guise of an \u201cemergency\u201d because the situation did not meet statutory criteria for an \u201cemergency\u201d]; <em>Boydston, supra, </em>222 Cal.App.3d 1362 [prospective tenant on ranch owned by sanitation district who made best monetary bid for leasehold was entitled to hearing on his responsibility before district could award leasehold to bidder that district preferred].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-6\">By contrast, where a statute or city charter specifically contemplated discretion on the part of the public entity to look at factors in addition to the monetary benefit of the bid, awards to other than the best monetary bidders have been upheld. (E.g., <em>Cypress Security, supra, </em>184 Cal.App.4th 1003 [city could prefer bidder who contemplated union contract with employees of security services for city human resources department]; <em>Mike Moore\u2019s, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at p. 1307 [city ordinance gave city wide discretion to \u201cwaive defects and technicalities,\u201d and thus city could award towing contract to second-best monetary bidder where best monetary bidder did not give required biographical information on its employees]; <em>Taylor Bus, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.3d 1331, 1335 [decided under statute for contracting of school bus services that \u201cdoes not require the contract be let to the lowest bidder\u201d]; <em>R &amp; A, supra, </em>172 Cal.App.3d at p. 1193 [city had discretion under city charter to reject best monetary bidder\u2019s bids for being unrealistic and containing \u201c \u2018admitted inaccuracies\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-7\">We may observe here that the difference in governing legal frameworks is itself the ultimate product of a legislative determination of a tradeoff between competing sets of values.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1449\">*1449</page-number>Cases where the governing statute requires the public entity to award a contract to the lowest responsible bidder even if it means bypassing a \u201csuperior\u201d bidder emphasize the public interest in guarding against \u201cTammany-style\u201d favoritism and corruption. (See <em>Domar Electric I, supra, </em>9 Cal.4th at p. 173 [\u201cThus, charters requiring competitive bidding are not to be given such a construction as to defeat the object of insuring economy and excluding favoritism and corruption.\u201d]; <em>City of Inglewood, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 866 [\u201cTo hold otherwise as a broad principle would open the door to possible favoritism, fraud or corruption in the letting of other public construction contracts.\u201d]; <em>Marshall, supra, </em>119 Cal.App.4th at p. 1256 [\u201cwe note the 1 \u201c purpose of requiring governmental entities to open the contracts process to public bidding is to eliminate favoritism, fraud and corruption; avoid misuse of public funds; and stimulate advantageous market place competition\u201d \u2019 \u201d]; <em>Boydston, supra, </em>222 Cal.App.3d at p. 1368 <em>[\u201cEast Bay Garbage Co. </em>reflects the public policy behind \u00bf1 statutory competitive bidding requirements governing the letting of public contracts: benefit to and protection of the public. . . . \u2018[L]owest responsible bids\u2019 insure the greatest possible value for the least expenditure. . . . \u2018Highest responsible bids\u2019 secure the largest reasonable return to the public. ... In either case the principle is the same \u2014 assurance that the taxpayers receive the most for their money and that awards are made without favoritism, fraud or corruption.\u201d (citations omitted)]; <em>Kajima, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 314 [\u201c \u2018 \u201cThe provisions of statutes, charters and ordinances requiring competitive bidding in the letting of municipal contracts are for the purpose of inviting competition, to guard against favoritism, improvidence, extravagance, fraud and corruption, and to secure the best work or supplies at the lowest price practicable . . .\u201d \u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-4\">On the other hand, at least some of the cases involving governing legislative schemes that allow for discretion in public contracting often emphasize just that \u2014 discretion. (E.g., <em>Mike Moore\u2019s, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at p. 1303 [tire \u201c \u2018letting of contracts by a governmental entity necessarily requires an exercise of discretion guided by considerations of the public welfare\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Educational &amp; Recreational, supra, </em>65 Cal.App.3d at p. 782 [\u201cWe believe, by adding these words, the Legislature made it clear that the District had the right to use judgment and discretion in awarding the contract and was not bound by the lowest bidder provided it first determined that the prevailing bidder could supply the better service under the enunciated standard.\u201d]; see also <em>Cypress Security, supra, </em>184 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1011-1018 [generally applying abuse of discretion standard].)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1450\">*1450</page-number>2. <em>The Governing Statutes Here</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1342-5\">There is no question that Public Contract Code section 20111 provides the applicable statutory framework in this case. The key language is in subdivision (b), which provides: \u201cThe governing board <em>shall let any contract for a public project, </em>as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 22002, involving an expenditure of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) or more, <em>to the lowest responsible bidder who </em>shall give security as the board requires, or else reject all bids.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1342-6\">This is thus <em>not </em>a case, like <em>Taylor Bus, </em>in which the court specifically noted the governing statute \u201cdoes not require the contract be let to the lowest bidder.\u201d <em>(Taylor Bus, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.3d at p. 1335.)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This case, like <em>East Bay Garbage, City of Inglewood, Boydston, </em>and most importantly, <em>D.H. Williams, </em>falls on the side where the Legislature has carefully circumscribed public entity discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-7\">3. <em>The Difference Between \u201cResponsibility\u201d and \u201cResponsiveness \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1342-8\">a. The Nature of Responsibility</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-9\">The definition of responsibility is fairly easy, because it is now statutory, set forth in section 1103 of the Public Contract Code. We now quote in full:</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1451\">*1451</page-number>\u201c \u2018Responsible bidder,\u2019 as used in this part, means a bidder who has demonstrated the attribute of trustworthiness, as well as quality, fitness, capacity, and experience to satisfactorily perform the public works contract. [][] The Legislature finds and declares that this section is declaratory of existing law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-4\">Readers of Public Contract Code section 1103 will note that it is focused on the <em>bidder, </em>not the bid. The statute speaks in terms of personal qualities that have been \u201cdemonstrated\u201d by the bidder. And the legislative emphasis on responsibility going to the personal quality of the bidder is all the more significant when one recognizes the history of the case law on responsible bidding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-5\">The first California case to confront the nature of what it means to be the lowest <em>responsible </em>bidder was the 1916 case of <em>West, supra, </em>30 Cal.App. 556, which, if you stand back and look at it today, essentially functioned as a <em>responsive </em>bidding case. For a contract to build a city jail, the lowest bidder proposed to use a locking device in a jail construction bid that was \u201cunsatisfactory in both design and operation.\u201d The court held that the city had the authority to prefer the \u201coffer\u201d of the second-lowest bidder who proposed to use the much better \u201cStewart locking device.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 558, 560-561.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-6\">However, in the 1954 case of <em>Raymond, supra, </em>123 Cal.App.2d 626, the clear emphasis was on qualities of the bidder, not the bid. There, a school district validly rejected the lowest bidder\u2019s bid for a school building as coming from a nonresponsible bidder because the lowest bidder had <em>already </em>built a building for the district, and that building had been the subject of \u201cmany complaints,\u201d including doors hung improperly and a leaky heating system. <em>Raymond, </em>in fact, may be the quintessential \u201cresponsibility\u201d case, because the decision boiled down to the idea that the school district had good reason not to trust the lowest bidder to do even a halfway decent job. (See also <em>Stacy &amp; Witbeck, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.4th 1074 [city could validly declare contractor irresponsible in wake of dispute over change orders and city utilities commission finding that contractor knowingly and intentionally submitted a false claim].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-7\">It was that emphasis on the personal qualities of the bidder that was finally picked up by our Supreme Court in the early 1970\u2019s in <em>City of Inglewood, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d 861 and embedded into California common law. <em>City of Inglewood </em>was the genesis of today\u2019s statutory language: the words \u201ctrustworthiness,\u201d \u201cquality,\u201d \u201cfitness\u201d and \u201ccapacity\u201d are original, in the responsible bidder context, to that case. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 867.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-8\">In <em>City of Inglewood, </em>the high court squarely confronted the original <em>West </em>paradigm of a responsibility being defined in terms of an \u201coffer.\u201d And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1452\">*1452</page-number>changed it. The court began by squarely rejecting the concept of \u201crelative superiority\u201d in the context of a statute requiring acceptance of the bid of the lowest responsible bidder. Then, in a footnote, it shifted the emphasis of the <em>West </em>case from the nature of the \u201coffer\u201d to a \u201cproduct\u201d not being satisfactory. We quote the entire passage in the margin.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1344-4\">The <em>City of Inglewood </em>definition was mostly repeated by the court in <em>Taylor Bus, </em>where the court cited <em>City of Inglewood, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at page 867, for a definition that defined responsibility in three of the four words used by <em>City of Inglewood. (Taylor Bus, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.3d at p. 1341, fn. 4 [\u201cResponsibility means the fitness, quality and capacity of the bidder to satisfactorily perform the proposed work.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-5\">b. The Nature of Responsiveness</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-6\">i. <em>responsiveness: the definition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1344-7\"><em>Taylor Bus </em>was the first California case to attempt a formal definition of bid responsiveness, as shown by its need to cite to a Seventh Circuit opinion from the Midwest, <em>James Luterbach Constr. Co. v. Adamkus </em>(7th Cir. 1986) 781 F.2d 599 <em>(Luterbach) </em>for the definition: \u201cA bid is responsive if it promises to do what the bidding instructions demand.\u201d <em>(Taylor Bus, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.3d at p. 1341, citing <em>Luterbach, supra, </em>781 F.2d at p. 601.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-8\"><em>Taylor Bus </em>then went on to elaborate on the nature of nonresponsiveness, contrasting it with nonresponsibility. <em>(Taylor Bus, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1341-1342.) It is from that swath of text that the ideas emerge that responsibility is a (1) \u201ccomplex matter dependent, often, on information received outside the bidding process and requiring, in many cases, an application of subtle judgment\u201d whereas (2) responsiveness is \u201cless complex\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1453\">*1453</page-number>and \u201ccan be determined from the face of the bid.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The <em>Taylor Bus </em>court thus said: \u201cIn most cases, the determination of nonresponsiveness will not depend on outside investigation or information and a determination of nonresponsiveness will not affect the reputation of the bidder.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1342.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-4\">That qualifying hedge \u2014 \u201cIn most cases\u201d \u2014 for the idea that responsiveness does not depend on investigation, was picked up by the court in <em>Valley Crest, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th 1432, in a general introductory discussion of bid law. The <em>Valley Crest </em>court translated \u201cIn most cases\u201d into the word \u201cusually\u201d in a passage that cited page 1342 of <em>Taylor </em>Bus: \u201cUsually, whether a bid is responsive can be determined from the face of the bid without outside investigation or information.\u201d <em>(Valley Crest, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th at p. 1438.) The \u201cusually\u201d passage from <em>Valley Crest </em>was quoted verbatim a short time later by the court in <em>MCM, supra, </em>66 Cal.App.4th at page 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-5\">Not surprisingly, the District here relies on the \u201cusually\u201d passage from <em>MCM </em>(which itself was taken from <em>Valley Crest\u2019s </em>paraphrase of the \u201cIn most cases\u201d language from <em>Taylor Bus) </em>as a lynchpin of its argument in the case before us. After all, Great West\u2019s bid was summarily rejected as nonresponsive only after an <em>external investigation </em>(to be sure, a very cursory external investigation) \u2014 a fact that would normally indicate that the substance of the District\u2019s rejection of Great West\u2019s bid was for nonresponsibility. Well, yes, the District seems to say: <em>Most </em>of the time investigation beyond the face of the bid is a matter of responsibility, not responsiveness. But here, the District says (in a footnote in its brief), the substantive falsity of the \u201cno\u201d answer to the question of any additional licenses takes this case out of the usual variety.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-6\">As we now show: No. In fact, the allegation of falsity only underscores the fact that the rejection here went to nonresponsibility, not nonresponsiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-7\">ii. <em>responsiveness: the practice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1345-8\">Let us emphasize now: We most certainly do <em>not </em>disagree with <em>Taylor Bus\u2019s </em>judicially cautious qualifying language, echoed in <em>Valley Crest </em>and then repeated in <em>MCM, </em>that <em>usually </em>the question of responsiveness can be determined simply by looking exclusively at the face of the bid. Thus we do not, in this case, articulate an absolute rule. And, perhaps, one day there will come a case where the determination of whether a bid is <em>truly </em>nonresponsive \u2014 as distinct from where the bid implicates nonresponsibility \u2014 will require going beyond the face of the bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-9\">That said, no such example is found in the case law. And this case is certainly not a good candidate to be the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1454\">*1454</page-number>The cases directly dealing with whether a given bid was truly nonresponsive are, to date: <em>Taylor Bus, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.3d 1331; <em>Pacific Bell, supra, </em>225 Cal.App.3d 107; <em>Domar Electric II, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th 810; <em>M &amp; B, supra, </em>68 Cal.App.4th 1353; <em>D.H. Williams, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.4th 757; and, most recently, <em>Cypress Security, supra, </em>184 Cal.App.4th 1003.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1346-5\">In all of the cases where a public entity\u2019s determination that a bid was nonresponsive was upheld, the determination of nonresponsiveness was readily ascertainable <em>on the face of the bid. </em>In <em>Taylor Bus, </em>the school district required at least a $10 million comprehensive liability insurance (\u201cCGL\u201d in insurance law) policy. The lowest bidder proffered a $10 million \u201cinsurance trust,\u201d which, noted the <em>Taylor Bus </em>court, entailed \u201cthe acceptance of different risks.\u201d <em>(Taylor Bus, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.3d at p. 1344.) In <em>Pacific Bell, </em>the solicitation by the state agency was for the acquisition of a system \u201cby purchase only\u201d with a specific exclusion for \u201cany proposals for acquisition by lease.\u201d The losing bidder just went ahead and proposed a leased system anyway. <em>(Pacific Bell, supra, </em>225 Cal.App.3d at pp. 110-111.) In <em>Domar Electric II, </em>the bid request required documentation of compliance with an outreach program as defined in a \u201c \u2018good faith documentation checklist.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Domar Electric II, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th at p. 819.) The losing bidder simply \u201cfailed to provide the required good-faith-effort documentation\u201d within the deadline. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In <em>M &amp; B, </em>the bidding instructions plainly required that all bidders have a \u201cclass \u2018A\u2019 \u201d license. The losing bidder listed only class \u201cB\u201d and class \u201cC\u201d licenses. <em>(M &amp; B, supra, </em>68 Cal.App.4th at p. 1357.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1455\">*1455</page-number>By contrast, investigation <em>was </em>required by the public entity in <em>D.H. Williams </em>to assert that the losing bidder\u2019s bid was nonresponsive. The court there readily concluded that the real reason was an assertion of nonresponsibility. As we now explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-4\">4. D.H. Williams <em>Shows the Rejection Here Was for Nonresponsibility, Not Nonresponsiveness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1347-5\">a. The <em>D.H. Williams </em>Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-6\">And so now to <em>D.H. Williams'. A </em>school district requested bids on concrete and fencing work for a new educational center. The bid instructions required listing of all subcontractors, but did not explicitly require the listing of only licensed subcontractors. The lowest bidder listed a particular subcontractor, but that subcontractor\u2019s license had expired. The district staff checked the license status of that subcontractor, and requested a faxed response to the problem of the expired license. The lowest bidder then immediately substituted itself for the work to be done by the unlicensed subcontractor. The staff was unimpressed, though, and recommended the lowest bidder\u2019s bid be rejected as nonresponsive. The board agreed with the staff and awarded the contract to the next lowest bidder. The lowest bidder sought a writ of mandate to have the contract rescinded and have it awarded the contract. <em>(D.H. Williams, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.4th at pp. 761-762.) The trial court agreed, and issued a judgment stopping all work by the second-lowest bidder, and requiring the contract be awarded to the lowest bidder. The district appealed.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1347-7\">The appellate court agreed with the trial court that the school district had incorrectly rejected the lowest bidder\u2019s bid as nonresponsive when the bidder had really been rejected as nonresponsible. As such, the lowest bidder was entitled to at least a \u201cdue process hearing\u201d on the purported nonresponsiblity. <em>(D.H. Williams, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.4th at p. 772.)<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1456\">*1456</page-number>In the process, the <em>D.H. Williams </em>court employed five factors in determining that the rejection of the bid before it was, in \u201clegal effect,\u201d for nonresponsibility rather than nonresponsiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-4\">Before we list those factors, let us hasten to add one threshold matter: literal compliance with the bid request. In <em>D.H. Williams, </em>the losing lowest bidder complied with the <em>literal </em>language of the bid request. (See <em>D.H. Williams, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.4th at pp. 764, 769-770 [making the point that the bid package \u201c[did] not require\u201d listing of only licensed subcontractors].) We thus recognize, as one can derive from the ordinary nonresponsive bidding cases <em>(Taylor Bus, Pacific Bell, Domar Electric II, </em>and <em>M &amp; B) </em>that literal noncompliance with a bid request does indeed make a bid nonresponsive.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1348-5\">That said, the following <em>D.H. Williams </em>factors are for situations where, as in <em>D.H. Williams, </em>there is literal compliance, but the public entity still claims the bid was nonresponsive. Here they are:</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-6\">(1) <em>The complexity of the problem and the ensuing need for subtle administrative judgment. </em>(See <em>D.H. Williams, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.4th at p. 766; see also <em>id. </em>at p. 764, quoting <em>Taylor Bus, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1341-1342 [contrasting responsibility determination as a complex process with responsiveness determination as practically a ministerial one involving no exercise of agency discretion].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-7\">(2) <em>The need for \u201c \u2018information received outside the bidding process. \u2019 \u201d (D.H. Williams, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.4th at p. 764, italics added, quoting <em>Taylor Bus, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1341-1342.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-8\">(3) <em>Whether the problem is the sort that is susceptible to categorical hard and fast lines, or whether it is better handled on a \u201ccase-by-case\u201d basis. </em>(See <em>D.H. Williams, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.4th at p. 767 [noting that problem of erroneous listing of unlicensed subcontractor required case-by-case determination].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-9\">(4) <em>The potential for \u201c \u2018adverse impact on the professional or business reputation of the bidder.\u2019 \u201d (D.H. Williams, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.4th at p. 764, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1457\">*1457</page-number>italics added, quoting <em>Taylor Bus, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1341-1342; see also <em>D.H. Williams, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.4th at p. 766 [noting a determination that a contract intentionally listed an unlicensed subcontractor was a \u201cserious matter\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-4\">(5) <em>The potential that \u201cinnocent bidders\u201d are subject to \u201carbitrary or erroneous disqualification from public works contracting. \u201d (D.H. Williams, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.4th at p. 766, italics added; <em>id. </em>at p. 767.) [This factor was also restated as whether any \u201cpurpose of the Public Contract Code would be served\u201d by the disqualification of the bid.]</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-5\">b. Application of the Relevant Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-6\">As a threshold matter, we observe that Great West, as did the lowest bidder in <em>D.H. Williams, </em>complied literally with the bid request. There was a question. Great West answered it. Period. The District in fact concedes as much in a footnote in its brief, where it hangs its hat on the purported falsity of the answer, not its nonexistence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-7\">Turning then to the application of the <em>D.H. Williams </em>factors, we find they all support the conclusion that the District\u2019s rejection of Great West\u2019s bid was \u201cin legal effect\u201d for nonresponsibility, not nonresponsiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-8\"><em>The complexity of the problem and the ensuing need for subtle administrative judgment. </em>Quite obviously, the District\u2019s concern in asking for all related and associated licenses went directly to a valid concern that contracts only go to the lowest <em>responsible </em>bidder. The question was asked so the District could check up on the history of is bidders so it could see whether, as in <em>Raymond, </em>the contractor had a history of shoddy workmanship.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-9\">However, the question of whether a shoddy contractor might <em>hide </em>its past by answering \u201cno\u201d to the associated license question or whether \u2014 as in <em>D.H. Williams </em>\u2014 the listing might be the result of inadvertence or oversight, is a question of some complexity necessarily requiring some administrative judgment. There is an obvious difference between an innocent forgetting to list some joint venture that an employee might have been involved in years ago and the deliberate concealment of the fact that a license was yanked or suspended for misconduct. But that requires some investigation and factfinding. And of course puts the matter in the \u201cresponsibility\u201d as distinct from \u201cresponsive\u201d category.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-10\"><em>The need for \u201c \u2018information received outside the bidding process. \u2019 \u201d </em>Great West\u2019s answer was responsive <em>on the face </em>of its bid. The District staff <em>had </em>to go outside the bidding process to derive the idea that the answer was false. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1458\">*1458</page-number>Not to give Great West a responsibility hearing under those circumstances effectively made the staff\u2019s initial determination the last word on the issue, and assumed the staff was infallible in its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-4\"><em>Whether the problem is the sort that is susceptible of categorical hard and fast lines, or whether it is better handled on a \u201ccase-by-case\u201d basis. </em>The problem of a purportedly false answer to a bid request as to associated licenses is quite different from the classic instances of nonresponsive bidding in the case law: We want $10 million worth of CGL insurance, not some flimsy substitute <em>(Taylor Bus). </em>We want to buy the system; we don\u2019t want to lease it from you <em>(Pacific Bell). </em>We want you to have a subcontractor outreach program, not just ignore that request <em>(Domar Electric II). </em>And we want you to tell us who your subcontractors are, not just leave the space blank <em>(M &amp; B). </em>By contrast, the purported failure to disclose an associated license (particularly any that were related to joint ventures or which go back over 15 years and which may not substantively reflect on the bidder\u2019s conduct) is a matter much more suited to a hearing, factfinding and administrative judgment, rather than summary rejection based on staff checking.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-5\"><em>The potential for \u201c \u2018adverse impact on the professional or business reputation of the bidder.\u2019 \u201d </em>In this case the District rejected Great West\u2019s bid for dishonesty. Need we say more?</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-6\"><em>The potential that \u201cinnocent bidders\u201d are subject to \u201carbitrary or erroneous disqualification from public work contracting. \u201d </em>Rejection for purportedly not disclosing <em>associated </em>licenses is, as the facts of this case may show, particularly vulnerable to abuse: While the question does reflect a valid public entity interest in ascertaining the history of any bidder (a fact which itself points toward responsibility, not responsiveness), it can readily serve as a trap for the unwary and a conduit for favoritism. Rejection on that basis <em>without a hearing </em>smells of a concerted effort by the District to find some reason, any reason, to reject the lowest bidder\u2019s contract. And particularly here, where there is at least the allegation <em>(never squarely confronted by the District) </em>that it used a double standard in evaluating Great West\u2019s bid and the winners\u2019 bids.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-7\">Clearly then, the District was incorrect in rejecting Great West\u2019s lowest bid as nonresponsive. By the same token, the trial court erred in agreeing with the District.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-8\">C. The Proposed Amended Pleading</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-9\">Having now determined that the Irvine Unified School District incorrectly summarily dismissed Great West\u2019s bid as \u201cnonresponsive,\u201d certain conclusions flow: Primarily, as shown in <em>D.H. Williams, </em>Great West was entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1459\">*1459</page-number>a hearing that it didn\u2019t get, and that hearing should have been afforded <em>prior </em>to the District\u2019s <em>not </em>awarding it the contract. Under <em>Kajima, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th 305, Great West <em>may </em>be entitled to recover its bid preparation costs, depending, of course, on what the results of the hearing to which it was entitled would have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-4\">But that claim is getting ahead of ourselves.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> For the moment, all we have to do is ascertain whether the trial court abused its discretion in rejecting Great West\u2019s admittedly belated request to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-5\">The answer is: The order must be reversed so that the trial court can make its decision in light of the correct law. In denying the request to amend, the trial court operated under two incorrect assumptions:</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-6\">First, it categorically assumed that the District was correct in summarily rejecting Great West\u2019s bid as nonresponsive. As we have showed at length, under <em>D.H. Williams, </em>Great West was entitled to a hearing on its responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-7\">Two, the trial court categorically assumed that the allegations of unequal treatment against Great West and in favor of the two winners were of no relevance to the case. As we have shown, to accept that point is to give the District the benefit of its own wrong in withholding requested information until after it could be timely included in Great West\u2019s moving papers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-8\">An exercise of discretion cannot be upheld when it is founded on incorrect legal premises. As the court said in <em>Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State University </em>(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 393 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 644]: \u201cBut a reasoned decision based on the reasonable view of the scope of discretion is still an abuse of judicial discretion <em>when it starts from a mistaken premise, </em>even though nothing about the exercise of discretion is, in ordinary-language use of the phrase, \u2018beyond the bounds of reason.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-9\">Other authorities to the same effect are: <em>City of Sacramento v.

Section 1087 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides in its entirety as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-12\">\u201cThe writ may be either alternative or peremptory. The alternative writ must command the party to whom it is directed immediately after the receipt of the writ, or at some other specified time, to do the act required to be performed, or to show cause before the court at a time and place then or thereafter specified by court order why he has not done so. The peremptory writ must be in a similar form, except that the words requiring the party to show cause why he has not done as commanded must be omitted.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1328-12\"> An interesting point here: Each prayer had a paragraph number, with the first three prayers numbered 1, 2, and 3. But the last two were numbered 6 and 7.

Williams, </em>where the plaintiff bidder actually <em>prevailed </em>at trial, got a judgment requiring it be awarded the contract, the judgment was appealed by the defendant school district and thus judgment was stayed, and during the pendency of the appeal the work was completed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1332-8\"> \u201cIrvine Unified School District [sometimes hereafter referred to as \u2018District\u2019] prepared its Bid Package to obtain relevant and material information from interested applicants. The District was and is not limited as to what information it can request. After receipt and review of the applications, the District determined that the response provided by Great West Contractors, Inc. [sometimes hereafter referred to as Great West] to Question 5 was incomplete and inaccurate. This rendered the bid non-responsive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-9\">\u201cBased on this, the Court finds that the District had sufficient cause to deem the bid of Great West to be non-responsive and to reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1332-10\">\u201cEven if the Court were to find that Great West had a due process right to a hearing, the remedy would merely be to issue a writ of mandate to the District compelling a hearing. The award of the construction contract to Great West would not have been the appropriate remedy in this case. Therefore, the relief sought does not correspond to the injury alleged. Great West would, at best, be entitled to a hearing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1333-7\"> No. It wouldn\u2019t have confused us in the slightest. Had an amendment been allowed and no action was otherwise taken to adjudicate it, any purported appeal would have been dismissed for lack of a final judgment. (See <em>Morehart v. County of Santa Barbara </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 725, 743 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 804, 872 P.2d 143] [\u201cAccordingly, we hold that an appeal cannot be taken from a judgment that fails to complete the disposition of all the causes of action between the parties even if the causes of action disposed of by the judgment have been ordered to be tried separately, or may be characterized as \u2018separate and independent\u2019 from those remaining.\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1334-11\"> To be fair to the District\u2019s counsel, the question was posed as to why JRH had the early access when, upon review of the record, we learned that it was Construct 1 who had that access.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1335-7\"> Presumably, if the discrepancy were some figment of Great West\u2019s counsel\u2019s imagination, the District would have been eager to demonstrate it and lay the issue to rest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1335-8\"> Because Great West was never afforded a hearing, the conflict in the factual assertions\u2014 did the District <em>know </em>that the winning bidders, like Great West, had also not listed all associated licenses? \u2014 remains as yet unlitigated at any level.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1336-9\"> In this regard, we note another practical factor that shows just how ephemeral is the opportunity to present to an appellate court the issue of the validity of a determination of nonresponsiveness \u2014 the relative incentive structure bearing on what an aggrieved contractor can obtain by way of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-10\">It is established law that a contractor wrongfully denied a public contract by a public entity can recover bid preparation costs but not lost profits. <em>(Kajima, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 308 [\u201cWe conclude bid preparation costs but not lost profits are available under a theory of promissory estoppel.\u201d].) As Great West\u2019s counsel pointed out in oral argument before this court, the rule has this effect: The main incentive for a bidder who has been wrongfully denied a public contract is to bring litigation that seeks to have the public contract ultimately awarded to it. And since such litigation is necessarily a prolonged process, which can entail a victory consisting of an order for a new request for bids and rebidding (as happened in <em>Konica, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.3d 449 [where university had no discretion to excuse large deviation by winning bidder, university was required to publish new request for bids within 30 days of remittitur]), even more time will pass during which the relief request can be mooted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1337-9\"> (See, e.g., Greenwood, <em>Looting: The Puzzle of Private Equity </em>(Fall 2008) 3 Brook. J. Corp. Fin. &amp; Com. L. 89, 92 [\u201cBoss Tweed\u2019s associate George Washington Plunkitt contended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1446\">*1446</page-number>that while this \u2018dishonest graft\u2019 is wrong, the Tweed machine limited its own activities to \u2018honest graft:\u2019 giving government work only to his supporters who provided just as good service as anyone else.\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1338-8\"> As noted above, <em>D.H. Williams </em>was similarly moot because all construction had been completed by the time the appellate court could consider the case. (See <em>D.H. Williams, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.4th at p. 763, fn. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-9\"><em>M &amp; B </em>was a case where a public agency required, in its first invitation for bids, a \u201cClass A\u201d license for all bidders. The lowest bidder on the first invitation, however, lacked that class of license. Before the contract was awarded, the lowest bidder sued and obtained a writ of mandate which caused the agency to issue a second invitation for bids. However, the lowest bidder the first time was not the lowest bidder the second time, so the contract went to another company anyway. The case was thus moot. Even so, the <em>M &amp; B </em>court readily agreed that the propriety of the writ of mandate \u201cinvolves a matter of public interest which is likely to recur.\u201d <em>(M &amp; B, supra, </em>68 Cal.App.4th at p. 1358.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-10\">The District attempts to distinguish <em>M &amp; B </em>by saying, \u201cA public entity\u2019s right to set the overall qualifications for the contractors it desires for a given project also contrasts sharply with [this case], which again merely pertains to a contractor omitting responsive information in its bid package.\u201d No. The District\u2019s argument is circular: It asks us to assume its position on the merits is correct, namely that Great West\u2019s bid was in substance nonresponsive. But that\u2019s the issue in the case to be decided, not a premise on which to distinguish <em>M &amp; B.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1338-11\">Similarly, there is <em>Marshall. </em>In <em>Marshall, </em>a school district tried to award a project to a particular contractor without competitive bidding on the theory that there was an \u201cemergency.\u201d A trial court disagreed, and ordered the contract rescinded and the case rebid. As events played out, though, the bidder who brought the litigation lost out in the rebidding. Even so, the <em>Marshall </em>court had no qualms about noting that the merits of the case should be considered because it clearly affected the public interest. <em>(Marshall, supra, </em>119 Cal.App.4th at p. 1250.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-12\">The District here attempts to distinguish <em>Marshall </em>as it did <em>M&amp;B </em>by again arguing there is a sharp contrast in the two cases. Asserts the District: The \u201cbroad interest in Marshall contrasts sharply with the narrow issue presented here: the District\u2019s determination that Appellant failed to provide responsive answers in its bids.\u201d No. This case presents an issue of major public importance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1339-8\"> The two cases are <em>Valley Crest, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th 1432 and <em>Ghilotti, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th 897, both decided in 1996. Both were cases where the public entity only wanted bids that provided that the bidder would itself do at least 50 percent of the work, as distinct from subcontracting it out. In <em>Valley Crest, </em>the lowest bidder submitted a bid that called for 83 percent subcontracting \u2014 pretty hard to ignore \u2014 and the appellate court ultimately held that the entity did <em>not </em>have the discretion to excuse the discrepancy from the bid request. (Technically, the entity fudged the process a bit by allowing the lowest bidder another chance to submit its bid, based on the fiction that the 83 percent was a \u201cmistake.\u201d The appellate court was not fooled.) By contrast, in <em>Ghilotti, </em>the discrepancy was a mere 5.5 percent (the bid called for 55.5 percent subcontracted work), which was one of two points on which the <em>Ghilotti </em>court distinguished <em>Valley Crest. </em>(See <em>Ghilotti, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at p. 911.) (The other point was that rather ham-fisted attempt by the entity in <em>Valley Crest </em>to allow the winning bidder to correct its \u201cmistake\u201d by withdrawing its bid. (See <em>ibid.)) </em>There is a passage in <em>Ghilotti </em>that says: \u201cWe find <em>Valley Crest </em>distinguishable from this case. To the extent its reasoning is inconsistent with ours, we respectfully disagree.\u201d <em>(Ghilotti, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th at p. 909.) However, since <em>Valley Crest </em>never questions the principle on which <em>Ghilotti </em>was decided, namely that public entities have discretion to discard <em>immaterial </em>deviations from bid requests, the \u201cdisagree\u201d line was unnecessary. There was nothing in <em>Ghilotti </em>to disagree with <em>Valley Crest.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b1341-5\"> A corollary of the tradeoff between protecting the public fisc and affording agencies the discretion to pick the best bidder is the distinction in the case law between services and building contracts. Courts considering public contracts for services have recognized that services tend to be more individuated than construction and have accordingly allowed the public entity more room to accept something less than the best monetary bid, i.e., to use their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1450\">*1450</page-number>own judgment in determining the best bid, not necessarily the most profitable. (E.g., <em>Cypress Security, supra, </em>184 Cal.App.4th 1003 [contract was for security services at city human resources agency]; <em>Cyr, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.2d 22 [exclusive contract for publication of city\u2019s public notices, hence circulation of competing newspapers was of more importance than nominal cost].) The point was made explicitly in <em>Educational &amp; Recreational, supra, </em>65 Cal.App.3d 775, a case which, like <em>Taylor Bus, </em>centered on a contract for school bus services: <em>\u201cService-type contracts are unique and are treated differently by the courts. </em>All bidders are vying to demonstrate that they can perform the busing contract at the lowest possible figure consistent with proper and satisfactory service.\u201d <em>(Educational &amp; Recreational, </em>at p. 785, italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b1342-11\"> Subdivision (c) of section 22002 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-12\">\u201c(c) \u2018Public project\u2019 means any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-13\">\u201c(1) Construction, reconstruction, erection, alteration, renovation, improvement, demolition, and repair work involving any publicly owned, leased, or operated facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-14\">\u201c(2) Painting or repainting of any publicly owned, leased, or operated facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-15\">\u201c(3) In the case of a publicly owned utility system, \u2019\u2019public project\" shall include only the construction, erection, improvement, or repair of dams, reservoirs, powerplants, and electrical transmission lines of 230,000 volts and higher.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b1342-16\"> The offbeat use of the word \u201clet\u201d for \u201caward\u201d is of course recognized by Black\u2019s Law Dictionary. (See Black\u2019s Law Diet. (9th ed. 2004) p. 986 [giving a third level definition of the verb \u201clet\u201d as \u201cTo award (a contract), esp. after bids have been submitted . . .\u201d].) The Oxford English Dictionary indicates that the use of \u201clet\u201d to mean the temporary possession or use of land (\u201clet\u201d as an archaic synonym for rent out) has Anglo-Saxon origins predating the Norman Conquest. (See 8 Oxford English Diet. (2d ed. 1989) p. 845.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1344-9\"> First, here is the main text: \u201cThere is no basis for the application of a relative superiority concept under that section, and <em>if petitioners applied such standard in selecting Swinerton rather than Argo as the contractor the award cannot stand.\u201d (City of Inglewood, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 867, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-10\">To that sentence, the high court appended this footnote, shifting the focus of <em>West: \u201cWest </em>v. <em>Oakland, supra, </em>30 Cal.App. 556, 560, states: \u2018The term \u201clowest responsible bidder\u201d has been held to mean the lowest bidder whose offer <em>best </em>responds in quality, fitness, and capacity to the particular requirements of the proposed work.\u2019 (Italics added.) While it is possible to interpret the use of the term \u2018best\u2019 as meaning that the standard to be applied is one of relative superiority, an examination of the holding of <em>West </em>as well as other cases which quote its language (e.g., <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Fresno City Unified Sch. Dist., supra, </em>123 Cal.App.2d 626, 629) reveals that this is not the intention since these cases hold that the lowest bidder was properly rejected as not responsible either because (as in <em>West) </em>his product was not satisfactory or (as in <em>Raymond) </em>because he was found to have provided poor workmanship in another public project.\u201d <em>(City of Inglewood, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at pp. 867-868, fn. 5.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b1346-6\"> There are, of course, a number of other cases whose main focus was on two other aspects of the problem:</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-7\">(1) whether the <em>scope </em>of the statutory authority allowed the public entity to require a given term in a bid in the first place (e.g., <em>Domar Electric I, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th 161 [city could validly require compliance with contractor outreach program]; <em>Monterey Mechanical, supra, </em>44 Cal.App.4th 1391 [sanitation district precluded from going beyond statutory criteria to satisfy affirmative action goal]; <em>Pacific Bell, supra, </em>225 Cal.App.3d 107 [scope of special statute governing procurement of data-processing and telecommunications services]); or</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-8\">(2) whether the public entity had discretion to <em>excuse </em>clear nonresponsiveness readily ascertainable from the face of the bid (e.g., <em>Menefee, supra, </em>163 Cal.App.3d 1175 [county had discretion to excuse lowest bidder\u2019s failure to sign because bid was still binding]; <em>Konica, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.3d 449 [university did not have discretion to excuse deviation from required performance specifications]; <em>Valley Crest, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.4th 1432 [city had no discretion to excuse 33 percent deviation from 50 percent no-subcontracting requirement]; <em>Ghilotti, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th 897 [city did have discretion to excuse 5.5 percent deviation from 50 percent no-subcontracting requirement]; <em>MCM, supra, </em>66 Cal.App.4th 359 [city did not have discretion to waive deviation from requirement to list all subcontractors]; <em>Cypress Security, supra, </em>184 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1015-1018 [city had discretion to (a) determine bid was not nonresponsive as to price because evaluator could still make straight-line comparison with rival\u2019s bid; (b) determine that exceeding page limit was not material deviation; and (c) look to other evidence of financial strength despite absence of required certified financial statements]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1347-8\"> By this time the work had been \u201csubstantially concluded\u201d by the second-lowest bidder (see <em>D.H. Williams, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.4th at p. 763, fn. 2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b1347-9\"> While the appellate court agreed with the trial court on the responsiveness-responsiblity issue, it reversed the judgment requiring the contract be awarded to the lowest bidder, and directed the trial judge to order the school district to offer the contract to the lowest bidder within 15 days, unless before the 15 days were up the District provided notice to the lowest bidder that its deemed it not responsible and offered the lowest bidder a due process hearing on that determination. <em>(D.H. Williams, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.4th at p. 772.) The <em>D.H. Williams </em>court reasoned that in requiring the school district to award the contract to the lowest bidder directly, the trial court deprived the school district of the opportunity to determine whether the lowest bidder really was responsible. Obviously if not, the school district would be under no obligation to award it the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1456\">*1456</page-number>In the present case, the District has made no request that, in the event of reversal, the trial court should be ordered to require the District to, as in <em>D.H. Williams, </em>first provide notice that Great West is deemed not responsible and then offer Great West a due process hearing on that determination. Nor do we have any need to opine on any possible future due process hearing on remind after reversal. That question is, at this moment, premature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b1348-11\"> Perhaps we should, following <em>Taylor Bus\u2019s </em>example, insert the idea of \u201cusually.\u201d But we will leave that task to the future, if at all. It is, however, interesting to note that just as there are no cases where nonresponsiveness was found by going outside the four comers of the bid, so are there no cases where a determination of nonresponsibility could be based on literal noncompliance with the bid request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b1351-10\"> We need not speculate at this juncture about the precise extent of any future claims by Great West against the District.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1352-9\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1425.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
