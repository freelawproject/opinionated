We order him disbarred.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">\n<em>A. O\u2019Meara\u2019s Conduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">The following facts either were found by the PCC or are supported by the record. The conduct code violations at issue stem from O\u2019Meara\u2019s representation of Anita and James Conant in a personal injury lawsuit. On May 19, 2005, Ms. Conant was involved in a car accident in Pennsylvania. She was stopped at a red light when her car was rear-ended by a paving truck driven by an employee of its owner, Lyons &amp; Hohl Paving, Inc. She suffered a severe spinal cord injury and is now a ventilator-dependent quadriplegic. At the time of the accident, she was forty-seven years old. She and her husband lived in Hampton with their three adult children. Mr. Conant owned his own electrical business, and Ms. Conant was the postmaster in New Castle.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">Immediately after the accident, Ms. Conant was intubated for respiratory failure and flown by helicopter to the hospital at the University of Pennsylvania, where she remained for twenty-three days in critical condition. While in Pennsylvania, she underwent several surgeries to stabilize her condition, including a cervical spinal fusion to insert steel rods into her spine, a tracheotomy to insert a permanent tracheal ventilator upon which she is dependent to breathe, and the installation of a feeding tube.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">Mr. Conant flew home to New Hampshire five days after the accident. Before flying back to Pennsylvania on May 25, he met with O\u2019Meara at a fast food restaurant near the airport to discuss the possibility of O\u2019Meara representing the Conants in a personal injury lawsuit. As a result of the meeting, Mr. Conant retained O\u2019Meara and signed a one-page contingent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>fee agreement, which provided that O\u2019Meara would be paid 33.33% of the \u201cgross amount recovered\u201d in the case, and that the Conants would be responsible for all expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">On or about June 3, approximately ten days after the Conants retained him, O\u2019Meara learned that the paving company had insurance coverage totaling $11 million. The insurance company retained Robert S. Davis, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to represent the paving company and its employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">On November 3, 2005, O\u2019Meara filed a personal injury lawsuit on behalf of the Conants in a Pennsylvania federal court. On December 1,2005, Davis informed O\u2019Meara that the insurer did not contest liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">O\u2019Meara sent Davis a letter dated December 8,2005, stating, in pertinent part: \u201cAs I have indicated on numerous occasions previously, this is a policy limits case. If said limits are not paid, the Conant family has instructed me to proceed to trial.\u201d However, O\u2019Meara was not authorized to settle the case for the insurance policy limits, and he sent the December 8 letter knowing that he lacked this authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">On January 13,2006, O\u2019Meara and Davis discussed settlement. O\u2019Meara told Davis that the Conants would release the paving company and its employee from liability in exchange for receiving the $11 million policy limits, less any advance payments. That day, O\u2019Meara spoke with Mr. Conant who confirmed that O\u2019Meara was <em>not </em>authorized to settle the case for $11 million, even if the insurer offered this amount. Between January 13 and January 24, O\u2019Meara did not inform Davis that he lacked the authority to settle the case for $11 million or that, to the extent he ever had such authority, it had been revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">On January 24, O\u2019Meara and Davis again discussed settlement. Davis agreed to settle the case for $11 million, but O\u2019Meara told Davis that the Conants would not settle for this amount. Davis responded that he believed the parties had an enforceable settlement agreement because, on January 13, O\u2019Meara had offered to settle for $11 million, and, on January 24, Davis had agreed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">On January 24, Davis sent O\u2019Meara a letter confirming his understanding of the parties\u2019 negotiations to date: \u201cI write to confirm my telephone acceptance [today]... on behalf of the defendants and their insurer, of the plaintiffs\u2019 . . . offer to settle all aspects of this case for . . . $11,000,000. Subsequent to the above referenced acceptance of the plaintiffs\u2019 settlement offer you stated that the plaintiffs now withdraw the offer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">Also on January 24, O\u2019Meara sent a letter to Davis, which he dated January 20, four days earlier, stating, in pertinent part: \u201cAs we discussed on the phone this morning, this correspondence should serve to inform you that my clients have withdrawn their settlement demand for the policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>limits of $11,000,000.\u201d Upon receipt of O\u2019Meara\u2019s letter dated January 20, Davis wrote O\u2019Meara a letter stating, \u201cI trust that the date used on the [January 20] letter was simply the result of inadvertence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">In a subsequent discussion, Mr. Conant expressed dismay that O\u2019Meara had stated in his January 24 letter (dated January 20) that the Conants \u201cwithdrew\u201d their demand to settle the case for $11 million. Mr. Conant told O\u2019Meara that he did not understand how the Conants could have withdrawn a settlement demand they had never made. O\u2019Meara told Mr. Conant that Davis had simply misconstrued their conversations.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">On or about January 25, 2006, O\u2019Meara and two financial planners met with the Conants to discuss settlement. Mr. Conant expressed concern that O\u2019Meara had communicated a demand to settle the case for $11 million even though he had no authority to do so and even though $11 million was insufficient to support Ms. Conant\u2019s future needs. On December 26,2005, a certified life planner had opined that the total cost to sustain Ms. Conant for the rest of her life was over $15 million. The planner revised his estimate on January 26,2006, to more than $23 million. Because O\u2019Meara had erred by demanding to settle for $11 million, Mr. Conant suggested that he reduce his fee. O\u2019Meara agreed to consider doing so and, ultimately suggested reducing his fee by $166,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">On January 31, the insurer filed a motion to enforce the alleged January 24 settlement agreement. O\u2019Meara objected to the motion, arguing that his December 8 demand was not an \u201coffer\u201d to be \u201caccepted\u201d by the insurer, but rather a solicitation of an offer from the insurer, and that on January 24, the Conants had rejected the insurer\u2019s offer to settle the case for $11 million. O\u2019Meara conceded that the Conants \u201chad not authorized [him]\u201d to settle the case for $11 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">The dispute between the insurer and the Conants was scheduled for mediation in federal court on February 27, only days before Ms. Conant was scheduled for surgery that her family feared she would not survive. O\u2019Meara met with Mr. Conant and the other members of the Conant family on February 25 to prepare for the mediation. At some point, Mr. Conant shared with O\u2019Meara that the family believed that, to meet Ms. Conant\u2019s projected needs, $12.5 million needed to be placed in an annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Mr. Conant asked O\u2019Meara what he thought his fee should be in the event the case settled for the policy limits of $11 million. O\u2019Meara said that he would be willing to reduce his $3.67 million potential fee by $500,000 if this occurred, angering Mr. Conant. Mr. Conant\u2019s brother, Craig, said that he had been informed that a $2 million fee was reasonable in a case such as this one. None of the other Conants responded to Craig\u2019s comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">The exchange between O\u2019Meara and the Conant family became heated, and at one point, Ms. Conant mouthed to O\u2019Meara: \u201cTell me why I should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>not fire you now?\u201d When asked what would happen if the Conants fired him, O\u2019Meara responded that litigation \u201cgets ugly.\u201d He also told the Conants that if they terminated his services, he would sue them for his one-third contingency fee and \u201cwould win.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Ultimately, the Conants and O\u2019Meara agreed to modify the original contingent fee agreement. As modified, instead of stating that O\u2019Meara would be paid 33.83% of the gross recovery in the case, the agreement stated that his fee was \u201cto be negotiated.\u201d Both Mr. Conant and O\u2019Meara initialed this handwritten change to the original fee agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The next day, February 26, O\u2019Meara faxed Mr. Conant a \u201cMemorandum of Understanding Regarding Fees,\u201d purporting to confirm the modified contingent fee agreement. However, instead of stating that O\u2019Meara\u2019s fee was \u201cto be negotiated,\u201d the memorandum stated: \u201cIf the final settlement offer is no more tha[n] $11,000,000 then the total of all attorneys fees and costs inclusive shall be no more than and no less than[] $2,000,000.\u201d Mr. Conant telephoned O\u2019Meara that day and explained that he would not sign the memorandum because it did not reflect the parties\u2019 February 25 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">On February 27, the day of the mediation, Mr. Conant and other members of his family met O\u2019Meara at the federal courthouse in Pennsylvania. O\u2019Meara said that he would not proceed with the mediation <em>unless </em>he received at least a $2 million fee. O\u2019Meara gave Mr. Conant a new memorandum to sign, which stated: \u201cThe total of all attorneys fees and costs inclusive shall be no more than and no less than[] $2,000,000.00 for all settlements up to 14.5 m[illion] then 20% for all amounts recovered over 14,500,00[0].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Mr. Conant believed that he had no choice but to sign the memorandum because he feared that if he did not do so, O\u2019Meara would refuse to represent the family in the imminent mediation.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">The mediation took place as scheduled. At the mediation, the mediator verified that if the paving company were forced to pay more than $500,000 over its insurance policy limits, it would likely declare bankruptcy. At the end of the mediation, the final offer from the paving company and its insurer was $11.5 million (the policy limits of $11 million plus $500,000). Unhappy with O\u2019Meara\u2019s conduct, the Conants terminated his services effective March 5, 2006. On March 6, the parties settled the underlying personal injury action for $11.5 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">The Conants and O\u2019Meara agreed that the Conants would pay O\u2019Meara an undisputed fee of $750,000, place $1,250,000 in escrow, and arbitrate the issue of how this amount should be divided. They also agreed that the Conants could not claim in the arbitration that O\u2019Meara failed to obtain a reasonable result in their personal injury case.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>During the arbitration, at which the Conants and O\u2019Meara each had counsel, O\u2019Meara testified that, before he left the Conants\u2019 home on February 25, the Conants had agreed to pay him $2 million in fees. Every other witness testified to the contrary, and the PCC found that O\u2019Meara presented false testimony to induce the arbitrators into believing that the Conants had, in fact, agreed on February 25 to the essential terms of what later became the February 27 agreement. Ultimately, the arbitrator panel awarded O\u2019Meara $837,000 of the $1,250,000 held in escrow and awarded the Conants the remaining $413,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\n<em>B. Disciplinary Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">On April 1, 2009, the Attorney Disciplinary Office (ADO) issued a notice of charges to O\u2019Meara, alleging that he had violated New Hampshire Rules of Professional Conduct 1.2(a) (Scope of Representation), 1.7 (Conflict of Interest), 8.4(c) (Deceit and Dishonesty), and 8.4(a) (General Rule). The charges were heard by the PCC\u2019s Hearing Panel in October and November 2009. The Panel found by clear and convincing evidence that O\u2019Meara had committed the charged violations, and recommended disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">In August 2010, the PCC agreed with the Hearing Panel about the rule violations. The PCC originally recommended that O\u2019Meara be suspended from the practice of law for two years. However, disciplinary counsel moved for reconsideration, arguing for disbarment. The PCC granted the motion in part, finding that the correct baseline sanction for O\u2019Meara\u2019s dishonest conduct was disbarment as set forth in Standard 5.11(b) of the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (2005) (Standards). However, the PCC found that disbarment was not the proper sanction because \u201cthe most serious charge [arose] from conduct that occurred after representation of the client was terminated in the context of a fee dispute.\u201d The PCC, therefore, recommended that O\u2019Meara be suspended from the practice of law for three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">\n<em>II. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">In attorney discipline cases, we defer to the PCC\u2019s factual findings if supported by the record, but retain ultimate authority to determine whether, on the facts found, a violation of the rules governing attorney conduct has occurred and, if so, the sanction. <em>Bruzga\u2019s Case, </em>162 N.H. 52, 57 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">\n<em>A. Rules Violations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">We first consider the PCC\u2019s finding by clear and convincing evidence that O\u2019Meara violated the Rules. <em>See </em>Sup. Ct. R. 37A(III)(d)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>\n<em>1. Rule 1.2(a)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Rule 1.2(a) states, in pertinent part: \u201c[A] lawyer shall abide by a client\u2019s decisions concerning the objectives of representation, and ... shall consult \u25a0with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued.\u201d N.H. R. PROF. Conduct 1.2(a). The PCC found that O\u2019Meara violated Rule 1.2(a) because in his December 8, 2005 letter to, and January 13, 2006 conversation with, Davis, he communicated a demand to settle the personal injury case for $11 million even though the Conants had not authorized him to settle for this amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">O\u2019Meara first argues that the PCC mischaracterized the demand as a demand to settle when, in fact, it was a \u201cDumas\u201d demand. <em>See Dumas v. State Farm, Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>111 N.H. 43 (1971). <em>Dumas </em>concerned an insured\u2019s action against a liability insurer for negligent failure to settle tort claims against the insured. <em>Dumas, </em>111 N.H. at 44. Under <em>Dumas, </em>an insured may maintain such an action when the insured has an outstanding judgment against him for an amount in excess of the policy limits, and the case <em>could </em>have been settled within the policy limits. <em>See id. </em>at 44-45. In such a case, an insured tortfeasor may assign his <em>Dumas </em>claim against the insurer to the victim. <em>See id. </em>at 45. O\u2019Meara contends that \u201call he did was make a <em>Dumas </em>demand ... to invite an offer and set up the [insurer] for a failure to make one.\u201d Although O\u2019Meara concedes that he had no authority to settle the case, he asserts that he had the authority to issue a so-called <em>Dumas </em>demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">There is evidence in the record to support the PCC\u2019s finding by clear and convincing evidence that O\u2019Meara communicated a settlement demand to the insurer\u2019s attorney, even though, as he concedes, he lacked the authority to do so. In his January 24 letter (dated January 20), O\u2019Meara referred to his December 8 letter to Davis as a \u201csettlement demand.\u201d The letter specifically stated that his clients \u201chave withdrawn their settlement demand for the policy limits of $11,000,000.\u201d Moreover, Davis\u2019s February 3, 2006 letter to O\u2019Meara supports a finding that O\u2019Meara made a settlement demand. In his February letter, Davis stated: \u201cOn January 13, 2006, . . . [y]ou stated . . . that in exchange for payment of the policy limits of the [insurance] policies, less partial payments and the property damage payment already made,... the corporate defendant and its employee would be fully released.\u201d Davis confirmed the contents of his letter when he testified before the PCC. Because we conclude that there is evidence in the record to support the PCC\u2019s finding that O\u2019Meara communicated a settlement demand, we uphold that finding. In light of our conclusion, we need not address whether O\u2019Meara had the authority to issue a <em>\u201cDumas\u201d </em>demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>We reject O\u2019Meara\u2019s assertion that his settlement demand was not an offer to settle. An \u201coffer\u201d is a promise to do or refrain from doing something provided that the offeree accepts the offer and pays or promises to pay the price of the offer. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1189 (9th ed. 2009). O\u2019Meara\u2019s settlement demand <em>was </em>an offer: it was a promise by his clients to do something (release the defendants from liability) upon the promise of the insurer to pay the offer price ($11 million).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\n<em>2. Rule 1.7</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Rule 1.7(a)(2) provides, in pertinent part: \u201c[A] lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation involves a concurrent conflict of interest. A concurrent conflict of interest exists if... there is a significant risk that the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited ... by a personal interest of the lawyer.\u201d The PCC found that O\u2019Meara violated this Rule when: (1) he threatened to sue the Conants for his contingency fee if they terminated his services; (2) although the parties had agreed to revise the original contingent fee agreement by crossing out the reference to 33.33% and inserting \u201cto be negotiated\u201d in its place, O\u2019Meara further revised the agreement without the Conants\u2019 knowledge or consent so that, as revised, it entitled him to a $2 million fee; and (3) O\u2019Meara threatened to withdraw as counsel on the morning of the mediation so as to secure the $2 million fee. The PCC determined that by engaging in this conduct, O\u2019Meara let his own personal interest in collecting a $2 million fee materially limit his representation of, and duty of loyalty to, the Conants.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The testimony and written statements of the Conants support these findings by clear and convincing evidence. Although O\u2019Meara\u2019s testimony conflicted with that of the Conants, \u201c[a]s a fact-finding tribunal, the [PCC] was at liberty to resolve any conflict in the evidence and to accept or reject such portions of the testimony as it saw fit.\u201d <em>Appeal of Alexander, </em>163 N.H. 397, 403-04 (2012) (quotation omitted) (referring to personnel appeals board); <em>see Budnitz\u2019 Case, </em>139 N.H. 489, 491 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">O\u2019Meara asserts that, in fact, his interests and those of the Conants were aligned. However, there is ample evidence to support the PCC\u2019s finding that O\u2019Meara allowed his interest in securing a $2 million fee to take precedence over his primary obligation to further the Conants\u2019 interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">\n<em>3. Rule 84(c)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">Rule 8.4(c) states, in pertinent part: \u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\u201d The PCC found that O\u2019Meara violated this rule by falsely testifying at the arbitration hearing that the Conants agreed to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>$2 million fee at the February 25 meeting. The PCC reached this conclusion based upon its finding that every other witness contradicted O\u2019Meara\u2019s account of the February 25 meeting. The PCC speculated, as well, that the arbitration panel likely concluded that O\u2019Meara testified falsely about the February 25 meeting because it awarded him a total fee of $1,587,000, instead of the $2 million fee to which he claimed he was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">O\u2019Meara does not dispute that he was the only witness to testify that the parties agreed to his $2 million fee at the February 25 meeting. Nor does he dispute that the arbitration panel did not award him his entire $2 million fee. To the extent that O\u2019Meara contends that the arbitration panel, in fact, found his testimony to be credible, we lack a sufficient record to decide this issue because the panel\u2019s decision was not part of the PCC record and is not part of the record on appeal. Because there is evidence in the record that supports the PCC\u2019s finding by clear and convincing evidence, we uphold it.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\n<em>k- Rule 8.1(a)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Rule 8.4(a) provides that it is \u201cprofessional misconduct for a lawyer to violate or attempt to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d Because we have upheld the PCC\u2019s determination that O\u2019Meara violated several Rules, we necessarily also uphold its conclusion that he violated Rule 8.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">\n<em>B. Sanction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">Having concluded that O\u2019Meara violated the Rules, we turn next to the sanction. We retain the ultimate authority to determine the sanction for a violation of the Rules. <em>Bruzga\u2019s Case, </em>162 N.H. at 60. When determining whether to impose the ultimate sanction of disbarment, we focus not on punishing the offender, but on protecting the public, maintaining public confidence in the bar, preserving the integrity of the legal profession, and preventing similar conduct in the future. <em>Morse\u2019s Case, </em>160 N.H. 538, 546 (2010). We consider the case on its own facts and circumstances in deciding the sanction. <em>Id. </em>The sanction we impose must take into account the severity of the misconduct. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">We look to the STANDARDS for guidance. <em>Id. </em>at 547. Under the STANDARDS, we consider: (a) the duty violated; (b) the lawyer\u2019s mental state; (c) the potential or actual injury caused by the lawyer\u2019s misconduct; and (d) the existence of aggravating or mitigating factors. <em>Id. </em>We first categorize the respondent\u2019s misconduct and identify the baseline sanction. <em>Id. </em>After determining the sanction, we then consider the effect of any aggravating or mitigating factors on the ultimate sanction. <em>Id. </em>When there are multiple misconduct charges, \u201cthe sanction imposed should at least be consistent with the sanction for the most serious instance of misconduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>among a number of violations; it might well be and generally should be greater than the sanction for the most serious misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">We first review the duties O\u2019Meara violated. <em>See id. </em>According to the PCC, O\u2019Meara\u2019s most serious violation was lying to the arbitration panel, in violation of Rule 8.4(c). Equally serious, in our view, is O\u2019Meara\u2019s violation of Rule 1.7(a)(2) by allowing his own interests to interfere with effective representation of the Conants under the circumstances, and, ultimately, by threatening to withdraw from representation on the morning of the mediation unless they acceded to his demand for a $2 million fee. O\u2019Meara\u2019s conduct violated his duties to be truthful and to act in his clients\u2019 best interests. <em>Conner\u2019s Case, </em>158 N.H. 299, 303 (2009). \u201cWe regard these as bedrock duties of the legal profession.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Next, we consider O\u2019Meara\u2019s mental state at the time of his violations, which may be one of intent, knowledge, or negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 304. The volitional nature of the acts, and not the external pressures that could potentially have hindered his judgment, is relevant. <em>Id. </em>The PCC determined that O\u2019Meara acted knowingly, and we agree. <em>See Wyatt\u2019s Case, </em>159 N.H. 285, 307 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Next, we consider the actual or potential injury caused by O\u2019Meara\u2019s misconduct. \u201cThe STANDARDS define \u2018injury\u2019 as harm to a client, the public, the legal system, or the profession which results from a lawyer\u2019s misconduct.\u201d <em>Conner\u2019s Case, </em>158 N.H. at 304 (quotation omitted). Aside from the costs incurred by the Conants for the lengthy fee dispute arbitration, the paramount injury here is injury to the profession. \u201c[I]njury to the integrity of the legal profession is substantial whenever an attorney engages in \u2022deceit.\u201d <em>Bosse\u2019s Case, </em>155 N.H. 128, 132 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Considering the duties violated, O\u2019Meara\u2019s mental state, and the harm and potential harm caused, we conclude, as did the PCC, that the proper baseline sanction is disbarment. \u201cDisbarment is generally appropriate when a lawyer, without the informed consent of elient(s)... engages in representation of a client knowing that the lawyer\u2019s interests are adverse to the client\u2019s with the intent to benefit the lawyer ..., and causes serious or potentially serious injury to the client.\u201d Standards, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 4.31(a). Here, O\u2019Meara knowingly allowed his representation of the Conants to be materially limited by his own interest in obtaining a lucrative fee. On the morning of the mediation, just days before Ms. Conant was scheduled for life-threatening surgery, he gave the Conants an ultimatum: either agree to a $2 million fee or represent themselves in the mediation. This egregious conduct was improper. <em>See </em>N.H. R. PROF. CONDUCT 1.16(b) (attorney may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>withdraw from representation only when \u201cwithdrawal can be accomplished without material adverse effect on the interests of the client\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Disbarment is also generally proper \u201cwhen ... a lawyer engages in .. . intentional conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation that seriously adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice.\u201d Standards, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 5.11(b). \u201cThe privilege of practicing law\u201d comes with \u201cthe concomitant responsibility of truth, candor and honesty. Because no single transgression reflects more negatively on the legal profession than a lie,\u201d attorney misconduct involving dishonesty usually justifies disbarment. <em>Cohen\u2019s Case, </em>143 N.H. 169, 172 (1998) (quotations, brackets, and ellipsis omitted). Here, O\u2019Meara lied under oath when he testified at the arbitration that the Conants agreed to his $2 million fee at the February 25 meeting. Although O\u2019Meara cannot be faulted for vigorously advocating his position in the arbitration, vigorous advocacy cannot include lying to a tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">We next consider the effect of aggravating and mitigating factors. There are no substantial mitigating factors in this case. The PCC found that the only possible mitigating factor was the delay in proceedings. Like the PCC, we give this factor little weight. <em>See Douglas\u2019 Case, </em>156 N.H. 613, 621-22 (2007) (delay generally not considered a mitigating factor). By contrast, there are numerous aggravating factors: (1) O\u2019Meara\u2019s prior disciplinary offense for engaging in similar misconduct \u2014 lying to a tribunal, <em>see O\u2019Meara\u2019s Case, </em>150 N.H. 157, 159 (2003); (2) his selfish motive; (3) his failure to acknowledge any wrongdoing; (4) his substantial experience in the practice of law; and (5) his multiple Rule violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\"> Despite the presence of numerous aggravating factors and the lack of mitigating factors, and even though it recognized that disbarment was the baseline sanction, the PCC recommended suspension because, when O\u2019Meara lied to the arbitration panel, he was no longer the Conants\u2019 attorney and he lied in the context of a fee dispute. We disagree with this reasoning. Even though O\u2019Meara no longer represented the Conants when he lied to the arbitration panel, his conduct adversely reflects upon his fitness to practice law. <em>See Bosse\u2019s Case, </em>155 N.H. at 131. \u201cLawyering involves a public trust and requires an unswerving allegiance to honesty and integrity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cAccordingly, it is the responsibility of every attorney at all times to be truthful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cAs officers of the court, attorneys are prohibited from making false statements of material fact to a tribunal.\u201d <em>Morse\u2019s Case, </em>160 N.H. at 548; see N.H. R. PROF. Conduct, 3.3(a)(1). O\u2019Meara\u2019s false testimony demonstrated a \u201cserious disregard\u201d for the very institutions that he has sworn to protect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>and uphold. <em>Fitzpatrick\u2019s Case, </em>182 N.H. 211, 217 (1989). We have previously disbarred attorneys for engaging in similar misconduct. <em>See id. </em>at 218 (disbarring attorney for lying to PCC); <em>Budnitz\u2019 Case, </em>139 N.H. at 492-93 (disbarring attorney for lying to grand jury and PCC); <em>cf. Astles\u2019 Case, </em>134 N.H. 602, 605-07 (1991) (disbarring attorney for using dishonest and fraudulent means to obtain commercial financing for his own home).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">That O\u2019Meara lied in the context of a fee dispute illustrates that the purpose of his lie was to further his own interest, at the expense of his clients\u2019 interests. If anything, this is an aggravating, not a mitigating, factor. Moreover, O\u2019Meara did more than just lie to the arbitration panel. He demanded to settle his clients\u2019 case for $11 million without any authority to do so. Most significantly, he pressured his clients into agreeing to pay him a $2 million fee because, as the PCC found, he \u201cdid not want a significant fee to slip away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">In light of the egregiousness of O\u2019Meara\u2019s misconduct, the absence of mitigating factors, and the presence of numerous aggravating factors, we conclude that disbarment is the proper sanction. Disbarment is necessary to protect the public and preserve the integrity of the legal profession when, as in this case, an attorney not only selfishly allows his own personal interests to take precedence over his duty of loyalty to his clients, but also lies to a tribunal. No lesser sanction will suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">O\u2019Meara is hereby assessed all expenses incurred by the PCC in the investigation and prosecution of this matter. In the event that O\u2019Meara applies to be readmitted to the bar, he may not do so earlier than three years from the date of this opinion. <em>See </em>Sup. Ct. R. 37A (I)(c). Under no circumstances shall he be readmitted to the bar unless he passes the New Hampshire Bar Examination and the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination and satisfies the other requirements of Supreme Court Rule 37(14).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b206-9\">Dalianis, C.J., and HICKS and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
