We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">The following facts were either found by the trial court or are undisputed. The parties\u2019 final decree of divorce was issued in October 2007. It directed Robin to pay 50% of Martin\u2019s federal income taxes for 2006. In September 2010, Robin filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, listing her obligation under the divorce decree in three separate places. She listed Martin as a creditor holding an unsecured nonpriority claim for $4,519.50 for \u201c2010; divorce settlement\u201d and as a codebtor on a \u201cfederal tax lien.\u201d She also included among her unsecured priority claims a \u201c2006; Federal Tax lien joint with ex husband\u201d in the amount of $5,052.82. In December 2010, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Hampshire found Robin entitled to a discharge. Robin and Martin each petitioned the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for \u201cinnocent spouse\u201d relief<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> from their federal income tax liability for 2006. Her petition was granted; his was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">In July 2011, Martin filed a motion for contempt in the 1st Circuit Court \u2014 Berlin Family Division, asking the court to order Robin to pay 50% of his federal income tax liability for 2006. The court found that, even though \u201cinnocent spouse\u201d relief \u201cchanged the nature of [Robin\u2019s] obligation from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>tax debt to a debt owed [Martin,]\u201d bankruptcy had absolved Robin of her obligation to pay 50% of Martin\u2019s 2006 federal income taxes. The court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">[Robin] sought to have her debt to [Martin] discharged in bankruptcy. Toward [that] end, in her bankruptcy petition [Robin] noticed [Martin] as a creditor for \u201c2010: divorce settlement\u201d in the amount of the original debt to the IRS. [Martin] was duly noticed that he was listed as a creditor and had the opportunity to litigate the issue in the bankruptcy court. [Robin] was granted a bankruptcy and the debt was discharged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The trial court denied Martin\u2019s motion for contempt as well as his request for attorney\u2019s fees. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">On appeal, Martin argues that the trial court erred as a matter of law when it found that Robin\u2019s obligation to pay 50% of his 2006 federal income taxes had been discharged in bankruptcy because he failed to make a showing before the bankruptcy court that her obligation was non-dis-chargeable. Martin also argues that the trial court erred as a matter of law and unsustainably exercised its discretion when it declined to award him attorney\u2019s fees and costs. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">\n<em>I. Dischargeability of Robin\u2019s Debt</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">As an initial matter, we find that this court has jurisdiction to determine the dischargeability of the debt at issue, contrary to Robin\u2019s argument that \u201c[i]n a contested case, whether a debt is nondischargeable is a matter for the Bankruptcy Court alone to decide.\u201d Federal \u201cdistrict courts shall have original <em>but not exclusive </em>jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in or related to cases under title 11,\u201d subject to an exception not at issue here. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1884(b), (e)(2) (2006) (emphasis added). \u2018While it is true that state courts lack jurisdiction to modify or to grant relief from a bankruptcy court\u2019s discharge injunction, they retain . . . concurrent jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1834(b) to construe the discharge and determine whether a particular debt is or is not within the discharge.\u201d <em>Sunbeam Corp. v. Dortch, </em>313 S.W.3d 114, 115-16 (Ky. 2010) (quotation omitted); <em>see Howard v. Howard, </em>336 S.W.3d 433, 442 (Ky. 2011); <em>State of New York High. Ed. v. Rochlitz, </em>505 N.Y.S.2d 354, 356 (Sup. Ct. 1986); <em>In re Grabinski, </em>150 B.R. 427, 432 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">Turning to the merits of the appeal, w\u00e9 find that the trial court erred as a matter of law when it found that Robin\u2019s obligation to pay 50% of Martin\u2019s 2006 federal income taxes had been discharged in bankruptcy. Section 523 of the Bankruptcy Code deals with exceptions to discharge for certain kinds of debts. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523 (2006) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>(a) A discharge under [Chapter 7] does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">(5) for a domestic support obligation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">(15) to a spouse, former spouse, or child of the debtor and not of the kind described in paragraph (5) that is incurred by the debtor in the course of a divorce or separation or in connection with a separation agreement, divorce decree or other order of a court of record, or a determination made in accordance with State or territorial law by a governmental unit....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Certain debts under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a) are non-dischargeable only if the creditor makes the necessary showing in bankruptcy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">Except as provided in subsection (a)(3)(B) of this section, the debtor shall be discharged from a debt of a kind specified in paragraph (2), (4), or (6) of subsection (a) of this section, unless, on request of the creditor to whom such debt is owed, and after notice and a hearing, the court determines such debt to be excepted from discharge under paragraph (2), (4), or (6), as the case may be, of subsection (a) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(c)(1) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">The issue here is whether a debt under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(15) is automatically non-dischargeable in bankruptcy, or whether the creditor must request the bankruptcy court not to discharge the debt. We conclude that since the passage of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA), Pub. L. No. 109-8 (codified as amended at 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523 (2006)), a debt under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(15) is automatically nondischargeable in Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Prior to BAPCPA, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a) (2000) exempted from discharge any debt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-11\">(5) to a spouse, former spouse, or child of the debtor, for alimony to, maintenance for, or support of such spouse or child, in connection with a separation agreement, divorce decree or other order of a court of record, determination made in accordance with State or territorial law by a governmental unit, or property settlement agreement, <em>but not to the extent that </em>\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-12\">(A) such debt is assigned to another entity, voluntarily, by operation of law, or otherwise . . . ; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>(B) such debt includes a liability designated as alimony, maintenance, or support, unless such liability is actually in the nature of alimony, maintenance, or support....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">(15) not of the kind described in paragraph (5) that is incurred by the debtor in the course of a divorce or separation or in connection with a separation agreement, divorce decree or other order of a court of record, a determination made in accordance with State or territorial law by a governmental unit <em>unless </em>\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">(A) the debtor does not have the ability to pay such debt from income or property of the debtor not reasonably necessary to be expended for the maintenance or support of the debtor or a dependent of the debtor and, if the debtor is engaged in a business, for the payment of expenditures necessary for the continuation, preservation, and operation of such business; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">(B) discharging such debt would result in a benefit to the debtor that outweighs the detrimental consequences to a spouse, former spouse, or child of the debtor ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a) (2000) (emphasis added). Also prior to 2005, debts under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(15) were included in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(c)(1) (2000). Thus, a creditor had to make a showing in bankruptcy court in order to preserve the non-dischargeability of the debt under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(15).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">BAPCPA eliminated the balancing tests that the bankruptcy court had to undertake in order to determine whether debts under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(15) were exempt from discharge.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-10\">[TJhere is no longer a distinction made between an alimony, maintenance or support claim and a property settlement.... This change also means that there is no longer a need for the balancing test imposed by former \u00a7 523(a)(15). That provision is now simplified to provide that a debt to a spouse, former spouse or child of the debtor that is incurred by the debtor in the course of a divorce or separation and that is not covered by \u00a7 523(a)(5) is excepted from discharge, whether the obligation is the product of an agreement, divorce decree, order of a court of record or determination made in accordance with state or territorial law by a governmental unit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">Fitzgerald, <em>We All Live in a Yellow Submarine: BAPCPA\u2019s Impact on Family Law Matters, </em>31 S. Ill. U. L. J. 563, 566 (2007).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Consequently, as a debtor\u2019s ability to pay is no longer a factor bankruptcy courts consider when analyzing whether a debt is non-dischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(15), courts do not engage in any balancing test of whether a debtor would gain more than his or her domestic relations creditors if the debtor were granted a discharge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">... As amended, \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(5) and (a)(15) provide that a chapter 7 bankruptcy does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt [which falls under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(5) and (15)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\">... As amended, \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(5) and (a)(15) provide that a chapter 7 bankruptcy does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt [which falls under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(5) and (15)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-7\"><em>Prensky v. Clair Greifer LLP, </em>No. 09-6200, 2010 WL 2674039, at *4 (D.N.J., June 30, 2010) (citation omitted). Since 2005, a debt under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(15) is automatically non-dischargeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Robin\u2019s obligation under the divorce decree to pay 50% of Martin\u2019s 2006 federal income taxes was automatically non-dischargeable because it was a debt under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(15). Robin argues that the obligation was not a \u201cdebt... to a... former spouse\u201d under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(15) because she had to pay the IRS rather than Martin. She contends that the IRS relieved her of that obligation when it granted her innocent spouse relief. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\"><em>Howard v. Howard, </em>a recent case from Kentucky, is instructive. In that case, a divorce decree directed the husband to make payments on a car loan that he held jointly with his wife. <em>Howard, </em>336 S.W.3d at 435. The husband filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, of which the wife was notified but in which she did not participate. <em>Id. </em>at 436. After the husband received a bankruptcy discharge, the trial court held him in contempt for failing to make payments on the car loan. <em>Id. </em>The Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed. <em>Id. </em>The court concluded that, after BAPCPA, a debt under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(15) is automatically non-dischargeable. <em>Id. </em>at 441-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">The court rejected the husband\u2019s argument that, because he was ordered to make payments to the bank rather than directly to the wife, his debt was not a debt to a former spouse within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(15).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-11\">While the creditor presumably accepted Shane\u2019s obligation to it under the car loan had been discharged in bankruptcy, Shane\u2019s obligation to Sondra under the divorce decree to make the payments to the creditor was excepted from discharge under 11 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(15) because this constitutes a debt to a former spouse under a divorce decree. <em>Debt </em>is defined in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(12) (2007) as \u201cliability on a claim.\u201d And a <em>claim </em>is basically defined as a \u201cright to payment\u201d or a \u201cright to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a right to payment\u201d under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(5) (2007). So, despite the language specifying a debt to a present or former spouse, the broad definition of debt has been interpreted to encompass divorce decree-imposed obligations to a former spouse to make payments on a loan from a third party. So the trial court could properly enforce Shane\u2019s obligation <em>to Sondra </em>under the divorce decree even if Shane\u2019s obligation <em>to the bank </em>on the repossessed Durango had been discharged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 445-46 (footnotes omitted); <em>see also In re Wodark, </em>425 B.R. 834, 837-38 (Bankr. 10th Cir. 2010) (concluding that the wife\u2019s debt to the husband was non-dischargeable, even though it was payable to the bank, because \u201c[w]hat matters in a \u00a7 523(a)(15) case is (1) the nature of the debt; and (2) whether the debt was incurred in the course of a divorce or separation\u201d). We agree with <em>Howard </em>and <em>Wodark </em>and hold that Robin\u2019s obligation to pay 50% of Martin\u2019s 2006 federal income taxes was a debt under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(15). As such, it was automatically non-discharge-able in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\"> Next, Robin argues that the divorce decree incorrectly reflects her 2006 federal income tax liability because it includes \u201cthe penalties assessed on an early retirement account withdrawal [that] are not \u2018income\u2019 <em>per se.\u201d </em>The amount for which Robin is liable under the final divorce decree is <em>res judicata </em>because the decree was issued on October 31,2007, and the record does not indicate that Robin attempted to seek post-decision relief or to appeal the decree with respect to the 2006 federal income tax liability. \u201cSpurred by considerations of judicial economy and a policy of certainty and finality in our legal system, the doctrines of <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel have been established to avoid repetitive litigation so that at some point litigation over a particular controversy must come to an end.\u201d <em>Eastern Marine Const. Corp. v. First Southern Leasing, </em>129 N.H. 270, 273 (1987) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">\n<em>II. Attorney\u2019s Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\"> A prevailing party may be awarded attorney\u2019s fees when recovery of fees is authorized by statute, an agreement between the parties, or an established judicial exception to the general rule that precludes recovery of such fees. <em>Kessler v. Gleich, </em>161 N.H. 104, 106 (2010).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>We have recognized exceptions where an individual is forced to seek judicial assistance to secure a clearly defined and established right if bad faith can be established; where litigation is instituted or unnecessarily prolonged through a party\u2019s oppressive, vexatious, arbitrary, capricious or bad faith conduct; as compensation for those who are forced to litigate in order to enjoy what a court has already decreed; and for those who are forced to litigate against an opponent whose position is patently unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-5\"><em>Clipper Affiliates v. Checovich, </em>138 N.H. 271, 278 (1994) (brackets, citation,. and quotations omitted). We will not overturn the trial court\u2019s decision concerning attorney\u2019s fees absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>Grenier v. Barclay Square Commercial Condo. Owners\u2019 Assoc., </em>150 N.H. 111, 115 (2003). We give tremendous deference to the trial court\u2019s decision on attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Daigle v. City of Portsmouth, </em>137 N.H. 572, 574 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Martin argues that the trial court erred as a matter of law and unsustainably exercised its discretion when it declined to award him attorney\u2019s fees. He contends that Robin\u2019s position regarding the dischargeability of her debt was frivolous, unreasonable, and legally erroneous and that the trial court \u201cinexcusably] misapprehended] the law of discharge under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 523 and 727.\u201d We disagree that the trial court\u2019s erroneous decision on dischargeability is reason for charging Robin for Martin\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. An award of attorney\u2019s fees \u201cmerely shifts the cost of what should have been an unnecessary judicial proceeding <em>to the responsible party </em>...\u201d <em>Harkeem v. Adams, </em>117 N.H. 687, 691 (1977) (emphasis added). Although we have found Robin\u2019s view of the law erroneous, we do not agree that her position was frivolous, patently unreasonable, or taken in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">However, in light of our reversal of the trial court\u2019s order on the merits, Martin now becomes the prevailing party and, therefore, may be entitled to recover costs. Accordingly, we remand the case to the trial court to address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">Finally, we deny Robin\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Insofar as her request is for fees and costs incurred in the trial court, Robin did not appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of that request. <em>See Singer Asset Finance Co. v. Wyner, </em>156 N.H. 468, 479 (2007). Moreover, insofar as her request is for fees and costs incurred in connection with this appeal, not only is she not the prevailing party, but she also has appeared <em>pro se. </em>Sup. Ct. R. 23; <em>see </em>5 G. MacDonald, Wiebusch on New Hampshire Civil Practice and Procedure \u00a7 52.01, at 52-1 to 52-3 (2010) (\u201cIn order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>recover attorneys fees in New Hampshire, one must be \u2018a prevailing party.\u2019... A <em>pro se </em>litigant who has no obligation to pay an attorney cannot be awarded attorneys fees.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">\n<em>III. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling on the dischargeability of the debt, affirm its ruling on Martin\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees, remand for consideration of his costs, and deny Robin\u2019s request for fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">\n<em>Affirmed, in part; reversed in part; and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b424-8\">Dalianis, C.J., and HICKS, CONBOY and BASSETT, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b417-12\"> In <em>Haag v.
