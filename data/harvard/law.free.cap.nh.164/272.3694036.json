On appeal, he argues that the Superior Court <em>{Lynn, </em>C.J.) erred by: (1) permitting the State to authenticate documents by use of affidavits, rather than live testimony, in violation of his rights under the State and Federal Constitutions; (2) permitting an FBI agent to testify that the defendant\u2019s account may have been untruthful; (3) permitting the State to introduce a new opinion from the medical examiner during the trial; (4) failing to instruct the jury that it must determine the \u201cpredominating cause\u201d of death, pursuant to <em>State v. Seymour, </em>140 N.H. 736 (1996); (5) failing to instruct the jury that the solicitation variant of capital murder requires a finding that the defendant acted for his personal pecuniary gain; and (6) failing to instruct the jury that the kidnapping variant of capital murder requires a finding that the defendant intended to confine Reid to commit a crime other than murder. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\n<em>I. Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The jury could have found the following facts. <em>See State v. Knight, </em>161 N.H. 338 (2011) (related proceeding). In September 2003, the Brooks family\u2019s belongings were stolen from a rental truck and trailer, which the family had loaded in preparation for their move from New Hampshire to Las Vegas. Although the Brookses suspected Jack Reid of the theft, they agreed not to give his name to the police; instead, the defendant told two friends of his son, Jesse \u2014 Andrew Carter and Michael Benton \u2014 that he wanted their help to kill Reid. He met with Carter and Benton over the next several months to discuss how to \u201ctake care of\u2019 Reid, including possibly kidnapping him so that the defendant could find out the location of his property, and ultimately killing him. The defendant assured Carter and Benton that they would be \u201ctaken care of\u2019 if they helped him, and they were initially paid $5,000. However, their attempts on Reid\u2019s life in 2003 were unsuccessful. The defendant and Carter continued to discuss killing Reid into the fall of 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">In August 2004, the defendant, his wife Lorraine, and Jesse went to the Portsmouth office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, where they reported their suspicions regarding Reid and provided Special Agent Laura Hanlon a written chronology of events that concerned them.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">At some point, the defendant became acquainted with Joseph Vrooman and Robin Knight in Las Vegas. Sometime after June 10, 2005, he offered Vrooman $10,000 to help him kill Reid, and Vrooman agreed. The defendant and Vrooman then met at the defendant\u2019s Las Vegas home, joined by Jesse. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>They discussed obtaining a telephone with which to lure Reid to the property of Michael Connors, another New Hampshire acquaintance, and obtaining handcuffs, pepper spray, and a stun gun with which to subdue Reid. After this meeting, Vrooman obtained the handcuffs, pepper spray, and stun gun and brought them to the defendant\u2019s Las Vegas home, where they packaged the supplies and sent them to Connors in New Hampshire. On June 18, 2005, the defendant and Vrooman flew to New Hampshire, where Connors picked them up at the airport, bearing the unopened package of supplies as the defendant had instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The next day, the defendant and Vrooman met Benton in Manchester. The defendant paid for Benton to purchase a prepaid cellular telephone with which to call Reid; Benton activated the telephone using the name \u201cCharlie Was.\u201d They then drove to Connors\u2019s home. Although Connors told the defendant he did not want him to use his property Vrooman testified that the defendant told him and Benton that they could use Connors\u2019s place.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Over the next week, the defendant and Vrooman, joined by Knight, purchased more supplies \u2014 a large black plastic tarp, duct tape, garbage bags, zip-ties, Saran Wrap, and gloves. They decided that Vrooman, Knight, and Benton would subdue Reid, and the defendant would be armed with his .22 caliber handgun in case anything went wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">On June 27, 2005, the date they had set for Reid to come to Connors\u2019s property for a fictitious job, the defendant, Vrooman, Benton, and Knight drove to the property. Once there, Benton testified, the defendant stated that he wanted Reid to know that \u201cit\u2019s me that\u2019s doing this to him.\u201d To this end, they decided that they would confine Reid in a small closet area in the home\u2019s attached barn, after which the defendant would confront him and they would suffocate him using the Saran Wrap. However, Benton found a sledgehammer in the barn, so the plan became that Vrooman would push Reid into the closet, where Benton would hit him with the sledgehammer.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">When Reid arrived at Connors\u2019s house, the defendant and Benton hid in the barn. Knight and Vrooman greeted Reid and led him down a hallway into the barn. After Vrooman pushed Reid into the closet, Benton hit him on the side of the head with the sledgehammer. Knight told Benton that Reid was not yet dead, and Benton struck two or three additional blows to Reid\u2019s forehead with the sledgehammer. Knight, Vrooman, and the defendant carried Reid, still breathing, from the closet to the black plastic tarp, which had been laid out on the barn floor. As Knight and Benton tried to clean up the blood, Vrooman told the defendant that Reid would not stop bleeding. Vrooman testified that the defendant said, \u201c[S]top the heart, stop the bleeding,\u201d and struck Reid two or three times in the chest with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>sledgehammer. The four men then emptied Reid\u2019s pockets, wrapped his body in the tarp, carried it out to the back of Reid\u2019s dump truck, and covered it with branches and rocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Vrooman and Knight drove Reid\u2019s truck to Massachusetts and left it in a Target Store parking lot. The defendant gave Benton $5,000. After returning to New Hampshire, the defendant and Vrooman threw the sledgehammer, handcuffs, and Reid\u2019s watch into a nearby river. They stopped by the home of Bert Seaver, a friend of the defendant, where they disposed of evidence. The following day, the defendant, Vrooman, and Knight returned to Connors\u2019s barn and replaced the walls and floor of the closet area where Reid had been killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">On July 1, 2005, the defendant, Vrooman, and Knight returned to Las Vegas. There, the defendant paid Vrooman $2,500 in cash; over the next few months, Vrooman received an additional $10,000 from the defendant and Jesse. Vrooman was told that Knight had also been paid. In late July, the defendant sent Benton another $400 through Western Union. In early August, Benton telephoned Jesse to ask for more money so he could travel to Las Vegas, and received another $800 through Western Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">\n<em>II. Confrontation Clause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">At trial, the State introduced extensive documentary evidence, including telephone records, air travel records, insurance company records, Federal Express records, and Western Union records, as business records under New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 803(6), and authenticated the records through certifications from the records\u2019 custodians pursuant to New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 902(11). The defendant argues that allowing the records to be so authenticated violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause and the New Hampshire Constitution. He challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling that the certifications of authenticity pursuant to Rule 902(11) were not testimonial, arguing that \u201cthe custodian affidavits did far more than \u2018authenticate\u2019 records as genuine copies of originals in the custodian\u2019s possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">We review the defendant\u2019s Confrontation Clause challenges <em>de novo. See United States v. Yeley-Davis, </em>632 F.3d 673, 678 (10th Cir. 2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>131 S. Ct. 2172 (2011). Because the defendant has raised his claim under both the State and Federal Constitutions, we would normally address his State claim first. <em>See State v. Ayer, </em>154 N.H. 500, 504 (2006). However, the defendant\u2019s arguments center upon his rights under the Federal Constitution: he contends that admitting the records through affidavits, rather than live testimony, was contrary to <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36 (2004), and its progeny, <em>Melendez-Diaz v. Massachu</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number><em>setts, </em>557 U.S. 305 (2009), and <em>Bullcoming v. New Mexico, </em>131 S. Ct. 2705 (2011). We will therefore first address his claim under the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The Sixth Amendment provides: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d The Fourteenth Amendment renders the Confrontation Clause binding on the States. <em>See Michigan v. Bryant, </em>131 S. Ct. 1143, 1152 (2011). Only \u201ctestimonial statements\u201d cause a declarant to be a \u201cwitness\u201d within the meaning of the Confrontation Clause. <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 821 (2006) (quotations omitted). A witness is a person who \u201cbear[s] testimony.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51 (quotation omitted). \u201cTestimony, in turn, is typically a solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\u201cThe crucial determination under <em>Crawford </em>as to whether an out-of-court statement violates the Confrontation Clause is whether it is \u2018testimonial\u2019 or not.\u201d <em>State v. O'Maley, </em>156 N.H. 125, 131 (2007), <em>overruled in part by Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 U.S. at 312-20; <em>see also United States v. Mallory, </em>461 Fed. Appx. 352, 356 (4th Cir. 2012) (\u201cthe right of confrontation covers all testimonial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorily\u201d (quotation omitted)). \u201cTo be considered testimonial, the primary purpose of the statement must be \u2018to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mallory, </em>461 Fed. Appx. at 356 (quoting <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 822).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">\u201cBusiness records are generally admissible, even without confrontation.\u201d <em>Id.) see Bullcoming, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2714 n.6. \u201cBusiness and public records are generally admissible absent confrontation not because they qualify under an exception to the hearsay rules, but because \u2014 having been created for the administration of an entity\u2019s affairs and not for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact at trial \u2014 they are not testimonial.\u201d <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 U.S. at 324. Statements that qualify as business records are not, however, nontestimonial <em>per se. See O\u2019Maley, </em>156 N.H. at 135. \u201cAccordingly, under <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>the relevant question in determining whether a business record is testimonial is whether it was created for the administration of an entity\u2019s affairs or for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact at trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Hudson, </em>2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126830, at *12 (E.D. La. 2011). \u201cIf the primary purpose of creating the record is not to prove a fact at trial, the admissibility of the records is the concern of state and federal rules of evidence, not the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation, brackets, and emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Although the defendant argues that the State should have presented live testimony regarding the requirements of the business records rule, he conceded at oral argument that if the records had been sponsored by a live witness who gave testimony establishing that they were business records, nearly all of the records admitted in the case would not be testimonial. He contends, however, that some of the telephone records \u201cwere not records . . . that were maintained in the ordinary course of business by the phone company.\u201d We disagree. The defendant\u2019s argument relies upon the testimony of a witness who explained that the telephone records that were not billing records were nonetheless part of the telephone company\u2019s record system. <em>See Yeley-Davis, </em>632 F.3d at 679 (finding that, although certain telephone records were not telephone bills, \u201c[t]his does not mean... that these records were created simply for litigation \u2014 they were not. Rather, these records were kept for [the telephone company\u2019s] business purposes\u201d and, therefore, were not testimonial). Because all of the telephone records, including the records that would not normally be provided to a subscriber, were \u201ccreated for the administration of [the] entity\u2019s affairs and not for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact at trial,\u201d <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 U.S. at 324, they are not testimonial. <em>See Mallory, </em>461 Fed. Appx. at 356 (FedEx record); <em>Hudson, </em>2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126830, at *12-*13 (telephone and financial records).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Unlike the records themselves, however, the certifications of the business records were created for the sole purpose of litigation \u2014 that is, to authenticate documents pursuant to Rule 902(11). <em>See Hudson, </em>2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126830, at *13-*14 (noting that business record certifications pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 902(11) could be described as affidavits prepared for litigation purposes); <em>United States v. Hemphill, </em>514 F.3d 1350, 1358-59 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (same). Thus, we turn to the question of whether admission of the certifications violated the defendant\u2019s Confrontation Clause rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\"> We note first that the defendant does not challenge the certifications\u2019 compliance with Rule 902(11). Rather, he challenges Rule 902(ll)\u2019s authentication procedure as incompatible with his confrontation rights. The Supreme Court, however, has distinguished an affidavit that is created for the purpose of providing evidence against a defendant (to which the right of confrontation would apply) from an affidavit merely authenticating an admissible record (an exception to confrontation requirements). <em>See Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 U.S. at 322-23. It stated, \u201cA clerk could by affidavit <em>authenticate </em>or provide a copy of an otherwise admissible record, but could not... <em>create </em>a record for the sole purpose of providing evidence against a defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Certifications under Rule 902(11) \u201care authentications of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>otherwise admissible records and do not themselves create new records. Accordingly, they are nontestimonial.\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126830, at *16. \u201cConsequently, <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>makes clear that the Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses does not include the right to confront a records custodian who submits a Rule 902(11) certification of a record that was created in the course of a regularly conducted business activity.\u201d <em>Mallory, </em>461 Fed. Appx. at 357; <em>see United States v. Fajardo-Guevara, </em>2011 WL 6003840, at *2 n.1 (M.D. La. 2011) (\u201c902(11) certifications are nontestimonial and do not implicate the Confrontation Clause\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The defendant insists that \u201cthe custodian affidavits did far more than \u2018authenticate\u2019 records as genuine copies of originals in the custodian\u2019s possession.\u201d He points out that an affidavit merely verifying that the records were true copies of those in the business\u2019s file would not suffice to authenticate the documents as business records. <em>See United States v. Weiland, </em>420 F.3d 1062, 1076 n.13 (9th Cir. 2005) (\u201cUnlike public records admitted under Rule 803(8), records of a regularly conducted activity admitted under Rule 803(6) require additional foundation.\u201d). Indeed, Rule 902(11) provides that authentication requires the custodian or another qualified person to certify under oath that the record: (A) was made at or near the time of the occurrence of the matters set forth by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge of those matters; (B) was kept in the course of the regularly conducted activity; and (C) was made by the regularly conducted activity as a regular practice. N.H. R. Ev. 902(11). Thus, the defendant argues, Rule 902(11) certifications provide \u201ctestimony about who made the records . . . and how the records were made,\u201d like the affidavits involved in <em>Melendez-Diaz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">We agree with the courts that have ruled that Rule 902(11) certifications are distinguishable from the certificates at issue in <em>Melendez-Diaz. See Hudson, </em>2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126830, at *16-*17 n.5 (\u201cAlthough a 902(11) certification goes beyond a simple statement that the record in issue is a record of the business in question, none of the courts to address the issue has found this to be an impediment to the use of these certifications under the Confrontation Clause.\u201d). The evidence at issue in <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>consisted of \u201cthree \u2018certificates of analysis,\u2019. . . sworn to before a notary public by analysts at the State Laboratory Institute of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health,\u201d reporting the weight of bags of material seized by the police and stating that the bags \u201c[had] been examined with the following results: The substance was found to contain: Cocaine.\u201d <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 U.S. at 308 (quotations omitted). In <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>\u201cnot only were the affidavits \u2018made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>statement would be available for use at a later trial,\u2019 but under Massachusetts law the <em>sole purpose </em>of the affidavits was to provide \u2018prima facie evidence of the composition, quality, and the net weight\u2019 of the analyzed substance.\u201d <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 U.S. at 311 (quoting <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 52 &amp; Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 111, \u00a7 13).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The certifications in this case, however, served only as the foundation for the admission of the substantive evidence. The certifications themselves had minimal evidentiary value. <em>See United States v. Kos, </em>2008 WL 5084006, at *3 (W.D.N.C. 2008) (\u201ca business record certification does not serve independently as evidence in the case; rather, it serves merely to lay a foundation for the admission of business records\u201d (quotations, brackets and ellipsis omitted)). Thus, we conclude that the admission of the records and the certifications did not violate the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights under the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The defendant argues that \u201c[t]he New Hampshire right must be at least as extensive as the Confrontation Clause rights described in <em>Crawford, Melendez-Diaz, </em>and <em>Bullcoming-, </em>however, given the greater precision of the New Hampshire Constitution, it-should be interpreted as more expansive.\u201d \u201cWe have not, however, adopted the <em>Crawford </em>analysis as applicable in this State.\u201d <em>State v. Munoz, </em>157 N.H. 143, 148 (2008). The defendant\u2019s assertion that the New Hampshire Constitution\u2019s Confrontation Clause protection is more expansive than the <em>Crawford </em>rule relies entirely upon our observation in <em>State v. Peters, </em>133 N.H. 791, 794 (1991), that \u201c[t]he language of the New Hampshire Constitution's Confrontation Clause] is the more precise of the two, in that it explicitly provides what the Federal Constitution has been interpreted to mean.\u201d The defendant, however, does not offer argument under any standard other than the federal standard regarding the violation of his rights under the State Constitution, <em>see Munoz, </em>157 N.H. at 148. Neither does he address the applicability of the Confrontation Clause test we have adopted \u2014 namely, that of <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56 (1980). <em>See State v. Ata, </em>158 N.H. 406, 409 (2009); <em>Ayer, </em>154 N.H. at 511. We will not consider the admissibility of the records and their certifications under a standard the defendant has not argued. <em>See Munoz, </em>157 N.H. at 148. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant has not established that admitting the records by means of custodians\u2019 affidavits rather than five testimony violated his rights under Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">\n<em>II. FBI Agent\u2019s Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">The defendant next argues that the trial court erred by permitting the State to elicit the opinion of FBI Special Agent Hanlon that her conversa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>tion with the Brooks family was \u201cpeculiar and kind of odd,\u201d and that \u201cparts of the stories that [the Brookses] were telling [her] seemed not only odd, but perhaps didn\u2019t have a full ring of truth to it.\u201d He first argues that the opinion testimony was not relevant because Lorraine Brooks\u2019s extensive testimony about her visit to the FBI was admitted only as evidence of the defendant\u2019s intent, and not for the truth of the matters stated during the discussion with Hanlon. Second, he asserts that \u201cthe admission of this evidence violated the cardinal rule that a trial judge should not permit the prosecution to ask a witness to express an opinion about the credibility of another witness.\u201d <em>See State v. Lopez, </em>156 N.H. 416, 423-24 (2007) (adopting a broad prohibition on questions requiring a witness to comment on credibility of other witnesses).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u201cWe review challenges to a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings under our unsustainable exercise of discretion standard and reverse only if the rulings are clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of a party\u2019s case.\u201d <em>State v. Wamala, </em>158 N.H. 583, 586 (2009). We have held that \u201crequiring a witness to opine upon the credibility of other witnesses is error because such questioning interferes with the jury\u2019s obligation to determine the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>156 N.H. at 423. We have also declined to create an exception to <em>Lopez\u2019s </em>\u201cbroad prohibition on questions requiring a witness to comment upon the credibility of other witnesses.\u201d <em>State v. Parker, </em>160 N.H. 203, 213 (2010) (quotation omitted). Thus, although Hanlon testified as to her impression of the veracity of a prior report by the Brookses rather than of a witness\u2019s trial testimony, we conclude that the trial court erred in allowing her to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The State argues that any error in admitting the testimony was harmless. The State bears the burden of proving that an error is harmless. <em>State v. Pseudae, </em>154 N.H. 196, 202 (2006). An error is harmless only if it is determined, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the verdict was not affected by the error. M.An error may be harmless if the alternative evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt is of an overwhelming nature, quantity or weight and if the inadmissible evidence is merely cumulative or inconsequential in relation to the strength of the State\u2019s evidence of guilt. <em>Id. </em>In determining whether an error was harmless, we consider the alternative evidence of guilt presented at trial as well as the character of the inadmissible evidence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">We conclude that the State has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the verdict was not affected by the admission of Hanlon\u2019s opinion. The evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt is overwhelming. Benton testified that the defendant wanted Reid killed, offered money to have him killed, engaged in numerous discussions about how to carry out the plan, and ultimately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>participated with him in the murder of Reid. Vrooman testified that the defendant recruited him in 2005 to help kill Reid and offered him money to do so, and corroborated Benton\u2019s testimony that the defendant participated in the killing of Reid. His testimony about the planning and purchasing of supplies to further the plot, and about the events surrounding the murder itself, corroborated Benton\u2019s testimony. Vrooman\u2019s and Benton\u2019s testimony about meetings before the murder, supplies gathered with which to commit the murder, and the destruction of evidence after the murder was corroborated by Connors, Seaver, and Lorraine Brooks. Connors also testified about the defendant\u2019s intention to lure Reid to his property and kill him.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Benton\u2019s and Vrooman\u2019s testimony about the specific location where Reid was killed, how he was killed, and what was done with his body was corroborated by a forensic examination of the body, by physical evidence gathered at the scene of the murder and from the river near the defendant\u2019s home, and by DNA analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Testimony indicated that the June 27, 2005 surveillance video from the Target store where Reid\u2019s dump truck had been left showed two men leave Reid\u2019s truck and get into a 2004 or 2005 gold or tan Toyota Sienna mini-van. Motor vehicle records showed that the defendant owned a beige 2004 Toyota Sienna mini-van. Testimony established that a videotape from a Waste Management facility in Londonderry showed Reid alive at 2:13 p.m. on June 27. Reid\u2019s telephone records showed that the last call he made that day was to the number associated with \u201cCharlie Was.\u201d When the records pertaining to this number were retrieved, it was found to be the number of a pre-paid cellular telephone activated June 19, 2005, in the name of \u201cCharlie Was.\u201d The only call shown by the records of the \u201cCharlie Was\u201d telephone that was not to Reid was a call placed to the telephone from a landline in the defendant\u2019s name from a home he owned in Derry.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">The logbook removed from Reid\u2019s truck listed on the pages dated June 27-28 the name \u201cCharlie,\u201d the number of the \u201cCharlie Was\u201d telephone, and Connors\u2019s address. In late July 2005, police visited Connors\u2019s home to speak with him and learned of other potential witnesses. The police then obtained flight records showing that the defendant had traveled from Manchester, New Hampshire, to Las Vegas, Nevada, on July 1, 2005, with Joseph Vrooman and Robin Knight.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">In December 2006, two halves of a pair of handcuffs were recovered from the river, corroborating Vrooman\u2019s statement that the handcuffs he and the defendant had mailed from Las Vegas had been thrown into the river. Also in December 2006, State Police executed a search warrant in Connors\u2019s barn and found that, while it appeared that the walls and floor of the closet had been replaced, the ceiling had not, and it contained a small spatter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>blood later identified as being consistent -with Reid\u2019s. Luminol testing revealed blood smears leading from the hallway outside the closet to an open area in the barn, and later examination of the floorboards confirmed the presence of blood consistent with that of Reid.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Benton\u2019s and Vrooman\u2019s testimony about the purchase of the telephone with which to contact Reid was corroborated by records of that purchase. Telephone records corroborated Benton\u2019s, Carter\u2019s, and Vrooman\u2019s testimony about telephone contacts among the conspirators at pertinent times. Federal Express records corroborated testimony by Connors, Benton, and Vrooman about a package of supplies sent from Las Vegas to New Hampshire. Airline records corroborated testimony by Connors, Vrooman, and Lorraine Brooks about relevant air travel. Western Union records corroborated Benton\u2019s testimony about receiving money from the defendant and Jesse. Benton\u2019s testimony that some of those funds were used to travel to Las Vegas was corroborated by Vrooman\u2019s and Lorraine Brooks\u2019s confirmation that he was visiting there at the relevant time.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">In addition to the overwhelming nature of the alternative evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt, we consider the character of the inadmissible evidence to determine whether it \u201cis merely cumulative or inconsequential in relation to the strength of the State\u2019s evidence of guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, Hanlon\u2019s opinion was inconsequential. The conversation between the Brooks family and the FBI was not admitted for the truth of the Brookses\u2019 statements, but rather to show that the defendant\u2019s actions were inconsistent with a longstanding plan to commit murder. The trial court allowed Lorraine Brooks to testify, over the State\u2019s hearsay objection, to the entire content of the family\u2019s discussion with Hanlon, reasoning that the testimony was admissible \u201cbecause it undermines the theory of a conspiracy because ... a jury could find people who are involved in a conspiracy are not likely to provide their identities to a law enforcement agency that may be \u2014 you know, at some point may be charged with investigating them.\u201d The purpose for which the defense proffered the evidence \u2014 to show that the defendant presented himself to the FBI and provided the names of Benton and Carter \u2014 was thus met, regardless of Hanlon\u2019s opinion of the Brooks family\u2019s account. Thus, despite the error, any prejudice caused by admission of Hanlon\u2019s opinion was minimal, and inconsequential in light of the strength of the State\u2019s evidence of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Because the evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt was overwhelming, the admission of Hanlon\u2019s opinion regarding the Brookses\u2019 statements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>\n<em>III. Medical Examiner\u2019s Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The defendant next argues that the trial court erred by permitting the State to introduce a new opinion from the medical examiner during the trial. He contends first that the trial court erred by applying former Superior Court Rule 98, rather than the version in effect at the time of trial. Second, he argues that the court unsustainably exercised its discretion in finding that he was not prejudiced by admission of the opinion evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Pursuant to Rule 98, the State timely disclosed, as its cause-of-death expert, Dr. Richard Evans, the Massachusetts medical examiner who conducted Reid\u2019s autopsy. The State produced Dr. Evans\u2019s autopsy report and death certificate, which described the cause of Reid\u2019s death as \u201chomicidal violence of undetermined etiology with evaluation complicated by multiple perimortem fractures, body discovered wrapped in plastic and severe postmortem putrefaction.\u201d At trial, the State informed the trial court that at Dr. Evans\u2019s deposition, available to both parties, \u201che testified extensively that the nature of the chest injuries was such that he couldn\u2019t tell specifically why they had been inflicted or how but rather that they were blunt force trauma injuries.\u201d The defense opening statement employed Dr. Evans\u2019s anticipated testimony as a tool to attack the credibility of Vrooman\u2019s account of the murder, casting Dr. Evans\u2019s evaluation of the victim\u2019s rib injuries as inconsistent with Vrooman\u2019s anticipated testimony that the defendant struck Reid in the chest with a sledgehammer.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">On the day that Dr. Evans was scheduled to testify, counsel for the State notified defense counsel by e-mail as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">It is my recollection that during a recent conversation with Dr. Richard Evans, he informed me that he believes that at the time of the autopsy, he was informed that rocks were found in the vicinity of the body and it was suggested to him that rocks might have been on top of the body prior to its discovery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">Before Dr. Evans took the stand, defense counsel asked the trial court to exclude any opinion from Dr. Evans that had not been previously disclosed. The State countered that there was no new or undisclosed opinion, since the only testimony the State planned to elicit from Dr. Evans, outside of that contained in the disclosed reports, was \u201c[essentially just that rocks are capable of inflicting blunt force trauma.\u201d The trial court allowed the State to question Dr. Evans about the potential contribution of rocks to the \u201cblunt force trauma\u201d originally disclosed, reasoning: \u201c[T]his new disclosure of the doctor is a very marginal difference. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s, you know, sort of a completely new thing.\u201d In response to the State\u2019s hypothetical question, \u201cIf someone had struck the victim in the chest several times with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>[the handheld sledgehammer] . . . very close in time to when his heart stopped beating and then at some point after the victim was deceased someone tossed several rocks weighing between four and thirteen pounds onto his chest, could that cause the constellation of chest injuries you observed during the autopsy?\u201d Dr. Evans replied, \u201cThe constellation of the two sets of events would in my opinion account for the injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\u201cWe will not reverse the trial court\u2019s admission of evidence absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Gamester, </em>149 N.H. 475, 478 (2003). \u201cThis same standard applies to review of the trial court\u2019s decision with respect to alleged discovery violations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo show that the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion is unsustainable, the defendant must show that the decision was clearly unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.\u201d <em>State v. Dodds, </em>159 N.H. 239, 248-49 (2009) (quotation omitted). \u201cIn the context of a discovery violation, actual prejudice exists if the defense has been impeded to a significant degree by the nondisclosure.\u201d <em>State v. Roldan, </em>151 N.H. 283, 287 (2004) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The version of Rule 98 in effect at the time of trial provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">For each expert witness included on the list of witnesses, the state shall provide a brief summary of the expert\u2019s education and experience relevant to his area of expertise, state the subject matter on which the expert is expected to testify, state a summary of the facts <em>and opinions </em>to which the expert is expected to testify and a summary of the grounds for each opinion, and provide a copy of any expert report relating to such expert.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">SUPER. Ct. R. 98(C)(1) (emphasis added). Rule 98(H) further provided that \u201cparties are under a continuing obligation to supplement\u201d discovery responses as additional materials are generated or if a party learns that previously provided discovery \u201cis incomplete, inaccurate or misleading.\u201d SUPER. Ct. R. 98(H); <em>see also State v. Pelletier, </em>149 N.H. 243, 250 (2003). By contrast, former Superior Court Rule 98 did not include the above requirements concerning expert witnesses. Rather, it merely required the State to provide the defendant copies, prior to trial, of all \u201cresults or reports of physical or mental examinations, scientific tests or experiments, or any other reports or statements of experts, as well as a summary of each expert\u2019s qualifications.\u201d SUPER. Ct. R. 98(A)(2)\u00ae (2004). In <em>Gamester, </em>we held that former Rule 98 did not require the State to summarize the testimony of the experts whose reports the State had provided to the defense, nor did it \u201cmandate that an expert\u2019s report contain all of the opinions regarding which the expert may be called upon to testify at trial.\u201d <em>State v. Lavoie, </em>152 N.H. 542, 545 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>The defendant first argues that \u201cthe trial court appeared to apply the law before Rule 98 was amended, and erroneously relieved the State of its obligation to disclose its expert\u2019s opinions in conformity with the current Rule.\u201d He bases this assertion on what he characterizes as the trial court\u2019s consideration of whether the State had produced the underlying <em>facts </em>that formed the basis of Dr. Evans\u2019s opinion, and the fact that, prior to the 2004 amendments, Rule 98 did not require the State to disclose \u201call of the <em>opinions </em>regarding which the expert may be called upon to testify at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The record does not support the defendant\u2019s reading of the trial court\u2019s legal analysis. After allowing defense counsel extensive argument, the trial court attempted to determine the essence of the defendant\u2019s objection, and specifically asked whether defense counsel was being taken by surprise based upon an undisclosed <em>opinion. </em>Accordingly, we do not agree that the trial court erroneously applied the former rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">We next turn to the defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion in allowing Dr. Evans\u2019s opinion is unsustainable. We assume, without deciding, that the admission of Dr. Evans\u2019s opinion about the possible contribution of rocks to the decedent\u2019s chest injury violated Rule 98. The defendant has nonetheless failed to demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s \u201cdecision was clearly unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.\u201d <em>Dodds, </em>159 N.H. at 248-49 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\"> \u201cActual prejudice exists if the defense has been impeded to a significant degree by the nondisclosure.\u201d <em>State v. Stickney, </em>148 N.H. 232, 236 (2002). Here, the nondisclosure was limited to Dr. Evans\u2019s opinion of one possible cause of the previously disclosed \u201cblunt force trauma\u201d \u2014 that is, the rocks that both parties had long known were found with the body. On cross-examination of Dr. Evans, the defense suggested other possible instrumentalities that might be consistent with the compressive chest injury. Dr. Evans specifically testified that he had not formulated an opinion as to whether rocks were the cause of the compressive chest injury. The tardy disclosure that the placement of rocks on Reid\u2019s body may have contributed to his chest injuries did not alter Dr. Evans\u2019s determination of the cause of death, or the evidence of the defendant\u2019s role therein. The defendant thus has not established actual prejudice as a result of the nondisclosure, or that the trial court unsustainably exercised its discretion in allowing admission of the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">\n<em>TV. \u201cPredominating Cause\u201d Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">The defendant next argues that the trial court erred by rejecting the defendant\u2019s request for a jury instruction on \u201cpredominating cause\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>pursuant to <em>Seymour. </em>He asserts that, as to the murder indictments, the jury had to determine whether Reid\u2019s death was caused by Benton\u2019s blows to Reid\u2019s head or the defendant\u2019s blows to Reid\u2019s chest. Without a \u201cpredominating cause\u201d instruction, he contends, the jury\u2019s verdict on the murder indictments may have been based upon the erroneous conclusion that the defendant\u2019s physical actions were the legal cause of Reid\u2019s death. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">One capital murder indictment charged that Brooks \u201cdid knowingly cause the death of Jack Reid, Sr., by criminally soliciting\u201d one or more individuals \u201cto cause his death .... in that, with the purpose to cause the death of Jack Reid, Sr., he offered one or more of said individuals some form of pecuniary gain in exchange for their participation in causing the death.\u201d The second capital murder indictment charged that Brooks, \u201cacting in concert with and aided by another,\u201d knowingly caused Reid\u2019s death while engaged in an actual or attempted kidnapping, by striking Reid with a blunt object. The first-degree murder indictment likewise charged Brooks with purposely causing Reid\u2019s death by striking him with a blunt object while \u201cacting in concert with and aided by another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\u201cUnder New Hampshire law, the \u2018acting in concert with\u2019 language used in the indictment is ordinarily sufficient to charge a defendant as both a principal and an accomplice.\u201d <em>State v. Doucette, </em>146 N.H. 583, 589 (2001). Where the indictments charged the defendant as both a principal and an accomplice, the State had two options for proving capital and/or first-degree murder. It could have proven that the defendant himself caused Reid\u2019s death by striking him with a blunt object. Or it could have proven accomplice liability; that is, that the defendant solicited, aided or attempted to aid another in causing Reid\u2019s death by striking him with a blunt object. <em>See State v. Winward, </em>161 N.H. 533, 539 (2011); <em>see also State v. Young, </em>159 N.H. 332, 340 (2009) (where defendant charged as both principal and accomplice, \u201cevidence supporting each element of accomplice liability also would be sufficient to support the conviction[] against the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">\u201cThe purpose of the trial court\u2019s charge is to state and explain to the jury, in clear and intelligible language, the rules of law applicable to the case.\u201d <em>State v. O\u2019Leary, </em>153 N.H. 710, 712 (2006) (quotation omitted). \u201cWhen reviewing jury instructions, we evaluate allegations of error by interpreting the disputed instructions in their entirety, as a reasonable juror would have understood them, and in light of all the evidence in the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We determine whether the jury instructions adequately and accurately explained each element of the offense, bearing in mind that the scope and wording of jury instructions are within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>See id. </em>We review the trial court\u2019s decisions on these matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>for an unsustainable exercise of discretion, and reverse only if the instructions did not fairly cover the issues of law in the case. <em>See id.; see also State v. Lamprey, </em>149 N.H. 364, 366 (2003) (\u201cReversal of a jury verdict is unwarranted when a jury charge fairly covers the issues and law of a case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Before addressing the elements of the crimes with which the defendant was charged, the trial court instructed the jury \u201cas to the principles of law that apply when more than one person is accused of being a participant in a crime.\u201d Its instructions on accomplice liability \u2014 which the defendant does not argue were erroneous \u2014 explained that \u201ca person may be convicted of a crime even if he did not personally perform all of the conduct which constitutes the crime,\u201d and that \u201can accomplice is just as guilty if the crime is in fact committed as if he had personally performed each step in the commission of the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The court then instructed the jury on the elements of the three alternative murder counts, each of which required the State to prove that the defendant had caused Reid\u2019s death. The instructions defined the element of \u201ccausation\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">To show that the defendant caused the death of Reid means that the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct was a direct and substantial factor in bringing about the death of Reid. In other words, a legal cause of death is a cause without which the death would not have occurred, and a substantial factor from which the death flows \u2014 from which the death follows as a natural, direct and immediate consequence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">To be a legal cause of death, the defendant\u2019s acts do not have to be the sole cause of death or the last acts which produce the death; rather, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt only that the defendant\u2019s conduct substantially and materially contributed to the death of Reid in natural and continuous sequence unbroken by superseding or intervening cause. <em>The State is not required to prove the manner in which or the means by which the death of Reid was caused.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">(Emphasis added). Specifically addressing accomplice liability, the court instructed the jury as to each of the three murder counts that, to find the defendant guilty, it must \u201cfind beyond a reasonable doubt that all of the elements\u201d of the crime \u201cwere committed by one or more of the following individuals: The defendant; Robin Knight; Joseph Vrooman; and/or Michael Benton,\u201d and \u201cthat the defendant solicited, aided or attempted to aid Vrooman, Knight, and/or Benton\u201d in the criminal activity with the requisite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>intent. The defendant does not contest that the instructions accurately stated the law on accomplice liability. <em>See </em>RSA 626:8.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The defendant\u2019s premise \u2014 that to convict Brooks on the murder indictments, the jury had to find that Reid\u2019s death was caused by Brooks\u2019s blows to Reid\u2019s chest rather than Benton\u2019s blows to Reid\u2019s head \u2014 is not supported by the indictments or the law. None of the indictments required the jury to find that the defendant himself delivered the mortal blow. As the court properly instructed the jury, the State was not required to prove the manner in which or the means by which the death of Reid was caused. Because the defendant was charged as an accomplice, the jury could have found him guilty of all three charges regardless of whether Benton\u2019s blows to Reid\u2019s head or the defendant\u2019s blows to Reid\u2019s chest were the \u201cpredominating cause\u201d of Reid\u2019s death. Therefore, \u201cpredominating cause\u201d language was not required to fairly cover the issues and law of this case, and reversal of the jury verdict is unwarranted. <em>See Lamprey, </em>149 N.H. at 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\n<em>V. Solicitation Variant and the Requirement of \u201cPersonal Pecuniary Gain\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The defendant next argues that the trial court erred in its interpretation of RSA 630:1,1(c). He argues that the statute requires that to be convicted on the solicitation variant of capital murder, the defendant must have acted for his own pecuniary gain.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">RSA 630:1,1(c) provides in pertinent part, \u201cA person is guilty of capital murder if he knowingly causes the death of . . . [a]nother by criminally soliciting a person to cause said death or after having been criminally solicited by another for his personal pecuniary gain.\u201d The defendant argues that the statute requires proof that he acted \u201cfor his personal pecuniary gain\u201d regardless of whether he solicited the death or was the person solicited. The State argues that only the person solicited must act for his own personal pecuniary gain.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">The interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we decide <em>de novo. See State v. Brown, </em>155 N.H. 590, 591 (2007). In matters of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of a statute considered as a whole. <em>State v. Gallagher, </em>157 N.H. 421, 422 (2008). We construe the Criminal Code \u201caccording to the fair import of [its] terms and to promote justice.\u201d RSA 625:3 (2007). In doing so, we first look to the plain language of the statute to determine legislative intent. <em>State v. Formella, </em>158 N.H. 114, 116 (2008). Absent an ambiguity, we will not look beyond the language of the statute to discern legislative intent. <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe interpret legislative intent from the statute as written and will not consider what the legislature might have said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include.\u201d <em>State v. Drake, </em>155 N.H. 169,174-75 (2007). Our goal is to apply statutes in light of the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting them, and in light of the policy sought to be advanced by the entire statutory scheme. <em>State v. Lamy, </em>158 N.H. 511, 515 (2009). Accordingly, we interpret a statute in the context of the overall statutory scheme and not in isolation. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The plain language of RSA 630:1,1(c) creates two categories: those who solicit and those who are solicited. \u201cOne established rule of statutory construction, the \u2018last antecedent rule,\u2019 is the general rule of statutory as well as grammatical construction that a modifying clause is confined to the last antecedent unless there is something in the subject matter or dominant purpose which requires a different interpretation.\u201d <em>Mt. Valley Mall Assocs. v. Municipality of Conway, </em>144 N.H. 642, 652 (2000) (quotation and citation omitted). \u201cTherefore, qualifying phrases are to be applied to the words or phrases immediately preceding and are not to be construed as extending to others more remote.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted); <em>see also </em>2A N. SINGER <em>&amp; </em>J.D. Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 47.33, at 487-89 (7th ed. 2007). This rule of statutory construction supports applying the qualifying phrase \u201cfor his own pecuniary gain\u201d to only the second category, those who are solicited to kill. Further, this interpretation is logically sound in that it imposes equally severe penalties on hired killers who act for mercenary motives and those who hire them, regardless of their motivation. Accordingly, we agree with the trial court\u2019s interpretation of RSA 630:1, 1(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument under the rule of lenity is unavailing. \u201c[T]he rule of lenity serves as a guide for interpreting criminal statutes where the legislature failed to articulate its intent unambiguously.\u201d <em>In re Alex C., </em>161 N.H. 231, 239 (2010) (quotation omitted). Because we find the legislative intent unambiguous, the rule of lenity, which forbids interpretation of a criminal statute so as to increase the statutory penalty where the legislature\u2019s intent is unclear, is inapplicable. <em>See id. </em>(legislative history to be consulted to aid statutory analysis if statute is ambiguous; if both statute and history are ambiguous, rule of lenity applies); <em>State v. Bailey, </em>127 N.H. 811, 814 (1986) (\u201cLenity thus serves only as an aid for resolving an ambiguity; it is not to be used to beget one.\u201d (quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\n<em>VI. Predicate Crime Underlying Kidnapping Variant</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">The defendant finally argues that the trial court erred in its interpretation of RSA 630:1,1(b). He asserts that, pursuant to the merger doctrine, to prove the kidnapping variant of capital murder, the State had to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>that the defendant intended to confine Reid for the purpose of committing a crime other than murder. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">RSA 630:1,1(b) provides that \u201c[a] person is guilty of capital murder if he knowingly causes the death of... [a]nother before, after, while engaged in the commission of, or while attempting to commit kidnapping as that offense is defined in RSA 633:1.\u201d RSA 633:1 (Supp. 2002), in turn, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">I. A person is guilty of kidnapping if he knowingly confines another under his control with a purpose to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">(a) Hold him for ransom or as a hostage; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">(b) Avoid apprehension by a law enforcement official; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">(c) Terrorize him or some other person; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-10\">(d) Commit an offense against him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">The indictment charged that the defendant, \u201cacting in concert with another or others, did knowingly confine [Reid] under his control with a purpose to terrorize him and/or to commit a crime against him,\u201d and that the defendant, in concert with others, caused Reid\u2019s death. In accordance with this language, based upon RSA 633:1, 1(c) and 1(d), the trial court instructed the jury that the elements of the crime included that the defendant \u201cconfined or attempted to confine Reid . . . with the conscious object or specific intent to terrorize Reid or to commit a crime against Reid,\u201d and that the defendant caused Reid\u2019s death \u201cbefore, after, while engaged in, or while attempting to engage in the confinement of Reid.\u201d The court further instructed the jury that the confinement could not be merely incidental to the murder: \u201cIn other words, if you find that Reid was only confined for the purpose of killing him, and that the confinement was only expected to be a momentary or passing event before the killing occurred, then this element of the crime has not been met and you must find the defendant not guilty of this charge.\u201d In order to convict, the court instructed, the jury had to unanimously agree either:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-12\">One, that the confinement of Reid was designed to accomplish an objective in addition to or independent of the killing of Reid, namely, the terrorizing of Reid;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-13\">Or, two, that if the only objective of the confinement was to kill Reid, the confinement was contemplated or expected to last for some appreciable period of time beyond that necessary to accomplish the killing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-14\">In response to a jury question regarding whether the predicate crime could be the murder itself, the court agreed that the murder itself could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>the purpose of the confinement, but \u201cthe evidence must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the confinement of Reid was not merely incidental to the murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\"> The merger doctrine, in this context, \u201cprohibits a conviction for kidnapping based upon acts that fall within the definition of that crime but are merely incidental to another crime.\u201d <em>People v. McEathron, </em>926 N.Y.S.2d 249, 251 (App. Div. 2011). The application of this doctrine presents an issue of first impression in New Hampshire. A significant majority of state courts have concluded that \u201cthe crime of kidnapping does not include conduct involving a restraint that is merely incidental to the commission of some other crime against the victim.\u201d <em>State v. Salamon, </em>949 A.2d 1092, 1119 (Conn. 2008) (collecting cases). Despite the varying statutory language and analyses underlying these cases, \u201cthey share a common theme, namely, that it is unlikely that the legislature intended to expose an accused to a kidnapping conviction, and the severe sanctions accompanying such a conviction, when the restraint involved is merely incidental to the commission of a separate, underlying crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We note that a minority of jurisdictions nonetheless hold that \u201ca kidnapping conviction may be sustained even when the restraint that forms the basis of that conviction is no greater in severity or duration than the restraint necessary to complete another crime, such as assault or robbery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1108,1119 n.30 (collecting cases). We agree with the view taken by the majority of jurisdictions, and now hold that a kidnapping conviction cannot rest on \u201cunlawful confinements or movements incidental to the commission of other felonies.\u201d <em>State v. Goodhue, </em>833 A.2d 861, 864 (Vt. 2003); <em>see also </em>Annotation, <em>Seizure or Detention for Purpose of Committing Rape, Robbery, or Other Offense as Constituting Separate Crime of Kidnapping, </em>39 A.L.R.5TH 283, 361, 368 (1996) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">As a threshold matter, we consider the merger doctrine to apply to a capital murder charge based upon kidnapping, since the kidnapping is an element of the offense that the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See </em>RSA 630:1, 1(b) (\u201c[a] person is guilty of capital murder if he knowingly causes the death of... [ajnother before, after, while engaged in the commission of, or while attempting to commit kidnapping as that offense is defined in RSA 633:1\u201d); <em>see also State v. Green, </em>616 P.2d 628, 634 (Wash. 1980) (\u201ckidnapping is a specific element of aggravated murder in the first degree. It is, however, a separate and distinct statutory crime having specific elements each of which must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The parties appear to agree, and the jury instructions reflect, that a kidnapping \u201cincidental\u201d to the commission of the murder would not suffice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>to support conviction. The issue before us, therefore, turns on the meaning of the word \u201cincidental.\u201d The defendant argues that the confinement of Reid needed to have independent significance from the crime of murder, and that in order to have such significance, the <em>purpose </em>of the confinement must have been other than the murder. The State maintains that the trial court accurately stated the law when it instructed that, in order to convict, the jury had to agree that either: (1) the confinement was designed to accomplish something other than Reid\u2019s death (namely, to terrorize Reid), <em>see </em>RSA 683:1,1(c); or (2) \u201cthe confinement was contemplated or expected to last for some appreciable period of time beyond that necessary to accomplish the killing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\u201cWhether restraint and movement are merely incidental to another crime or support kidnapping as a separate crime is a fact-specific determination based on the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. R.A., </em>2005 WL 2271889, at *3 (Wash. Ct. App. 2005); <em>see also Goodhue, </em>833 A.2d at 866. \u201cIn making that determination, our guiding principle is whether [the] defendant\u2019s restraint of the victim was so much the part of another substantive crime that the substantive crime could not have been committed without such acts and that independent criminal responsibility may not fairly be attributed to them.\u201d <em>McEathron, </em>926 N.Y.S.2d at 251 (brackets and quotations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">In determining whether a separate kidnapping conviction was supportable, courts have considered various factors, including whether evidence of the seizure, detention, or movement was or was not inherent in the nature of the underlying crimes; whether the crime was facilitated by the confinement; whether the movement or confinement prevented the victim from summoning assistance; whether the movement or detention lessened the defendant\u2019s risk of detection; and whether the movement or detention created a significant danger or increased the victim\u2019s risk of harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-7\"><em>Goodhue, </em>833 A.2d at 865. .</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">The defendant\u2019s reading of the statute \u2014 requiring the confinement to be for a purpose other than the underlying murder without consideration of the totality of the circumstances or any factor other than the purpose of the confinement \u2014 does not accord with other jurisdictions\u2019 interpretations of the merger doctrine. <em>See Salamon, </em>949 A.2d at 1117 (concluding that, \u201cto commit a kidnapping in conjunction with another crime, a defendant must intend to prevent the victim\u2019s liberation for a longer period of time or to a greater degree than that which is necessary to commit the other crime\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Nor does such an interpretation comport with the fairness purposes of the merger doctrine, which require analysis of whether the restraint constituted \u201ca minimal intrusion necessary and integral to another crime, . . . simultaneous and inseparable from another crime,\u201d or rather \u201ca crime in itself.\u201d <em>McEathron, </em>926 N.Y.S.2d at 251 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">We agree with the Washington courts that \u201csimply because the restraint takes place to facilitate another crime does not by itself render that restraint \u2018merely incidental.\u2019 \u201d <em>R.A., </em>2005 WL 2271889, at *4. The defendant\u2019s argument that, if he restrained the victim solely for the purpose of killing him, then he did not commit kidnapping,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">ignores the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d analysis <em>Green </em>mandates. Under [the defendant\u2019s] reasoning, there could be no kidnapping anytime the victim was restrained to facilitate a murder, regardless of the nature of the restraint. He would have us view all the events leading up to the murder as merely incidental to the murder itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">The trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury required a unanimous decision as to whether the defendant confined Reid for the purpose of terrorizing him, or, if the purpose of the confinement was to kill Reid, whether \u201cthe confinement was contemplated or expected to last for some appreciable period of time beyond that necessary to accomplish the killing.\u201d We find no error in this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b320-9\">DALIANIS, C.J., and HICKS, J., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
