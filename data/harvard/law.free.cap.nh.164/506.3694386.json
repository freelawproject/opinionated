We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The trial court found, or the record supports, the following facts. The petitioner rented an apartment from the respondent in Rochester. At some point before March 23, 2011, the petitioner complained to the city\u2019s plumbing and health inspector that her apartment lacked heat. On March 23, the inspector came to the premises and discovered that there was no heat in the petitioner\u2019s master bedroom because neither the radiator nor the electric heater worked. The inspector called the respondent about this issue on or about March 23, and met with her on or about March 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">On March 28, the inspector sent a letter to the respondent about this problem, giving her fourteen days to remedy it. The respondent did not respond to the letter. Nor did she return the inspector\u2019s subsequent telephone calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">The petitioner filed the instant petition on April 12, and, on that day, the trial court issued a temporary order requiring the respondent \u201cto immediately restore and maintain all utility services\u201d to the petitioner\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">On or about April 14, the inspector returned to the premises to meet with the parties, but left because of the marked hostility between them. The inspector observed that the petitioner\u2019s master bedroom still lacked heat that day. The inspector testified that he sent the respondent another letter on April 14, inquiring why she had not responded to the March 28 letter. The city\u2019s assistant director of code enforcement inspected the premises on April 18, and found that the heating units were operational. The director of code enforcement also came to the premises on April 20 and as well discovered that the heating units worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">Following the hearing on the petition, the trial court found that the respondent was aware that the heating units did not work from March 28 or later, and that she failed to have them repaired until April 18. The court determined that the respondent\u2019s actions were willful because she knew that the master bedroom lacked heat but failed to have it repaired for eighteen days despite this knowledge. The trial court awarded the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>tioner damages in the amount of $1,000 per day for each of the eighteen days that the respondent\u2019s violation continued. <em>See Wass v. Fuller, </em>158 N.H. 280, 283 (2009); RSA 540-A:4, IX(a) (2007) (amended 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">We will not disturb the findings of the trial court unless they lack evidentiary support or are erroneous as a matter of law. <em>Miller v. Slania Enters., </em>150 N.H. 655, 659 (2004); <em>see </em>RSA 540-A:4, V. Our inquiry is to determine whether the evidence presented to the trial court reasonably supports its findings, and then whether the court\u2019s decision is consonant with applicable law. <em>Miller, </em>150 N.H. at 659. Finally, we review questions of law <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">RSA 540-A:3, I (2007) provides: \u201cNo landlord shall willfully cause, directly or indirectly, the interruption or termination of any utility service being supplied to the tenant including, but not limited to . . . heat . . . , whether or not the utility service is under the control of the landlord.\u201d \u201c[T]he term \u2018willfully\u2019 in RSA 540-A:3, I, denotes a voluntary and intentional act, and not a mistaken or accidental act.\u201d Wass, 158 N.H. at 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">In her brief, the respondent argued that her conduct was not \u201cwil[l]ful\u201d because she did not cause the petitioner\u2019s apartment to lack heat in the first instance. She argued that, at most, she merely \u201callow[ed]\u201d the heating service to be interrupted; she did not \u201ccause\u201d the interruption itself. Her merely \u201cnegligent omission,\u201d she argued, did not constitute a willful act.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">However, at oral argument, when questioned about whether she had ever raised this statutory argument in the trial court, the respondent clarified her position. She conceded that a landlord\u2019s willful failure to correct a condition \u201cat some point... it rises to willful interruption.\u201d Her counsel argued that the respondent did not act \u201cwillfully,\u201d however, because she was \u201cjust idly unaware of the problem.\u201d Later, her counsel explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-9\">[Court]: Now, you acknowledged at the outset of your argument that at some point there\u2019s a line where inaction becomes willfulness, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-10\">[Counsel]: I think that\u2019s built into the statute because the . . . penalties accrue daily. So, in effect, every day is another violation. So, I think that there\u2019s no choice but to read it as day by day, /know, today you might be mistaken, but tomorrow, if you ignore the problem,. . . yes, the answer to your question is yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-12\">[Court]:... In essence, didn\u2019t the trial court make a determination that, yes, this time it went. . . past the fine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-13\">[Counsel]: Yes, I think that\u2019s what the trial court did, but the facts aren\u2019t on the record to support the finding. The/re just not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>there. . . . The tenant. .. never notified the [landlord]. The heat worked every time.... I think this is sufficiency of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">In light of the respondent\u2019s clarification at oral argument, we assume, without deciding, that a landlord\u2019s willful failure to repair a tenant\u2019s utility service constitutes \u201cwillful interruption\u201d of that service. RSA 540-A:3,1. We limit our review to whether there was evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s findings that the respondent was aware that the heating units in the petitioner\u2019s apartment did not work and that she willfully did not repair them, despite this knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">There is ample evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the respondent was aware that the heating units in the petitioner\u2019s apartment did not work. The petitioner\u2019s brother testified that he had been living with the petitioner in the apartment since January 2011, and that while living there, he observed that the heating units worked only intermittently. The brother testified that the petitioner called the respondent about this issue on numerous occasions and that she finally notified the city of her concerns because the respondent had failed to fix the problem. The record also includes the March 28 letter specifically notifying the respondent that the heating units did not work.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The record also supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the landlord did not repair the units until April 18 despite knowing that they did not work. The record includes a May 14 letter from an electrician stating that he was not called until April 8 to repair the heating units, and that he did not respond to the call until April 18. Thus, despite knowing at least from the inspector\u2019s March 28 letter that the heating units needed repair, the landlord offered no evidence that she called an electrician until eleven days later. The electrician did nothing for another ten days.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Based upon all of the above evidence, the trial court reasonably found that the respondent knew that the heating units in the petitioner\u2019s master bedroom did not work and that, despite this knowledge, she did not have them repaired for at least eighteen days. Based upon these findings, the trial court reasonably determined that the respondent\u2019s failure to have the units repaired was intentional, and, therefore, willful. <em>See Wass, </em>158 N.H. at 283. We, therefore, uphold the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the respondent\u2019s conduct willfully violated RSA 540-A:3, I.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">We next address the proper measure of damages. Under the version of RSA 540-A:4, IX(a) in effect when the events giving rise to this appeal occurred, a violation of RSA 540-A:3,1, entitled the petitioner to \u201cthe civil remedies set forth in RSA 358-A:10 for the initial violation, including costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the proceedings.\u201d RSA 540-A:4, IX(a) (Supp. 2012). RSA 358-A:10 (2009) provides for recovery \u201cin the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>amount of actual damages or $1,000, whichever is greater.\u201d Because we have upheld the trial court\u2019s finding that the respondent willfully violated RSA 540-A:3, I, we also uphold its determination that the petitioner was entitled to damages of $1,000 for that initial violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">RSA 540-A:4, IX(a) also entitled the petitioner to damages for \u201c[e]ach day\u201d that the respondent\u2019s violation continued <em>\u201cafter issuance of a temporary order!\u2019 </em>RSA 540-A:4, IX(a) (emphasis added); <em>see Wass, </em>158 N.H. at 283. The temporary order in this case was issued on April 12, 2011. Nonetheless, the trial court awarded the petitioner $1,000 per day for some days that the respondent\u2019s violation of RSA 540-A:3, I, continued <em>before </em>April 12. In so doing, <em>the </em>trial court contravened the plain meaning of RSA 540-A:4, IX(a) and committed plain error. <em>See </em>SUP. Ct. R. 16-A.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The plain error rule allows us to exercise our discretion to correct errors that were raised neither in the trial court nor on appeal. <em>Id. </em>To find plain error: \u201c(1) there must be an error; (2) the error must be plain; (3) the error must affect substantial rights; and (4) the error must seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Brownell &amp; Brownell, </em>163 N.H. 593, 602 (2012) (quotation omitted). The rule should be used sparingly, its use limited to those circumstances in which a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The petitioner contests only the fourth prong of the plain error test. In light of her apparent concession that the other prongs of the plain error test have been met, we limit our analysis to the fourth prong of that test. \u201cUnder the fourth prong, we must decide whether the trial court\u2019s error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>State v. Russell, </em>159 N.H. 475, 491 (2009) (quotation and brackets omitted). We apply the fourth prong \u201con a case-specific and fact-intensive basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">Under this case-by-case approach, we conclude that the error in this case warrants the exercise of our discretion to correct it. The trial court\u2019s damage award was contrary to the express language of the pertinent statute. The statute plainly allows a trial court to award damages of $1,000 per day for each day that a violation continues <em>after </em>the court has issued a temporary order. The statute does not authorize a trial court to award continuing violation damages for any days <em>before </em>it has issued a temporary order. The damages award in this case, therefore, cannot stand. <em>See State v. Taylor, </em>152 N.H. 719, 721 (2005) (fourth prong of plain error test satisfied because sentence imposed by trial court was illegal in that it violated pertinent statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">The petitioner argues that the trial court\u2019s error does not satisfy the fourth prong because the respondent did not bring the error to the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>court\u2019s attention. She contends: \u201cThe failure of [the respondent\u2019s] representatives to raise this issue does not support an allegation that the proceedings in the [trial] [c]ourt were unfair.\u201d As she explains: \u201cA judicial proceeding in which an experienced [respondent] and two experienced legal counsel did not perceive an error by the [trial] [c]ourt, is not one where the process can be considered \u2018unfair\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">In effect, the petitioner argues that because the respondent failed to preserve the trial court\u2019s error for our review, the error cannot \u201cseriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 720. We disagree. The plain error rule grants us the discretion to correct trial court errors despite an appellant\u2019s failure to preserve them for our review, or even to argue them on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Additionally, the petitioner argues that we should not exercise our discretion to correct the trial court\u2019s error in this case because \u201cthe result is not a miscarriage of justice.\u201d We disagree. As a result of the trial court\u2019s error, the respondent was required to pay $18,000, even though the damage award should have been thousands of dollars less.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Because the trial court committed plain error when it awarded the petitioner $1,000 per day for at least some days that the respondent\u2019s violation of RSA 540-A:3,1, continued before April 12, we vacate $17,000 of the damage award and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. On remand, the trial court shall determine whether the respondent willfully violated RSA 540-A:3,1, after April 12, and, if so, the court shall award the petitioner $1,000 per day for each day that the respondent\u2019s violation continued. If the court finds that the respondent did not willfully violate RSA 540-A:3, I, after April 12, the court shall not award the petitioner any continuing violation damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">We have reviewed the parties\u2019 remaining arguments and conclude that they do not warrant any extended consideration. <em>See Vogel v. Vogel, </em>137 N.H. 321, 322 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; vacated in part; and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b535-10\">Hicks, Conboy, Lynn and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
