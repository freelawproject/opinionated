He argues that the Superior Court <em>(Houran, </em>J.) erred in: (1) denying his motion to suppress eyewitness identification evidence; (2) hmiting his ability to cross-examine the victim; and (3) allowing the admission of evidence of a pocket knife discovered on his person when apprehended by the police. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">The following facts are drawn from the trial court\u2019s order denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. N.R., the victim, told police that she had been walking home from work late on the evening of August 22,2008, along Route 16 in North Conway when a man approached her and proposed to pay her for a sexual act. She said the man told her he was from out of town and worked as a painter in the area. She rebuffed him and walked alone for about a mile, but the man approached her again near a scenic overlook and once more made a sexual advance. After she rejected him, he punched her in the face, pulled her into the woods, and raped her. She described her attacker as a white man in his late twenties or early thirties, with a thin, muscular build, a narrow face, and a goatee.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">After receiving another report on September 18 of a sexual assault occurring in the same area, the police issued a \u201cbe on the lookout\u201d alert for the man N.R. had described. The defendant was apprehended several days later when State Trooper Craig McGinley saw him walking near the scenic overlook and, after speaking with him, identified several characteristics that matched the description given by N.R. The police assembled a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>photographic array displaying the defendant and seven other men selected from the police department\u2019s computer system and, on September 25, presented it to N.R. at her home. N.R. identified the defendant as the attacker.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">On September 26, N.R. met at the police station with Elizabeth Kelley, the program director of the Child Advocacy Center. During that interview, N.R. expressed uncertainty as to her identification of the defendant. For example, in response to Kelley\u2019s question as to \u201chow sure [she was] that it was the guy,\u201d N.R. responded, \u201cI don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know.\u201d According to a police lieutenant, the police suspended their investigation as a result of N.R.\u2019s uncertainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Trooper McGinley, however, continued investigating the incident and assembled a file on the defendant, including photographs of him and documents regarding his criminal background. On June 19,2009, McGinley visited N.R. at work and told her he believed that she had chosen the right person in the photo array, and later testified he did so to reassure her that the police cared about her case. He then gave N.R. the file and stepped away for approximately five minutes while she looked at it. When he returned, he gave N.R. his contact information and told her to contact him if she wanted to pursue the matter further.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">On June 28, N.R. sent McGinley a text message stating she would like to \u201chelp put this guy away.\u201d On July 22, N.R. met with Officer Jody Eichorn of the Moultonborough Police Department for another interview. Officer Eichorn asked N.R. if she had identified her attacker in the photo array on September 25, 2008, to which N.R. responded, \u2018Tes.\u201d N.R. then explained that the police had caused her to \u201csecond-guessG\u201d herself after selecting the defendant\u2019s photograph when first presented with the photo array, stating that \u201cthey kept harping at me\u201d and repeatedly asked how sure she was. N.R. did not remember discussing the photo array at the September 26,2008 meeting with Elizabeth Kelley. Eichorn then said, \u201cso, at this point today you answered that yes, you\u2019re positive that that was him.\u201d N.R. answered, \u201cI\u2019m, yeah.\u201d The defendant was arrested on July 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">The State charged the defendant with aggravated felonious sexual assault and kidnapping and a trial was held in April 2010. That trial ended in a mistrial after a jury could not reach a verdict. Subsequently, the State added charges of attempted aggravated felonious sexual assault and criminal threatening. After a retrial, a jury found him guilty of all four charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">The defendant first argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress N.R.\u2019s identification of him as her assailant. He asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>the trial court to suppress any testimony about N.R.\u2019s September 25, 2008 identification of the defendant in the photo array, any testimony about the July 22, 2009 conversation with Officer Eichorn in which N.R. confirmed she had correctly identified her assailant, and any in-court testimony positively identifying the defendant as her assailant. He contends that the identification procedures employed by the police were unnecessarily suggestive, in violation of his rights under Part I, Article 15 of the State Constitution and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of its federal counterpart.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">We first address the defendant\u2019s argument under the State Constitution, <em>State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231-32 (1983), and rely on federal law only to aid in our analysis, <em>id. </em>at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">On appeal from a motion to suppress identification evidence, we will not overturn the trial court\u2019s ruling unless, after reviewing the record, we conclude that it is contrary to the weight of the evidence. <em>State v. Bell-Rogers, </em>159 N.H. 178, 181 (2009); <em>State v. Fecteau, </em>133 N.H. 860, 867 (1991). In making this determination, we ask whether the identification procedures used were so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification that the defendant was denied due process of law. <em>Fecteau, </em>133 N.H. at 867. The defendant has the initial burden of proving that the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive. <em>State v. King, </em>156 N.H. 371, 374 (2007). Only if the defendant has met his burden must we then consider the factors enumerated in <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188 (1972), to determine whether the identification procedure was so suggestive as to render the identification unreliable and, hence, inadmissible. <em>King, </em>156 N.H. at 374. At this stage of the inquiry, the State bears the burden. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Under <em>Biggers,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">the factors to be considered in evaluating the likelihood of misidentification include the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness\u2019 degree of attention, the accuracy of the witness\u2019 prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of time between the crime and the confrontation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-9\"><em>Biggers, </em>409 U.S. at 199-200.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">The September 25 photo array contained eight pictures generated through a computer system using N.R.\u2019s description of her attacker and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>appearance of the defendant. Lieutenant Joseph Faia and Sergeant Alan Broyer took the photo array to N.R.\u2019s home and told her they had a person of interest in the case and asked her to look at some photographs. Faia told her to pick the person who attacked her if his picture was in the array, but \u201c[i]f that person isn\u2019t in the lineup, do not select anyone.\u201d After placing the photographs on the table, N.R. identified the photograph of the defendant as her attacker without hesitation and initialed and dated the space below his image. Faia asked her how sure she was that the man she selected was her attacker and she rated her level of certainty a seven out of ten. The officers did not tell her she had selected the person of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The defendant argues that the photo array procedures were unnecessarily suggestive because the officers \u201cfailed materially to follow New Hampshire [Attorney General] protocols specifically designed to eliminate possible suggestiveness in a photo array.\u201d We disagree. That the police did not follow every recommendation of the attorney general guidelines does not, in and of itself, satisfy the defendant\u2019s burden to show that the manner of presenting the photographs was unnecessarily suggestive. As the trial court recognized, the pertinent inquiry is \u201cwhether the police indicated the suspect\u2019s identity to the witness by means of the photographic display or by saying something before or contemporaneously with the witness\u2019 positive identification,\u201d notwithstanding that the police \u201cdid not provide [N.R.] with most of the [Attorney General] Guidelines\u2019 explanations.\u201d <em>See Bell-Rogers, </em>159 N.H. at 181 (\u201cTo determine whether the out-of-court identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive we ask whether the police have implicitly conveyed their opinion of the criminal\u2019s identity to the witness by means of the photographic display.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Our review of the record, including the photo array itself, indicates no suggestiveness in the photo array. <em>Cf. Fecteau, </em>133 N.H. at 867. Although the police told N.R. they had a person of interest, there is no evidence that they told her that the defendant\u2019s photograph depicted that person. As the trial court found, there was no indication that the officers rushed N.R. to make a decision or implied she should select a particular photograph. Nor did the photo array display the images in a manner that highlighted the defendant\u2019s photograph, such as an absence of other images of men with goatees or characteristics similar to the defendant\u2019s. The defendant has provided nothing that would satisfy his burden to show that \u201cthe police have implicitly conveyed their opinion of the criminal\u2019s identity to the witness.\u201d <em>Bell-Rogers, </em>159 N.H. at 181 (quotation omitted). Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the trial court\u2019s decision as to the admissibility of the photo array was contrary to the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Because the Federal Constitution is no more protective of the defendant\u2019s rights than the State Constitution under these circumstances, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Flenory, </em>619 F.2d 301, 304 (3d Cir. 1980), we reach the same conclusion under the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The defendant next argues that N.R.\u2019s identification of him during her July 2009 meeting with Officer Eichorn and her subsequent in-court identification of him were \u201cirrevocably taint[ed]\u201d as a result of Trooper McGinley\u2019s interactions with her in June 2009, and, accordingly, both identifications should have been excluded from trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">As noted, we employ a two-step analysis to determine the admissibility of N.R.\u2019s July 2009 out-of-court identification of the defendant. <em>King, </em>156 N.H. at 374. If that identification is found inadmissible under this test, N.R.\u2019s subsequent in-court identification will also be inadmissible \u201cunless it did not result from the earlier confrontation but was independent thereof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and ellipsis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">The trial court determined, and the State does not argue otherwise on appeal, that McGinley\u2019s conduct when he visited N.R. at work and showed her the defendant\u2019s file was suggestive. The court noted that McGinley \u201cexplicitly conveyed to her his opinion that the defendant was her attacker\u201d and subsequently allowed her to review a file containing photographs of the defendant, a document entitled \u201cState v. Timothy Perri / Sexual Assault,\u201d and writings about the defendant that evidenced a propensity to commit violence against women. The court nevertheless did not exclude the later identification because it concluded that the State had satisfied the <em>Biggers </em>test by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">We agree with the trial court that consideration of the five <em>Biggers </em>factors supports a finding that N.R.\u2019s identification of the defendant in July 2009 was sufficiently reliable to warrant admission at trial. She had two opportunities to view the defendant on the day of the assault, including in a well-lit area when he first propositioned her for sex and later when he approached her, punched her, and faced her as he raped her on the ground. That her degree of attention was high is shown by her accurate description of his clothing and facial characteristics, as well as by her observation that he held a folding pocket knife against her neck and had an odor of cigarettes. She accurately described the defendant before the June 2009 meeting with Trooper McGinley as being white, thin, and muscular, having a narrow face and a dark goatee, and being a smoker. While she did not exhibit complete certainty in her choice of the defendant\u2019s photograph when presented with the photo array, she did note that the defendant\u2019s face <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>\u201creally stood out. ... like right away when I saw it.\u201d Under the totality of the circumstances, N.R.\u2019s out-of-court identification of the defendant after meeting with Trooper McGinley bore sufficient indicia of reliability to warrant admission at trial. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s decision was not contrary to the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Because N.R.\u2019s July 2009 out-of-court identification of the defendant was admissible under <em>Biggers, </em>it follows that her in-court identification was also ' admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">As is true with respect to the photo array, the Federal Constitution is no more protective of the defendant\u2019s rights than the State Constitution under these circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Biggers, </em>409 U.S. at 200-01 (identification sufficiently rehable where victim faced attacker twice, provided detailed description of his characteristics, and had \u201cno doubt\u201d defendant was the attacker). Accordingly, we reach the same conclusion under the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Next, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in prohibiting him from eliciting testimony from N.R. that would have demonstrated that a person who helped prepare her for the second trial was the jury foreperson in the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">The facts relevant to this claim of error are as follows. After the first jury trial ended in a mistrial, its jury foreperson, A.C., wrote a message to N.R. via Facebook expressing feelings of support, telling her she believed in N.R. and noting that others on the jury believed the defendant was guilty. A.C. also provided details as to how the jurors voted and offered her contact information should N.R. have \u201cany questions.\u201d The two women then began a correspondence and eventually met in person to discuss ways in which N.R. might improve her testimony to be more credible to the jury in the subsequent trial. During one meeting that took place in the presence of a victim/witness advocate, A.C. provided N.R. with \u201ctips on how to improve [her] testimony,\u201d advising her to make clear she was certain of her identification of the defendant at the September 25, 2008 photo array; to better explain why she told Child Advocacy Center director Elizabeth Kelley \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d in response to a question about her level of certainty; and to be more emotional and feel free to cry.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">In a motion argued outside the jury\u2019s presence, the defendant sought permission to elicit testimony relating to N.R.\u2019s exchanges with A.C., asserting that this information \u201cgoes to [N.R.\u2019s] motivation to make her testimony better, to potentially be more emotional\u201d to convince the jury to believe her. The court partially granted the defendant\u2019s request, ruling that it was \u201cfair game\u201d for defense counsel to make any \u201cinquiries concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>whether someone who observed her testimony . . . later contacted [N.R.] and made suggestions.\u201d However, the court prohibited defense counsel from referring to or inquiring about the fact that there was a former trial at which another jury was unable to render a decision. Thus, defense counsel was permitted to ask anything \u201cexcept those [questions] that are premised upon the existence of a prior trial or prior fact finder as a jury and the findings of that jury.\u201d Accordingly, defense counsel was precluded from inquiring about A.C.\u2019s status as a juror at the prior trial. The defendant contends this was reversible error because it \u201cseriously undermined [his] ability to present a defense.\u201d The State does not contend that the excluded references were not relevant; rather, it argues that the trial court sustainably exercised its discretion under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Relevant evidence \u201cmay be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 408.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">Evidence is unfairly prejudicial if its primary purpose or effect is to appeal to a jury\u2019s sympathies, arouse its sense of horror, provoke its instinct to punish, or trigger other mainsprings of human action that may cause a jury to base its decision on something other than the established propositions in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-7\"><em>State v. Cassavaugh, </em>161 N.H. 90, 98 (2010) (quotation omitted). We accord the trial court considerable deference in determining whether to admit or exclude evidence under Rule 403, and we will not disturb its decision absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>State v. Miller, </em>155 N.H. 246, 252 (2007). To show an unsustainable exercise of discretion, the defendant must demonstrate that the court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case. <em>State v. Stowe, </em>162 N.H. 464, 470 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">We disagree with the defendant that the trial court\u2019s decision precluding direct references to the former trial or the identity of A.C. as the foreperson of the jury of that trial constituted an unsustainable exercise of discretion. At the outset, we note that defense counsel was permitted to, and did, engage in a thorough cross-examination of N.R. with respect to her exchanges with A.C. Defense counsel elicited several pertinent facts bearing on N.R.\u2019s credibility: that she testified four months earlier under oath with a judge presiding; that the same prosecutor, defense attorney, and defendant were present during her prior testimony; that N.R. faced the same questions during her prior testimony as she did at trial; and that A.C. observed her testimony at the former \u201chearing\u201d and contacted her thirty days later. Counsel also elicited many details about N.R.\u2019s exchanges with A.C., including that A.C. provided \u201ctips on how to improve [her] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>testimony,\u201d such as being more emotional, giving more details, clarifying her testimony about the September 26, 2008 interview with Elizabeth Kelley, and crying during the testimony. All of these facts were pertinent to N.R.\u2019s credibility because they tended to suggest her in-court testimony was influenced not by the truth or by genuine emotions, but by \u201ccoaching\u201d provided by a person who had observed her previous testimony first-hand and, therefore, had an informed opinion about why that testimony fell short. Because the court permitted defense counsel to explore these topics freely, we need only determine whether the court erred in prohibiting any reference to the fact that A.C. was a juror at a prior trial \u2014 not merely an observer at a hearing \u2014 that ended in a deadlocked jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Knowledge of A.C.\u2019s status as a juror at a prior trial could have helped the jury assess the credibility of N.R.\u2019s testimony in the subsequent trial because A.C. was in a unique position, as a juror, to understand the deficiencies in N.R.\u2019s testimony at the prior trial and make recommendations to enhance her testimony. A rational jury could have believed that N.R. would give A.C.\u2019s advice special consideration that she would not otherwise have afforded a mere observer of the prior testimony. But permitting reference to the prior \u201ctrial,\u201d rather than a prior \u201chearing,\u201d would have risked misleading and confusing the jury because it may have led jurors to speculate as to the prior trial\u2019s outcome and the deliberations of the prior jury \u2014 both impermissible considerations. <em>See, e.g., Kinney v. People, </em>187 P.3d 548, 558 (Colo. 2008) <em>(en banc) </em>(finding reversible error where trial court failed to instruct jury that defendant had been acquitted of charges in other trials, even though trials referred to as \u201cproceedings,\u201d when it was evident from the record that jury had speculated that there had been previous trials). In light of these considerations, the trial court acted well within its discretion in concluding that these risks substantially outweighed whatever marginal probative value A.C.\u2019s status as a juror and the outcome of the former trial would have provided. <em>Cf. United States v. Cook, </em>776 F. Supp. 755, 760 (S.D.N.Y. 1991) (permitting counsel to refer to witness\u2019s testimony at \u201ca prior trial\u201d but not \u201cthe prior trial of this case\u201d (quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\"><em>United States v. Giovanelli, </em>945 F.2d 479 (2d Cir. 1991), does not require a contrary result. Although in that case the court held that the defendants should have been permitted to refer to prior \u201ctrials\u201d rather than \u201cproceedings\u201d when cross-examining witnesses who had testified at the prior trials, <em>id. </em>at 488, it did so for reasons that do not apply to this case. For example, in contrast to the court\u2019s concern in <em>Giovanelli </em>that \u201cit was at times impossible to focus a witness\u2019 attention on a specific prior inconsistent statement,\u201d <em>Giovanelli, </em>945 F.2d at 488, here defense counsel directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>N.R.\u2019s memory to the precise time and context of her prior testimony. The defendant does not suggest that the prohibition on reference to a prior \u201ctrial\u201d inhibited N.R.\u2019s ability to remember her statements at that trial. Also in contrast to <em>Giovanelli, </em>in which the defense could not establish that the prior statements of the witnesses had been made \u201cin a setting as solemn and dignified as the current trial,\u201d <em>Giovanelli, </em>945 F.2d at 488, here defense counsel established that the prior hearing bore the same indicia of solemnity and dignity as the trial. Of course, trial courts have an obligation to examine the facts of each case to determine whether limiting a defendant\u2019s proposed line of questioning would unduly inhibit the opportunity to confront witnesses for potential bias or other credibility issues \u2014 as the court found to be a concern in <em>Giovanelli. </em>There may be circumstances in which prohibiting reference to a prior trial constitutes an unsustainable exercise of discretion for reasons similar to those present in <em>Giovanelli </em>or other compelling reasons. Here, however, the trial court struck a sustainable balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">To the extent that the defendant premises his argument upon a claim that the trial court could have cured any dangers of allowing reference to A.C.\u2019s status as a juror or to the prior \u201ctrial\u201d through timely jury instructions, that claim is not preserved for our review. <em>Cf. State v. Hynes, </em>159 N.H. 187, 205 (2009) (\u201cAs a general rule, we will not consider grounds of objections not specified or called to the court\u2019s attention at the trial. This requirement, grounded in common sense and judicial economy, affords the trial court an opportunity to correct an error it may have made and is particularly appropriate where an alleged error involves a jury instruction.\u201d (quotation omitted)). Specifically, during the arguments on this issue, the defendant did not propose such instructions to the trial court as a viable alternative to excluding all references to the prior trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Next, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence that he possessed a folding pocket knife when he was detained. The State presented the detaining officer\u2019s testimony describing the pocket knife as evidence tending to corroborate N.R.\u2019s statement that her attacker held a folding pocket knife against her throat and threatened to kill her during the assault. The defendant contends that the police lacked \u201creasonable belief that [he was] armed and presently dangerous to the officer or to others,\u201d <em>State v. Coons, </em>137 N.H. 365, 367 (1993) (quotation omitted), as is required to justify the frisk search that led to the knife\u2019s discovery. The State defends the search on two grounds, contending first that the officers had reasonable suspicion to believe the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>defendant was armed and dangerous, and second that, even if the frisk was unlawful, the inevitable discovery doctrine applied to preclude its exclusion at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">We first address the defendant\u2019s argument under the State Constitution, <em>Ball, </em>124 N.H. at 231-32, and rely on federal law only to aid in our analysis, <em>id. </em>at 233. In reviewing the trial court\u2019s ruling, we accept its factual findings unless they lack support in the record or .are clearly erroneous. <em>State v. McKinnon-Andrews, </em>151 N.H. 19, 22 (2004). \u201cThe application of the appropriate legal standard to those facts, however, is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo.\u201d State v. Roach, </em>141 N.H. 64, 66 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Once an officer is justified in making an investigatory stop, he may also conduct a protective frisk if he reasonably believes the individual is armed and presently dangerous. <em>State v. Michelson, </em>160 N.H. 270, 272 (2010). The purpose of a protective frisk is not to discover evidence of a crime, but to allow the officer to pursue his investigation without fear of violence. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the frisk must be strictly confined to what is minimally necessary to discover the presence of a weapon. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Here, the police were justified in conducting a protective frisk of the defendant. On September 19, Trooper McGinley received the \u201cbe on the lookout\u201d alert describing \u201cmultiple forcible rape[s]\u201d in the area. The report indicated that the Conway police were looking for a \u201cwhite male, in his 30\u2019s, 5'7\" to 5'8\" tall, slim build and unshaven face with goatee[, and]... smoker\u2019s breath,\u201d who may be a painter and had been seen wearing a maroon hooded sweatshirt. McGinley later learned that N.R.\u2019s assault took place near the scenic overlook in North Conway. He testified that, at around 8:40 p.m. on September 21, he saw the defendant walking near the overlook and believed he matched the description of the rape suspect. McGinley pulled behind the defendant in his police cruiser and stopped him for questioning, during which he observed that the defendant was wearing a hooded sweatshirt and dark jeans with paint on them, was smoking a cigarette, and had a goatee. In McGinley\u2019s estimation, the defendant matched the person described in the report \u201cto a tee.\u201d After backup police officers arrived on the scene, one of them, according to his testimony, patted the defendant down and found the folding pocket knife. Given that the defendant\u2019s appearance closely corresponded to the person described in the report of a violent rape occurring in the same area, there was reasonable suspicion to believe the defendant would be armed and dangerous when faced with imminent apprehension by the authorities. <em>Cf. United States v. Bullock, </em>510 F.3d 342, 347 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (\u201c[C]ourts routinely hold that protective frisks to ensure officer safety are permissible when an officer has reasonable suspicion that the suspect committed a crime involving or associated with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>carrying or using a weapon.\u201d) (citing cases); <em>United States v. Barnett, </em>505 F.3d 637, 640 (7th Cir. 2007) (reasonable suspicion to frisk where person was suspected of burglary, a crime \u201cnormally and reasonably expected to involve a weapon\u201d); <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 33 (1968) (Harlan, J., concurring) (\u201cthe right to frisk must be immediate and automatic if the reason for the stop is, as here, an articulable suspicion of a crime of violence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Because the Federal Constitution is no more protective of the defendant\u2019s rights than the State Constitution under these circumstances, <em>see Barnett, </em>505 F.3d at 640; <em>Michelson, </em>160 N.H. at 273, we reach the same conclusion under the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Finally, the defendant argues that the trial court erred by admitting the pocket knife evidence because it was irrelevant. All evidence must be relevant to be admissible. N.H. R. Ev. 402. Relevant evidence is that which has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 401. Whether evidence is relevant is a question for the trial court\u2019s sound discretion, and we will not overturn its determination absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>State v. Town, </em>163 N.H. 790, 795 (2012). To show an unsustainable exercise of discretion, the defendant must demonstrate that the court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">The defendant contends that the evidence had no probative value because the State did not establish that the knife found on him when he was detained was the same as, or even similar to, the knife used in the August 22, 2008 assault. However, contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion that there was \u201cno way to establish that the knife found on\u201d him \u201cwas similar to\u201d the knife described by N.R., both Officer Walker and N.R. described their observations in consistent terms: Walker testified that the knife on the defendant \u201cwas just a folding pocketknife,\u201d while N.R. testified that she saw the defendant pull a pocket knife from his pocket, heard the sound of a knife clicking open, and felt the blade on her throat. Moreover, the State need not marshal conclusive evidence to connect the knife found on the defendant\u2019s person to the crime scene for the knife to be admissible in evidence. <em>See People v. Farnam, </em>47 P.3d 988, 1025 (Cal. 2002). That many persons possess similar knives \u201cmay diminish the strength of the evidence, but it does not make it irrelevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The fact that the defendant carried a pocket knife on his person, near the scene of the crime, tended to make it more probable than without such evidence that he committed the assault. <em>Cf. State v. Giddens, </em>155 N.H. 175, 180 (2007) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>(statements made by defendant about methods for committing rape were relevant because methods were similar to the events of the alleged rape). Therefore, the trial court acted within its discretion in admitting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b437-6\">DALIANIS, C.J., and CONBOY, LYNN and BASSETT, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
