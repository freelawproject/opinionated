We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-21\">The only issue on appeal is whether the defendant, having been twice previously convicted of a class A misdemeanor theft or felony theft in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>another state, may be charged with class B felony theft as a third offense under RSA 637:11, 11(b). This question requires us to engage in statutory interpretation, a question of law that we decide <em>de novo. State v. Marshall, </em>162 N.H. 657, 661 (2011). In matters of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of a statute considered as a whole. <em>Duquette v. Warden, N.H. State Prison, </em>154 N.H. 737, 740 (2007). We do not follow the common law rule that criminal statutes are to be strictly construed; rather, we construe them according to the fair import of their terms and to promote justice. <em>See State v. Moran, </em>158 N.H. 318, 321 (2009); RSA 625:3 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Regardless of the value of the property stolen, RSA 637:11,11(b) makes a theft crime a class B felony if \u201c[t]he actor has been twice before convicted of theft of property or services, as a felony or class A misdemeanor.\u201d \u201cFelony\u201d is defined as \u201cmurder or a crime so designated by statute within or outside this code or a crime defined by statute outside of this code where the maximum penalty provided is imprisonment in excess of one year.\u201d RSA 625:9, III (2007). \u201cClass A misdemeanor\u201d is defined as \u201cany crime so designated by statute within or outside this code <em>and </em>any crime defined outside of this code for which the maximum penalty, exclusive of fine, is imprisonment not in excess of one year.\u201d RSA 625:9, TV(a) (Supp. 2012) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\"> The defendant argues that her prior out-of-state convictions may not be considered for the purpose of the RSA 637:11, 11(b) sentence enhancement because the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting this provision was to \u201cexclude out-of-state convictions.\u201d We disagree. The relevant definitions of a felony and a class A misdemeanor evince a clear legislative intent to include theft crimes committed outside of New Hampshire as predicate offenses triggering the sentence enhancement of RSA 637:11, 11(b). Any crime defined \u201coutside\u201d of the criminal code means any crime \u201cbeyond [its] limits.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1604 (unabridged ed. 2002). A theft statute in another state for which the maximum penalty is either \u201cimprisonment in excess of one year,\u201d RSA 625:9, III, or \u201cimprisonment not in excess of one year,\u201d RSA 625:9, IV(a), is plainly a statute \u201cbeyond the limits of\u2019 New Hampshire\u2019s criminal code. <em>Id. </em>The defendant\u2019s interpretation would require us to construe \u201coutside of this code\u201d to mean \u201coutside of this code but within other laws of the State of New Hampshire\u201d \u2014 a construction at odds with the oft-repeated maxim that courts may not add words to a statute that the legislature did not see fit to include. <em>State v. Pessetto, </em>160 N.H. 813, 816 (2010). \u2018We will not rewrite the statute; that is the province of the legislature.\u201d <em>Balke v. City of Manchester, </em>150 N.H. 69, 73 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>Having concluded that the plain language of RSA 637:11, 11(b), together with RSA 625:9, III and IV(a), expresses the legislature\u2019s intent to include out-of-state theft convictions as predicate sentence enhancement offenses, we find the defendant\u2019s remaining arguments unavailing. The defendant contends, for example, that our decision in <em>State v. Cardin, </em>102 N.H. 314 (1959), recognized the common law principle that, in her words, \u201ca prior conviction ha[s] no effect beyond the limits of the jurisdiction where the judgment was rendered unless a statute expressly h[olds] otherwise.\u201d <em>But cf. People v. Hazelton, </em>926 P.2d 423, 426-27 (Cal. 1996); <em>State v. Henderson, </em>804 N.W.2d 723, 727 (Iowa Ct. App. 2011) (prior out-of-state convictions may be used as predicate offenses under enhanced penalty statute for \u201cone who has before been twice convicted of theft,\u201d notwithstanding existence of other Iowa statutes explicitly providing for such use in other contexts (quotation omitted)). Because we have rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that RSA 637:11,11(b) lacks an express indication of the legislature\u2019s intent to include out-of-state criminal theft convictions as predicates for sentence enhancement, we necessarily reject her argument under <em>Cardin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The defendant also contends that \u201c[t]he existence of other statutes specifically referring to out-of-state convictions indicates the legislature\u2019s intent to exclude out-of-state prior convictions where, as in RSA 637:11, 11(b), their inclusion is not specified.\u201d Although she recites the principle of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>(the mention of one thing excludes another), her argument is more aptly based upon our statement in <em>In re Guardianship of Williams </em>that \u201cthe legislature\u2019s choice of language is deemed to be meaningful, and that. . . whenever the legislature enacts a provision, it has in mind previous statutes relating to the same subject matter.\u201d <em>In re Guardianship of Williams, </em>159 N.H. 318, 323 (2009) (quotation omitted). As the State correctly observes, \u201cthe statutes cited by the defendant are not referred to in RSA 637:11,11(b),\u201d nor do they relate to the same subject matter \u2014 penalty enhancements for third theft offenses \u2014 as the one at issue. \u201cWe interpret legislative intent from the statute <em>as urritten </em>and will not consider what the legislature might have said...\u201d <em>Fog Motorsports #3 v. Arctic Cat Sales, </em>159 N.H. 266, 268 (2009) (emphasis added); <em>see Henderson, </em>804 N.W.2d at 727 (rejecting similar contention that the existence in one statute of explicit language authorizing use of prior out-of-state convictions for penalty enhancement implied legislative intent to prohibit use of out-of-state convictions for third-offense theft statute at issue). That a number of New Hampshire statutes refer to out-of-state convictions more explicitly than does the statute here at issue, <em>see, e.g., </em>RSA 632-A:10, I (2007) (prohibiting those who have \u201cbeen convicted in this or any other jurisdiction\u201d of certain offenses from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>engaging in child care services), does not alter the fact that the legislature chose the words \u201coutside of this code\u201d in RSA 625:9, III and TV(a). \u201c[T]here is more than one way\u201d for the legislature \u201cto skin the cat.\u201d <em>Knight v. Comissioner, </em>552 U.S. 181, 194 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Finally, the defendant contends that, \u201cif any doubt or ambiguity survives\u201d after undertaking statutory analysis, we \u201cshould apply the rule of lenity in favor of\u2019 her construction. Because we find no ambiguity in RSA 637:11,11(b), the rule of lenity does not apply. <em>State v Brooks, </em>164 N.H. 272, 291-92 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b720-7\">Dalianis, C.J., and Conboy, Lynn and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
