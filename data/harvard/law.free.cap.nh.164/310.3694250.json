We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The following facts are drawn from the trial court\u2019s final order. Father and Mother had a brief relationship that resulted in Daughter\u2019s birth in 2006. Mother married Richard Carter in October 2008 and had a child born of their marriage. Mother and Father entered into a parenting agreement in July 2009 whereby Daughter would live with Mother during the week and with Father from Friday to Monday. At that time, Mother lived in Kittery, Maine, and Father lived with his parents, the B\u00f3rdalos, in Unity, New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Father filed a petition for contempt against Mother in November 2009, asserting that she had moved with Daughter to a more remote location in Maine, making it impossible to exercise his parenting time according to the agreement. The court found Mother in contempt, and ordered the parties to find a suitable location between their homes to exchange Daughter. Father subsequently filed another petition for contempt, this time asserting that Mother had prevented him from seeing Daughter at all. In response, the court again made a contempt finding and ordered the parties to exchange Daughter at each other\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">In March 2010, Mother and Father each moved to modify the parenting plan, and a guardian ad litem (GAL) was appointed. By August 2010, Mother had moved back to Kittery and the court had adjusted the plan to afford Father time with Daughter on alternating weekends to reduce the \u201copportunity for conflict\u201d arising out of the previous plan. Sometime after that order, Richard Carter was arrested in a domestic violence incident and the Maine Department of Social Services identified concerns it had about Daughter\u2019s well-being, particularly with respect to exposure to her maternal grandmother. In December 2010, the court ordered Daughter\u2019s contact with her maternal grandmother to be supervised and authorized the GAL to make certain interim decisions in Daughter\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">In March 2011, prior to the final hearing, the B\u00f3rdalos were permitted to intervene and requested parental rights over Daughter, asserting that it would be in her best interests to reside with them \u201cto prevent significant psychological harm.\u201d A final hearing took place in April 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>At the hearing, the GAL opined that Daughter was being harmed in Mother\u2019s care and recommended that she reside with the B\u00f3rdalos. She noted that Daughter is a \u201ctroubled child\u201d who has exhibited violent behaviors toward animals, her younger half-sister, and others in the family. The GAL also opined that Mother is in a poor position to support Daughter in light of Daughter\u2019s behavioral problems. The court noted in its June 2011 final order that Richard Carter had been arrested once for endangering the welfare of Daughter and another time for domestic violence against Mother; the record does not indicate the legal resolution of those arrests. The court also noted that the \u201cauthorities\u201d had expressed concern that Daughter\u2019s emotional and mental health had been harmed due to the influence of the maternal grandmother, violent incidents in the home, and a \u201cvolatile\u201d relationship with Mr. Carter. The GAL also expressed concern that Mother lacks \u201cunderstanding of the emotional boundaries which should exist between a parent and a child.\u201d At the same time, the court noted that Mother \u201cdoes, in fact, have the ability to be a competent parent for [Daughter]; in her care, [Daughter] has been well fed, has been provided for and has developed intellectually.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The court also stated that Father is \u201cnot recognized as a particularly competent parent.\u201d Both the GAL and Daughter\u2019s therapist believed that he lacked parenting skills due to a \u201cdevelopmental disability or information processing deficit that makes it hard for him to understand his responsibilities as a parent.\u201d Although a \u201cdevoted\u201d father, he was not actively engaged in Daughter\u2019s counseling, therapy, or vocational rehabilitation. Father admitted at trial that he would need help from his parents to care for Daughter permanently. The GAL and Daughter\u2019s therapist also believed that Karen Bordalo provided the most \u201csafe, sound, stable and nurturing\u201d environment for Daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The trial court awarded primary parenting and residential responsibility jointly to Father and the B\u00f3rdalos, and awarded weekend parenting time to Mother. Under the new parenting plan, Father and the B\u00f3rdalos were to \u201cshare in the responsibility for making major decisions\u201d and consult with Mother \u201cwhen feasible.\u201d Mother was expressly prohibited from \u201cinterfer[ing] with the authority of the B\u00f3rdalos in making the final decision.\u201d After a motion to reconsider was denied, Mother appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">The trial court has wide discretion in matters involving parental rights and responsibilities under RSA 461-A:6 (Supp. 2011), and we will not overturn its determination except when there has been an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>In the Matter of R.A. &amp; J.M., </em>153 N.H. 82, 93 (2005) (plurality opinion); <em>cf. State v. Lambert, </em>147 N.H. 295, 296 (2001) (explaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>unsustainable exercise of discretion standard). However, we apply a <em>de novo </em>standard of review both to the constitutionality of a statute, <em>Appeal of Blizzard, </em>163 N.H. 326, 331 (2012), and to the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts, <em>State v. Michelson, </em>160 N.H. 270, 272 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Mother argues that the parenting award cannot be sustained because \u201cthe strict test for awarding custody of a minor to grandparents over the express wishes of a fit parent was not met.\u201d The B\u00f3rdalos and Father, on the other hand, contend that the court properly exercised its discretion to award \u201cprimary residential and decision-making responsibility\u201d jointly to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">It is well-established that parents have a fundamental liberty interest in raising and caring for their children. <em>See In the Matter of Nelson &amp; Horsley, </em>149 N.H. 545, 547 (2003); <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57 (2000) (plurality opinion). As Justice O\u2019Connor stated for the plurality in <em>Troxel: </em>\u201c[T]he Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.\u201d <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 66 (O\u2019Connor, J.).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">We have adopted the <em>Troxel </em>plurality\u2019s ruling that fit parents are presumed to act in the best interest of their children. . . . Provided that a parent is fit, there will normally be no reason for the State to inject itself into the private realm of the family to further question the ability of that parent to make the best decisions concerning the rearing of that parent\u2019s children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-8\"><em>In re Guardianship of Reena D., </em>163 N.H. 107, 111-12 (2011) (quotations and citations omitted). Moreover, \u201c[t]he fundamental liberty interest of... parents in the care, custody and management of their children does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Jeffrey G. &amp; Janette P., </em>153 N.H. 200, 204 (2006) (quotations omitted). Even though their parenting skills are less than ideal, biological and adoptive parents are presumed to be fit parents until they are found to be unfit under either RSA chapter 169-C (abuse and neglect proceedings) or RSA chapter 170-C (termination of parental rights). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Against this constitutional backdrop, RSA 461-A:6, V provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-10\">If the court determines that it is in the best interest of the children, it shall in its decree grant reasonable visitation privileges to . . . the grandparents of the children pursuant to RSA 461-A:13. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit or require\" an award of parental rights and responsibilities to a stepparent or grandparent if the court determines that such an award is in the best interest of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>The trial court, relying upon <em>In the Matter of R.A., </em>construed the second sentence of this provision to allow a trial court to award parental rights and responsibilities to a stepparent or grandparent in appropriate circumstances even when the court has not found the parent who is denied such rights and responsibilities to be unfit. <em>In the Matter of R.A., </em>153 N.H. at 94 (interpreting RSA 458:17 (2004) (repealed 2005)). Mother does not challenge this interpretation of RSA 461-A:6 in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\"><em>In the Matter of R.A. </em>involved a child\u2019s grandmother who sought to intervene in a custody dispute between the child\u2019s mother and father, asking for primary \u201cphysical custody\u201d and joint \u201clegal custody\u201d with the parents. <em>Id. </em>at 87. The grandmother \u201ccontended that she played the primary parental role in [the child\u2019s] life, particularly from 2002 to 2004,\u201d and argued that granting her requests would serve the child\u2019s best interests. <em>Id. </em>at 86,87. The trial court, however, rejected the grandmother\u2019s argument on the ground that, even if former RSA 458:17, VI were construed to permit an award of custody to a grandparent where a natural, fit parent also seeks custody, the statute so construed would be unconstitutional under <em>Troxel. Id. </em>at 87. The grandmother appealed, arguing that the statute could be constitutionally applied to grant her custody petition because she had a significant \u201cparent-child\u201d relationship with the child. <em>Id. </em>at 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\"><em>In the Matter of RA. </em>produced three separate opinions as to the statute\u2019s constitutionality. Two justices, writing in dissent, agreed with the trial court that the statute was unconstitutional on its face in light of <em>Troxel. Id. </em>at 111-12 (Dalianis &amp; Duggan, JJ., dissenting). In their view, a statute permitting a custody award to grandparents over the objections of a fit, natural parent ran afoul of the \u201cfundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody and control of their children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112 (quotation omitted). Two justices, concurring in part and dissenting in part, believed RSA 458:17, VI to be constitutional as long as three conditions were established by clear and convincing evidence: (1) the grandparent or stepparent has established an <em>in loco parentis </em>relationship with the child; (2) the denial of custody would cause \u201csignificant emotional harm\u201d to the child; and (3) the custody award is in the child\u2019s best interests. <em>Id. </em>at 110 (Nadeau &amp; Galway, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Their view, echoing Justice Stevens\u2019s dissent in <em>Troxel, </em>was that courts must \u201cstop treating children as the chattel of their parents. In child custody disputes, the best interests of the child must be paramount.\u201d Id.; see <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 89 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (urging a rejection of \u201cany suggestion that when it comes to parental rights, children are so much chattel\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Chief Justice Broderick wrote the controlling opinion upholding the statute, provided that a stringent four-part test (hereinafter, \u201cBroderick test\u201d) could be satisfied in the case. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">[A]n award of custody to a .. . grandparent over the objection of a fit natural or adoptive parent is not unreasonable or unduly restrictive of parental rights only if the petitioning party can show by clear and convincing evidence that: (1) the custody award would specifically be in the child\u2019s best interest because of a significant psychological parent-child relationship; (2) the custody award only be allowed where the family is already in the process of dissolution; and (3) there is some additional overriding factor justifying intrusion into the parent\u2019s rights, such as a significant failure by the opposing parent to accept parental responsibilities. [In addition,] . . . the custody award must be necessary for the State to enforce its compelling interest in protecting the child from the emotional hami that would result if the child were forced to leave the significant psychological parent-child relationship between the child and the . . . grandparent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-7\"><em>In the Matter of RA., </em>153 N.H. at 101. Having upheld the statute against a facial attack, the court remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Thus, although the court in <em>In the Matter of R.A. </em>was divided both as to whether the statute was constitutional on its face and, as to the majority\u2019s judgment that it was, what standard should be employed to make it so, all five justices agreed that it could not be applied simply using a best-interests standard. Applying solely a best-interests standard to adjudicate disputes concerning parental rights and responsibilities between a grandparent and a fit natural or adoptive parent does not comport either with <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 66, or our precedents recognizing parents\u2019 fundamental liberty interest in raising and caring for their children, <em>see, e.g., In the Matter of Jeffrey G., </em>153 N.H. at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">The B\u00f3rdalos contend, at the outset, that \u201cthis was a parenting dispute between two natural, fit parents,\u201d and, accordingly, argue that the appropriate standard to apply is simply that of the best interests of the child. The trial court, however, applied the Broderick test for awarding primary parenting responsibilities to grandparents, indicating that it considered the dispute to be between Mother and the B\u00f3rdalos, not simply between Mother and Father. While the court did not deem Father to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>unfit, it did note that he was not \u201ca particularly competent parent,\u201d that he had \u201csome kind of developmental disability or information processing deficit that makes it hard for him to understand his responsibilities as a parent,\u201d and finally that \u201che is not able to engage in independent parenting responsibility for [Daughter] and he has specifically recognized this in his testimony.\u201d The court also opined that \u201c[o]ne of the best things [Father] has going for him is that he resides with his parents.\u201d Furthermore, the court awarded parenting and residential responsibility not just to Father, but also to the B\u00f3rdalos. For these reasons, we think it readily apparent that the court did not rest its decision upon a simple balancing of the rights between two parents. Although we agree with the B\u00f3rdalos that a trial court normally has wide discretion in adjudicating parenting disputes, it has no discretion to award parental responsibilities to a child\u2019s grandparents as against a fit natural or adoptive parent without satisfying the appropriate constitutional standard for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The B\u00f3rdalos next contend, in the alternative, that this standard has been met here: the trial court, they contend, \u201cproperly identified and applied the provisions of RSA 461-A:6, as interpreted by <em>[In the Matter of R.A.] </em>... to determine whether [Father] jointly with John and Karen Bordalo should be granted parental rights and residential responsibility.\u201d Mother, on the other hand, argues that <em>none </em>of the elements of the Broderick test were established by clear and convincing evidence. None of the parties argues that the Broderick test should not govern parenting disputes between a fit natural or adoptive parent and a grandparent or stepparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">We assume, for the purposes of this analysis, that the second and third requirements of the Broderick test were satisfied. We note, however, that the facts of this case underscore the uncertain application of these factors. While the trial court\u2019s explanation that the family was in \u201cdissolution\u201d because \u201cit was never a coherent family\u201d is arguably accurate as to Daughter\u2019s biological parents, it is not self-evident how and whether this factor should be considered in light of the fact that Mother had a family with her husband, Richard Carter, with whom she bore a second child and was raising that child and Daughter together. The court also explained that there was \u201csome additional overriding factor\u201d because of Mother\u2019s \u201cfailure to provide for [Daughter\u2019s] emotional safety and well being\u201d \u2014 a conclusion arguably at odds with the observation elsewhere in the final order that \u201cin [Mother\u2019s] care, [Daughter] has been well fed, has been provided for and has developed intellectually.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\"> Nevertheless, we agree with Mother that the first and fourth requirements of the Broderick test were not satisfied here. The first is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>\u201cthe custody award would specifically be in the child\u2019s best interest because of a significant psychological parent-child relationship.\u201d <em>In the Matter of R.A., </em>153 N.H. at 101. Elsewhere in his opinion Chief Justice Broderick stated that there must be a \u201csubstantial\u201d relationship between the child and the grandparent, \u201csuch that denial of custody to that person would be emotionally harmful to the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100 (quotation omitted). Whether \u201csubstantial\u201d or \u201csignificant,\u201d the relationship under the Broderick test requires, at the very least, a parent-like relationship in which the grandparent has assumed primary obligations of parenthood, such as responsibility for the child\u2019s education and development, on a non-temporary basis. To support its finding that such a relationship had been established, the trial court noted that \u201cKaren Bordalo ... has been a constant presence in [Daughter\u2019s] life from the day of her birth and ... has provided, it seems, the only consistent, coherent, and comforting parenting role for this child.\u201d While this may be true, the record does not provide clear and convincing evidence that the B\u00f3rdalos\u2019 status vis-a-vis Daughter was that of parents rather than that of ordinary \u2014 though by all appearances ideal \u2014 grandparents. <em>Cf. In re Diana P., </em>120 N.H. 791, 796 (1980) (noting that a few weeks would not be long enough to establish a \u201cpsychological family\u201d), <em>overruled on other grounds by In re Craig T., </em>147 N.H. 739 (2002); <em>In the Matter of R.A., </em>153 N.H. at 111 (Nadeau and Galway, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (indicating concern that prohibiting custody awards to grandparents as against a fit parent \u201cwould require that a child <em>raised for years </em>by a grandparent\u201d would need to be turned over to a fit parent without considering child\u2019s best interests (emphasis added)). Unlike in <em>In the Matter of R.A., </em>in which the trial court had found the grandmother \u201cpredominantly responsible\u201d for raising the child for two years prior to trial, <em>In the Matter of R.A., </em>153 N.H. at 106, here the B\u00f3rdalos never had primary parenting responsibilities for Daughter. The record reflects that Mother has always assumed such responsibilities except for a short guardianship over the child by Daughter\u2019s <em>maternal </em>grandmother. That Daughter \u201cresided with\u201d the B\u00f3rdalos whenever she visited her father under the terms of the previous parenting agreement does not mean that the B\u00f3rdalos thereby established a \u201cparent-child relationship\u201d with her. <em>See In the Matter of R.A., </em>153 N.H. at 101. Were this enough to satisfy Cheif Justice Broderick\u2019s first factor, almost any child\u2019s grandparents would be entitled to sue for parental rights and responsibilities as long as they established a common residence with the child, however temporary. Indeed, the trial court stated in its final order that \u201cthe kind of psychological parent-child relationship that was in existence in <em>... In the Matter of R.A. </em>. . . has not exactly occurred here [because Daughter] has never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>lived with her grandparents on a permanent basis.\u201d Thus, the trial court\u2019s own findings demonstrate that the first criterion of the Broderick test has not been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">It follows, then, that the trial court\u2019s order would not satisfy the fourth requirement \u2014 that the award be necessary for the State to enforce its compelling interest in protecting the child from the emotional harm that would result if the child were forced to leave the significant parent-child relationship between the child and the grandparents. Having held that the record fails to demonstrate the existence of a significant parent-child relationship between Daughter and the B\u00f3rdalos, we necessarily conclude that the fourth requirement was not met. Indeed, the trial court essentially stated as much when it concluded that \u201c[t]his is not ... a circumstance where a child is \u2018forced to leave a significant psychological [parent-]child relationship between the child and ... grandparent,\u2019 because the child has not been residing with the grandparents.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Accordingly, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b343-8\">DALIANIS, C.J., and CONBOY, J., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
