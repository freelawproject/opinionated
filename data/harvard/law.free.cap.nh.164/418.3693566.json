The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the defendant used his own name and already-reported e-mail address to create the account; thus, the trial court concluded, the defendant was not required under the statute to report the account\u2019s existence. The State contests the basis of the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Resolving this dispute requires that we engage in statutory interpretation. The interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we decide <em>de novo. State v. Etienne, </em>163 N.H. 57, 71 (2011). In matters of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of a statute considered as a whole. <em>Id. </em>We construe the Criminal Code \u201caccording to the fair import of [its] terms and to promote justice.\u201d RSA 625:3 (2007). In so doing, we must first look to the plain language of the statute to determine legislative intent. <em>Etienne, </em>163 N.H. at 72. Absent an ambiguity we will not look beyond the language of the statute to discern legislative intent. <em>Id. </em>Our goal is to apply statutes in light of the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting them, and in light of the policy sought to be advanced by the entire statutory scheme. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we interpret a statute in the context of the overall statutory scheme and not in isolation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The trial court concluded that the defendant\u2019s alleged failure to report the creation and use of a Myspace account did not violate RSA 651-B:4-a because he used his own name and previously-reported e-mail address to become a member. In the trial court\u2019s view, the defendant would be obligated to report the use of a name or e-mail address by which he intended to be identified on Myspace only if it differed from his already-reported name or email address. The State contends that the trial court erred in so concluding because the account constituted either \u201cuser profile information\u201d or \u201cchat or other Internet communication name or identity information.\u201d RSA 651-B:4-a. The defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s decision was correct and, in the alternative, that the statute is unconstitutionally vague if construed to require him to report his Myspace account.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number> We agree with the State that a Myspace account constitutes an \u201conline identifier\u201d under RSA 651-B:4-a. As noted, we first turn to the statute\u2019s plain language. The relevant definition of \u201cuser\u201d is \u201c[o]ne who uses a computer, computer program, or online service.\u201d American HERITAGE Dictionary of the English Language 1908 (5th ed. 2011); <em>see </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2524 (unabridged ed. 2002) (\u201cone that uses\u201d). A \u201cprofile\u201d is \u201ca biographical account presenting the subject\u2019s most noteworthy characteristics and achievements.\u201d AMERICAN Heritage, <em>supra </em>at 1407; <em>see </em>Webster\u2019s, <em>supra </em>at 1811 (\u201ca concise geographical, historical, or political sketch\u201d). Consistent with these definitions, the trial court explained that \u201c \u2018[p]rofile creation is accomplished by filling out a series of virtual forms eliciting a broad range of personal data,\u2019 \u201d whereby \u201c \u2018users are commonly asked to provide their name, home address, e-mail address, age, sex, location, and birth date.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting Petrashek, Comment, <em>The Fourth Amendment and the Brave New World of Online Social Networking, </em>93 Marq. L. Rev. 1495,1499 (2010).)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The trial court defined Myspace as \u201c\u2018a \u201csocial networking\u201d website where members can create \u201cprofiles\u201d and interact with other members.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Griffin v. State, </em>19 A.3d 415, 417 n.2 (Md. 2011).) The court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">Anyone with Internet access can go onto the Myspace website and view content which is open to the general public such as . . . members\u2019 profiles which are not set as \u201cprivate.\u201d However, to create a profile, upload and display photographs, communicate with persons on the site, write \u201cblogs,\u201d and/or utilize other services or applications on the Myspace website, one must be a \u201cmember.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">(Quoting <em>Griffin, </em>19 A.3d at 417 n.2.) With this description in mind, it is apparent that Myspace membership requires the creation of a personal \u201cprofile\u201d or \u201cbiographical account,\u201d American Heritage, <em>supra </em>at 1407, triggering an obligation to report its creation to law enforcement under RSA 651-B:4-a. The defendant\u2019s Myspace profile itself contains several such pieces of biographical information, including his name, age, sex, \u201csingle\u201d relationship status, and zodiac sign. Indeed, the plain language of the phrase \u201cuser profile information,\u201d RSA 651-B:4-a, is at odds with the trial court\u2019s statement that the defendant was \u201cnot obligated to report... that he created a MySpace <em>profile, </em>or the <em>information </em>he posted to the profile.\u201d (Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Nor does the fact that the defendant used his already-reported e-mail address to establish the account militate against finding an obligation to report the account\u2019s creation to law enforcement. On the contrary, it highlights that the legislature differentiated between \u201celectronic mail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>address\u201d and \u201cuser profile information,\u201d RSA 651-B:4-a, as independent examples of online identifiers. <em>See Pennelli v. Town of Pelham, </em>148 N.H. 365, 367-68 (2002) (\u201cBasic statutory construction rules require that all of the words of a statute must be given effect and that the legislature is presumed not to have used superfluous or redundant words.\u201d (quotation omitted)). As is clear from the trial court\u2019s order, the user\u2019s Myspace account and profile are independent of the user\u2019s other methods of online communication or activity, such as an e-mail address.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Construing \u201cuser profile\u201d to include the defendant\u2019s Myspace account also comports with the general purposes of sex offender registration and reporting requirements, including the twin goals of \u201cinvestigating crimes committed online by registered sex offenders\u201d and discouraging registered sex offenders \u201cfrom engaging in such criminal activities.\u201d The National Guidelines for Sex Offender Registration and Notification, 73 Fed. Reg. 38030, 38055 (July 2, 2008) (final guidelines interpreting and implementing Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA)); <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16901 (2006) (SORNA\u2019s purpose is to \u201cprotect the public from sex offenders and offenders against children . .. [by] establishing] a comprehensive national system for the registration of those offenders.\u201d); <em>cf </em>RSA 651-B:12 (2007) (sex offender registration and reporting requirements to be interpreted as consistent with federal law). Requiring a registered offender to report the creation of a Myspace profile or other \u201conline profile\u201d promotes the investigatory purpose of the statute by providing law enforcement with the means to monitor and track the offender\u2019s online activities. Such a requirement also serves to discourage the use of social networking for predatory purposes because the offender knows he or she is under the watchful eye of law enforcement. To the extent that our interpretation of the phrase \u201cuser profile information\u201d may require sex offenders to report a wide range of online activities, it does so as a reflection of legislative intent expressed in the statute\u2019s plain terms. Here, of course, we need not define the outer limits of the reporting requirement of RSA 651-B:4-a.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The defendant observes that a Nebraska statute contains a reporting requirement with language that, he claims, is considerably broader than that of RSA 651-B:4-a, as it obligates sex offenders to report \u201call blogs and Internet sites maintained by the person or to which the person has uploaded any content or posted any messages or information.\u201d Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 29-4006(l)(s) (Supp. 2010). The New Hampshire legislature, according to the defendant, could have enacted similar language had it intended to extend the reporting requirement to cover the creation of a Myspace account. We have concluded, however, that the plain language of RSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>651-B:4-a applies to the defendant\u2019s creation of a Myspace account. Thus, as noted, we need not decide the outer reaches of the statute\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The defendant also contends that the phrase \u201cuser profile information\u201d \u201cfails to ground the application of RSA 651-B:4-a to [the defendant\u2019s] case in a non-vague manner.\u201d A statute can be impermissibly vague for either of two independent reasons: (1) it fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits; or (2) it authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. <em>State v. MacElman, </em>154 N.H. 304, 307 (2006). \u201cA statute is not unconstitutionally vague as long as its prohibitions are set out in terms that the ordinary person exercising ordinary common sense can sufficiently understand and comply with.\u201d <em>State v. Lamarche, </em>157 N.H. 337, 340 (2008) (quotation omitted). \u201cIn addition, mathematical exactness is not required in a penal statute, nor is a law invalid merely because it could have been drafted with greater precision.\u201d <em>MacElman, </em>154 N.H. at 307 (quotation and brackets omitted). A party challenging a statute as void for vagueness bears a heavy burden of proof in view of the strong presumption favoring a statute\u2019s constitutionality. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">We conclude that the phrase \u201cuser profile information\u201d in RSA 651-B:4-a provides a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand the conduct it prohibits \u2014 namely, the failure by a sex offender to report the creation of, or changes to, an online profile. It is well-established that the necessary specificity required to uphold a statute \u201cneed not be contained in the statute itself, but rather, the statute in question may be read in the context of related statutes, prior decisions, or generally accepted usage.\u201d <em>State v. Winslow, </em>134 N.H. 398, 400 (1991). It is also well-established that words and phrases in a statute are to be construed in light of the overall statute and statutory scheme. <em>Etienne, </em>163 N.H. at 72. The statute\u2019s plain terms take aim at a sex offender\u2019s \u201conline identifiers],\u201d of which \u201cuser profile information\u201d is listed as an example. RSA 651-B:4-a. It has become generally accepted in modem internet parlance that a \u201cuser profile\u201d refers to a set of personal facts that a person provides to a website in order to create an account. <em>See, e.g., Crispin v. Christian Audigier, Inc., </em>717 F. Supp. 2d 965, 976 (C.D. Cal. 2010) (\u201cFacebook and MySpace, Inc., are companies which provide social networking websites that allow users to send and receive messages, through posting on user-created \u2018profile pages\u2019 or through private messaging services.\u201d (quotation omitted)); Guo, Note, <em>Stranger Danger and the Online Social Network, </em>23 Berkeley Tech. L. J. 617, 619 (2008) (\u201cA profile is a webpage that allows a user to aggregate and present her personal information, photos, web journals, favorite hyperlinks, and the like into one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>location.\u201d); Pannozzo, Note, <em>Uploading Guilt: Adding a Virtual Records Exception to the Federal Rules of Evidence, </em>44 Conn. L. Rev. 1693, 1698 (2012) (On Myspace, \u201cusers create and decorate their own profiles, upload music and video clips, post photographs, author blogs, play games, and chat with friends in real time\u201d). This accepted usage is consistent with the dictionary definition of a profile, recited above, as \u201ca biographical account presenting the subject\u2019s most noteworthy characteristics and achievements.\u201d AMERICAN Heritage, <em>supra </em>at 1407. The defendant\u2019s Myspace account is clearly encompassed within this definition; indeed, it is difficult to imagine what the statute covers by use of the phrase \u201cuser profile\u201d if not an account on a social networking website with which users share personal information with others through self-created \u201cprofiles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">We further reject the defendant\u2019s argument that the sex offender registration form that the defendant was required to sign renders the statute\u2019s application to him impermissibly vague. The first page of the form asks the defendant to provide \u201cONLINE IDENTIFIERS (INCLUDING E-MAIL ADDRESSES, INSTANT MESSAGE SCREEN NAMES, ETC.).\u201d While the defendant contends that the use of \u201cETC.\u201d both poses notice concerns and gives the police \u201cvirtually unfettered discretion\u201d in the statute\u2019s enforcement, the form\u2019s third page explicitly requires the defendant to acknowledge that he is subject to the requirements of RSA 651-B, within which the requirement to report \u201conline identifiers]\u201d is contained. The form also states that noncompliance with RSA 651-B is a felony. Thus, the defendant may fairly be charged with knowledge that he must report \u201cuser profile information\u201d and the other statutory examples of online identifiers. <em>Cf. State v. Stratton, </em>132 N.H. 451, 457 (1989) (\u201cIgnorance of the law is no excuse.\u201d). Nor does the statute or the form promote arbitrary enforcement or unfettered police discretion, as the statute provides five specific examples of the online information and activities subject to the reporting requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">We conclude that a Myspace account includes \u201cuser profile information,\u201d which, therefore, is an \u201conline identifier\u201d subject to the reporting requirement of RSA 651-B:4-a. Thus, we need not address the defendant\u2019s argument that the phrase \u201cchat or other Internet communication name or identity information\u201d is also unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b448-8\">Dalianis, C.J., and CONBOY, Lynn and BASSETT, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
