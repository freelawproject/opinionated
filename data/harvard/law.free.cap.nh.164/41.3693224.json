Poulin (Father), in contempt of a court order. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">The record supports the following. The parties divorced in October 1996 and entered into a permanent stipulation, which was incorporated, by reference, into the divorce decree. The stipulation included the following provision, in which the parties agreed to contribute to their two children\u2019s college expenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-12\">The parties agree to contribute to their children\u2019s college education to the extent each party is financially able. The actual contributions shall be determined when each child is near college age. A child, entering college, in the first instance, however, shall apply for financial aid or use her own savings for said expense. Both parties shall cooperate in completing any financial aid application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-14\">Their younger daughter was accepted at Southern New Hampshire University. She received a scholarship, as well as a loan covering a portion of the cost for tuition and room and board for the 2011-2012 academic year. The Mother requested that the Father contribute 75% of the remaining costs. The Father responded by offering to pay some amount, but the parties could not agree on the amount and the Father has not yet contributed to the younger daughter\u2019s college expenses at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-15\">The Mother then filed a \u201cPetition to Bring Forward and for Contempt,\u201d requesting the court to find the Father in contempt of the college expense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>provision of the divorce decree, and apparently asking the court to enforce the provision from the parties\u2019 stipulation. The Father objected and moved to dismiss, arguing that the petition should be dismissed because \u201cthere is no Court order or decree that orders [the Father] to contribute a set percentage or specific dollar amount to\u201d their younger daughter\u2019s college expenses. After a hearing on July 18, 2011, the trial court dismissed the Mother\u2019s petition because \u201c[t]he provision at issue in the parties\u2019 divorce decree lacks specificity.\u201d In support of its ruling, the trial court cited <em>In the Matter of Scott &amp; Pierce, </em>160 N.H. 354 (2010). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">\u201cThe court\u2019s powers in custody, maintenance, and education of children in divorce and separation cases are conferred entirely by statute.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Johnson &amp; Johnson, </em>158 N.H. 555, 558 (2009) (quotation omitted). We afford broad discretion to the trial court in divorce matters, and will not disturb the trial court\u2019s rulings regarding child support absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion or an error of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">On appeal, the Mother argues that the trial court erred in ruling \u201cthat it did not have the authority to enforce the [college expense] provision in the parties\u2019 [divorce decree]\u201d because the provision \u201cclearly provide[s] that each parent [will] contribute to the children\u2019s college expenses to the extent each party is financially able after financial aid, scholarships and any children\u2019s savings are considered.\u201d The Father asserts that our decision in <em>Scott, </em>160 N.H. at 365-66, set forth a bright fine rule of law that \u201cabsent a set percentage or specific dollar amount, trial courts cannot issue new orders regarding college expenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">At the time the parties divorced, the trial court had \u201c\u2018broad discretionary\u2019 powers to order divorced parents to contribute to their children\u2019s college expenses under RSA 458:17, I (Supp. 2003) and RSA 458:20 (1992).\u201d <em>In the Matter of Donovan &amp; Donovan, </em>152 N.H. 55, 61 (2005). However, in 2004, the legislature amended RSA 458:17 to provide that \u201c[n]o child support order shall require a parent to contribute to an adult child\u2019s college expenses or other educational expenses beyond the completion of high school.\u201d RSA 458:17, Xl-a (2004) (recodified as RSA 461-A:14, V (Supp. 2011)); <em>see also Donovan, </em>152 N.H. at 61. Shortly after the 2004 amendment was enacted, we decided that it does not apply retroactively and, therefore, \u201cdoes not mandate the trial court to vacate [a] provision in [a pre-existing] divorce decree that requires [parents] to contribute to their children\u2019s college education.\u201d <em>Donovan, </em>152 N.H. at 62-64. Since then, we have consistently reaffirmed that the amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>does not apply retroactively. <em>See, e.g., Scott, </em>160 N.H. at 365; <em>In the Matter of Cole &amp; Ford, </em>156 N.H. 609, 612 (2007); <em>In the Matter of Forcier &amp; Mueller, </em>152 N.H. 463, 466 (2005). We have also held that the amendment does not prohibit a court from modifying a pre-amendment order regarding college expenses. <em>Forcier, </em>152 N.H. at 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Recently, we again addressed the effect of the 2004 amendment in <em>Scott, </em>160 N.H. at 365-66. The parties in <em>Scott </em>divorced in Massachusetts in 1989. <em>Id. at </em>356. The divorce decree expressly incorporated their separation agreement, in which \u201cthe parties agreed that their children should receive the best college education available to them and that they would meet in the future to discuss the financial responsibility each of them shall bear for their children\u2019s college expenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). In 2003, a New Hampshire court ordered the father to contribute $3,000 per year to the college expenses of the parties\u2019 son. <em>Id. </em>at 357. The 2003 order \u201cdid not address whether [the father] had to contribute to [their daughter\u2019s] eventual college expenses, but required [the mother] to consult with him about [their daughter\u2019s] plans.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\"><em>In 2008, </em>the father filed a petition to terminate his child support obligations while the mother requested that the father be ordered to pay for, among other things, certain college expenses for both the son and the daughter. Id. On appeal, we determined that the father was obligated to contribute to the son\u2019s college expenses because the 2003 order required him to do so. Id. at 365-66. As to the daughter\u2019s college expenses, however, we held that the father could not be required to contribute to such expenses because there was no court order requiring him to do so. Id. at 366. The original divorce decree only required that the parties \u201cmeet in the future to discuss the financial responsibility\u201d that each would bear. Id. at 356 (quotation omitted). While the 2003 court order required the father to contribute $3,000 towards the son\u2019s college expenses, it did not require any contribution for the daughter\u2019s college expenses; instead, it merely required the mother to consult with the father about the daughter\u2019s college plans. Id. at 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Here, the trial court cited Scott for the proposition that \u201c[t]he provision at issue in the parties\u2019 divorce decree [is unenforceable because it] lacks specificity.\u201d Similarly, the Father argues that Scott requires us to affirm on appeal because the parties\u2019 divorce decree merely requires them to \u201ccontribute to their children\u2019s college education to the extent each party is financially able,\u201d but does not set forth a specific dollar amount or percentage to be contributed by each party. The father specifically relies upon the following language from our conclusion in Scott: \u201cBecause there is no order requiring [the father] to pay a set percentage of or a specific dollar amount toward the daughter\u2019s college expenses predating the . . . 2004 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>change in the law,... the trial court had no jurisdiction to issue a new order for payment of these expenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Under the Father\u2019s understanding, the dispositive factor in <em>Scott </em>was that there was no court order setting a \u201cset percentage of or a specific dollar amount\u201d toward college expenses. Contrary to the Father\u2019s arguments, however, <em>Scott </em>did not set forth a bright line rale requiring such an outcome. Rather, <em>Scott </em>merely clarified that the pre-2004 order must explicitly order the parties to contribute <em>some </em>amount of their children\u2019s college expenses, as distinguished from merely ordering the parties to discuss the <em>option </em>of contributing to such expenses in the future. While the order in <em>Scott </em>anticipated that in the future the parents would discuss their financial responsibility for college expenses, it left the decision of whether to so contribute to the parties in the future. Here, in contrast, the Mother and the Father were <em>ordered </em>to contribute, leaving only the specific amount to be determined at a later date. This is a material difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The Father emphasizes that in <em>Scott </em>we stated \u201cthe trial court [had] no jurisdiction to issue a <em>new </em>order for payment of these expenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366 (emphasis added). He argues that in this case, \u201c[t]here are no pre-2004 orders to enforce,\u201d and the court cannot issue a new order. However, when the parties\u2019 stipulation was incorporated into the divorce decree, it became an order. <em>See Donovan, </em>152 N.H. at 61; <em>Cole, </em>156 N.H. at 612. While in <em>Scott, </em>the trial court <em>never ordered </em>the parties to contribute to the daughter\u2019s college expenses, <em>see Scott, </em>160 N.H. at 356-57, the divorce decree in this case does order the parties to contribute to their children\u2019s college expenses \u2014 it specifically states that they will \u201ccontribute to their children\u2019s college education to the extent each party is financially able.\u201d Accordingly, an order in this case setting an amount would not constitute a \u201cnew\u201d order for the payment of expenses, but would instead amount to either an order enforcing the divorce decree or a modification of the previous order, either of which is permissible. <em>See Cole, </em>156 N.H. at 610-12 (upholding the trial court\u2019s order enforcing a pre-2004 order requiring parents to contribute to college expenses \u201cto the best of their abilities\u201d even though the pre-2004 order did not require a specific amount); <em>Forcier, </em>152 N.H. at 466 (elaborating that the rule set forth in <em>Donovan </em>allows courts to modify pre-amendment orders after 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Because the parties\u2019 divorce decree ordered them to contribute to their children\u2019s college expenses in a \u201cspecific proportion,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>\u201cto the extent each party is financially able\u201d after deducting financial aid and the child\u2019s own savings, the trial court has authority to enforce it. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>the trial court\u2019s ruling that it could not enforce the college expense provision in light of <em>Scott </em>constituted an error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b70-6\">DALIANIS, C.J., and LYNN, J., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
