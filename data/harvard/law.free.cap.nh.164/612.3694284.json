(GAD), is an additional insured under a policy issued by Philadelphia. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-15\">The trial court found the following facts. DW Ray Commons, LLC (DW Ray) owned and leased a building to Webster Place Center, Inc. (Webster Place). Prior to renting the building, DW Ray required Webster Place to obtain an insurance policy listing DW Ray as an additional insured. In March 2008, Webster Place obtained from Philadelphia a commercial general liability policy that contained a provision listing as an additional insured \u201c[a]ny person or organization with respect to their liability arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of that part of the premises leased or rented to [Webster Place] . ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-16\">In October 2008, Dr. James Kenneth Wyly fell through the building\u2019s porch railing and suffered serious injuries. Dr. Wyly sued DW Ray and Webster Place for damages. After the Superior Court issued a declaration that DW Ray was an additional insured under Webster Place\u2019s policy with Philadelphia, Webster Place and DW Ray settled with Dr. Wyly and sued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>GAD for contribution on the theory that GAD negligently constructed, installed, and maintained the porch railing. A jury found that GAD was 45% at fault for Dr. Wyly\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">GAD then filed the present declaratory judgment action, asking the trial court to find that it is an additional insured under Webster Place\u2019s policy with Philadelphia, and, as such, entitled to reimbursement for defense costs incurred in the action for contribution, the judgment rendered against it, and costs and attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to RSA 491:22-b (2010) for bringing the action against Philadelphia to determine coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The trial court determined that GAD is an additional insured under a provision of the policy titled \u201cManagers, Landlords or Lessors of Premises\u201d because the provision applies to \u201cany person or organization\u201d whose liability \u201caris[es] out of ownership, maintenance or use\u201d of the leased premises. The court found that Philadelphia owed GAD a duty of defending the contribution case because Dr. Wyly\u2019s pleadings sufficiently alleged that GAD engaged in maintenance. As to Philadelphia\u2019s duty to indemnify GAD, the court concluded that \u201cthe trial evidence and the theory upon which the judgment was actually entered establish that GAD\u2019s liability arose from its \u2018maintenance\u2019 of the lease[d] premises.\u201d Having determined that GAD is an additional insured and that Philadelphia owed it a duty both to defend and to indemnify, the court awarded GAD reimbursement for defense costs and the judgment rendered in the contribution action as well as attorney\u2019s fees and costs. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\"> In an action for declaratory judgment under RSA 491:22-a (2010), the insurer bears the burden of establishing lack of coverage. <em>M. Mooney Corp. v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>186 N.H. 463, 466 (1992). \u201cThe fundamental goal of interpreting an insurance policy ... is to carry out the intent of the contracting parties.\u201d <em>Bates v. Phenix Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>156 N.H. 719, 722 (2008) (quotation omitted). Our analysis begins with an examination of the insurance policy language. <em>Pro Con Constr. v. Acadia Ins. Co., </em>147 N.H. 470, 472 (2002). We look to the plain and ordinary meaning of the policy\u2019s words in context, <em>Concord Gen. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mitchell, </em>138 N.H. 229, 231 (1994), \u201cand we construe the terms of the policy as would a reasonable person in the position of the insured based on more than a casual reading of the policy as a whole.\u201d <em>Deyette v. Liberty Mut. Ins. </em>Co., 142 N.H. 560, 561 (1997) (quotation omitted). This is an objective standard. <em>Concord Hosp. v. N.H. Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Assoc., </em>137 N.H. 680, 683 (1993). \u201cIf more than one reasonable interpretation is possible, and an interpretation provides coverage, the policy contains an ambiguity and will be construed against the insurer.\u201d <em>Brickley v. Progressive N. Ins. Co., </em>160 N.H. 625, 627 (2010) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>The interpretation of an insurance policy, like any contract, is an issue of law for the court to decide. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Armstrong, </em>144 N.H. 170, 172 (1999). We review questions of law <em>de novo. In the Matter of Taber McCarthy &amp; McCarthy, </em>160 N.H. 112, 115 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">On appeal, Philadelphia argues that: (1) GAD was not an additional insured because it was not a manager, landlord, or lessor of the premises; (2) GAD\u2019s liability did not arise out of \u201cthe ownership, maintenance or use\u201d of the premises leased to Webster Place; and (3) GAD was a stranger to the policy and ambiguities, therefore, need not be construed in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The policy language at issue here, Provision 2f, is the portion of the additional insured endorsement that provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">2. Each of the following is also an insured:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">f. Managers, Landlords, or Lessors of Premises \u2014 Any person or organization with respect to their liability arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of that part of the premises leased or rented to you subject to the following additional exclusions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-9\">This insurance does not apply to</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-10\">(1) Any \u201coccurrence\u201d which takes place after you cease to be a tenant in that premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-11\">(2) Structural alterations, new construction or demolition operations performed by or on behalf of that person or organization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">The trial court found that Provision 2f covers more than just managers, landlords and lessors because, notwithstanding its heading, the provision broadly encompasses <em>any </em>person or organization with respect to its liability arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the premises. The court contrasted Provision 2f with Provision 2b, which defines as additional insureds \u201cmanagers and supervisors . . . , <em>but only with respect to their duties as your managers and </em>supervisors.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-13\">Importantly, the terms \u201cmanagers and supervisors\u201d are both included in the heading and in the language [of Provision 2b], indicating a clear intent to limit coverage only to managers and supervisors. Because Philadelphia did not similarly draft the \u201cmanagers, landlords, and lessors\u201d provision, the broader language of the provision controls.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>In ruling that Provision 2f applies more broadly than its caption suggests, the court relied on <em>Concord Hospital, </em>137 N.H. at 683, which states that \u201cwe disregard the labels attached to . . . policies and examine the various provisions themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">As an initial matter, we disagree with Philadelphia that the court misapplied <em>Concord Hospital: </em>consistent with that case, the court read the policy as a whole. In <em>Concord Hospital, </em>we addressed whether several medical malpractice insurance policies covered certain occurrences that the insured hospital reported to the insurer two days before the policies lapsed, but for which the hospital did not file claims until after the policies lapsed. <em>Concord Hosp., </em>137 N.H. at 682. The policies were labeled \u201cclaims made,\u201d which we described as \u201caffordfing] coverage for tort claims- that [we]re ... reported to the insurance company during the policy period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 683. We looked past the \u201cclaims made\u201d label to the policies\u2019 various provisions to determine whether they were, in fact, \u201cclaims made,\u201d in that claims had to have been reported before the policies lapsed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-5\">[The policies] are not \u201cclaims made\u201d simply because they say they are. \u201cClaims made\u201d is a category of policies that contain certain provisions; without those provisions, no amount of label-ling can make these policies \u201cclaims made\u201d or induce us to treat them as such. The layperson of average intelligence does not know what \u201cclaims made\u201d refers to and cannot be expected to read crucial provisions into the term. The insurance company must spell out the provisions of a \u201cclaims made\u201d policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">Accordingly, we disregard the labels attached to the... policies and examine the various provisions themselves.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-7\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">Even though three provisions in the policies stated that covered claims had to have been first made while the policies were still in force, a fourth provision stated that \u201c[a] claim shall be considered to be <em>first made </em>when the company first receives written notice of the claim <em>or occurrence'.' Id. </em>at 684 (quotation omitted). Reading the policies as a whole, we concluded that, although titled \u201cclaims made,\u201d the policies in fact offered coverage for claims made after the policy had expired, as long as the underlying occurrences were reported while the policy was still in effect. <em>Id. </em>at 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">Similarly, we read insurance policies as a whole in <em>Hanover Insurance Co. v. Grondin, </em>119 N.H. 394, 397 (1979), and <em>Atwood v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>116 N.H. 636 (1976), two cases on which Philadelphia relies in arguing that we should read the caption of Provision 2f as controlling. In <em>Atwood, </em>we considered whether the policy provided coverage by looking at the size and inconspicuous location of the provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>extending coverage, confusingly redundant headings in the policy, obscure phrasing of the exclusion, and the fact that one part of the policy contained four indications of coverage, whereas the relevant exclusion was buried among thirteen others. <em>Atwood, </em>116 N.H. at 637-39. We also noted that the language obligating the insurer to indemnify the insured appeared in a sentence numbering one hundred twenty-nine words. <em>Id. </em>at 638. Based on all these factors, we concluded that the policy did not afford the insured fair notice of the exclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 639. In <em>Hanover Insurance Co., </em>119 N.H. at 397, we also considered the policy as a whole, emphasizing its clear and unambiguous language and simple and informative captions. We concluded that a reasonable person reading the policy as a whole would not expect coverage for the type of accident at issue. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><em>Concord Hospital, Atwood, </em>and <em>Hanover Insurance Co. </em>stand for the proposition that, when construing an insurance policy, we must read it as a whole and from the vantage point of an ordinary person. <em>Hanover Ins. Co., </em>119 N.H. at 397; <em>Concord Hosp., </em>137 N.H. at 682-83; <em>Atwood, </em>116 N.H. at 637; <em>see also Maville v. Peerless Ins. Co., </em>141 N.H. 317, 319 (1996); <em>Raudonis v. Ins. Co. of North America, </em>137 N.H. 57, 59 (1993). We disagree with Philadelphia \u201cthat the scope of the holding in <em>Concord Hospital </em>extends to only allowing analyzing courts to disregard insurance policy captions, terms or words if they are in direct conflict with other portions of the policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Mindful of these principles, and reading the policy at issue as a whole, we address whether Provision 2f applies, as its caption suggests, to \u201cManagers, Landlords, or Lessors of Premises\u201d or, more broadly, to \u201c[a]ny person or organization,\u201d as stated in its text.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Initially, we observe that the policy itself attempts to prevent over-reliance on captions. The general liability endorsement, which lists the various provisions\u2019 captions, also states: \u201cThe following is a summary of the Limits on Insurance and additional coverages provided by the endorsement. For complete details on specific coverages, consult the policy contract wording.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-7\">Captions must be construed together with the provisions following them. In addition the captions of a policy are a part of it, and should be construed with the detailed provisions. The captions will not, of themselves, be taken to override the intention of the parties as shown by the provisions and clauses inserted therein, but may be read in connection with such clauses in determining the intention of the parties. Nor should the parties be deemed to have chosen wrong words in heading a clause in the policy if another construction can reasonably be found which gives an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>harmonious effect to the heading and clause together. But an ambiguous provision of a policy may be explained by its caption. And the better rule is that a caption, at least where misleading, or confusing, may control over <em>less liberal </em>provisions in the policy itself. While captions in a policy are not insuring provisions and are not required to be drawn so as to touch on every element of the policy, they should not be repugnant or misleading as to the requirements of the coverage in the policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">13 Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 7387, at 168-71 (revised ed. 1976) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Construing the language of the policy as a whole, we find Provision 2f ambiguous because \u201cmore than one reasonable interpretation is possible.\u201d <em>MacLearn v. Commerce Ins. Co., </em>163 N.H. 241, 244 (2012). One such interpretation is that Provision 2f covers not only \u201cmanagers, landlords, or lessors,\u201d but \u201cany person or organization with respect to their liability arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use\u201d of the premises, because in no other provision of the additional insured endorsement does the caption act as a limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">The policy is replete with limiting language. For example, Philadelphia drafted Section II of the policy to limit coverage for various types of insureds. An insured individual is covered \u201conly with respect to the conduct of a business of which [he or she is] the sole owner\u201d; the members and partners of an insured partnership or joint venture are covered \u201conly with respect to the conduct of [the] business\u201d; the members of an insured LLC \u201conly with respect to the conduct of [the LLC\u2019s] business\u201d; the LLC\u2019s managers \u201conly with respect to their duties as . . . managers\u201d; the stockholders of an insured organization \u201conly with respect to their liability as stockholders\u201d; and the insured\u2019s trustees \u201conly with respect to their duties as trustees.\u201d The insured\u2019s volunteer workers and employees are also insured, \u201cbut only for acts within the scope of their employment... or while performing duties related to the conduct of . . . business.\u201d The insured\u2019s employees, volunteer workers, partners, and members are covered only for bodily injury incurred in the course of employment or performing duties related to the conduct of the insured\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">The additional insured endorsement also contains numerous limitations. Each of the eight provisions describing the types of entities and individuals deemed additional insureds consists of a caption and text.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">2. Each of the following is also an insured:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-10\">a. Medical Directors and Administrators \u2014 Your medical directors and administrators, but only while acting within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>scope of and during the course of their duties as such. Such duties do not include the furnishing or failure to furnish professional services of any physician or psychiatrist in the treatment of a patient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-4\">b. Managers and Supervisors \u2014 If you are an organization other than a partnership or joint venture, your managers and supervisors are also insureds, but only with respect to their duties as your managers and supervisors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">c. Broadened Named Insured \u2014 Any organization and subsidiary thereof which you control and actively manage____However,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">coverage does not apply to any organization or subsidiary not named in the Declarations as Named Insured, if they are also insured under another similar policy, but for its termination or the exhaustion of its limits of insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">d. Funding Source \u2014Any person or organization with respect to their liability arising out of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-8\">(1) Their financial control of you; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-9\">(2) Premises they own, maintain or control while you lease or occupy these premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-10\">This insurance does not apply to structural alterations, new construction and demolition operations performed by or for that person or organization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-11\">e. Home Care Providers \u2014At the first Named Insured\u2019s option, any person or organization under your direct supervision and control while providing for you private home respite or foster home care for the developmentally disabled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-12\">f. Managers, Landlords, or Lessors of Premises \u2014Any person or organization with respect to their liability arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of that part of the premises leased or rented to you subject to the following additional exclusions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-13\">This insurance does not apply to</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-14\">(1) Any \u201coccurrence\u201d which takes place after you cease to be a tenant in that premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>(2) Structural alterations, new construction or demolition operations performed by or on behalf of that person or organization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\">g. Lessor of Leased Equipment \u2014 Automatic Status When Required in Lease Agreement With You \u2014 Any person or organization from whom you lease equipment when you and such person or organization have agreed in writing in a contract or agreement that such person or organization is to be added as an additional insured on your policy. Such person or organization is an insured only with respect to liability for \u201cbodily injury\u201d, \u201cproperty damage\u201d or \u201cpersonal and advertising injury\u201d caused, in whole or in part, by your maintenance, operation or use of equipment leased to you by such person or organization... .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">h. Grantors of Permits \u2014 Any state or political subdivision granting you a permit in connection with your premises subject to the following additional provision ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Unlike Provision 2f, the captions of Provisions 2a, 2b, 2e, 2g, and 2h are either repeated or echoed in the provisions\u2019 text. With the exception of Provision 2f, each provision\u2019s limitations are set forth in the text rather than the caption. For example, despite its expansive caption \u201cFunding Source,\u201d Provision 2d limits coverage to liability arising out of the financial control of the insured or of the ownership, maintenance, or control of the leased premises. Similarly, Provision 2a extends coverage to medical directors and administrators, but, as the text specifies, \u201conly while acting within the scope of and during the course of their duties as such\u201d and subject to further restrictions on the types of duties covered. Provision 2b specifies that managers and supervisors are covered only with respect to their duties as such. The text of Provision 2c, titled \u201cBroadened Named Insured,\u201d limits its reach by setting forth the types of organizations covered by the provision. Similarly, the text of Provisions 2e, 2g, and 2h, which apply to home care providers, lessors of leased equipment, and grantors of permits, significantly narrow the provisions\u2019 captions.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Consistent with <em>Concord Hospital, Atwood, </em>and <em>Hanover Insurance Co., </em>we must interpret Provision 2f \u201cconsider[ing] how the policy provisions interact in order to better understand a provision\u2019s meaning.\u201d New Appleman ON INS. L. Libr. Ed. \u00a7 5.03[1], at 5-31 (Dec. 2010); <em>cf. Phaneuf Funeral Home v. Little Giant Pump Co., </em>163 N.H. 727, 734 (2012) (applying \u201cthe basic principle that words are known by the company they keep\u201d). Throughout the policy and the additional insured endorsement, the parties inserted numerous limitations on coverage. Provision 2f itself contains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>several limitations in its text: it limits coverage to liability arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the leased premises and further excludes some types of occurrences and operations. None of these limitations references managers, landlords, or lessors. The parties to the policy were clearly able, but opted not to, include in the text of Provision 2f reference to the caption as they did, for example, in Provisions 2a, 2b, and 2e. Nor did they limit Provision 2f to the duties undertaken as managers, landlords, or lessors as they did in Provision 2b.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">We reject Philadelphia\u2019s argument that reading Provision 2f as extending coverage to \u201cany person or organization,\u201d rather than only \u201cmanagers, landlords, or lessors,\u201d \u201cwould lead to the absurd result of improperly extending additional insured status to any independent construction or maintenance contractor with no involvement in the ownership or management of the property.\u201d \u201cAn insurance company remains free to limit its liability through clear and unambiguous policy language.\u201d <em>Weeks v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>140 N.H. 641, 643 (1996) (quotation omitted). But having extended coverage to \u201cliability arising out of the ownership, maintenance <em>or use\u201d </em>of the leased premises, Philadelphia cannot now argue that it intended to limit coverage to only those with \u201cinvolvement in the ownership or management of the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Nor are we persuaded that the trial court\u2019s reading of Provision 2f would lead to an absurd result by extending coverage to individuals who are strangers to the policy, such as contractors, electricians, plumbers, carpenters, snow plowers, exterminators, and \u201c \u2018any\u2019 person or organization that worked in any capacity on the property.\u201d First, a broad reading of Provision 2f as covering any person or organization whose liability arises out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the leased premises leads no more to an absurd result than do provisions in a motor vehicle insurance policy extending coverage to any individual operating the vehicle with the owner\u2019s consent, <em>see </em>RSA 264:18, VI (2004),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> when such individual would also be a \u201cstranger to the policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Second, Provision 2f covers only those persons and organizations whose liability <em>arises out of </em>the ownership, maintenance, or use of the leased premises. <em>See Merrimack School Dist., v. Nat\u2019l School Bus Serv., </em>140 N.H. 9, 13 (1995) (\u201cThe phrase \u2018arising out of has been interpreted as . .. meaning \u2018originating from or growing out of or flowing from.\u2019 \u201d). Thus, \u201cany person or organization\u201d is specifically limited by the terms of the provision. For all the foregoing reasons, we find that a reasonable insured could conclude that the caption of Provision 2f does not act as a limitation on the coverage set forth in the text.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">We acknowledge that Philadelphia offers a plausible construction of the policy, <em>ie., </em>that the caption <em>of </em>Provision 2f, \u201cManagers, Landlords, or Lessors of Premises,\u201d serves to narrow the provision\u2019s broad language referencing \u201c[a]ny person or organization.\u201d When an insurance policy\u2019s language is ambiguous and one reasonable interpretation favors coverage, however, we construe the policy in the insured\u2019s favor and against the insurer. <em>Barking Dog v. Citizens Ins. Co. of America, </em>164 N.H. 80, 84 (2012). We reject Philadelphia\u2019s argument that the trial court improperly construed ambiguities in favor of GAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Although it does not challenge the rule that ambiguities must be construed against the insurer and in favor of the insured, Philadelphia contends that ambiguous terms must not be construed in favor of GAD, a stranger to the policy. This is a circular argument because the very question before us is who is an insured under the terms of the policy and, where terms are ambiguous, how to construe them. We decline to adopt a new rule of construction, which would <em>not </em>construe ambiguities against the insurer when addressing who is an insured under the policy. The rationale for our firmly-established rule is equally as strong in such a situation as in any other: the insurer controls the language of the policy and the insurance contract aims \u201cto provide protection for the insured.\u201d <em>Trombly v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield, 120 N.H. </em>764, 771 (1980) (adopting the majority rule of construction because \u201c[t]his rule reflects the fundamental principle of contract law that doubtful language is to be construed most strongly against the party who used it in drafting the contract\u201d (quotation omitted)); <em>cf. Northern Sec. Ins. Co., Inc. v. Doherty, </em>987 A.2d 253, 256-57 (Vt. 2009) (\u201c[T]he naming of the Trust as an additional insured... clearly falls within the realm of ambiguity as we have defined that term. Because the policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>language is ambiguous, we construe it in favor of providing coverage for the beneficiaries of the Trust...\u201d (citation and quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Next, Philadelphia contends that Provision 2f does not cover GAD because GAD\u2019s work on the porch railing constituted renovation rather than maintenance and the two terms are not synonymous. Philadelphia argues that renovation \u201cconnotes an action of restoring property to a good condition or making it like new again \u2014 which is an entirely different concept from maintenance, which only involves taking steps to keep or preserve the existing condition (or status quo).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The policy does not define \u201cmaintenance\u201d or \u201crenovation.\u201d \u201cWhere disputed terms are not defined in the policy, we construe them in context, and in the light of what a more than casual reading of the policy would reveal to an ordinarily intelligent insured.\u201d <em>Weeks, </em>140 N.H. at 644 (quotation and ellipses omitted). Our review of the policy does not reveal, and Philadelphia has not explained, how we should construe the term \u201cmaintenance\u201d when reading the policy as a whole.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Philadelphia argues that maintenance differs from renovation based upon definitions set forth in certain dictionaries, but other dictionaries define maintenance as potentially coextensive, or at least overlapping, with renovation in that both activities include the concept of repair. \u201cMaintenance\u201d is defined, in part, as \u201c[t]he care and work put into property to keep it operating and productive; general repair and upkeep.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1039 (9th ed. 2009). \u201cRenovation\u201d means \u201crestoration] to a former better state (as by cleaning, repairing, or rebuilding).\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 1054 (11th ed. 2003). \u201cRepair\u201d is defined, in part, as \u201crestor[ing] by replacing a part or putting together what is torn or broken.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1055; <em>cf. </em>8A L. Russ &amp; T. Segadla, Couch on Insurance 3d \u00a7 119:36, at 119-54 (1997) (in the context of automobile insurance, \u201c[t]he \u2018maintenance\u2019 aspect of the \u2018ownership, <em>maintenance, </em>or use\u2019 clause covers the act of repairing the covered automobile\u201d). Given the variety of these\u201doverlapping definitions, \u201cmaintenance\u201d may reasonably be understood to include \u201crenovation.\u201d Furthermore, the only case which Philadelphia cites when distinguishing between maintenance and renovation, <em>Utility Service v. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>331 S.W.3d 654, 657 (Mo. 2011), is entirely inapposite as it did not concern an insurance contract, but rather a statute which defined both \u201cmaintenance work\u201d and \u201cconstruction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Because Provision 2f applies to \u201c[a]ny person or organization with respect to their liability arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use\u201d of the premises, and because, read broadly, GAD\u2019s renovation of the porch railing constituted maintenance of the railing, we agree with the trial court that GAD is an additional insured under Philadelphia\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">We also agree that Philadelphia owed GAD a duty to defend it against the contribution actions brought by DW Ray and Webster Place.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\">An insurer\u2019s obligation to defend its insured is determined by whether the cause of action against the insured alleges sufficient facts in the pleadings to bring it within the express terms of the policy.

Dr. Wyly\u2019s claims, in turn, can be reasonably read as alleging that GAD maintained the leased premises. <em>See </em>14 L. RUSS &amp; T.

Sec. Ins. Co., </em>161 N.H. at 650. We resolve any doubt against the insurer and in favor of coverage. <em>Id. </em>The trial court properly ruled that Philadelphia owed GAD a duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\"> The record also supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Philadelphia owed GAD a duty to indemnify. \u201c[T]he majority of jurisdictions hold that the duty to defend is distinct from, and broader than, the duty to indemnify.\u201d 14 COUCH ON INSURANCE 3d, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 200:1, at 200-6.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">The distinction between the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify is based upon the time when the duties are determined. The duty to defend arises prior to the completion of litigation, and therefore insurers are required to meet their defense obligation before the scope of the insured\u2019s liability has been determined. In contrast, the duty to indemnify arises only once liability has been conclusively determined. In other words, because the duty to defend arises whenever an insurer ascertains facts that give rise to the possibility or the potential of liability to indemnify, the duty to defend must be assessed at the very outset of a case, unlike the duty to indemnify, which arises only when the insured\u2019s underlying liability is established.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">14 Couch on Insurance 3D, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 200:3, at 200-9 to 200-10. \u201c[T]he duty to indemnify adher[es] only if the third party suit proves meritorious.\u201d <em>Julio &amp; Sons Co. v.

Koshy, </em>995 A.2d 651, 670 (Me. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Philadelphia argues that \u201c[t]he evidence presented at the contribution trial clearly established that GAD\u2019s work at Webster Place, including work on the railing, involved new construction and renovation, not \u2018maintenance.\u2019 \u201d Philadelphia relies on the testimony of Alex Ray, the owner of both DW Ray and GAD. Ray\u2019s testimony, however, does not support the conclusion that GAD did not maintain the property. Ray testified that, from the time DW Ray acquired the property and until the accident, GAD performed maintenance and repair on the property.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">[GAD] also ha[s] a maintenance division which maintains all the buildings and one of the extended components is[,] when we build or renovate a building[,] we generally have a pattern which we hire someone to do the major construction, which is an outside contractor if it\u2019s a major renovation. And then we finish some of that, painting, fitting out, finish work, mill work, as part of the maintenance job ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">In Webster Place\u2019s and DW Ray\u2019s contribution action against GAD, the court instructed the jury to find whether GAD\u2019s legal fault contributed to the cause of Dr. Wyly\u2019s injury and, in determining whether the parties, including GAD, were negligent, \u201cto decide whether or not a party exercised reasonable care under all the circumstances in the construction, operation <em>and maintenance </em>of the property.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court also instructed the jury to determine whether any of the parties, including GAD, had breached the duty of reasonable care: \u201cin other words, whether any of the parties did or did not construct, operate or <em>maintain </em>the premises in accordance with the duty of due care ....\u201d (Emphasis added.) The jury found that GAD was 45% at fault for Dr. Wyly\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">\u2018We assume that the jury follows properly crafted instructions ....\u201d <em>Cyr v. J.I. Case Co., </em>139 N.H. 193, 210 (1994). We note that it is unclear as to whether the jury\u2019s general verdict amounted to a finding that GAD\u2019s negligence lay in its construction, operation, maintenance, or any combination of these functions relating to the premises. Thus, it cannot be said with certainty whether the jury actually found GAD liable for negligent maintenance. <em>See Julio &amp; Sons Co., </em>591 F. Supp. 2d at 657. Such certainty, however, is not necessary because it is not the insured\u2019s burden to establish coverage. \u201cUnder New Hampshire law, the burden of proving that no insurance coverage exists is on the insurer.\u201d <em>Laconia Rod &amp; Gun Club v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co., </em>123 N.H. 179, 182 (1983); <em>Rivera v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number><em>Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>163 N.H. 603, 606 (2012) (\u201cIn a declaratory judgment action to determine the coverage of an insurance policy, the burden of proof is always on the insurer, regardless of which party brings the petition\u201d). Because, under its general verdict, the jury could have found GAD liable for negligent maintenance, Philadelphia has not met its burden of establishing lack of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b653-6\">DALIANIS, C.J., and CONBOY and BASSETT, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b647-6\"> RSA 264:18, VI states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">A motor vehicle liability policy... shall be subject... to the following provisions which need not be contained therein:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">VT.
