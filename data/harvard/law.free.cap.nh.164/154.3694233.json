Hollenbeck, Jr., Ph.D., because it determined that the statute upon which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>they were based, RSA 632-A:2,1(g)(1) (2007), violated his state and federal substantive due process rights. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">For the purposes of this appeal, the following facts are undisputed. At the time of the alleged crimes, the defendant was a licensed psychologist, who provided therapy to the complainant in 2007. Less than a year after the therapy ended, the two became sexually involved. In April 2010, the defendant was charged with thirty counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault (AFSA) for engaging in sexual penetration with the complainant between February 1,2008, and December 9,2008. The indictments alleged that by engaging in sexual penetration with the complainant \u201cwithin one year of the termination of their therapeutic relationship,\u201d the defendant \u201cact[ed] in a manner which is not professionally recognized as ethical,\u201d thereby violating RSA 632-A:2,1(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">In December 2010, the defendant moved to dismiss the indictments, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that RSA 632-A:2,1(g)(1) violated his state and federal rights to substantive due process because it \u201ccriminalizes the private sexual conduct of consenting adults.\u201d The trial court agreed, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The issue before us is one of constitutional law, which we review <em>de novo. State v. MacElman, </em>154 N.H. 304, 307 (2006). In reviewing a legislative act, we presume it to be constitutional and will not declare it invalid except upon inescapable grounds. <em>State v. Gubitosi, </em>157 N.H. 720, 727 (2008). In other words, we will not hold a statute to be unconstitutional unless a clear and substantial conflict exists between it and the constitution. <em>Id. </em>We first address the defendant\u2019s claim under the State Constitution and rely upon federal law only to aid in our analysis. <em>State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231-33 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">RSA 632-A:2,1(g) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">A person is guilty of the felony of aggravated felonious sexual assault if such person engages in sexual penetration with another person</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-10\">[w]hen the actor provides therapy, medical treatment or examination of the victim and in the course of that therapeutic or treating relationship or within one year of termination of that therapeutic or treating relationship:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-11\">(1) Acts in a manner or for purposes which are not professionally recognized as ethical or acceptable; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>(2) Uses this position as such provider to coerce the victim to submit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The only portions of this statute at issue are those that criminalize engaging in sexual penetration with another \u201cwithin one year of the termination\u201d of the therapeutic or treating relationship between them when doing so is not \u201cprofessionally recognized as ethical or acceptable.\u201d RSA 632-A:2,1(g)(1). The other portions of RSA 632-A:2,1(g)(1) that relate to sexual relationships between therapists and their current clients are not at issue. Nor is RSA 632-A:2, 1(g)(2), which criminalizes sexual contact between a therapist and his or her current or former client when he or she \u201c[u]ses this position as such provider to coerce the victim to submit,\u201d at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Our first task is to determine the scope of the defendant\u2019s challenge to RSA 632-A:2, 1(g)(1). <em>See Milavetz, Gallop &amp; Milavetz, P.A. v. United States, </em>130 S. Ct. 1324, 1339 (2010). \u201cAn appellant may challenge the constitutionality of a statute by asserting a facial challenge, an as-applied challenge, or both.\u201d <em>United States v. Carel, </em>668 F.3d 1211, 1217 (10th Cir. 2011). \u201cA facial challenge is a head-on attack of a legislative judgment, an assertion that the challenged statute violates the Constitution in all, or virtually all, of its applications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted). To prevail on a facial challenge to a statute, \u201cthe challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.\u201d <em>United States v. Salerno, </em>481 U.S. 739,745 (1987); <em>see State v. Furgal, </em>161 N.H. 206, 210 (2010); <em>cf. United States v. Stevens, </em>130 S. Ct. 1577, 1587 (2010) (in First Amendment context, court recognizes another type of facial challenge under which a law may be invalidated as overbroad if \u201ca substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep\u201d (quotation omitted)). \u201c[A]n as-applied challenge,\u201d on the other hand, \u201cconcedes that the statute may be constitutional in many of its applications, but contends that it is not so under the particular circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Carel, </em>668 F.3d at 1217 (quotation and emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The defendant argues that he attacked RSA 632-A:2, 1(g)(1) both facially and as-applied, but contends that the relief he sought, dismissal of the indictments against him, requires us to consider his challenge only as an as-applied challenge. <em>See id.; John Doe No. 1 v. Reed, </em>130 S. Ct. 2811, 2817 (2010). The defendant\u2019s as-applied challenge relies solely upon the language of the indictments, which tracks, nearly exactly, the language of RSA 632-A:2, 1(g)(1). Under these circumstances, there is no meaningful difference between his as-applied and facial challenges. <em>See United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number><em>v. Riquene, </em>No. 3:10-cr-227-J-34TEM, 2012 WL171080, at *7 n.9 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 20, 2012) (when as-applied challenge is not \u201ctied to any case-specific discussion that would make [defendant\u2019s] as-applied challenge different from his facial challenge,\u201d court treats them as the same; moreover, to extent that as-applied challenge depends upon facts and evidence beyond those given in indictment, it must be denied before trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The dissent argues that because the trial court stated that it was undisputed that the relationship between the defendant and the complainant was consensual, the defendant\u2019s as-applied challenge is ripe for review. We disagree. Under the statute variation at issue, lack of consent is irrelevant; it is not an element of the crime for which the defendant was charged. <em>See </em>RSA 632-A:2, 1(g)(1). As the dissent itself points out, \u201cthe legislature has determined that all patients are legally incapable, for an admittedly arbitrary period of one year after the termination of therapy, of consenting to sex with a former therapist.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s finding did not transform this case from a facial to an as-applied challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Moreover, in this case, unlike the cases upon which the dissent relies, the operative facts <em>are </em>disputed. In this case, we have no facts, jury-decided or otherwise, which would allow us to opine as to whether the complainant is part of \u201cthat subset of adults who may not easily refuse consent to sex with a former therapist.\u201d Accordingly, we consider the defendant\u2019s claim to be a facial challenge to the portion of RSA 632-A:2, 1(g)(1) that relates to therapists and their former clients, and hold that to prevail, he must demonstrate that there is no set of circumstances under which the statute might be valid. <em>See Furgal, </em>161 N.H. at 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">We begin our due process analysis by determining the nature of the right at issue, which in turn, dictates the level of scrutiny that we apply to the infringement of that right. <em>See McKenzie v. Town of Eaton Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, </em>154 N.H. 773, 782 (2007) (Duggan, J., concurring specially); <em>cf. Bleiler v. Chief, Dover Police Dep\u2019t, </em>155 N.H. 693, 697 (2007). \u201cThe Due Process Clause guarantees more than fair process, and the \u2018liberty\u2019 it protects includes more than the absence of physical restraint.\u201d <em>Washington v. Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S. 702, 719 (1997); <em>see Collins v. Barker Heights, </em>503 U.S. 115, 125 (1992) (Due Process Clause \u201cprotects individual liberty against certain government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them\u201d (quotation omitted)). \u201cThe substantive component of due process provides heightened protection against government interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests.\u201d <em>Cook v. Gates, </em>528 F.3d 42, 49 (1st Cir. 2008) (quotation omitted); <em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S. at 720. In addition to the specific freedoms protected by the Bill of Rights, the Supreme Court has ruled that the \u201cliberty\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>specially protected by the Due Process Clause includes the rights to: marry, have children, direct the education of one\u2019s children, enjoy marital privacy, use contraception, maintain bodily integrity, choose to have an abortion, and refuse unwanted medical treatment. <em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S. at 720; <em>see Cook, </em>528 F.3d at 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">When there is no fundamental right or protected liberty interest at stake, we review the infringement of a right or interest under our rational basis standard of review, which provides that a statute is constitutional if it is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. <em>Cook, </em>528 F.3d at 48 n.3; <em>see State v. Haas, </em>155 N.H. 612, 613 (2007). By contrast, a heightened standard of review applies when a fundamental right or protected liberty interest is at issue. <em>See Bleiler, </em>155 N.H. at 699-700; <em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S. at 721; <em>Cook, </em>528 F.3d at 55-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">In this case, the parties dispute whether a fundamental right or protected liberty interest is at stake. The defendant contends that RSA 632-A:2,1(g)(1) burdens the exercise of a constitutionally protected right to engage in private consensual sexual conduct with another adult. Accordingly, he argues that we must review the infringement of his right under our strict scrutiny standard, which requires that \u201cthe infringement [must be] narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest,\u201d <em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S. at 721 (quotation omitted), or some other heightened standard of review. <em>See, e.g., Bleiler, </em>155 N.H. at 699-700. The State argues that \u201cwhatever the nature of the right at issue here, ... it is certainly not fundamental\u201d or even entitled to constitutional protection. Therefore, the State asserts, we should apply our rational basis standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">To support their arguments, both parties rely upon the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lawrence v. Texas, </em>539 U.S. 558, 563, 564 (2003), which concerned a substantive due process challenge to a Texas statute that made it a crime for two people of the same gender to engage in sodomy. The specific constitutional question was \u201cwhether the petitioners were free as adults to engage in the private conduct in the exercise of their liberty under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.\u201d <em>Lawrence, </em>539 U.S. at 564; <em>Cook, </em>528 F.3d at 49. In deciding this question, the court found it necessary to overrule <em>Bowers v. Hardwick, </em>478 U.S. 186 (1986), which upheld a Georgia statute that made it a crime to engage in sodomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">The <em>Lawrence </em>court overruled <em>Bowers </em>after deciding that the <em>Bowers </em>court had \u201cmisapprehended the claim of liberty . . . presented to it\u201d by defining the issue before it as \u201cwhether there is a fundamental right to engage in consensual sodomy.\u201d <em>Lawrence, </em>539 U.S. at 567. To the contrary, the <em>Lawrence </em>Court explained, the laws at issue in both <em>Bowers </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number><em>Lawrence </em>\u201ctouch[ ] upon the most private human conduct, sexual behavior, and in the most private of places, the home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>According to the Court, the statutes at issue in <em>Bowers </em>and <em>Lavrrence </em>sought \u201cto control a personal relationship that, whether or not entitled to formal recognition in the law, is within the liberty of persons to choose without being punished as criminals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After overruling <em>Bowers, </em>the Court then invalidated the Texas statute because it \u201cfurthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 578. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\">The present case does not involve minors. It does not involve persons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused. It does not involve public conduct or prostitution. It does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter. The case does involve two adults who, with full and mutual consent from each other, engaged in sexual practices common to a homosexual lifestyle. The petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives. The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime. Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government. It is a promise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-6\"><em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">\u201cCourts and commentators interpreting <em>Lawrence </em>diverge over the doctrinal approach employed to invalidate the petitioners\u2019 convictions.\u201d <em>Cook, </em>528 F.3d at 51. Some have interpreted <em>Lawrence </em>to apply the rational basis standard of review; others interpret it as applying strict scrutiny. <em>Id. </em>at 51 nn. 6-7 (citing cases). \u201cAnd a third group view the case as applying a balancing of state and individual interests that cannot be characterized as strict scrutiny or rational basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We find ourselves in the third group. Like the First and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals, \u201cwe are persuaded that <em>Lawrence </em>did indeed recognize a protected liberty interest for adults to engage in private, consensual sexual intimacy and applied a balancing of constitutional interests that defies either the strict scrutiny or rational basis label.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52; <em>see Witt v. Department of Air Force, </em>527 F.3d 806, 816-17 (9th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Like the Ninth Circuit, \u201c[w]e cannot reconcile what the Supreme Court did in <em>Lawrence </em>with the minimal protections afforded by traditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>rational basis review.\u201d <em>Witt, </em>527 F.3d at 816. \u201cThe criticism that the Court in <em>Bowers </em>had misapprehended the extent of the liberty at stake does not sound in rational basis review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 817 (quotation omitted). If the Court were reviewing whether the <em>Bowers </em>Court had correctly applied the rational basis test, it would have had no reason to consider the extent of the liberty involved. <em>Id. </em>\u201cRational basis review does <em>not </em>permit consideration of the strength of the individual\u2019s interest or the extent of the intrusion on that interest caused by the law; the focus is entirely on the rationality of the state\u2019s reason for enacting the law.\u201d <em>Cook, </em>528 F.3d at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Additionally, the <em>Lawrence </em>Court\u2019s rationale for its holding is inconsistent with rational basis review. <em>Witt, </em>527 F.3d at 817. The Court held that the Texas statute \u201cfurthers no legitimate state interest <em>which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual.\u201d Lawrence, </em>539 U.S. at 578 (emphasis added). Had the Court applied rational basis, it would not have asked whether the state interest \u201cjustified\u201d the intrusion, for under rational basis review, \u201cany hypothetical rationale for the law would do.\u201d <em>Witt, </em>527 F.3d at 817. Had the Court applied rational basis review, it would have upheld the petitioners\u2019 convictions. <em>Cook, </em>528 F.3d at 52. The state interest that Texas offered to justify the statute was the government\u2019s interest in promoting moral conduct. <em>Lawrence, </em>539 U.S. at 582 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring); <em>see Cook, </em>528 F.3d at 52. This is a legitimate state interest. <em>See Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., </em>501 U.S. 560, 569 (1991). \u201cThus, <em>Lawrence\u2019s </em>holding can only be squared with the Supreme Court\u2019s acknowledgement of morality as a rational basis by concluding that a protected liberty interest was at stake, and therefore a rational basis for the law was not sufficient.\u201d <em>Cook, </em>528 F.3d at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The fact that \u201cvirtually every case it relied upon for support\u201d recognized a protected liberty interest further suggests that the right <em>Lawrence </em>recognized was a protected liberty interest. <em>Id. </em>at 52; <em>see Lawrence, </em>539 U.S. at 564-66 (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Finally, the language employed throughout <em>Lawrence </em>supports interpreting it to recognize a protected liberty interest. The Court began its opinion by explaining the nature of the liberty protected by the Constitution: \u201cLiberty protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions into a dwelling or other private places. . . . And, there are other spheres of our lives and existence . . . where the State should not be a dominant presence. Freedom extends beyond spatial bounds.\u201d <em>Lawrence, </em>539 U.S. at 562. \u201cThe instant case,\u201d the Court explained, \u201cinvolves liberty of the person both in its spatial and in its more transcendent dimensions.\u201d <em>Id: </em>The Court used the word \u201cspatial\u201d because the case concerned conduct occurring at home, and the word \u201ctranscendent\u201d because it involved the freedom of the petitioners to engage in \u201ccertain intimate conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>decision to engage in certain intimate sexual conduct, with another consenting adult, is central, the Court explained, to a person\u2019s autonomy. <em>Id. </em>The right to engage in private, consensual sexual conduct \u201cis a promise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 578 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\"> Having defined the constitutional interest recognized in <em>Lawrence, </em>we hold that the defendant\u2019s facial challenge fails. We agree with the State that the kind of sexual relationship alleged here is not included in the constitutional right <em>Lawrence </em>recognized. <em>\u201cLawrence </em>did not identify a protected liberty interest in all forms and manner of sexual intimacy.\u201d <em>Cook, </em>528 F.3d at 56; <em>see Muth v. Frank, </em>412 F.3d 808, 818 (7th Cir. 2005). Instead, the <em>Lawrence </em>Court \u201cmade . . . clear that there are . . . types of sexual activity that are beyond the reach of that opinion,\u201d <em>Cook, </em>528 F.3d at 56, specifically, sexual activity involving minors, or \u201cpersons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused.\u201d <em>Lawrence, </em>539 U.S. at 578; <em>see Muth, </em>412 F.3d at 818 <em>(.Lawrence </em>does not apply to invalidate state law criminalizing incest); <em>Lowe v. Swanson, </em>663 F.3d 258, 264-65 (6th Cir. 2011) (same). Here, RSA 632-A:2, 1(g) includes such other types of activity. <em>See Cook, </em>528 F.3d at 56. RSA 632-A:2, 1(g) criminalizes a sexual relationship between a therapist and a former client, which is the kind of relationship \u201cwhere consent might not easily be refused.\u201d <em>Lawrence, </em>539 U.S. at 578. <em>Lawrence </em>did not recognize a constitutional right to engage in this conduct. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Because we conclude that the defendant has no constitutionally protected right at stake, w\u00e9 apply our rational basis standard of review to his facial challenge. The rational basis test requires that legislation only be rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. <em>State v. Haas, </em>155 N.H. 612, 613 (2007). The party challenging the legislation has the burden of proof. <em>Id. </em>The rational basis test \u201ccontains no inquiry into whether legislation unduly restricts individual rights.\u201d <em>Boulders at Strafford v. Town of Strafford, </em>153 N.H. 633, 641 (2006). Further, the legitimate government interest posited by the State need not be the State\u2019s actual interests in adopting the statute. <em>Cmty. Res. for Justice v. City of Manchester, </em>154 N.H. 748, 757 (2007). Nor need the State\u2019s posited interest be based upon facts because \u201c[i]n rational basis review, we will not independently examine the factual basis for [a statute].\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cRather, we will inquire only as to whether the legislature could reasonably conceive to be true the facts upon which [the State\u2019s interest] is based.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The defendant has not met his burden of establishing that RSA 632-A:2,1(g)(1) is facially unconstitutional. Here, the State has articulated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>legitimate governmental interests in protecting those who are vulnerable to exploitation from being exploited, <em>see State v. Frost, </em>141 N.H. 493, 496-97 (1996), and in maintaining the integrity of the mental health profession. As the State argues in its brief, the statute was \u201cintended to further the State\u2019s legitimate . . . interests in protecting persons whose ability to consent to sexual contact may have been compromised by the inherent nature of the treatment relationship and in maintaining the integrity of the mental health treatment professionals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Moreover, RSA 632-A:2,1(g)(1) is rationally related to those legitimate interests. It was rational for the legislature to impose a one-year limitation on sexual relationships between therapists and their former clients. As the State explains: \u201c[C]ommon sense dictates that any coercive influence on former patients is likely to be at its strongest during the first year after the treatment relationship has ended.\u201d Indeed, when the legislature amended RSA 632-A:2, 1(g)(1) to pertain to therapists and their former clients in 1998, it considered an article, which observed that while \u201ca sexual or romantic relationship that immediately follows the termination of the physician-patient relationship may be more suspect than one that occurs after considerable time has passed[,]... [rjesearch on psychotherapists has shown that patients experience strong feelings about their therapists for 5 to 10 years after the termination of treatment.\u201d Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, American Medical Association, <em>Sexual Misconduct in the Practice of Medicine, </em>266 J. Am. Med. ASS\u2019N 2741,2743-44 (Nov. 1991). We conclude that the legislature could reasonably conceive these facts to be true, and, thus, that RSA 632-A:2,1(g)(1) serves or could conceivably serve legitimate governmental interests. <em>See Cmty. Res. for Justice, </em>154 N.H. at 757.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">While the defendant argues that the one-year limitation is arbitrary, in a sense, every line drawn by the legislature is arbitrary. <em>See Estate of Cargill v. City of Rochester, </em>119 N.H. 661, 667 (1979). \u201cThat exercise of discretion, however, is a legislative, not a judicial function.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). To satisfy rational basis review, the legislature\u2019s line drawing need only be rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Because the defendant has not met his burden of proving that RSA 632-A:2, 1(g)(1) is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose in all circumstances, <em>see Salerno, </em>481 U.S. at 745; <em>Furgal, </em>161 N.H. at 210, his facial challenge fails. We reach the same result under the Federal Constitution as we do under the State Constitution because the Federal Constitution offers the defendant no greater protection than does the State Constitution under these circumstances, <em>see Laumnce, </em>539 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>at 578. We express no opinion as to the validity of any as-applied challenge that the defendant may bring in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b189-6\">BASSETT, J., concurred; GALWAY, J., retired, and FITZGERALD, J., retired superior court justice, specially assigned under RSA 490:3, concurred; Hicks, J., dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b189-7\">HICKS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AhY\">dissenting. Because I believe that the statute under which the defendant is indicted is unconstitutional as applied to him, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Unlike the majority, I would reach the defendant\u2019s as-applied challenge. The majority finds \u201cno meaningful difference between [the defendant\u2019s] as-applied and facial challenges\u201d because his \u201cas-applied challenge relies solely upon the language of the indictments, which tracks, nearly exactly, the language of RSA 632-A:2,1(g)(1).\u201d I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">In his motion to dismiss, the defendant asserts that his \u201cprosecution [under the statute] constitutes a violation of his constitutionally protected fundamental right to engage in private <em>consensual </em>sexual conduct with other adults.\u201d (Emphasis added.) No allegations concerning consent or lack thereof are contained in the indictments against him. The majority cites <em>United States v. Riquene, </em>No. 3:10-er-227-J-34TEM, 2012 WL 171080, at *7 n.9 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 20, 2012), for the proposition that \u201cto [the] extent [the defendant\u2019s] as-applied challenge depends upon facts and evidence beyond those given in [the] indictment, it must be denied before trial.\u201d I acknowledge the soundness of that proposition in the great majority of cases. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Pope, </em>613 F.3d 1255, 1259-60 (10th Cir. 2010) (discussing rule). There are, however, exceptions. <em>See id. </em>at 1260-61. For instance, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit recognized that a district court may \u201cdismiss charges at the pretrial stage under the limited circumstances where the operative facts are undisputed and the government fails to object to the district court\u2019s consideration of those undisputed facts in making the determination regarding a submissible case.\u201d <em>United States v. Hall, </em>20 F.3d 1084, 1088 (10th Cir. 1994) (dismissal under Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)). In <em>United States v. Engstrum, </em>609 F. Supp. 2d 1227, 1229 n.6 (D. Utah 2009), that exception was used to consider, prior to trial, a motion to dismiss an indictment on grounds that the underlying statute was unconstitutional as applied to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">In the instant case, the trial court\u2019s order recited the \u201cundisputed fact[]\u201d that the defendant and the complainant \u201chad a consensual sexual relationship in 2008, less than one year after [she] stopped treating with [him].\u201d The State does not explicitly challenge that \u201cundisputed fact[]\u201d on appeal, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>rather suggests that it is legally irrelevant. The State asserts, for instance, that \u201cthe statute does not penalize defendants for engaging in consensual sexual activity. Instead, it penalizes defendants for engaging in what the legislature has deemed nonconsensual sex, an activity to which there is no constitutional right whatsoever.\u201d It also asserts that the State \u201chas a legitimate interest in protecting those who are vulnerable to exploitation because of their inability legally to consent.\u201d (Quotation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">This position reinforces my conviction that the defendant\u2019s as-applied challenge is now ripe for review because \u201creserving resolution of the issue could harm the defendant] without presenting the constitutional question more clearly.\u201d <em>United States v. Beckford, </em>966 F. Supp. 1415, 1423 (E.D Va. 1997). In other words, if lack of consent is not an element of, and actual consent is not a defense to, the crime, evidence related to whether the complainant in fact consented may be deemed irrelevant and inadmissible at trial. \u201cGiven that situation, the defendant[] likely would not present [his] theories at trial, and in reserving judgment on the constitutional question, the Court, in effect, would force the defendant[] to undergo prosecution pursuant to a potentially unconstitutional statute without obtaining the benefit of significant clarification of the facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, I would consider the merits of the defendant\u2019s as-applied challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The first step of the substantive due process analysis, as the majority notes, is to determine the nature of the right asserted, which then informs the level of scrutiny to apply. <em>See Aime v. Com., </em>611 N.E.2d 204, 209 (Mass. 1993) (stating that in substantive due process analysis under Federal Constitution, nature of individual interest at stake determines standard of review courts apply). I agree with the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit that <em>Lawrence v. Texas, </em>539 U.S. 558 (2003), \u201crecognize[d] a protected liberty interest for adults to engage in private, consensual sexual intimacy and applied a balancing of constitutional interests that defies either the strict scrutiny or rational basis label.\u201d <em>Cook v. Gates, </em>528 F.3d 42, 52 (1st Cir. 2008); <em>see State v. Holmes, </em>154 N.H. 723, 726-27 (2007) (noting that the <em>Lawrence </em>Court ruled \u201cthat substantive due process precludes the State from criminalizing private consensual sexual conduct between adults\u201d). The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit attempted to give form to that balancing test by adapting the heightened level of scrutiny applied in <em>Sell v. United States, </em>539 U.S. 166 (2003). <em>Witt v. Department of Air Force, </em>527 F.3d 806, 819 (9th Cir. 2008). Since that test supplies a useful vehicle for balancing the interests at issue here, I will apply it for purposes of this dissent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">[W]hen the government attempts to intrude upon the personal and private lives of . . . [consenting adults], in a manner that implicates the rights identified in <em>Lawrence, </em>the government must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>advance an important governmental interest, the intrusion must significantly further that interest, and the intrusion must be necessary to further that interest. In other words, for the third factor, a less intrusive means must be unlikely to achieve substantially the government\u2019s interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-5\"><em>Id.; cf. Cook, </em>528 F.3d at 56 <em>(\u201cLawrence </em>balanced the strength of the state\u2019s asserted interest in prohibiting immoral conduct against the degree of intrusion into the petitioners\u2019 private sexual life caused by the statute in order to determine whether the law was unconstitutionally applied.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The State asserts that RSA 632-A:2, 1(g) is part of \u201ca comprehensive statutory scheme that was intended to further the State\u2019s legitimate, if not compelling, interests in protecting persons whose ability to consent to sexual contact may have been compromised by the inherent nature of the treatment relationship, and in maintaining the integrity of the mental health treatment professions.\u201d I will assume for purposes of this dissent that these interests are \u201cimportant\u201d under the <em>Witt </em>balancing test and that the statute significantly furthers those interests. <em>Witt, </em>527 F.3d at 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">I conclude, however, that the statute falters on the third prong. With respect to the interest in maintaining the integrity of mental health professions, I fail to see how this interest cannot be substantially achieved through the less intrusive means of licensing statutes and sanctioning mechanisms of professional boards. <em>See </em>RSA ch. 330-A (2011 &amp; Supp. 2011) (Mental Health Practice).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The more significant interest, in my mind, is that of protecting persons whose ability to consent actually has been compromised by the treatment relationship. The State points to the recognition by other courts of \u201cthe increased risk of coercion that flows from the inherent nature of a psychotherapist-patient relationship.\u201d Coercion by the therapist, however, is explicitly criminalized under RSA 632-A:2, 1(g)(2) (2007) (variant of offense containing element that the defendant \u201c[u]ses this position as such provider to coerce the victim to submit\u201d). Thus, the legislature addressed that concern in a section of the statute not involved in this case. Moreover, the State notes that it \u201cinformed the [trial] court that it could not bring the charges under \u2018any other section of RSA 632-A.-2,\u2019 so \u2018the practical effect of the [c]ourt\u2019s [o]rder m[ight] be to bar the State from prosecuting the case.\u2019 \u201d Apparently, then, coercion by use of the defendant\u2019s position as the complainant\u2019s therapist is not at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">The State also contends that the therapist-patient relationship is one in which \u201cconsent might not easily be refused,\u201d <em>Lawrence, </em>539 U.S. at 578, and thus lies outside the scope of the right recognized in <em>Lawrence. </em>It asserts that \u201c[a]uthorities have recognized that a... therapist-patient relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>is just such a relationship because the ... therapist wields power over the patient and could easily exploit his or her vulnerabilities, even after the relationship has ended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">I acknowledge that the <em>Lawrence </em>Court distinguished the case before it from other situations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">The present case does not involve minors. It does not involve persons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused. It does not involve public conduct or prostitution. It does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-7\"><em>Lawrence, </em>539 U.S. at 578. Nevertheless, I would hesitate to read too much into this <em>dicta, </em>which merely stated what was <em>not </em>before the Court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-8\">It is true that <em>Lawrence </em>did not involve a case where consent was in doubt. <em>Lawrence </em>explicitly said as much: \u201c[The present case] does not involve persons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused.\u201d [539 U.S. at 578.] But that distinction does not conclusively decide this case. The Supreme Court was simply making clear what could just as well have gone unsaid \u2014 that the Court expresses no view as to issues not before it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-9\"><em>Anderson v. Morrow, </em>371 F.3d 1027, 1037 (9th Cir. 2004) (Berzon, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">To declare all sexual relationships between therapists and their former patients within one year after termination of therapy constitutionally unprotected because some former patients might not easily refuse consent makes an end-run around <em>Lawrence. </em>Instead, the inquiry must start with the premise that adults have \u201ca protected liberty interest... to engage in private, consensual sexual intimacy.\u201d <em>Cook, </em>528 F.3d at 52. Then, the State\u2019s interest in protecting that subset of adults who may not easily refuse consent to sex with a former therapist must be balanced \u201cagainst the degree of intrusion into the [defendant\u2019s] private sexual life caused by the statute in order to determine whether the law [is] unconstitutional] [as] applied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56; <em>cf. Paschal v. State, </em>No. CR 11-673, 2012 WL 1034538, at *10-11 (Ark. March 29, 2012) (stating that under state constitution, \u201c[t]he State misapprehends the issue when it asserts that there is no fundamental right for a public high school teacher to have sex with an eighteen-year-old high school student enrolled in that school\u201d and clarifying that \u201c[t]he issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>is whether the statute, as applied in this case, infringes on [the defendant\u2019s] fundamental right to engage in private, consensual, noncommercial acts of sexual intimacy with an adult\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The degree of intrusion here is severe: the defendant faces strict criminal liability. The State need not prove that the relationship between the defendant and the complainant actually impaired her ability to refuse consent to the charged sexual contact. <em>See </em>RSA 632-A:2, 1(g)(1) (2007). Rather the legislature has determined that all patients are legally incapable, for an admittedly arbitrary period of one year after the termination of therapy, of consenting to sex with a former therapist. That determination applies whether the patient was in therapy for ten years or one session, whether the sexual relationship began the day after therapy terminated or 364 days after termination. To declare all adult psychotherapy patients legally incapable of consenting to sex with their former therapist because the therapy relationship is one \u201cwhere consent <em>might </em>not easily be refused,\u201d <em>Lawrence, </em>539 U.S. at 578 (emphasis added), and in so doing impose strict criminal liability on the therapist even when the \u201cprotected\u201d partner was actually capable of giving or refusing consent and did, in fact, freely give it, simply goes too far. Although the issue is not before us, one might wonder about the burden thereby placed upon the rights of the \u201cprotected,\u201d but fully capable, partner. <em>Cf. State v. Frost, </em>141 N.H. 493, 497, 502 (1996) (noting that a \u201csubset of \u2018mentally defective\u2019 persons <em>is </em>capable of legally consenting to sexual relations and thus does not require protection,\u201d but finding it unnecessary to reach defendant\u2019s argument that RSA 632-A:2, 1(h), as applied, \u201cviolates the [constitutional and statutory] rights of \u2018mentally defective\u2019 people\u201d); <em>Anderson, </em>371 F.3d at 1029,1040-41 (Berzon, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (discussing \u201cmoderately retarded\u201d adult\u2019s ability to consent to sex in addressing \u201cwhether the sexual liberty interest outlined in <em>Lawrence </em>regulates the manner in which a state drafts and applies its statutory rape law as applied to adult victims\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">I cannot conclude that \u201ca less intrusive means [would] be unlikely to achieve substantially the government\u2019s interest.\u201d <em>Witt, </em>527 F.3d at 819. Accordingly, I conclude that RSA 632-A:2, 1(g)(1) is unconstitutional as applied to the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
