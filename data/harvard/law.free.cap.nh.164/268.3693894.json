We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The following facts are drawn from the trial court\u2019s order and the record, or are otherwise undisputed. In 2006, the defendant pleaded guilty to one count of accomplice to burglary, <em>see </em>RSA 626:8 (2007); RSA 635:1 (2007), and one count of tampering with witnesses, <em>see </em>RSA 641:5 (2007). Under the plea agreement, the defendant was sentenced to two concurrent prison terms of three and one-half to seven years, suspended for five years on the condition of his good behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">On May 11, 2010, the Laconia District Court found the defendant guilty of two counts of simple assault and one count of criminal threatening in connection with a physical altercation that occurred in 2009. The defendant appealed to the superior court for a jury trial. Later in May, the State filed a motion to impose the 2006 suspended sentence, alleging that the physical altercation constituted a violation of the good behavior requirement. The defendant requested that the hearing on the motion to impose be deferred until final disposition of the pending criminal trial. The State objected, and the court denied the defendant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">On December 14, 2010, the superior court held a hearing on the motion to impose at which testimony and evidence were received. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court found \u201cthat the State ha[d] submitted sufficient evidence to show that indeed [the defendant had] failed to remain of good behavior and, in fact, the crime of simple assault did occur.\u201d As a result, the court granted the motion and imposed the original 2006 sentence. The defendant did not appeal. <em>See </em>Sup. Ct. R. 3, 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">On July 6, 2011, the defendant was tried by a jury on the charges stemming from the 2009 altercation. At trial, he argued that his actions were justified by self-defense. The jury acquitted him of all the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">On July 21, the defendant filed a motion to vacate the imposition of his sentence for the 2006 convictions. He argued that his actions in the 2009 altercation were justified by self-defense, as evidenced by the jury\u2019s acquittal on those charges, and, thus, he did not violate the good behavior requirement of his 2006 suspended sentence. Accordingly, he requested that the court vacate his sentence or, in the alternative, reevaluate the sentence \u201cin order to consider the complete exposition of evidence and the jury\u2019s\u201d verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>After a hearing, the court denied the defendant\u2019s motion. The court noted that \u201ca jury acquittal of criminal charges is not dispositive as to whether a suspended sentence should be imposed,\u201d and found that the sentence was properly imposed. It further disagreed with the defendant\u2019s argument that he did not violate the good behavior requirement because the jury found that his actions were justified and in conformity with the law. It explained: \u201cThe jury only found that the defendant was not guilty of simple assault and criminal threatening beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury did not specifically find that the defendant acted in self defense or that his actions were otherwise justified.\u201d Finally, the court declined to address the defendant\u2019s alternative argument that it should reevaluate his sentence in light of his acquittal as he \u201cfailed to provide any legal support for [his] request.\u201d The defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration was denied, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The defendant\u2019s main argument on appeal is that the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to vacate his suspended sentence was based upon its misinterpretation of the jury\u2019s verdict. He contends that the jury acquitted him because it credited his assertion that he acted in self-defense and, as a result, the trial court\u2019s ruling that \u201c[t]he jury did not specifically find that the defendant acted in self defense or that his actions were otherwise justified\u201d was an \u201cerroneous misinterpretation of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d Consequently, he maintains that the court unsustainably exercised its discretion in denying his motion to vacate. We review a trial court\u2019s decision to impose or vacate a suspended sentence for an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>See State v. Gibbs, </em>157 N.H. 538, 540 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\"> When a defendant raises self-defense, \u201cconduct negating the defense becomes an element of the charged offense, which the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Etienne, </em>163 N.H. 57, 80-81 (2011) (quotation and citation omitted). The State\u2019s failure to do so, however, is not equivalent to an affirmative finding by the jury that the defendant, in fact, acted in self-defense. Rather, it merely means that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt one or more elements of the charged crime. <em>See State v. White, </em>145 N.H. 544, 548 (2000), <em>vacated on other grounds by White v. Coplan, </em>399 F.3d 18 (1st Cir. 2005). Such failure can result from a variety of factors. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the trial court did not err in ruling that \u201c[t]he jury did not specifically find that the defendant acted in self-defense or that his actions were otherwise justified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Moreover, a suspended sentence may be imposed upon proof by a preponderance of evidence of a violation of the condition upon which the sentence was imposed. <em>See State v. Weeks, </em>141 N.H. 248, 251 (1996). \u201cWhen, as here, the condition was to be of good behavior, the State\u2019s burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>proof is satisfied either by establishing the fact of a criminal conviction for the acts which constitute the violation or by proof of the commission of the underlying acts.\u201d <em>Gibbs, </em>157 N.H. at 540 (quotation omitted). \u201c[A] jury acquittal of criminal charges is not dispositive as to whether a suspended sentence should be imposed.\u201d <em>Cf. id. </em>(concluding \u201cthat the trial court\u2019s consideration of the evidence presented at trial regarding the acquitted conduct was proper for purposes of imposing [the defendant\u2019s] suspended sentence\u201d); <em>State v. Benjamin, </em>9 A.3d 338, 346 (Conn. 2010) (\u201c[A] trial court\u2019s finding of a violation of probation is not clearly erroneous solely because of an acquittal at the criminal trial on the basis of the same alleged unlawful conduct.\u201d); <em>Douglas v. State, </em>43 So. 3d 196,198 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2010) (\u201cThe law is well-settled that, because different standards of proof apply, a violation of probation can be based on criminal conduct for which a defendant is subsequently acquitted by a jury.\u201d). Here, the court \u201cindependently determined that a violation of the suspension condition occurred\u201d and found that the defendant had \u201cnot pointed to any law or fact which the Court misapprehended when\u201d deciding to impose the suspended sentence. We find this was a sustainable exercise of the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\"> The defendant next argues that, even prior to his acquittal, there was insufficient evidence to support the court\u2019s decision to impose the suspended sentence. The defendant, however, has waived this argument because he did not appeal the trial court\u2019s original decision to impose the suspended sentence. The trial court imposed the 2006 suspended sentence on December 14, 2010. The defendant did not appeal this ruling. The imposition of a suspended sentence is a decision on the merits that a defendant may appeal to this court. <em>See </em>SUP. Ct. R. 3, 7. A defendant has thirty days from its imposition to file an appeal. <em>See </em>SUP. CT. R. 7. Failure to appeal within the permitted time will result in the entry of judgment. <em>See </em>SUPER. Ct. R. 74; <em>State v. Ryan, </em>142 N.H. 486, 487 (1997). Because the defendant failed to directly appeal the imposition of his suspended sentence, we do not reach the merits of his sufficiency claim. <em>See Ryan, </em>142 N.H. at 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Finally, the defendant argues, in essence, that we should reverse <em>State v. Flood, </em>159 N.H. 353 (2009), and hold that the imposition hearing should have been stayed pending the conclusion of his criminal trial. As previously noted, the defendant did not appeal the decision imposing his suspended sentence; thus, he failed to timely appeal the court\u2019s earlier ruling denying his request for a stay. Accordingly, we decline to address this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b295-8\">Dalianis, C.J., and HICKS, CONBOY and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
