We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The following facts are drawn from the record of the trial and the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. In October 1998, C.T., a nine year-old female, told her mother that the defendant had touched her genital area on numerous occasions. C.T.\u2019s mother reported the allegations to the police, but four months elapsed before C.T. was interviewed by Officer Lori Stowell of the Raymond Police Department, who had never before conducted a child sexual assault investigation. After submitting a report of her February 1999 interview with C.T., Stowell did not pursue the investigation further.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Approximately seven years later, in 2006, Raymond Police Detective Richard Labell re-opened the investigation of C.T.\u2019s allegations. In accordance with policies and procedures developed subsequent to her 1999 interview with Stowell, C.T. was re-interviewed in 2006 at the Child Advocacy Center (CAC) by a specially trained interviewer while Labell observed from an adjacent room. Following the interview, Labell obtained a warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest. In a post-arrest interview, the defendant denied that he had ever intentionally touched C.T.\u2019s genital area. He was thereafter indicted on three counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault. <em>See </em>RSA 632-A:2, II (Supp. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">The defense theory at trial was that C.T.\u2019s allegations were not credible, and that if the defendant ever touched C.T.\u2019s genitalia, he did so accidentally while playing games with her and his daughters. Thus, in his opening statement, defense counsel characterized C.T.\u2019s accusations as a \u201cstory,\u201d said that if any touchings occurred, they were accidental, and emphasized that no official action was taken for many years after she first made her allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">The State presented four witnesses at trial: C.T., C.T.\u2019s mother, Labell, and Stowell. C.T., who was eighteen years of age and a ninth-grade student at the time of trial, testified that when she was eight and nine years old she frequently went to her grandmother\u2019s house. The defendant was a neighbor of her grandmother, and C.T. would often play with the defendant\u2019s children. Sometimes the defendant would join in the play. C.T. described a game they played where the defendant threw the children into the air and then caught them and tickled them all over. C.T. indicated that during these games the defendant would touch her private area, which she described as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>the part of her body below the belt that she used \u201cto go pee.\u201d Most of this touching occurred over her shorts, but on a couple of occasions the defendant touched her under her shorts but over her underwear, and on one occasion he touched her underneath her underwear.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">C.T. said that she was uncomfortable and scared when the defendant touched her underneath her underwear and that she told the defendant that she wanted to stop playing because she had to go to the bathroom. C.T. said that, on this occasion, she left the defendant\u2019s house just as his wife was pulling into the driveway, and the defendant told C.T. not to tell anyone or she would get in trouble. C.T. ran home and told her mother what had happened. C.T.\u2019s mother took her to the police station where they spoke with an officer. Approximately four months later, C.T. returned to the police station for a taped interview. C.T. said that, after this interview, she had no further contact with the police for a long time, and that \u201c[everybody called me a liar, and the neighbors\u2019 kids, [the defendant\u2019s] kids, were telling me I was a home wrecker and I just wanted to take their daddy away.\u201d In 2006, Detective Labell contacted C.T. and arranged for her to be interviewed at the CAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">On cross-examination, C.T. acknowledged that six or seven months after she told her mother about the defendant touching her, she resumed going to the defendant\u2019s house to play with his children, although she said she then usually played \u201coutside away from the adults.\u201d She explained that she resumed going to the defendant\u2019s house \u201cbecause everybody had convinced me that I was overexaggerating about it, it never happened, and it wasn\u2019t the way it was meant to be, so I went back . . . because they were my friends.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">C.T.\u2019s mother testified that her daughter had told her about being touched by the defendant, that she brought C.T. to the Raymond police station, that she later brought her to be interviewed in February 1999, and that thereafter she heard nothing from the police until Labell contacted her in 2006. On cross-examination, she admitted to being aware that C.T. continued to play at the defendant\u2019s house even after C.T.\u2019s disclosure of the touchings and her February 1999 police interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Labell testified that he had extensive experience investigating crimes against children, described the CAC interview procedure, and explained that he had observed the interview of C.T. conducted at the CAC. He then testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-9\">Q. Okay. And based on that interview, did you do anything next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-10\">A. Yes, I did. Based on the interview, I obtained a warrant for the arrest of Mr. Eschenbrenner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Labell then related what the defendant told him during a post-arrest interview conducted after being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>See Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966). The defendant described C.T. as the oldest freshman at Raymond High School and \u201cnot the brightest girl.\u201d He acknowledged that C.T.\u2019s grandmother lived across the street from him, that he was aware C.T. had previously accused him of touching her, and that he knew the police had been called, although they never interviewed him. He also admitted that he played a game with C.T. called \u201cairplane,\u201d during which he would catapult the child into the air, catch her when she came down, and then tickle her from her armpits down to her inner thighs. The defendant said that it was possible he may have touched C.T.\u2019s private parts while catching her during these games, but he denied that he had ever done so intentionally. Labell described the defendant\u2019s demeanor during the interview as \u201cdefeated,\u201d and said that at one point the defendant said, \u201cI\u2019m toast. I\u2019m going to jail. My wife\u2019s dying in the hospital. I\u2019m being accused of rape and my daughters[] are going to be alone for a very long time.\u201d When Labell asked the defendant what he meant by rape, the defendant responded: \u201cI have a girl that\u2019s accusing me of touching her, a cop that believes it, what do you think.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Stowell testified that she first became involved in the investigation of C.T.\u2019s allegations in October 1998. She said that her investigation of C.T.\u2019s allegations was her first sexual assault case, that her February 1999 interview with C.T. was \u201cfairly short,\u201d and that she had never before interviewed a child alleged to be the victim of sexual assault. Stowell also said that, after the interview, she submitted her report and the interview tape, but did not speak to anyone else or conduct further investigation. On direct examination, the prosecutor did not attempt to elicit from Stowell testimony regarding her opinion of C.T.\u2019s demeanor during the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">On cross-examination, Stowell said she believed that the initial referral of the case to the police came from the New Hampshire Division for Children, Youth and Families (DCYF). She also testified that, after being assigned the matter, she made several attempts to contact C.T. and her mother, but was unsuccessful in doing so until February 1999, when she arranged for an interview with C.T. and her mother at the police station. Stowell said that there was no indication that C.T. or her mother had attempted to return to the police during the four-month period from October 1998 to February 1999, or that DCYF had conducted any follow-up investigation during this period. In addition, Stowell testified that, during the interview, C.T. appeared \u201ccarefree\u201d and not emotionally upset about the events she was describing.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">On redirect examination, without objection, Stowell gave the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Q. You were asked about [C.T.\u2019s] demeanor during [the February-1999] interview?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">Q. And at the time had you had any specific training regarding investigating sexual abuse cases involving children?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">A. I had not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-8\">Q. And subsequent to this, now, have you had training-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEh\">A. Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-9\">Q. \u2014 in dealing with this kind of \u2014 and would you draw the same conclusion today that you did then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-10\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-11\">Q. Why not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-12\">A. Because I\u2019ve learned from some of the training I\u2019ve received specifically involving sexual assault and children as the victims in that, they typically tend to be disassociated from the events that occurred. It\u2019s almost a self defense mechanism to protect themselves from it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-13\">Q. So it wouldn\u2019t be unusual for a child to not be emotionally upset by disclosing these details?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-14\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-15\">Q. And have you seen that in your experience since that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-16\">A. Since then, yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-17\">Q. And this was your first interview of a child?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-18\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-19\">Q. Would you characterize your conclusion as a mistake?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-20\">A. Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-21\">On recross, defense counsel elicited from Stowell that if she had concerns about her inexperience at the time of the interview, she could have sought assistance from another police officer or a supervisor. Stowell also acknowledged that, following the interview of C.T., she submitted a report for review by a supervisory officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-22\">In closing argument, defense counsel began by saying: \u2018You heard my partner start this morning out by telling you that you were going to hear a story____Now you\u2019ve heard the story and this story doesn\u2019t make sense. And let me tell you why the story doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d Counsel then pointed to the four-month delay between C.T.\u2019s disclosure in October 1998 and the first police interview by Stowell in February 1999, arguing that C.T.\u2019s mother and grandmother could have been calling the police daily if they were concerned about hastening the investigation. He described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Stowell\u2019s testimony about C.T.\u2019s \u201ccalm, cool, collected\u201d demeanor during the interview and stressed that the authorities took no action after the interview. He dismissed Stowell\u2019s explanation on redirect that she lacked experience, and noted that Stowell\u2019s report had been submitted to her superiors, yet still no action was taken. Counsel added that, in the years between 1999 and 2006, C.T. and her mother made \u201cnot so much as a phone call ... to the Raymond Police Department.\u201d He also emphasized that, despite her testimony about being scared, C.T. continued to visit the defendant\u2019s house after 1999. Summarizing these points, counsel argued, \u201cif there was a sexual assault... [the investigation] would have been done six years ago.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The prosecutor responded in her closing by asserting, \u201c[I]t\u2019s not [C.T.\u2019s] fault that it took eight years\u201d to investigate the defendant. As to C.T.\u2019s unemotional demeanor during the 1999 interview, the prosecutor reminded the jury of Stowell\u2019s testimony that such a reaction by a child sexual assault victim was not unusual, and argued that C.T. had \u201cno motive to make this up.\u201d The prosecutor concluded by asking the jury to recall Stowell\u2019s testimony that her decision not to pursue the case in 1999 was a mistake, and urging the jury not to \u201cmake that same mistake today.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The defendant was convicted of all three counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault, and, on direct appeal, we affirmed his convictions in an unpublished order, see <em>State v. Eschenbrenner, </em>No. 2008-249 (N.H. Feb. 4, 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">In January 2011, the defendant moved for a new trial, arguing that his trial attorneys afforded him ineffective assistance of counsel. Following a hearing at which only the defendant\u2019s lead trial counsel testified, the superior court granted the defendant\u2019s motion. The court concluded that a reasonably competent attorney would have objected to: (1) Labell\u2019s testimony in which, after explaining his training and experience in child abuse cases, he stated that he had observed C.T.\u2019s interview at the CAC and thereafter obtained an arrest warrant for the defendant; and (2) Stowell\u2019s testimony that, based upon the training she had received since her 1999 interview with C.T., she believed that her conclusion in 1999 not to pursue the investigation was a mistake. The court determined that the testimony in question was expert testimony that the State had not disclosed to the defense before trial, and that both Labell and Stowell had improperly conveyed to the jury that they believed C.T.\u2019s allegations. The court found that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object most likely came from insufficient preparation, was not part of trial strategy, and caused the defendant actual prejudice. After the court denied the State\u2019s motion for reconsideration, this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>On appeal, the State argues that the defendant\u2019s trial attorneys were not constitutionally ineffective for failing to object to the disputed testimony of Labell and Stowell. Specifically, the State contends that an objection to Labell\u2019s testimony would have been futile because it merely provided context necessary for the jury to understand how Labell came to interview the defendant and obtain his statements. As to Stowell\u2019s testimony on redirect examination, the State contends that an objection also would have been unsuccessful because it was admissible under the doctrine of specific contradiction. Further, the State argues that Stowell\u2019s redirect examination testimony did not cause the defendant actual prejudice because no reasonable probability exists that the outcome of the trial would have been different had the trial court excluded this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">The State and Federal Constitutions guarantee a criminal defendant reasonably competent assistance of counsel. N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 15; U.S. CONST, amend. VI; <em>see State v. Kepple, </em>155 N.H. 267, 269 (2007). \u201cTo demonstrate a violation of this right, the defendant must show that his trial counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\u201d <em>State v. Fecteau, </em>140 N.H. 498, 500 (1995) (quotation omitted). We examine the constitutional competency of counsel\u2019s performance under the State Constitution, and rely upon federal case law to aid in our analysis. <em>State v. Whittaker, </em>158 N.H. 762, 768 (2009). \u201cBecause the standard for determining whether a defendant has received ineffective assistance of counsel is the same under both constitutions, necessarily, we reach the same result under the Federal Constitution as we do under the State Constitution.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">To assert a successful claim for ineffective assistance of counsel under the State Constitution, a defendant must show, first, that counsel\u2019s representation was constitutionally deficient and, second, that counsel\u2019s deficient performance actually prejudiced the outcome of the case. <em>State v. McGurk, </em>157 N.H. 765, 769 (2008). To satisfy the first prong, the defendant must show that counsel made such egregious errors that he or she failed to function as the counsel guaranteed by the State Constitution. <em>Id. </em>We afford broad discretion to trial counsel when determining a trial strategy, <em>id., </em>and we \u201cindulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>State v. Hall, </em>160 N.H. 581, 584-85 (2010) (quotation omitted). To satisfy the second prong, the defendant must demonstrate actual prejudice by showing that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different had competent legal representation been provided. <em>McGurk, </em>157 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>N.H. at 769. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">When we determine that a defendant has failed to meet either prong of the test, we need not consider the other one. <em>Kepple, </em>155 N.H. at 270. Both the performance and prejudice prongs of the ineffectiveness inquiry are mixed questions of law and fact. <em>Hall, </em>160 N.H. at 585. Therefore, we will not disturb the trial court\u2019s factual findings unless they are not supported by the evidence or are erroneous as a matter of law, and we review the ultimate determination of whether each prong is met <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">We first address the issues regarding Stowell\u2019s testimony and then consider the impact of Labell\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">The trial court ruled that the defendant\u2019s attorneys should have objected to Stowell\u2019s redirect testimony because the State had not disclosed her as an expert witness and because the testimony conveyed to the jury that she believed C.T. We disagree with the trial court on both points.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">First, assuming, without deciding, that Stowell provided expert testimony, we conclude that any objection to it on the basis that the State had not disclosed her as an expert witness would not have been successful. The record reveals that the prosecutor did not elicit any expert testimony from Stowell during her direct examination. Not until after the defendant\u2019s attorneys cross-examined Stowell about C.T.\u2019s carefree and unemotional demeanor during the February 1999 interview did she discuss on redirect examination the post-interview knowledge she had acquired about the disassociative behavioral characteristics of child victims of sexual abuse, and express the view that, in retrospect, she had reached a mistaken conclusion in not pursuing the investigation. It is important to emphasize that the defendant makes no claim that his trial counsel were ineffective in choosing to pursue the aforesaid line of cross-examination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indeed, doing so was obviously crucial to the defense\u2019s effort to establish that C.T.\u2019s allegations were not credible; and defense counsel readily acknowledged in his testimony at the new trial motion hearing that the defense team, including the defendant, was aware that such cross-examination would open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>the door \u201cto that type of redirect\u201d the State elicited from Stowell.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The policy underlying expert witness disclosure requirements is to prevent unfair surprise, <em>see Gulf Ins. Co. v. AMSCO, </em>153 N.H. 28, 33 (2005), not to thwart fair rebuttal of issues raised during cross-examination. <em>See O\u2019Donnell v. Moose Hill Orchards, </em>140 N.H. 601, 604 (1996) (trial court did not err as a matter of law when it ruled that a party\u2019s failure to disclose an expert witness did not bar witness\u2019s testimony where opposing party was prepared for such testimony); <em>Miller v. State, </em>28 A.3d 675, 686 (Md. 2011) (upholding trial court\u2019s decision to allow expert\u2019s testimony on redirect examination over a discovery objection because questioning on cross-examination opened the door to such testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Second, we are not persuaded that the defendant\u2019s attorneys could have successfully objected to Stowell\u2019s redirect examination testimony on the basis that it conveyed to the jury that she believed C.T. Assuming, without deciding, that Stowell\u2019s testimony at least implied that she believed C.T., we conclude that any objection on this ground would have been unavailing. On cross-examination of Stowell, the defendant\u2019s attorneys elicited testimony that C.T. appeared carefree and unemotional during her February 1999 interview, and emphasized that Stowell discontinued her investigation after the interview. The clear purpose of this line of cross-examination, as defendant\u2019s trial counsel admitted, was to convey to the jury the impression that Stowell did not find C.T. credible. To rebut the misleading impression that Stowell\u2019s opinion had not changed, the State was entitled to elicit from Stowell on redirect examination that, based on her training and experience acquired subsequent to the interview, her original assessment as to the import of C.T.\u2019s demeanor and resultant conclusion not to pursue the investigation were mistaken. <em>See State v. Wamala, </em>158 N.H. 583, 589 (2009) (doctrine of specific contradiction allows introduction of otherwise inadmissible evidence to counter misleading impression created by admissible evidence introduced by opponent); <em>State v. Carlson, </em>146 N.H. 52, 56 (2001) (same). Furthermore, Stowell did not directly opine that she believed C.T. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>was telling the truth; she merely related that she had learned since her interview with C.T. that child victims of sexual assault typically exhibit disassociative behavior, and indicated how this new information persuaded her that her original conclusion not to pursue the investigation was a mistake. <em>Cf. State v. Cressey, </em>137 N.H. 402, 412 (1993) (holding that \u201cState may offer expert testimony explaining the [counterintuitive] behavioral characteristics commonly found in child abuse victims to rebut any inferences that a child victim witness is lying\u201d); <em>State v. MacRae, </em>141 N.H. 106, 110 (1996) (expert testimony that allows a jury to draw inferences that tend to bolster victim\u2019s credibility is not inadmissible because \u201c[s]o long as the expert does not render an opinion on the accuracy of the victim\u2019s recitation of facts, his or her general testimony on the dynamics of sexual abuse does not prejudice the jury\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Finally, although the defendant\u2019s trial counsel testified that he did not know that Stowell had received sexual assault training subsequent to her interview with C.T., he also testified that he and co-counsel considered the \u201cpros and cons\u201d of cross-examining Stowell and determined that proceeding with the cross-examination was important to the defendant\u2019s theory of defense, <em>ie., </em>that nobody, including Stowell and her supervisors, believed C.T.\u2019s allegations of abuse. Thus, we are satisfied that the decision to cross-examine Stowell and expose the defendant to potentially detrimental redirect examination testimony was a \u201ccalculated risk falling within the limits of reasonable practice.\u201d <em>Fecteau, </em>140 N.H. at 502 (quotation omitted) (not constitutionally deficient to open the door to defendant\u2019s prior arrest); <em>State v. Perron, </em>122 N.H. 941, 949-50 (1982) (not ineffective assistance to open the door to bad character evidence of the defendant).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We cannot say that the defendant\u2019s attorneys\u2019 performance was constitutionally deficient. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number><em>Compare State v. Thompson, </em>161 N.H. 507, 530-31 (2011) (attorney\u2019s repeated failure to object was illogical, manifestly unreasonable, and completely irrational).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Because we conclude that the defendant\u2019s attorneys\u2019 failure to object to Stowell\u2019s redirect examination testimony was not constitutionally deficient, we need not consider whether it caused the defendant actual prejudice. <em>Kepple, </em>155 N.H. at 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Turning to Labell\u2019s testimony, the State\u2019s notice of appeal does not dispute the trial court\u2019s ruling that a reasonably competent attorney would have objected to this testimony. Accordingly, the State has waived its argument that the court erred in reaching this conclusion. <em>Appeal of Keelin B., </em>162 N.H. 38, 48 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">However, in addressing the issue of prejudice, the trial court did not separately analyze the testimony of Labell and Stowell. Instead, the court found a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different if the relevant portions of both officers\u2019 testimony had been excluded from evidence. Normally, in such circumstances, a remand to the trial court would be appropriate to determine whether Labell\u2019s disputed testimony alone caused the defendant actual prejudice. Here, however, a review of the entire trial record makes it abundantly clear that there is no reasonable probability the outcome of the trial would have been different absent the challenged portion of Labell\u2019s testimony. <em>See State v. Berry, </em>148 N.H. 88, 92 (2002) (when \u201crecord reveals that a reasonable fact finder necessarily would reach a certain conclusion, we may decide th[e] issue as a matter of law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">At most, Labell only indirectly revealed that he regarded C.T. as credible. He did not inform the jury that he believed C.T., nor did he directly comment either on her allegations or on her demeanor during the CAC interview. On the contrary, the most reasonable interpretation of his testimony is that, based on C.T.\u2019s interview at the CAC and the officer\u2019s background and experience, the police had sufficient grounds to arrest and question the defendant as to his version of what occurred. <em>See Gomez v. State, </em>68 P.3d 1177, 1180-81 (Wyo. 2003) (officer\u2019s testimony that another officer radioed that there was enough evidence and that the defendant could be arrested \u201cshowed only that there was sufficient evidence to warrant an arrest... [and] cannot, therefore, be accurately characterized as vouching for the truth of the victim\u2019s testimony\u201d). Such testimony is not prejudicial, and did not become so merely because Labell also testified about his background and experience and that he obtained an arrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>warrant for the defendant. <em>Compare State v. Reynolds, </em>136 N.H. 325, 328-29 (1992) (state trooper\u2019s testimony that victim\u2019s contradictory testimony should not diminish her credibility was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\"> We agree with the defendant that the issues of when and why he was arrested were irrelevant to whether he committed the sexual assaults. Indeed, the trial court specifically instructed the jury that the fact the defendant had been arrested or indicted could not be considered as evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt, and we presume that the jury followed such instructions. <em>See State v. Pepin, </em>156 N.H. 269, 279 (2007). But, as the defendant concedes,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Labell\u2019s testimony about the defendant\u2019s arrest was relevant for an independent reason \u2014 to provide context for the jury to understand how Labell came to interview the defendant and why, before doing so, he advised the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">For these reasons, and in light of all the testimony presented at trial, including C.T.\u2019s description of the assaults, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s attorneys\u2019 failure to object to Labell\u2019s testimony did not cause the defendant actual prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b568-8\">Dalianis, C.J., and Hicks, Conboy and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b564-10\"> The defendant did argue in the trial court that his counsel should have objected to Stowell being allowed to testify at all, but he conceded that this alleged error did not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel. However, the defendant never asserted below that, given the fact Stowell did testify as a witness for the State, the cross-examination of Stowell conducted by his trial counsel constituted ineffective representation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b565-6\"> In his memorandum of law, the defendant repeatedly asserts that, at trial, his counsel never accused C.T. of lying, and that the theory of defense instead was that C.T. had simply misinterpreted what were, at most, merely inadvertent touchings by the defendant that may have occurred while playing the airplane game. While we agree that defendant\u2019s trial counsel made a deliberate tactical decision not to call C.T. a liar before the jury, we do not agree that the defense theory was limited to the claim that C.T. innocently misinterpreted what had happened. Such a theory would not have accounted for C.T.\u2019s testimony that the defendant told her not to tell anyone about the touchings and that she would get in trouble if she did. Rather, the defendant\u2019s lead trial counsel clearly was correct when he testified that the defense asked the jury to conclude that C.T.\u2019s \u201cstory\u201d was a lie which no one, including Officer Stowell, C.T.\u2019s mother, and C.T. herself believed to be trae, as evidenced by the facts that (1) for seven years no one thought the investigation worth pursuing, and (2) even after she reported the touchings to the police, C.T. continued to go to the defendant\u2019s house to play.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b566-6\"> The defendant argues that the trial court made factual findings: (1) that the \u201ctrial strategy\u201d explanation offered by defendant\u2019s lead trial counsel as the reason for not objecting to Stowell\u2019s redirect testimony was not credible; and (2) that the \u201cfailure to object... most likely came from insufficient preparation.\u201d He contends that we are bound by these findings. The problem with this argument is that these findings were premised entirely on the trial court\u2019s <em>legal conclusion </em>that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel could have successfully objected to Stowell\u2019s redirect testimony. As explained in the text, that conclusion was erroneous, and the court\u2019s reliance on it completely undercut the basis of its factual findings on the above points.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Moreover, while we readily agree with the defendant that credibility determinations fall within the province of the trial court, <em>see State v. Ayer, </em>154 N.H. 500, 519 (2006), the fact remains that it was the defendant\u2019s burden to establish that his trial counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient. The trial court did not find that trial counsel were ineffective because of the nature of them cross-examination of Stowell; the court faulted counsel only for failing to object to Stowell\u2019s redirect examination. Even if we entirely discount trial counsel\u2019s testimony as to his trial strategy explanation, the record is devoid of evidence showing how any amount of further preparation by trial counsel would have permitted the defendant to successfully exclude Stowell\u2019s redirect testimony given the theory of defense presented at trial and the cross-examination of Stowell pursued in support of that theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b568-18\"> The defendant agrees that it would have been proper for the State to ask Labell if he interviewed the defendant and whether the defendant was under arrest at the time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
