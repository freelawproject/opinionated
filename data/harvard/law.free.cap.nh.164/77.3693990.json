On appeal he contends that the Superior Court <em>(Nicolosi, </em>J.) erred in denying his motion to dismiss one of the charges for insufficiency of the evidence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">RSA 632-A:3, III provides that a person is guilty of felonious sexual assault if such person \u201c[ejngages in sexual contact with a person other than his legal spouse who is under 13 years of age.\u201d The defendant challenges his conviction on the indictment alleging that he \u201cengaged in sexual contact with [the victim]... by touching her genital area under her clothing....\u201d The defendant does not dispute that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that he touched the six-year-old victim\u2019s upper thigh between her legs in close proximity to her genitals. He argues, however, that the upper thigh between the legs is not a \u201csexual or intimate part\u201d as defined by RSA 632-A:l, TV (Supp. 2011). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">RSA 632-A:l, IV defines \u201csexual contact\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-12\">the intentional touching whether directly, through clothing, or otherwise, of the victim\u2019s or actor\u2019s sexual or intimate parts, including emissions, tongue, anus, breasts, and buttocks. Sexual contact includes only that aforementioned conduct which can be reasonably construed as being for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">Several features of this statute lead us to reject the defendant\u2019s argument. First, unlike the act proscribed for commission of the more serious offense of aggravated felonious sexual assault without penetration, <em>see </em>RSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>632-A:2, II (2007), sexual contact in violation of the felonious sexual assault statute is not limited to touching of the \u201cgenitalia.\u201d <em>Compare </em>RSA 632-A:2, II, <em>with </em>RSA 632-A:3, III <em>and </em>RSA 632-A:l, IV; <em>see </em>WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD New International Dictionary 946 (unabridged ed. 2002) (\u201cgenitalia\u201d means \u201cthe organs of the reproductive system; <em>esp: </em>the external genital organs\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\"> Second, although the word \u201cintimate\u201d can have a directly sexual connotation, <em>see </em>WEBSTER\u2019S, <em>supra </em>at 1184 (definition of \u201cintimate\u201d includes \u201cengaged in or marked by sexual relations\u201d), construing it in this fashion would make it duplicative of the word \u201csexual,\u201d thus suggesting that the legislature intended no differentiation between \u201csexual parts\u201d and \u201cintimate parts.\u201d Such a construction runs afoul of the well-recognized principles of statutory construction that all words of a statute are to be given effect, that the legislature is presumed not to use words that are superfluous or redundant, and that when the legislature uses two different words, it generally means two different things. <em>Fischer v. Hooper, </em>143 N.H. 585, 588 (1999); <em>see State v. Gingras, </em>162 N.H. 633, 639 (2011). Giving effect to these principles, we conclude that the legislature intended \u201cintimate parts,\u201d as distinguished from \u201csexual parts,\u201d to mean parts of the body that are deeply personal and usually kept private and discreet. <em>See </em>WEBSTER\u2019S, <em>supra </em>(\u201cintimate\u201d also can mean \u201cof, relating to, or befitting deeply personal.. . matters or matters usu[ally] kept private or discreet\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Finally, the statute\u2019s specific listing of parts of the body that are not part of the reproductive system <em>(e.g., </em>tongue, anus, buttocks) preceded by the word \u201cincluding\u201d both confirms that \u201csexual contact\u201d is not confined to touching of the genitals and indicates that the proscribed conduct can involve touching of areas of the body beyond the specific parts enumerated, provided the areas in question are similar in character to the enumerated ones. <em>See State v. Gibson, </em>160 N.H. 445, 450 (2010); <em>Conservation Law Found, v. N.H. Wetlands Council, </em>150 N.H. 1, 5-6 (2003) (\u201cterm \u2018including\u2019 indicates that the factors listed are not exhaustive,\u201d but items covered are limited to \u201cthose of the same type as the items specifically listed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">We, therefore, conclude that an \u201cintimate part\u201d means any part of the body the touching of which, for sexual arousal or gratification, is offensive to an objectively reasonable sense of personal dignity, privacy, and modesty. Applying this standard to the facts of this case, we have no difficulty in concluding that the victim\u2019s inside upper thigh adjacent to her genitals was an \u201cintimate part\u201d of her body within the meaning of that term in RSA 632-A:l, IV. <em>See Com. v. Lavigne, </em>676 N.E.2d 1170, 1173 (Mass. App. Ct. 1997) (\u201cThe \u2018inner thigh\u2019 is, under our contemporary views of personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>integrity and privacy \u2014 whether clothed or unclothed \u2014 a body part that our law views as requiring protection from improper touching.\u201d); <em>State v. Harstad, </em>218 P.3d 624, 628-29 (Wash. Ct. App. 2009) (A jury may determine that \u201cparts of the body in close proximity to the primary erogenous areas\u201d are intimate parts and that the defendant placing his hand on the victim\u2019s upper inner thigh area constituted touching an \u201cintimate part.\u201d). Accordingly, there is no basis to upset the jury\u2019s verdict on the indictment at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b104-5\">Dalianis, C.J., and HICKS and CONBOY, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
