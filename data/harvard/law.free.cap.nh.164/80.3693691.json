The court ruled that an insurance policy (the policy) issued by the defendant provides coverage for damage to the plaintiffs septic system and ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff $20,000, the agreed upon damage amount. The court also ruled that the defendant was not prejudiced by the plaintiffs failure to disclose its expert\u2019s report in a timely manner or its failure to disclose its expert\u2019s <em>curriculum vitae </em>and, accordingly, permitted the plaintiffs expert to testify at trial. The defendant argues that both rulings were error. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The following facts are derived from the record. On February 25, 2010, after a heavy rainfall, the septic system at the plaintiff\u2019s Derry facility failed. The plaintiff made a claim under the policy, but the defendant denied it, relying on certain policy exclusions. On June 23, 2010, the plaintiff petitioned the superior court for a declaration that it is entitled to coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">It is undisputed that the septic system failed due to the failure of the pump portion of the system. Both parties retained experts to determine the precise cause of the pump failure. The trial court noted that \u201ctheir general conclusions were quite similar\u201d and \u201c[t]his is not a case where the two experts were 180 degrees apart in their assessment of this loss.\u201d Ultimately, the court adopted the plaintiff\u2019s expert\u2019s theory that \u201cthe significant and highly unusual amount of rainfall on the day in question coupled with the existing melting of snow, created such a serious groundwater condition so as to cause the cement risers surrounding the pump chamber to move, thereby allowing water and other materials to enter the chamber itself and cause its failure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The plaintiff argued that it is entitled to coverage under the policy\u2019s \u201cBroad Form Water Damage\u201d (BFWD) provision, which was added to the policy through a \u201cSpecial Broadening Endorsement\u201d that \u201camendfed] coverage provided under the [policy] through new coverages and broader coverage grants.\u201d The BFWD provision first deletes two of the policy\u2019s so-called \u201cwater exclusions,\u201d which exclude coverage for damage caused by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">Water that backs up or overflows from a sewer, drain or sump; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-8\">Water under the ground surface pressing on, or flowing or seeping through:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-10\">(a) Foundations, walls, floors or paved surfaces;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-11\">(b) Basements, whether paved or not; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-12\">(c) Doors, windows or other openings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-13\">The BFWD provision then adds, to the \u201cAdditional Coverages\u201d section of the policy, coverage for damage described in language identical to those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>water exclusions. Thus, absent the BFWD provision, such damage would be excluded from coverage. The plaintiffs specific argument is that it is entitled to coverage under the BFWD provision because \u201c[t]he cause of the damage [to the pump chamber] was groundwater.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">The defendant acknowledged that the BFWD provision provides coverage for some damage that would otherwise not be covered. However, the section to which the BFWD provision was added specifically states that \u201c[a]ll policy Exclusions . . . apply.\u201d Accordingly, the defendant maintained that the damage at issue is barred by another of the policy\u2019s water exclusions that was unaffected by the BFWD provision, as well as by an \u201cearth movement exclusion.\u201d The water exclusion relied upon by the defendant excludes coverage for damage caused by \u201c[f]lood, surface water, waves, tides, tidal waves, overflow of any body of water, or their spray, all whether driven by wind or not.\u201d The earth movement exclusion excludes coverage for damage caused by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">Earth sinking (other than sinkhole collapse), rising or shifting including soil conditions which cause settling, cracking or other disarrangement of foundations or other parts of realty. Soil conditions include contraction, expansion, freezing, thawing, erosion, improperly compacted soil and the action of water under the ground surface.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The plaintiff argued, however, that these exclusions are inapplicable because the BFWD provision added by the special endorsement supersedes them. The defendant responded that the special endorsement did not alter or modify these water or earth movement exclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">In a declaratory judgment proceeding to determine the coverage of an insurance policy, the burden of proof is on the insurer. <em>Carter v. Concord Gen. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>155 N.H. 515, 517 (2007); RSA 491:22-a (2010). After considering the experts\u2019 testimony and the policy provisions, the court concluded that \u201cgiven the cause of this loss, the policy provisions are ambiguous.\u201d It explained that \u201cany ambiguity in insurance policies inures to the benefit of the policy holder,\u201d and thus ruled that the loss is covered under the policy. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Resolution of this case requires us to interpret the language of the policy, which is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. See Webster v. Acadia Ins. Co., </em>156 N.H. 317, 319 (2007). \u2018We construe the language as would a reasonable person in the position of the insured based upon a more than casual reading of the policy as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319-20. \u201cPolicy terms are construed objectively; where the terms are clear and unambiguous, we accord the language its natural and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 320. \u201cAbsent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>a statutory provision or public policy to the contrary, an insurance company is free to limit its liability through an exclusion written in clear and unambiguous policy language.\u201d <em>Philbrick v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>156 N.H. 389, 391 (2007). However, for exclusionary language to be considered clear and unambiguous, two parties cannot reasonably disagree about its meaning. <em>Id. </em>Thus, when an insurance policy\u2019s language is ambiguous and one reasonable interpretation favors coverage, we construe the policy in the insured\u2019s favor and against the insurer. <em>Progressive N. Ins. Co. v. Argonaut Ins. Co., </em>161 N.H. 778, 781 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">We must first determine whether the damage falls within an area of coverage. <em>See </em>S. PLITT ET AL., COUCH ON INSURANCE 3d \u00a7 22:2, at 22-6 (2010) (\u201cGenerally, the insuring agreement of an insurance policy should be construed before the exclusions to avoid confusion and error.\u201d). We therefore examine the cause of the damage to determine whether it falls within the coverage granted by the BFWD provision in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The trial court adopted the plaintiffs expert\u2019s damage theory. The plaintiff\u2019s expert testified that the pump chamber is a concrete box containing the pump. He explained that there were high groundwater conditions on the day in question, and, as a result, the groundwater surrounding the pump chamber created an uplifting pressure called \u201cbuoyancy force.\u201d That force exerted pressure on the bottom and sides of the pump chamber, which caused the chamber to float. In turn, concrete risers sitting atop the chamber shifted, allowing groundwater and soil to infiltrate the chamber, thereby causing the pump to fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The BFWD provision grants, in relevant part, coverage for damage caused by \u201c[w]ater under the ground surface pressing on, or flowing or seeping through ... [foundations, walls, floor[s] or paved surfaces.\u201d Given the expert testimony submitted by the plaintiff, the damage falls within the scope of this coverage \u2014 the damage was caused by \u201cwater under the ground\u201d pressing on the walls and floor of the pump chamber, a concrete box. The defendant contends that the terms \u201cwalls\u201d and \u201cfloor\u201d cannot be applied to the pump chamber because both terms \u201ccan... only reasonably be construed as applying to parts of a building, not parts of a subterranean septic system.\u201d We decline to adhere to such a narrow construction of these terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Although \u201cwalls\u201d and \u201cfloors\u201d are typically associated with buildings, we see no reason why one would not refer to the bottom of a box as its floor and the sides perpendicular thereto as its walls. These terms offer a simple, easily-understood description of the orientation of the surfaces of a box and, thus, using these terms for such a descriptive purpose is consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>with their \u201cnatural and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Webster, </em>156 N.H. at 320. Accordingly, in the first instance, the damages at issue fall within the BFWD coverage provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Next, we consider the exclusions. On appeal, the defendant relies only upon the earth movement exclusion, and we thus confine our analysis to that exclusion. The earth movement exclusion, in relevant part, excludes coverage for damage caused by the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">[S]oil conditions which cause settling, cracking or other <em>disarrangement of foundations or other parts of realty. </em>Soil conditions include contraction, expansion, freezing, thawing, erosion, improperly compacted soil and the action of <em>water under the ground surface.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">(Emphases added.) This exclusion arguably applies here. The damage to the pump chamber was caused by \u201cwater under the ground surface\u201d and the pump chamber could fairly be considered a \u201cpart of realty.\u201d This exclusion, however, directly contradicts the BFWD provision, which provides coverage for damage resulting from <em>\u201c[wjater under the ground surface </em>pressing on, or flowing or seeping through ... <em>foundations, walls, floor[s] or paved surfaces.\u201d </em>(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">This contradiction is reflected in <em>Amherst Country Club, Inc. v. Harleysville Worcester Insurance Co., </em>561 F. Supp. 2d 138 (D.N.H. 2008). In <em>Amherst Country Club, Inc., </em>the insured drained its pool for annual spring cleaning, and, due to high groundwater conditions, the pool floated up and out of the ground. <em>Id. </em>at 141-42. This caused the pool to crack and break, leading to its ultimate destruction. <em>Id. </em>The insured\u2019s policy was nearly identical to the one at issue here, except that the insured had not purchased BFWD coverage and thus the water exclusions remained fully in effect. <em>See id. </em>at 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">The court focused its inquiry on the earth movement exclusion discussed above and the water exclusion that excludes coverage for \u201c[w]ater under the ground surface pressing on, or flowing or seeping through . . . [foundations, walls, floors or paved surfaces.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142-49. The court held that coverage could be excluded under either provision, <em>id. </em>at 143-49, demonstrating that these exclusions substantially overlap and that if one were designated as an area of coverage and the other remained an exclusion, they would substantially conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">Here, the special endorsement eliminated the subject water exclusion and added coverage, through its BFWD provision, for damages that otherwise would have been excluded under the subject water exclusion. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>earth movement exclusion, however, remained unaltered. Thus, the special endorsement\u2019s grant of BFWD coverage contradicts the earth movement exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">When forced to reconcile contradictory clauses in an insurance policy, \u201cwe must adopt the interpretation which most correctly reflects the reasonable expectations of the insured.\u201d <em>Commercial Union Assurance Co. v. Gilford Marina, Inc., </em>119 N.H. 788, 790 (1979). \u201cIn so doing, the test is whether the ordinary layman in the position of the insured could reasonably be expected to understand that certain exclusions qualified the policy's grants of coverage.\u201d <em>Gilford Marina, Inc., </em>119 N.H. at 790 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that a layperson could reasonably be expected to understand that even though he paid for additional coverage that covers the damage at issue, the policy would nevertheless exclude coverage for such damage because another policy provision negates the additional grant of coverage. Simply put, a reasonable layperson would not understand that the additional coverage he paid for does not actually provide such coverage. Accordingly, we uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling that the policy provides coverage for the damage to the plaintiffs septic system.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Finally, we address the defendant\u2019s claim that the court erred when it allowed the plaintiffs expert to testify. In a motion <em>in limine, </em>the defendant argued that it was prejudiced by the plaintiff\u2019s failure to timely disclose its expert\u2019s report and its failure to make disclosures required by RSA 516:29-b (2007). Thus, it argued, the plaintiff\u2019s expert should be precluded from testifying. The court disagreed and permitted the plaintiff\u2019s expert to testify. The defendant argues that this ruling was error. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">We will uphold a trial court\u2019s decision to admit evidence absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>State v. Roldan, </em>151 N.H. 283, 286 (2004). \u201cThis same standard applies to review of the trial court\u2019s decision with respect to alleged discovery violations.\u201d <em>State v. Gamester, </em>149 N.H. 475, 478 (2003). \u201cTo show that the trial court\u2019s decision is not sustainable, the defendant must demonstrate that the ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.\u201d <em>Roldan, </em>151 N.H. at 286. \u201cIn the context of a discovery violation, actual prejudice exists if the defense has been impeded to a significant degree by the nondisclosure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 287 (quotation omitted). The trial court has wide discretion in admitting or excluding expert testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">The defendant has failed to establish that it suffered actual prejudice. Although the plaintiff did not provide its expert report by the disclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>deadline set by the court, it did provide the three-page report approximately three months prior to trial. Thus, the defendant had ample time to examine the report and prepare to contest it at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">As to RSA 516:29-b, it is clear from the record that the plaintiff did not satisfy the disclosure requirements set forth therein, which, in relevant part, require disclosure of the qualifications of the witness, the compensation to be paid to the witness, and a list of prior cases in which the witness testified. It appears that, to meet these statutory requirements, the plaintiff had planned to provide its expert\u2019s <em>curriculum vitae </em>prior to trial. The defendant argues that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to do so prevented it from closely scrutinizing the expert\u2019s background. Nonetheless, we cannot conclude that, as a result, the defendant suffered actual prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Although it might have been easier to challenge the plaintiff\u2019s expert\u2019s conclusion had the required disclosures been made, that does not mean the defendant was \u201cimpeded to a significant degree by the nondisclosure.\u201d <em>Roldan, </em>151 N.H. at 287 (quotation omitted). The defendant still had ample tools at its disposal. It had the plaintiff\u2019s expert\u2019s report, and it had the plaintiff\u2019s expert\u2019s name and the organization for which he works. This information presumably could have been used to research the expert\u2019s qualifications. The defendant also had the ability to challenge the plaintiff\u2019s expert\u2019s damage theory on its merits through the testimony of its own expert. Furthermore, it does not appear that either of the experts\u2019 qualifications were significant factors in the court\u2019s conclusion; the court\u2019s order focused not on the qualifications of the experts, but rather on the reasonableness of the experts\u2019 theories, whose general conclusions, it noted, \u201cwere quite similar.\u201d Under these circumstances, therefore, we cannot conclude that the decision of the trial court to allow the plaintiff\u2019s expert to testify was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of the defendant\u2019s case. <em>See id. </em>at 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b111-8\">DALIANIS, C.J., and Hicks and LYNN, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
