The PPFC found that the petitioner failed to demonstrate that the funds at issue were lost as a result of Wyatt\u2019s embezzlement, conversion, or theft. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-13\">In <em>In re Proposed Public Protection Fund Rule, </em>142 N.H. 588 (1998), we adopted Supreme Court Rule 55(2), which directs the New Hampshire Bar Association to establish the Public Protection Fund (PPF). The PPF is \u201ca reimbursement mechanism for proven losses resulting from embezzlement, conversion, or theft of client funds by lawyers.\u201d Sup. Ct. R. 55(2). \u201c[Vjictims who have lost money or property as the result of the defalcation of the lawyer\u201d may petition the PPF for reimbursement, \u201cexplaining] specifically the defalcations which led to the losses in question.\u201d SUP. Ct. R. 55(8), (4). The PPFC may hold a hearing on the petition, at which \u201c[t]he claimant shall bear the burden of proving each element of the claim, including the amount of the claimant\u2019s loss, by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d Public Protection Fund Reg. 500.13.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The PPFC then issues a written decision explaining its reasons for approving or denying the claim. <em>Id. </em>500.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>A claim may be brought only against a lawyer who \u201chas been suspended or disbarred from practice; or . . . has died or been judged mentally incompetent before the suspension or disbarment proceedings have been commenced or concluded.\u201d Sup. Ct. R. 55(3). Additionally, a claim \u201cmust be submitted within three years of the time when the victim discovered or first reasonably should have discovered the defalcations and the resulting losses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Recovery on a claim is now capped at $250,000, Sup. CT. R. 55(4), although when Stacy filed his claim with the PPFC, the cap was $150,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The underlying facts are set forth in large part in <em>Wyatt\u2019s Case, </em>159 N.H. 285 (2009). Beginning in the spring of 1998, Wyatt <em>served </em>as personal counsel to the petitioner. <em>Wyatt\u2019s Case, </em>159 N.H. at 289. In 2001, the petitioner sought a voluntary conservatorship for himself and the appointment of Michel Brault as his conservator. <em>Id. </em>at 290. Wyatt counseled the petitioner throughout this process. <em>Id. </em>The Carroll County Probate Court approved the petition and appointed Brault as conservator. <em>Id. </em>Brault, acting on the petitioner\u2019s behalf, entered into four agreements for legal services with Wyatt\u2019s firm, Wyatt &amp; Theroux, PC. Brault signed one of the agreements pursuant to a power of attorney granted by the petitioner; this agreement pre-dated Brault\u2019s appointment as conservator. Brault signed the remaining three agreements as conservator.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">On March 18, 2003, Brault. resigned as conservator, <em>id. </em>at 305, and, eventually, the probate court appointed the petitioner\u2019s sister, Deborah Stacy, in his place. <em>Id. </em>at 296. In May 2003, Ms. Stacy filed a professional conduct complaint against Wyatt for having a conflict of interest when simultaneously representing the conservatorship estate and the petitioner. <em>Id. </em>at 296-97. As a result, the attorney discipline office charged Wyatt with violating New Hampshire Rules of Professional Conduct 1.7 (amended 2007), 1.9 (amended 2007), and 8.4(a). <em>Id. </em>at 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">Ms. Stacy also objected to the inventory and accounts that Brault filed with the probate court on behalf of the conservatorship in June 2002 and May 2003. On July 13, 2005, the probate court found that \u201cBrault breached his fiduciary obligations in numerous ways, to varying degrees, during his management of [the petitioner\u2019s conservatorship] estate.\u201d The probate court found that, among other breaches, Brault wasted estate assets on Wyatt\u2019s legal fees \u201cwhen it was clear that Wyatt was in a clear conflict of interest position\u201d and the petitioner had objected to Wyatt\u2019s continued representation of the conservatorship estate. The probate court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-9\">Consequently, payments for administrative support by Wyatt and attorney fees and costs paid to Wyatt were not proper expenses of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>the conservatorship estate and must be reimbursed to the estate by Brault. Payment of attorney fees to Wyatt out of the conservatorship estate . . . were a waste and misapplication of conservatorship assets____As conservator, Brault had a fiduciary duty to see to the proper application of [the petitioner\u2019s] resources .... Brault failed miserably in this regard and should reimburse the conservatorship estate for those failures, <em>except to the extent, if any, Wyatt reimburses the conservatorship estate for fees and costs disallowed to him, </em>as hereinafter stated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-7\">Because of Wyatt\u2019s inherent conflict of interest..., the <em>[In re Estate of McCool, </em>131 N.H. 340 (1988)] decision . . . essentially instructs this Court to disallow all fees and costs incurred and paid to Wyatt----[The petitioner] identifies the total amount for all fees paid to Donald Wyatt... as being $175,012.82. . . . [The petitioner] identifies the total amount of administrative support fees and costs paid to Wyatt... at $16,071.00. While the Court has not tried to add up all the various separate amounts of fees, legal and administrative, as well as all costs shown in various amounts in the multiple exhibits presented in relation to [the] question of Wyatt\u2019s fees, the Court will accept the representation being made by the requests and supporting exhibits as being reasonably accurate and supported by the evidence presented overall, as well as reasonable inferences to be derived therefrom. Therefore, <em>Donald Wyatt is ordered to reimburse the conservatorship estate for all fees and costs paid to him, in the amount of $175,012.82, and administrative support fees and costs in the amount of $16,071.00.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">(Quotation omitted; emphasis added.) The probate court ordered Wyatt to repay $191,083.82 to the estate and, in case of Wyatt\u2019s nonpayment, directed Brault to make the payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">Significantly, although he was ordered to reimburse the conservatorship estate for all fees and costs paid to him, Wyatt was not a party to the proceedings before the probate court. <em>See In re Wyatt, </em>368 B.R. 99, 101 (Bankr. D.N.H. 2007). Additionally, Wyatt was involved in bankruptcy proceedings at the time. <em>Id. </em>The petitioner filed a claim against Wyatt in those proceedings, but the bankruptcy court disallowed it because the petitioner failed to appear at a hearing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b733-12\">On November 2, 2005, the petitioner submitted a claim to the PPFC, setting forth $191,083.82 as \u201cthe total amount of the actual theft\u201d and describing the manner of the loss by referring to the probate court order. The petitioner stated that he first discovered \u201closses from Wyatt\u2019s actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>by order of the Carroll County Probate Court dated July 13,2005.\u201d Because Supreme Court Rule 55(4) provides that a claim may be brought only against a lawyer who has been suspended or disbarred, the PPFC held the petitioner\u2019s claim in abeyance pending the resolution of Wyatt\u2019s disciplinary action.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">In September 2005, shortly before he filed his claim with the PPFC, the petitioner brought suit against Brault\u2019s probate bond insurance company, eventually settling for $275,000 of the $400,000 bond. The release that the petitioner signed on May 19,2006 provided: \u201cthis release includes all claims for attorneys fees and other legal expense or cost, interest, . . . and all claims described in the order of the Carroll County Probate Court (Patten, J.) of July 13, 2005.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">In September 2009, disciplinary proceedings against Wyatt, concluded. <em>See Wyatt\u2019s Case, 159 </em>N.H. at 309. We found that Wyatt operated under a conflict of interest when he simultaneously represented the conservatorship estate and the petitioner, and that the petitioner\u2019s interests were materially adverse <em>to </em>Brault\u2019s interests as conservator. <em>Id. at </em>305. Wyatt was suspended from the practice of law for a period of two years for the \u201ccontinuous and knowing violations of his duties of loyalty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309. \u201cIn violating Conduct Rules 1.7(a) and 1.9, [Wyatt] undertook and persisted in representations which he knew or should have known were improper. Other attorneys twice pointed out the conflicts of interest.\u201d <em>Id. at </em>308.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">We did not disbar Wyatt because he did not \u201cact pursuant to some selfish or improper motive.\u201d <em>Id. at </em>309. \u2018While [Wyatt] improperly favored Brault\u2019s and [the petitioner\u2019s wife\u2019s] interests, the reasonableness of [his] fear for [the petitioner\u2019s] welfare was never questioned in these proceedings and mitigates much, though not all, of his misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Unlike the probate court, we did not direct Wyatt to forfeit the fees he had collected from the petitioner and the conservatorship estate. The Professional Conduct Committee (PCC), which prosecuted the disciplinary action, had waived the argument that Wyatt violated Conduct Rule 1.5(a) by charging illegal fees while operating under a conflict of interest. <em>Id. </em>at 305-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">After Wyatt\u2019s suspension, the PPFC brought forward the petitioner\u2019s claim and scheduled a hearing on the merits for August 26, 2010. Prior to the hearing, the PPFC requested additional information, including whether a claim had been made against the $400,000 surety bond. The petitioner responded that he settled with the bond carrier for $275,000. The PPFC then cancelled the August 2010 hearing; it directed the petitioner \u201cto show cause why his claim should not be dismissed on the grounds that he has made a full recovery of his claimed damages from a third party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">The petitioner responded that the release operated on all claims against Brault rather than Wyatt. In a further response dated September 7, 2010, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>the petitioner also raised new claims, in addition to the loss of $191,083.82 named in his original claim. These new claims related to: legal fees paid to attorneys in Texas, a car loan secured by the petitioner\u2019s automobile, proceeds from a loan issued to Wyatt, proceeds from the foreclosure sale of the petitioner\u2019s home, and a loan issued to the conservatorship estate but deposited into Wyatt\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The PPFC scheduled a hearing to address: (1) why the petitioner settled the bond for less than $400,000; (2) why the petitioner\u2019s claim should not be reduced proportionately by his settlement; and (3) whether the funds subject to the claim were paid to Wyatt as a result of Wyatt\u2019s defalcation, embezzlement, conversion, or theft. The PPFC ruled that the petitioner\u2019s new claims were untimely because he did not raise them until September 2010. <em>See </em>SUP. Ct. R. 55(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">After a hearing on May 24,2011, the PPFC ruled that it would reduce the petitioner\u2019s claim by the portion of his recovery on the bond that the probate court found to be attributable to attorney\u2019s fees. The PPFC rejected the petitioner\u2019s arguments that the probate court found that Wyatt committed conversion and/or theft when he collected fees for his representation of the petitioner, the conservatorship, and Brault, and that the PPFC was bound by these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Following a further hearing, the PPFC undertook an independent calculation of the petitioner\u2019s claim, noting that the probate court accepted the parties\u2019 representations without reviewing them. The PPFC concluded that the petitioner had proved only $173,849.73 in attorney\u2019s fees and expenses paid to Wyatt during the period at issue in his claim. The PPFC offset that amount by $36,481.00 representing the proportion of the petitioner\u2019s recovery on the probate bond attributable to Wyatt\u2019s fees and expenses,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> resulting in a net claim of $137,368.73.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>The PPFC then addressed whether the petitioner\u2019s claim arose from Wyatt\u2019s theft or conversion of client funds.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It found that the petitioner failed to carry his burden on this issue. As to theft, the PPFC found that the evidence did not establish that Wyatt acted with the intent to steal when he received funds from the conservatorship estate in payment of his legal fees and expenses. With respect to conversion, the PPFC concluded that, because the funds were paid to Wyatt with the permission of the conservator, Wyatt did not act with the intent required for conversion since he did not know to a substantial certainty that his actions \u201cwould wrongfully deprive the one entitled to possession of the funds of possession.\u201d In addition, it found no conversion in Wyatt\u2019s failure to return the funds after we upheld the PCC\u2019s \u201cdetermination that he had a conflict of interest because that determination came more than seven years after the last legal fees at issue were paid to [him] and six years after he filed for bankruptcy, after presumably spending the legal fees he received.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The standard of review applicable to a decision of the PPFC is an issue of first impression. Supreme Court Rule <em>55(5) </em>provides: \u201cDecisions of the [PPFC] as to whether or not to pay claims and the amount of payments shall be within the [PPFC\u2019s] discretion ... and will be reviewable <em>only </em>for unsustainable exercise of discretion.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In the context of awarding attorney\u2019s fees, we have described the unsustainable exercise of discretion standard as follows: \u201cTo be reversible on appeal, the discretion must have been exercised for reasons clearly untenable or to an extent clearly unreasonable to the prejudice of the objecting party. If there is some support in the record for the trial court\u2019s determination, we will uphold it.\u201d <em>LaMontagne Builders v. Brooks, </em>154 N.H. 252, 259 (2006) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">On appeal, the petitioner argues that the PPFC erred in finding that Wyatt had not committed theft or conversion when he collected and retained fees while knowing about the conflict of interest involved in his joint representation of the conservator and beneficiary of the conservatorship estate. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">The PPF \u201cprovides] some measure of reimbursement to victims who have lost money or property caused by the defalcation of lawyers.\u201d SUP. CT. R. 55(1). Reimbursement for defalcation requires \u201cproven losses resulting from embezzlement, conversion, or theft of client funds by lawyers.\u201d SUP. Ct. R. 55(2). The rule does not define the terms \u201cembezzlement,\u201d \u201cconver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>sion,\u201d or \u201ctheft.\u201d Supreme Court Rule 55 is consistent with the ABA Model Rules for Lawyer\u2019s Funds for Client Protection (ABA Model Rules), pursuant to which public protection funds generally \u201creimburs[e] losses caused by the dishonest conduct of lawyers.\u201d ABA Model Rule 1. \u201c \u2018[Dishonest conduct\u2019 means wrongful acts committed by a lawyer <em>in the nature of </em>theft or embezzlement of money or the wrongful taking or conversion of money, property, or other things of value ...\u201d ABA Model Rule 10 (emphasis added). Thus, the focus of our rule is upon dishonest takings by lawyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Next, we consider the type of dishonesty contemplated by Supreme Court Rule 55. Given that the defalcating attorney must be suspended or disbarred before the client can obtain reimbursement, Sup. Ct. R. 55(4), we consider the type of dishonest conduct that may warrant suspension or disbarment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">An attorney may be disbarred or suspended under the disciplinary rule prohibiting an attorney from engaging in illegal conduct <em>involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation where the attorney converts or wrongfully retains, misappropriates, or misapplies </em>money or property received in his or her professional capacity. Continuing public confidence in the judicial system and the bar requires that the strictest attorney discipline be imposed in misappropriation cases and no circumstances ever justify the deliberate misappropriation of client\u2019s funds for a lawyer\u2019s personal benefit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">7 Am.

The STANDARDS also distinguish between conversion and failure to avoid a conflict of interest. <em>See </em>STANDARDS, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 4.31, at 31. We found that Wyatt had engaged in the latter, not the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Our case law is consistent with the policy of sanctioning most harshly \u201cillegal conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation where the attorney converts or wrongfully retains, misappropriates, or misapplies\u201d client funds. 7 Am. JUR. 2d <em>Attorneys at Law </em>\u00a7 63, at 131; <em>see, e.g., Richmond\u2019s Case, </em>153 N.H. 729, 745 (2006) (disbarring an attorney, as recommended by the STANDARDS, <em>supra \u00a7 </em>4.11, for knowingly converting client property and causing or potentially causing injury to the client when the attorney knowingly made transactions out of the client\u2019s brokerage accounts, against the client\u2019s express instructions, for the attorney\u2019s own benefit, and to the client\u2019s detriment); <em>Doherty\u2019s Case, </em>142 N.H. 446,451-52 (1997) (suspending an attorney for commingling and converting client funds by expending the funds before having earned them, disobeying four court orders to disgorge the funds, and placing his own financial difficulties above the needs of his clients, thus \u201cseriously calling into question the absence of a selfish motive\u201d); <em>cf. Coddington\u2019s Case, </em>155 N.H. at 70-71 (suspending an attorney for commingling rather than knowingly converting client funds where, among other mitigating factors, \u201cthere was no evidence that the [attorney had a dishonest motive\u201d]); <em>Douglas\u2019 Case, </em>147 N.H. 538, 545 (2002) (suspending an attorney for improperly withdrawing client funds and applying them to her fees where the attorney \u201cdid not make any intentional misrepresentations and ... her violations of the rules stemmed from her erroneous belief that she was authorized to withdraw the escrowed funds\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">The petitioner relies upon <em>Douglas\u2019 Case, </em>156 N.H. 613 (2007), arguing that it stands for the proposition that \u201capplying client funds to the payment of legal bills without permission is an act of conversion.\u201d In <em>Douglas\u2019 Case, </em>we disbarred an attorney for violating several rules of professional conduct, including Rule 1.15(c), which requires an attorney to segregate client property during a dispute with a client over that property,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Rule 8.4(c), which prohibits an attorney from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>fraud, deceit or misrepresentation. <em>Douglas\u2019 Case, </em>156 N.H. at 619-20. Petitioner cites the following passage from that case as supporting his position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\">The duty to safeguard property means that a lawyer may not use a client\u2019s or third party\u2019s funds for his own or his law firm\u2019s purposes. Such misuse is conversion. Conversion in the extreme sense occurs when a lawyer intentionally takes or uses client funds for his own or the law firm\u2019s use. Applying client funds to the client\u2019s bill without permission is an example of conversion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 619 (quotations, citations, and brackets omitted). But the attorney conduct at issue in <em>Douglas\u2019 Case </em>is qualitatively different from Wyatt\u2019s conduct here.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">First, the attorney in <em>Douglas\u2019 Case </em>failed to segregate client funds; despite a disagreement with the client as to whether the funds should be applied to the bill, the attorney withdrew them from her trust account, converted them into cash and then into Traveler\u2019s Checks, and put them into a safe. <em>Id. </em>at 617-18. Second, she misrepresented to the client the whereabouts of the funds. <em>Id. </em>at 620. Third, the attorney had a selfish motive. <em>Id. </em>at 628. We adopted the judicial referee\u2019s finding that the attorney engaged in knowing conversion and disbarred her, as recommended by the STANDAKDS, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 4.11, at 28.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-8\">The referee concluded that the [attorney] knowingly violated the duty to preserve her client\u2019s property, the duty to be candid and the duty to maintain personal integrity, and that her conduct caused injury or potential injury to [the client]. As the referee found, \u201cthe [attorney] knowingly converted [the client\u2019s] property when she withdrew the $49,000 from her trust account, without [the client\u2019s] knowledge or permission, and applied it to her fees.\u201d Accordingly, disbarment is the proper sanction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">Although we have sometimes suspended attorneys for conduct falling short of knowing dishonesty, based upon the above authorities, as well as the underlying purpose of the PPF, we conclude that, to obtain reimbursement from the PPF, a claimant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the losses resulted from an attorney\u2019s knowingly dishonest conduct. Public Protection Fund Reg. 500.13; <em>cf. O\u2019Meyer v. Idaho State Bar, </em>67 P.3d 82, 84 (Idaho 2003) (\u201c[R]ecovery from [Client Security Fund] was not intended to be a substitute for a malpractice action. Reimbursement from the fund is limited to loss caused by a lawyer\u2019s dishonest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>conduct.\u201d (quotation omitted)). The findings contained in <em>Wyatt\u2019s Case </em>and in the probate court\u2019s order fall short of such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Here, although Wyatt\u2019s submission of his legal bills evidences his intent to obtain payment from the petitioner and the conservatorship estate, Wyatt\u2019s conduct does not amount to a defalcation. The record supports the PPFC\u2019s finding that Wyatt sought and collected the fees and expenses under the honest, albeit erroneous, belief that he had a valid claim to them as compensation for the services he rendered. In fact, the petitioner did not contend before the PPFC, nor does he argue on appeal, that Wyatt\u2019s fees were unearned or unreasonable. Even granting that Wyatt acted with knowledge of his conflicted representation of both petitioner and Brault, as we found in <em>Wyatt\u2019s Case, </em>159 N.H. at 307, knowledge of a conflict of interest is not the equivalent of knowingly dishonest conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">The probate court\u2019s order that Wyatt reimburse the conservatorship estate for the fees he collected does not persuade us to the contrary. First, Wyatt was not a party to the probate proceedings against Brault. Second, the court\u2019s conclusion that Wyatt was obligated to return his fees to the petitioner was predicated upon our holding in <em>In re Estate of McCool, </em>131 N.H. at 351. In <em>McCool, </em>we held that \u201can attorney who violates our rules of professional conduct by engaging in clear conflicts of interest, of whose existence he either knew or should have known, may receive neither executor\u2019s nor legal fees for services he renders an estate.\u201d However, an attorney\u2019s obligation to return the fees based upon a conflict of interest did not compel the PPFC here to find that Wyatt\u2019s conduct involved dishonesty within the meaning of Rule 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the PPFC sustainably exercised its discretion when it denied the petitioner\u2019s claim for failing to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his losses resulted from the conversion or theft of client funds by Wyatt within the meaning of Rule 55. <em>See </em>SUP. Ct. R. 55(5); Public Protection Fund Reg. 500.13. We therefore need not address the petitioner\u2019s other arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b740-9\">Dalianis, C.J., and HICKS and CONBOY, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-14\"> <em>See </em>Regulations of the New Hampshire Bar Association PubEc Protection Fund Committee, <em>available at </em>http://www.nhbar.org/for-the-pubE&lt;YpubEc-protection-fund-committee-regulations.asp (02/07/2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b735-8\"> The PPFC explained its calculation of the offset as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-9\">The probate court surcharged a total of $999,099.00 against Mr. Brault. Included in this amount was the $191,083.82 in attorneys\u2019 fees and costs that the probate court found Attorney Wyatt should repay, but also surcharged against Mr. Brault .... [T]he Fund determined that the percentage of the total surcharge due to Attorney Wyatt\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees, 19.1%, should be the percentage by which Mr. Stacy\u2019s bond recovery would reduce his claim to the Fund. Accordingly, the Fund determined that Mr. Stacy\u2019s claim should be reduced by $36,481.00, which is the percentage of Mr. Stacy\u2019s $275,000.00 bond recovery attributable to Wyatt\u2019s conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">(Citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b736-9\"> The petitioner makes no claim that Wyatt\u2019s conduct constituted embezzlement within the meaning of Supreme Court Rule 55.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b737-9\"> Although we have not adopted the STANDARDS, we look to them for guidance. <em>Coddington\u2019s Case, </em>155 N.H. 66, 68 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b738-7\"> The requirement that an attorney segregate property that is subject to a dispute with the client now appears in Rule 1.15(g) rather than Rule 1.15(c), as it did when the events at issue in <em>Douglas\u2019 Case </em>transpired.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
