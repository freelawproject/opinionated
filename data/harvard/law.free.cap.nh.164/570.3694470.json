J.</author>\n<p id=\"all-dedup-0\">The respondent, J Four Realty, LLC (J Four), appeals an order of the 1st Circuit Court \u2014 Lancaster District Division <em>(Patten, </em>J.) finding that it violated RSA 540-A:2 and :3, II (2007) by using self-help to evict the petitioner, Mary Evans, and awarding her actual damages of $3,000 and attorney\u2019s fees and costs, see RSA 540-A-.4, IX(a) (Supp. 2012). We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-14\">The trial court found, or the record supports, the following facts. The petitioner lived for approximately five years in an apartment with two bedrooms, a kitchen, a living room, and one bathroom, which was part of a resort called \u201cNaturally New Hampshire Healthfully Yours Resort, Inc.\u201d The petitioner\u2019s apartment was adjacent to the resort\u2019s office and was not part of the hotel portion of the resort. The petitioner did not have a written lease; she resided in the apartment as a tenant at will pursuant to an informal agreement with the resort\u2019s prior owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-15\">The respondent became the owner of the resort property on January 9, 2008, having purchased it at a foreclosure sale in late 2007. Because she was unaware of the foreclosure, the petitioner continued to pay rent to the prior owner of the resort.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-16\">On August 3,2008, the respondent dispatched its agent to the petitioner\u2019s apartment to evict her. The agent arrived at the petitioner\u2019s residence with a deputy sheriff and a town police officer and told her that she had to leave her apartment with all of her property by the end of the day. The petitioner complied with the agent\u2019s demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-17\">The petitioner brought a petition against the respondent under RSA chapter 540-A, alleging that the respondent\u2019s conduct violated RSA 540-A:2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>and :3, II and seeking damages under RSA 540-A:4, IX(a). Following an evidentiary hearing, the trial court ruled in her favor, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">\u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s legal rulings <em>de novo, </em>but defer to its findings of fact if supported by the record.\u201d <em>O\u2019Hearne v. McClammer, </em>163 N.H. 430, 436 (2012) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The respondent first argues that the trial court erroneously determined that it was a \u201clandlord\u201d within the meaning of RSA chapter 540-A. Resolving this issue requires that we interpret the pertinent statutory provisions. We review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretation <em>de novo. Town of Atkinson v. Malborn Realty Trust, </em>164 N.H. 62, 67 (2012). We are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. <em>Id. </em>When examining the language of the statute, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meaning to the words used. <em>Id. </em>We interpret legislative intent from the statute as written and will not consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include. <em>Id. </em>We also interpret a statute in the context of the overall statutory scheme and not in isolation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">RSA 540-A:l, I (2007) defines a \u201c[IJandlord\u201d as \u201can <em>owner, </em>lessor or agent thereof <em>who rents or leases </em>residential premises including manufactured housing or space in a manufactured housing park to another person.\u201d (Emphases added.) The respondent contends that it does not meet this definition because, while it owned the premises, it neither rented nor leased the petitioner\u2019s apartment to her. Thus, the respondent reasons, under the plain meaning of RSA 540-A:l, I, it is not a \u201clandlord.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">The petitioner raises three arguments in response. First, relying upon Texas law, the petitioner argues that she and the respondent created a new landlord/tenant relationship by implication. <em>See Twelve Oaks Tower I v. Premier Allergy, </em>938 S.W.2d 102, 110 (Tex. App. 1996) (\u201cparties\u2019 post-foreclosure conduct, including continued possession of the premises and payment and acceptance of rent payments with full knowledge of foreclosure, created a new lease\u201d). Under Texas law, \u201c[w]hen a landlord-mortgagor is foreclosed upon, the general rule is that a tenant\u2019s lease is terminated.\u201d <em>Aspenwood Apartment Corp. v. Coinmach, Inc., </em>349 S.W.3d 621, 631 (Tex. App. 2011), <em>review granted, </em>(Tex. 2012). When this occurs, the tenant and the purchaser at a foreclosure sale may \u201cindependently enter into a new landlord-tenant relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For such a new relationship to be found to exist, \u201cboth parties must manifest consent to enter into a new lease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A tenant\u2019s mere continuation in possession does not, without more, establish a new landlord/tenant relationship. <em>See id. </em>By contrast, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>\u201clandlord\u2019s either demanding rent or accepting it constitutes an election to create a tenancy relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Thus, in <em>Twelve Oaks, </em>a new landlord/tenant relationship arose by implication when, after learning that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) had foreclosed upon the property, the tenant continued to occupy the premises and pay rent to the FDIC, which accepted it. <em>Twelve Oaks, </em>938 S.W.2d at 110. In <em>ICM Mortgage Corp. v. Jacob, </em>902 S.W.2d 527 (Tex. App. 1994), however, although the tenant \u201cclearly manifested her desire to lease the property after foreclosure,\u201d the mortgagee, \u201cthrough its repeated refusals to accept rent\u201d from her, \u201crevealed only unwavering disinterest in leasing the house to [her].\u201d <em>Jacob, </em>902 S.W.2d at 533. Although the mortgagee instructed the tenant to \u201csit tight\u201d until it obtained clear title to the property, this was \u201cinsufficient as a matter of law to give rise to a new lease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">In this case, the petitioner concedes that she never paid rent to the respondent and was never \u201cspecifically aware that [the respondent] owned her apartment.\u201d She was not even aware of the foreclosure until the day she was evicted. Nor is there any evidence that the respondent ever demanded that the petitioner pay rent. Although the respondent did not attempt to remove the petitioner for eight months after becoming the owner of the premises, during that entire time, the petitioner paid rent to the prior owner. Under these circumstances, assuming, without deciding, that our law is consistent with Texas law on this point, the petitioner\u2019s and respondent\u2019s post-foreclosure conduct did not evince their mutual consent to enter into a new landlord/tenant relationship, as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Next, the petitioner asserts that the respondent is a landlord within the meaning of RSA chapter 540-A because her tenancy at will with the prior owner predated the mortgage at issue. She entered into the informal agreement with the prior resort owner in 2003, and the prior resort owner obtained the mortgage at issue in 2006. The petitioner argues that, under these circumstances, the respondent, as the purchaser at the foreclosure sale, took the resort property subject to her tenancy at will. <em>See, e.g., </em>Restatement (Third) of Property: Mortgages \u00a7 7.1 (1997) (\u201cForeclosure does not terminate interests in the foreclosed real estate that are senior to the mortgage being foreclosed.\u201d); 55 Am. Jr. 2d <em>Mortgages </em>\u00a7 595 (2009) (\u201cThe rights of a tenant in possession of real estate, under a lease given prior to the execution of a mortgage on the same premises, are not extinguished by a foreclosure of the mortgage; the purchaser at the foreclosure sale acquires no greater interest than the mortgagor had, and becomes the landlord of the lessee.\u201d). <em>See generally </em>Annotation, <em>Effect of Foreclosure of Mortgage as Terminating Lease, </em>14 A.L.R. 664 (1921). <em>But </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number><em>see Aspenwood Apartment Corp., </em>349 S.W.3d at 631 (generally, foreclosure terminates prior lease); <em>but cf. Molla v. Sanders, </em>981 A.2d 1197, 1200-01 (D.C. 2009) (if lease with prior owner is not recorded, it \u201cis ineffective against a subsequent bona fide purchaser,\u201d including purchaser that acquired property in foreclosure sale).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The petitioner, however, had only a tenancy at will with the prior owner. \u201cA tenancy at will is an estate which simply confers a right to the possession of the premises leased for such indefinite period as both parties shall determine such possession shall continue.\u201d <em>Public Service Co. v. Voudomas, </em>84 N.H. 387, 391 (1930) (quotation omitted). \u201cThe continuance of the tenancy at will depends upon the presence of the landlord\u2019s and tenant\u2019s wills that the tenancy continue.\u201d RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF Property: Landlord &amp; Tenant \u00a7 1.6 comment <em>e </em>at 39 (1977). Thus, for instance, when either the landlord or tenant dies, the tenancy ceases \u201cunless the decedent\u2019s successor in interest and the other party agree otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIt is well settled law that a tenancy at will cannot be assigned or transferred.\u201d <em>Voudomas, </em>84 N.H. at 389; <em>see </em>RESTATEMENT (Second) of Property: Landlord &amp; Tenant, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 15.1. This is because \u201c[a] tenancy at will inherently exists only as long as both parties will its continuance. They are in a position to exercise this will only so long as they retain their original interests. Hence the tenancy at will can inherently exist only between the original parties.\u201d RESTATEMENT (SECOND) of Property: Landlord &amp; Tenant, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 15.1 comment <em>b </em>at 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Because it was only a tenancy at will, the petitioner\u2019s tenancy with the prior resort owner necessarily terminated upon foreclosure. As the trial court aptly concluded, at that point, the petitioner became the respondent\u2019s tenant at sufferance. A tenant at sufferance is not, however, in a landlord-tenant relationship. <em>See Hill v. Dobrowolski, </em>125 N.H. 572, 575 (1984). As we explained in <em>Hill\\ \u201cA </em>tenancy at sufferance has been described generally as an interest in land which exists when a person who had a possessory interest in land by virtue of an effective conveyance, wrongfully continues in the possession of the land after the termination of such interest----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574 (quotations omitted). It is not a \u201ctenancy in fact\u201d because there is no \u201cprivity between [the] landlord and tenant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">Alternatively, the petitioner asserts that her tenancy at will was not terminated by the foreclosure because she was not joined as a party to it. <em>See Flushing Sav. Bank, FSB v. 509 Rogers LLC, </em>928 N.Y.S.2d 618, 620 (Sup. Ct. 2011) (under New York law, because, by statute, tenants of a property are necessary parties to foreclosure action, failure to join them leaves their interests unaffected by foreclosure and sale). In making this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>argument, however, the petitioner relies upon cases construing the statutory schemes of states other than New Hampshire. She has not analyzed <em>our </em>statutory scheme to demonstrate that she was a necessary party to the foreclosure action under it. Nor has she addressed New Hampshire case law on this subject. <em>See Snyder v. N.H. Savings Bank, </em>134 N.H. 32, 37 (1991) (lessee whose lease has been recorded is entitled to notice of foreclosure sale). Under these circumstances, we consider her argument insufficiently developed for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The petitioner next argues that regardless of whether the respondent is a \u201clandlord,\u201d she is entitled to the protections of RSA chapter 540-A because her tenancy at sufferance followed the termination of her tenancy at will with the prior resort owner. <em>See Hill, </em>125 N.H. at 575-76 (explaining that protections of RSA chapter 540-A apply only to tenancies at sufferance that have \u201cfollowed the termination of a conventional leasehold relationship\u201d); <em>see Voudomas, </em>84 N.H. at 390 (tenancy at will is leasehold under New Hampshire law).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">In <em>Hill, </em>the plaintiff and her former husband sold a home to the defendant, and the defendant allowed the plaintiff to remain in the home for two days after the passage of title pursuant to a short lease. <em>Hill, </em>125 N.H. at 573, 576-77. When, after the second day, the plaintiff refused to leave the premises, despite the defendant\u2019s demands that she vacate it, the defendant used self-help to evict her. <em>Id. </em>at 573-74. The plaintiff sued the defendant for trespass and for violation of RSA chapter 540-A. <em>Id. </em>at 573. The defendant successfully moved to dismiss both claims, and the plaintiff appealed only the dismissal of the RSA chapter 540-A claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">On appeal, the defendant argued that RSA chapter 540-A did not apply to him because his relationship with the plaintiff was a tenancy at sufferance. <em>Id. </em>at 574. We disagreed, holding that when the tenancy at sufferance follows \u201cthe termination of a conventional leasehold relationship,\u201d RSA chapter 540-A applies. <em>Id. </em>at 575, 576. We explained that when the legislature enacted RSA chapter 540-A, it intended to \u201cremove[ ] the landlord\u2019s common law right to self-help in evicting a residential tenant whose tenancy at sufferance was preceded by a different leasehold tenancy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575. We observed that RSA 540-A:2 generally prohibits a residential landlord from attempting to \u201ccircumvent lawful procedures for eviction pursuant to RSA 540,\u201d and that RSA chapter 540 applies to tenancies at sufferance. <em>Id.; see AIMCO Props. v. Dziewisz, </em>152 N.H. 587, 589 (2005) (holding that current version of RSA chapter 540 applies to tenancies at sufferance). \u201cTherefore, when RSA 540-A:2 . . . forbids a residential landlord to attempt to circumvent the eviction procedures under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>RSA chapter 540, it is clearly forbidding landlords to use self-help to evict tenants at sufferance.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>125 N.H. at 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">We also held that because of the short two-day lease, the plaintiff\u2019s tenancy at sufferance followed the termination of \u201ca conventional leasehold relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575, 577. Likewise, because of the two-day lease, the defendant was a \u201clandlord\u201d and the plaintiff was a \u201ctenant\u201d within the meaning of RSA chapter 540-A. <em>Id. </em>at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Application of <em>Hill </em>to the instant case is problematic, however, because, although the petitioner\u2019s tenancy at sufferance followed the termination of a conventional leasehold relationship, she had the leasehold with someone <em>other </em>than the respondent. Whereas in <em>Hill </em>the plaintiff had a two-day lease with the defendant, making the defendant her \u201clandlord\u201d under RSA chapter 540-A, here, the petitioner was the tenant at will of the prior resort owner. She never entered into a leasehold relationship with the respondent. The question before us is whether this factual difference between <em>Hill </em>and the instant case compels us to reach a different result than we did in <em>Hill. </em>We conclude that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">We decline to hold that the respondent in this case is a \u201clandlord\u201d absent any evidence that it ever \u201crent[ed] or lease[d]\u201d the petitioner\u2019s apartment to her, RSA 540-A:l, I, or that it could be deemed to have done so by operation of law. Contrary to the petitioner\u2019s assertions, \u201c[t]he focus of RSA chapter 540-A... is to deter unacceptable landlord conduct rather than to remedy harm to tenants.\u201d <em>Wass v. Fuller, </em>158 N.H. 280, 283 (2009) (quotation omitted). RSA 540-A:l, I, specifically defines a \u201clandlord\u201d as one <em>\u201cwho rents or leases </em>residential premises.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We must interpret this statute as written, according to its plain meaning. <em>See Malborn Realty Trust, </em>164 N.H. at 67. Had the legislature intended damages actions under RSA chapter 540-A to be brought against those who do not \u201crent[ ] or lease[ ] residential premises,\u201d it could have so stated. <em>See First Fed. Bank, FSB v. Whitney Dev., </em>677 A.2d 1363, 1367-68 (Conn. 1996) (after foreclosure, mortgagee was \u201clandlord\u201d under statute defining \u201clandlord\u201d as \u201cthe owner of the dwelling unit\u201d (quotations and ellipses omitted)). \u201cOf course, if the legislature disagrees with our construction, it is free to amend the statute as it sees fit.\u201d Wass, 158 N.H. at 283. For all of the above reasons, therefore, we reverse the trial court\u2019s determination that the respondent was a \u201clandlord\u201d under RSA chapter 540-A.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">The respondent argues that because it was not the petitioner\u2019s \u201clandlord\u201d within the meaning of RSA chapter 540-A, it was entitled to use self-help to evict her. To the contrary, a purchaser at a foreclosure sale may <em>not </em>use self-help to evict a tenant at sufferance. <em>See Greelish v. Wood, </em>154 N.H. 521, 527 (2006); RSA 540:12 (2007) (\u201cThe owner, lessor, or purchaser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>at a mortgage foreclosure sale of any tenement or real estate may recover possession thereof from a lessee, occupant, mortgagor, or other person in possession, holding it without right, after notice in writing to quit the same as herein prescribed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Our decision in <em>Greelish </em>is dispositive. The defendant in <em>Greelish </em>had a life estate in certain residential property. <em>Greelish, </em>154 N.H. at 521. When the property was sold to the plaintiff at a foreclosure sale, the life estate was terminated. <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, although the plaintiff filed a landlord-tenant writ to establish his right to possession, he also engaged in conduct intended to force the defendant to leave. <em>Id. </em>at 521-22. Each party sued for damages. <em>Id. </em>at 522. The trial court found that the plaintiffs harassment of the defendant, whom the court found to be a tenant at sufferance, constituted \u201can attempted self-help constructive eviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). On appeal, the plaintiff argued that he was entitled to use self-help to evict the defendant because her tenancy at sufferance, unlike the tenancy at sufferance in <em>Hill, </em>arose outside of the rental or leasehold context. <em>See id. </em>at 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">After reviewing development of the common law and the statutory process for eviction, we disagreed. <em>Id. </em>at 524-27. We concluded both that \u201cthe statutory summary process in RSA chapter 540 was available to the plaintiff,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 527; <em>see </em>RSA 540:12, and that \u201cthe time when the public interest required the existence of self-help for a purchaser at a foreclosure sale to recover possession from a tenant at sufferance has passed.\u201d <em>Greelish, </em>154 N.H. at 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The respondent argues that <em>Greelish </em>is distinguishable because the statutory summary process was not available to evict the petitioner in this case. The respondent contends that it could not use the summary process in RSA chapter 540 because the petitioner\u2019s apartment was merely a hotel \u201croom,\u201d which was not rented for residential purposes. <em>See </em>RSA 540:l-a, I, II, IV(b) (2007) (defining restricted property as real property rented for \u201cresidential purposes\u201d except for \u201c[r]ooms in hotels, motels, inns, tourist homes and other dwellings rented for recreational or vacation use\u201d). This argument is unavailing. The trial court specifically found that the petitioner was a \u201cresidential tenant\u201d of the resort, who resided in a two-bedroom \u201cfull apartment.\u201d In light of these findings, which the respondent does not challenge and the record supports, we disagree with the respondent that the summary process under RSA chapter 540 was unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">In making this argument, the respondent relies upon our decision in <em>Atwood v. Owens, </em>142 N.H. 396 (1997), which is distinguishable from this case. The tenants in <em>Atwood </em>rented a tavern \u201cfor the purpose of operating a bed and breakfast.\u201d <em>Atwood, </em>142 N.H. at 397 (quotation omitted). Although they happened also to live on premises, the primary purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>the leasehold was commercial, to run the bed and breakfast; its residential component was merely \u201cincidental.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 399. Under these circumstances, we held that the statute regarding security deposits for residential premises did not apply. <em>Id. </em>at 396, 399; <em>see </em>RSA 540-A:6 (2007). In the instant case, by contrast, the <em>sole </em>purpose of the petitioner\u2019s tenancy was residential. She, unlike the tenants in <em>Atwood, </em>rented only a residential unit; she did not rent the commercial property in which the residential unit was located. Accordingly, for the reasons detailed above, we uphold the trial court\u2019s determination that the respondent was not entitled to use self-help to evict the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">At oral argument, the parties agreed that a common law theory of recovery could apply to the facts of this case. <em>See Hill, </em>125 N.H. at 573 (in addition to claiming statutory violation, tenant sued landlord for trespass); <em>Greelish, </em>154 N.H. at 521-22 (purchaser at foreclosure sale sued for harassment). However, although the petition was not included in the record on appeal, the parties have represented that the petitioner alleged only a claim under RSA chapter 540-A. Having determined that the petitioner\u2019s RSA chapter 540-A claim is not viable against the respondent, we remand so that the petitioner may seek leave to amend her writ to correct this deficiency. <em>Cf. ERG, Inc. v. Barnes, </em>137 N.H. 186, 189 (1993) (relating to pre-trial dismissal of claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; reversed in part; and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b602-6\">Conboy, Lynn and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
