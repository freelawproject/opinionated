We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-14\">This is -the fourth time this case has come before us. A detailed account of the underlying facts and procedural history can be found in our previous decisions, <em>see Carleton, LLC v. Balagur, </em>162 N.H. 501, 503-04 (2011) (citing previous cases). We recite only those facts pertinent to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-15\">In 1995, Bukk Carleton and Richard Balagur formed MTS for the purpose of purchasing land in Lebanon and operating as a real estate holding company. Originally, of the 1,000 total MTS shares, Richard Balagur owned 400, his mother, Adrienne Balagur, owned 100, and the trustee of a trust for Bukk Carleton\u2019s daughters owned 500. Carleton, LLC eventually purchased the trust\u2019s shares and, thus, became the owner of fifty percent of MTS\u2019s stock. Bukk Carleton owns all of the shares of Carleton, LLC. In May 2004, Carleton, LLC brought an action against MTS and Richard Balagur to, among other things, dissolve MTS, <em>see </em>RSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>293-A: 14.30(b) (2010). In January 2005, Adrienne Balagur successfully moved for leave to file an election to purchase shares in lieu of dissolution, pursuant to RSA 293-A:14.34 (2010). The case was consolidated with other related actions and tried to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The central issue at trial was how to value Carleton, LLC\u2019s fifty percent ownership of MTS, which Adrienne Balagur sought to acquire. Following the trial court\u2019s ruling on the value of Carleton, LLC\u2019s ownership interest, <em>see </em>RSA 293-A:14.34(d), the Balagurs moved to terminate Carleton, LLC\u2019s rights and status as a shareholder of MTS. The court granted the motion, ruling that \u201cRSA 293-A:14.34(f) requires removal of a shareholder whose shares have been valued for an elective purchase\u201d and that, thereafter, Carleton, LLC would be considered \u201ca creditor of MTS until [it] receives payment for the shares purchased.\u201d Shortly thereafter, the court granted Carleton, LLC\u2019s request for a security interest in order \u201c[t]o protect and preserve the value of the award provided to [Carleton, LLC] by the [c]ourt in granting\u201d Adrienne Balagur\u2019s election remedy. On July 26,2009, the trial court ordered \u201cthat the election to purchase [Carleton, LLC\u2019s] shares be accomplished within ninety (90) days from the date of the Clerk\u2019s notice of this order ... in one lump sum.\u201d We affirmed this ruling on May 13, 2010. <em>See Carleton, LLC v. Richard Balagur &amp; a.; Carleton, LLC v. Richard Balagur; Richard Balagur v. Bukk Carleton, </em>No. 2009-0708 (N.H. May 13, 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">On June 7, 2010, MTS filed a notice of intention to adopt articles of dissolution. <em>See </em>RSA 293-A:14.34(g). Carleton, LLC objected, asserting that the notice was not timely filed under RSA 293-A:14.34(g). <em>See Carleton, LLC, </em>162 N.H. at 504. In September 2011, we affirmed the trial court\u2019s finding that the notice of intention to adopt articles of dissolution was timely filed. <em>See id. </em>at 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Subsequently, Carleton, LLC moved to vacate and set aside the articles of dissolution filed by MTS, arguing that Adrienne Balagur\u2019s election to purchase Carleton, LLC\u2019s shares was irrevocable and that the shareholders could not validly authorize the later filed articles of dissolution. Carleton, LLC also filed a motion for an accounting of all income and expenses of MTS. It further filed a renewed motion to enforce its creditor status, arguing that \u201c[w]hile RSA 293-A: 14.34(g) addresses the <em>terms </em>of purchase, nowhere does the statute abandon the court\u2019s fair value determination.\u201d It maintained that the trial court\u2019s order on \u201cfair value\u201d and on creditor status are now the law of the case and \u201cremain unaffected by [MTS and the Balagurs\u2019] attempt to dissolve MTS.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">The trial court denied the motion; however, it agreed that an accounting should occur and ordered \u201ca full accounting of the books and records of MTS.\u201d The court further denied Carleton, LLC\u2019s renewed motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>enforce creditor status, finding \u201cthat the provisions of RSA 293-A: 14.34(g) void the provisions of RSA 293-A: 14.34(e),\u201d and that it was \u201cconstrained by the application of RSA 293-A:14.34(g).\u201d Carleton, LLC\u2019s motion to reconsider was denied, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">On appeal, Carleton, LLC contends that the trial court erred in its application of RSA 293-A:14.34 and in failing to enforce its order making Carleton, LLC a secured creditor. It also contends that corporate dissolution is an equitable proceeding and, as such, the trial court erred in failing \u201cto enforce the \u2018principles of fair play\u2019 embodied in RSA 293-A: 14.34\u201d and in failing to balance the competing interests of the parties. It further asserts that Adrienne Balagur is estopped from avoiding her election to purchase Carleton, LLC\u2019s shares of MTS. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Carleton, LLC first argues that the trial court erred in utilizing RSA 293-A:14.34(g) as a basis for denying its renewed motion to enforce creditor status. It maintains that the court\u2019s order making Carleton, LLC a secured creditor was not issued pursuant to RSA 293-A:14.34(e) and, thus, RSA 293-A:14.34(g) could not have voided the order. It further contends that the court\u2019s order establishing Carleton, LLC as a secured creditor is a final order that could not be altered or vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Resolving this issue requires us to interpret RSA 293-A-.14.34. We are the final arbiter of the legislature\u2019s intent regarding the meaning of a statute considered as a whole, and our review of the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretation is <em>de novo. Bendetson v. Killarney, Inc., </em>154 N.H. 637, 641 (2006). We first examine the language of the statute, and, where possible, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meanings to the words used. <em>Id. </em>When a statute\u2019s language is plain and unambiguous, we need not look beyond it for further indication of legislative intent, and we refuse to consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to incorporate in the statute. <em>Id. </em>Finally, we interpret a statute in the context of the overall statutory scheme and not in isolation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">RSA 293-A:14.34 governs the procedure to be followed when a corporation or other shareholders elect to purchase all of the shares of a shareholder who has petitioned for dissolution. Once an election to purchase is filed, the parties have sixty days to \u201creach [an] agreement as to the fair value and terms of purchase of the petitioner\u2019s shares,\u201d and \u201cthe court shall enter an order directing the purchase of petitioner\u2019s shares upon the terms and conditions agreed to by the parties.\u201d RSA 293-A:14.34(c). If, however, the parties fail to reach an agreement, either party may petition the court to stay the dissolution proceedings and \u201cdetermine the fair value of the petitioner\u2019s shares.\u201d RSA 293-A:14.34(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>\u201cUpon determining the fair value of the shares, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase upon such terms and conditions as the court deems appropriate ...\u201d RSA 293-A:14.34(e). Once the court enters an order under RSA 293-A: 14.34(e),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">the court shall dismiss the petition to dissolve the corporation under RSA 293-A: 14.30, and the petitioning shareholder shall no longer have any rights or status as a shareholder of the corporation, except the right to receive the amounts awarded to him by the order of the court which shall be enforceable in the same manner as any other judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">RSA 293-A: 14.34(f). RSA 293-A:14.34(g) then provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">The purchase ordered pursuant to subsection (e), shall be made within 10 days after the date the order becomes final, unless before that time the corporation files with the court a notice of its intention to adopt articles of dissolution pursuant to RSA 293-A: 14.02 and RSA 293-A: 14.03, which articles shall then be adopted and filed within 50 days thereafter. Upon filing of such articles of dissolution, the corporation shall be dissolved in accordance with the provisions of RSA 293-A: 14.05 through 293-A:14.07 and <em>the order entered pursuant to subsection (e) shall no longer be of any force or effect, </em>except that the court may award the petitioning shareholder reasonable fees and expenses in accordance with the provisions of the last sentence of subsection (e) and the petitioner may continue to pursue any claims previously asserted on behalf of the corporation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Since our election statute is nearly identical to the like provision in the Model Business Corporation Act, <em>see </em>MODEL BUS. CORP. ACT ANNOTATED \u00a7 14.34 (4th ed. 2011), \u201cwe look to the official comments of the model act for guidance on the intended meaning of the election statute.\u201d <em>Bendetson, </em>154 N.H. at 643. One comment states that, \u201c[i]n addition to the usual rights of appeal available to any party under the laws of the local jurisdiction, subsection (g) affords the alternative of voluntary dissolution after entry of an order under subsection (e).\u201d MODEL BUS. CORP. ACT ANNOTATED \u00a7 14.34 emt. 4D, at 14-172. The comment explains, in relevant part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">If the corporation elects to dissolve, the petitioning shareholder will receive his or her pro rata share of the liquidating proceeds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>distributed to shareholders without reference to the \u201cvalue\u201d of the shares as determined by the court under subsection (e). By virtue of subsection (f), the petitioning shareholder would not be entitled to vote on a proposal to adopt articles of dissolution under section 14.02. Once articles of dissolution are filed, however, subsection (g) provides that the order under subsection (e) is \u201cno longer of any force or effect.\u201d Accordingly, subsection (f) no longer applies, the petitioner resumes shareholder status and will be entitled to a pro rata share of any liquidating distribution to shareholders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 14-173.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Applying this interpretation to this case, once the articles of dissolution were filed under RSA 293-A:14.34(g), the trial court\u2019s order under RSA 293-A:14.34(e), directing the terms and conditions of the purchase of Carleton, LLC\u2019s shares, no longer had any force or effect. <em>See </em>RSA 293-A:14.34(g). Moreover, RSA 293-A: 14.34(f), providing that \u201cthe petitioning shareholder shall no longer have any rights or status as a shareholder of the corporation,\u201d no longer applied and Carleton, LLC \u201cresume[d] shareholder status and will be entitled to a pro rata share of any liquidating distribution to shareholders.\u201d Model Bus. Corp. Act Annotated \u00a7 14.34 cmt. 4D, at 14-173.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">While Carleton, LLC is correct that the trial court\u2019s order establishing it as a secured creditor of MTS was issued prior to the order dictating the terms and conditions of purchase under RSA 293-A:14.34(e), the order <em>was </em>issued in relation to, and resulting from, Adrienne Balagur\u2019s election to purchase shares in lieu of dissolution; indeed, the trial court specifically relied upon RSA 293-A: 14.34(f) as the authority for its initial order. Here, Adrienne Balagur no longer sought to acquire Carleton, LLC\u2019s shares; instead, MTS elected to dissolve pursuant to RSA 293-A:14.34(g). It follows, therefore, that the order granting creditor status to secure Carleton, LLC\u2019s payment of shares was rendered moot because, in the absence of Adrienne Balagur\u2019s election to purchase, it has no practical significance. <em>Cf. In the Matter of O\u2019Neil &amp; O\u2019Neil, </em>159 N.H. 615, 624 (2010) (concluding that the issue of whether the family division had jurisdiction to order the sale of the respondent\u2019s company was moot because the company was ultimately sold by the trustee pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court). Therefore, the trial court did not err by denying Carleton, LLC\u2019s motion to enforce creditor status.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Carleton, LLC next argues that the trial court erred when it failed to exercise its \u201cinherent equitable authority... to address the circumstances of this particular case.\u201d It contends that RSA 293-A: 14.34 does not constrain the trial court\u2019s authority to issue equitable orders in a judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>dissolution proceeding and, thus, the court should have \u201cbalance[d] the competing interests of the parties\u201d and \u201cenforce[d] the \u2018principles of fair play\u2019 embodied in RSA 293-A: 14.34 and as recognized ... in <em>Bendetson.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In <em>Bendetson, </em>we analyzed the election irrevocability provision in RSA 293-A:14.34(a) and held that, with respect to subsection (a), the legislature expressly allowed for the trial court to consider the equities in a particular case. <em>Bendetson, </em>154 N.H. at 643-45. We reasoned that the legislature\u2019s explicit reference to the court\u2019s equitable powers in both RSA 293-A: 14.34(a) and (b) indicates that it intended to empower the court to enforce principles of fair play in situations that are often rife with tension and ill-will. <em>Id. </em>at 645. We concluded that RSA 293-A:14.34(a) renders the electing party\u2019s right subject to the trial court\u2019s authority to set aside the election when \u00e9quity so requires. <em>Id. </em>at 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">An examination of the language of RSA 293-A: 14.34(g), however, requires a different conclusion. Unlike the language in RSA 293-A: 14.34(a), which expressly allows the trial court to utilize its equitable authority to set aside an election to purchase, <em>id., </em>the language in subsection (g) does not grant such authority once articles of dissolution have been filed pursuant to that subsection. On the contrary, as discussed above, the language in subsection (g), along with the comments to the Model Business Corporation Act, leaves \u201cno question that the filing of an intention to adopt articles of dissolution at that time automatically nullifies the order [under subsection (e)] and triggers the dissolution process without further order of the court.\u201d <em>Fierro v. Templeton, </em>857 So. 2d 931, 933 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2003) (analyzing nearly identical subsection in Florida\u2019s election to purchase statute). Had the legislature intended to grant the court equitable authority to set aside dissolution under subsection (g), it could have expressly done so, as it did in subsection (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">We recognize the legitimacy of the concerns associated with depriving the trial court of authority to consider the equities when voluntary dissolution is sought under subsection (g). Although many states, including New Hampshire, have modeled their election statute on the Model Business Corporation Act, there is a paucity of authority addressing the subsection at issue in this case. However, in one case, <em>Jones v. Pfaff, 77 </em>So. 3d 884 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2012), where the underlying facts were markedly similar to this case, Judge Morris of the Florida District Court of Appeals specially concurred to \u201cexpress [his] concern with the language\u201d of the similar election subsection in Florida\u2019s statute. <em>Jones, </em>77 So. 3d at 885-86 (Morris, J., concurring specially). As he observed,' the language in the subsection at issue allows a fifty percent shareholder to avoid dissolution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>\u201csimply by asserting his intention to purchase the shares but then later filing the notice of intention to adopt articles of dissolution, either because he intended to do so all along or because he was dissatisfied with the determined fair value of the petitioning shareholder\u2019s shares.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 888 (Morris, J., concurring specially). We share the concerns expressed by Judge Morris. As we acknowledged in <em>Bendetson, </em>to avoid dissolution\u2019s adverse effects on shareholders, employees, and others who may have an interest in the continuation of the business, \u201celection is often favored over judicial dissolution as a remedy.\u201d <em>Bendetson, </em>154 N.H. at 645 (quotation omitted). Nonetheless, we are constrained by the clear language of the statute and we will not rewrite it; that is the province of the legislature. <em>See Balke v. City of Manchester, </em>150 N.H. 69, 73 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">We do note, however, that while the application of RSA 293-A:14.34(g) may, in some instances, be unfair to a petitioning shareholder, the statute expressly provides \u201cthat the court may award the petitioning shareholder reasonable fees and expenses in accordance with the provisions of the last sentence of subsection (e) and the petitioner may continue to pursue any claims previously asserted on behalf of the corporation.\u201d Indeed as explained in the Model Business Corporation Act,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">[t]o prevent use of voluntary dissolution to evade responsibilities, subsection (g)... provides that the filing of articles of dissolution does not affect either the court\u2019s award of expenses to the petitioner under subsection (e) or the petitioner\u2019s standing to pursue derivative claims on behalf of the corporation, provided that the derivative claims ha[ve] been previously asserted by the petitioner in the section 14.34 proceedings or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Model Bus. Corp. Act Annotated \u00a7 14.34 cmt. 4D, at 14-173. Moreover, once the articles of dissolution are filed, the petitioning shareholder is \u201centitled to a pro rata share of any liquidating distribution to shareholders.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Carleton, LLC further contends that the trial court \u201cerr[ed] in finding that [MTS and the Balagurs] followed appropriate procedures for dissolving the corporation where the court held no hearing or took any evidence on the issue.\u201d We decline to address this argument, however, because it is not fully developed in Carleton, LLC\u2019s brief. <em>See Wyle v. Lees, </em>162 N.H. 406, 414 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">Finally, Carleton, LLC argues that \u201cAdrienne Balagur is both equitably and judicially estopped from avoiding her purchase of Carleton\u2019s shares.\u201d We disagree. \u201cA party may not assert equitable estoppel to avoid the application of a statute.\u201d <em>Appeal of Alexander, </em>163 N.H. 397, 409 (2012) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>(quotation and brackets omitted); <em>cf. Petition of Perkins, </em>147 N.H. 652, 655-56 (2002) (finding that petitioner\u2019s estoppel claim faded because her reliance upon representations contrary to the statute was unreasonable). As discussed above, once MTS filed the articles of dissolution, RSA 293-A:14.34(g) provides that it \u201cshall be dissolved.\u201d Thus, under the plain language of the statute, equitable estoppel cannot be used to circumvent the dissolution. <em>See McCarthy v. Wheeler, </em>152 N.H. 643, 645 (2005) (\u201c[U]se of the word \u2018shall\u2019 is generally regarded as a command . . . [and] is significant as indicating the intent that the statute is mandatory.\u201d). For these reasons, we similarly conclude that Carleton, LLC cannot avoid application of RSA 293-A: 14.34(g) by asserting judicial estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b504-5\">Dalianis, C.J., and HlCKS, CONBOY and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
