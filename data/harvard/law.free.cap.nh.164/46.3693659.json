He argues that there was insufficient evidence for the trial court to find that he committed sexual assault against the complainant pursuant to the variant charged. <em>See </em>RSA 632-A:2,1(a) (2007). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The record supports the following facts. In May 2010, the juvenile and the complainant, also a juvenile, regularly rode the school bus together. On May 19, the juvenile sat next to the complainant on the bus ride home. The complainant testified that during the ride, the juvenile put his hand down her shirt and touched her breasts. She further stated that he put his hand down her pants and \u201cran it\u201d down to her ankle. The complainant repeatedly told the juvenile to stop, but he did not. She testified that, immediately after the incident, the juvenile told her, \u201c[I]f you tell anyone, I\u2019ll rape you every single month til we get pregnant and I\u2019ll hurt your little brother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">A week later, the complainant reported the incident to a guidance counselor. The juvenile was charged with misdemeanor sexual assault, see RSA 632-A:4,1(a), and witness tampering, <em>see </em>RSA 641:5 (2007). The sexual assault petition alleged that the juvenile \u201c[d]id commit the crime of sexual assault in that he purposefully subjected [the complainant] (15 years old) to sexual contact without her consent by squeezing her breasts and touching her nipples with his hand by overcoming the victim through the actual application of physical force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The complainant wrote a statement describing the incident and provided it to the police. Although the statement was not admitted into evidence at trial, the complainant agreed, in response to questioning, that in the statement she wrote that when the juvenile reached underneath her clothes, he \u201csqueezed and rubbed\u201d her breasts, and \u201ctouched [her] privates and... rubbed them.\u201d She also agreed that in her statement, she described the juvenile\u2019s conduct as \u201churting\u201d her and being \u201crough.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">In addition to the complainant\u2019s testimony, the State presented at trial a surveillance video of the May 19 bus ride. The complainant testified that she did not alert other students on the bus at the time of the incident because she \u201cdid not want to get in trouble,\u201d \u201cdid not want other people to know,\u201d and \u201cwas in shock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">At the close of the State\u2019s case, and at the end of the trial, the juvenile moved to dismiss the sexual assault charge for lack of sufficient evidence. Subsequently, the trial court found the juvenile delinquent on both charges. On appeal, the juvenile challenges only the sexual assault delinquency finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">The juvenile argues that \u201c[t]he evidence did not justify a rational trier of fact in finding beyond a reasonable doubt that [he] sexually assaulted\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>complainant because it failed to demonstrate that he \u201covercame\u201d her \u201cthrough the actual application of physical force.\u201d He further argues that \u201c[t]he evidence ... failed to prove that he acted with the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">In challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, the juvenile must \u201cprove that no rational trier of fact, viewing all of the evidence and all reasonable inferences from it in the light most favorable to the State, could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Oakes, </em>161 N.H. 270, 275 (2010) (quotation omitted). We will consider the entire trial record because the juvenile chose to present a case after unsuccessfully moving to dismiss the petitions. <em>Id. </em>at 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The juvenile first argues that the State failed \u201cto prove that [he] overcame [the complainant] with the actual application of physical force.\u201d He contends that the State was required to prove that he exerted physical force apart from that inherent in the sexual contact itself. His argument focuses on the phrase \u201covercomes the victim through the actual application of physical force,\u201d RSA 632-A2, 1(a), and, more specifically, on the term \u201covercomes\u201d as used in the statute. The State argues that the statute does not require application of force greater than that inherent in the act itself. In the alternative, the State contends that the juvenile used more force than that involved in the act itself, thereby satisfying either construction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">When construing a statute, \u201cwe are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of a statute considered as a whole.\u201d <em>In re Alex C., </em>161 N.H. 231, 235 (2010) (quotation omitted). \u2018We first examine the language of the statute, and, where possible, we apply the plain and ordinary meanings to the words used.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We review matters of statutory construction <em>de novo </em>and consider the words and phrases of the statute within the context of the statute as a whole. <em>Id. </em>We construe provisions of the Criminal Code \u2018according to the fair import of their terms and to promote justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting RSA 625:3 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Under the charged variant of misdemeanor sexual assault, a person is guilty when he \u201csubjects another person who is 13 years of age or older to sexual contact\u201d and \u201covercomes the victim through the actual application of physical force, physical violence or superior physical strength.\u201d RSA 632-A:4, 1(a); RSA 632-A:2, 1(a). \u201cSexual contact\u201d is defined as \u201cthe intentional touching whether directly, through clothing, or otherwise, of the victim\u2019s or actor\u2019s sexual or intimate parts, including emissions, tongue, anus, breasts, and buttocks,\u201d and includes only the \u201caforementioned conduct which can be reasonably construed as being for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification.\u201d RSA 632-A:l, IV (Supp. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>The statute does not set forth the degree of force required to demonstrate that a person \u201covercomes the victim through the actual application of physical force.\u201d RSA 632-A:2, 1(a). Neither does it define the term \u201covercomes.\u201d The general meaning of the term is twofold: it can either mean \u201cto get the better of: SURMOUNT, CONQUER, SUBDUE,\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1607 (unabridged ed. 2002), or \u201cto affect or influence so strongly as to make physically helpless or emotionally distraught... : OVERPOWER, OVERWHELM.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Both understandings of the word thus share the connotation \u201cto defeat.\u201d As to either understanding of the word, under the plain language of the statutory variant charged here, the actor must \u201covercome!] the victim through the actual application of physical force, physical violence or superior physical strength.\u201d RSA 632-A:2,1(a). Indeed, RSA 632-A:2,1(a) is the only variant under RSA 632-A:2 that requires \u201cthe actual application of physical force.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 632-A:2 (Supp. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The State relies upon <em>People v. Premo, </em>540 N.W.2d 715 (Mich. Ct. App. 1995), in arguing that our statute requires no greater application of force than that necessary to perform the sexual contact itself. However, in concluding that the defendant\u2019s pinching of the victim\u2019s buttocks \u201csatis-fie[d] the <em>force </em>element\u201d of Michigan\u2019s statute, which is broader in scope than ours, the court did not address the statute\u2019s \u201covercoming\u201d requirement. <em>Premo, </em>540 N.W.2d at 716-17 (emphasis added). Thus, <em>Premo </em>is not on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The juvenile cites <em>State v. Simpson, </em>133 N.H. 704 (1990), as well as cases from other jurisdictions, in support of his argument that, to \u201covercome by physical force,\u201d the actor must use physical force apart from that inherent in the sexual contact. In <em>Simpson, </em>we held that the evidence was sufficient to find the defendant guilty of aggravated felonious sexual assault under RSA 632-A:2,1(a) where the victim testified that the defendant fondled her breasts and sexually penetrated \u201cher while physically holding her down.\u201d <em>Simpson, </em>133 N.H. at 706. Although <em>Simpson </em>does not establish the parameters for the amount of force required to show that a victim was overcome by force, we agree that to sustain a sexual assault charge under RSA 632-A:2, 1(a), the evidence must show that the actor applied some degree of force greater than that inherent in the sexual act itself. <em>Cf. State v. Marshall, </em>253 P.3d 1017, 1028 (Or. 2011) (determining \u201cthat, when the state elects to prove the \u2018forcible compulsion\u2019 element of a charge of first-degree sexual abuse by evidence of physical force, it must show that the physical force that the defendant used was greater in degree or different in kind from the simple movement and contact that is inherent in the act of touching the intimate part of another\u201d and the force \u201cwas sufficient to compel the victim to submit to or engage in the sexual contact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>against the victim\u2019s will\u201d); <em>State v. Lynch, </em>19 A.3d 51, 57 (R.I.2011) (stating that \u201cto prove first-degree sexual assault by force or coercion ... \u2018proof of force beyond that which is used in the consummation of the act is required\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">To read the statute as requiring no greater force than that inherent in the sexual contact itself would make this variant applicable to any and all sexual assault allegations, essentially rendering meaningless the \u201cphysical force\u201d and \u201covercoming\u201d requirements. This we decline to do. <em>Cf. State v. McDonald, </em>163 N.H. 115, 127-28 (2011) (declining to construe the term \u201cforcible sex offense\u201d to mean <em>any </em>aggravated felonious sexual assault because to do so would render the term meaningless and require the court to insert language the legislature did not see fit to include). Therefore, the legislature\u2019s use of the phrase \u201covercomes the victim through the actual application of physical force\u201d in RSA 632-A:2, 1(a) means that the State must prove the use of <em>actual physical force, </em>and not simply lack of consent, to support a delinquency finding under this variant. The State is not required, however, to prove that the victim resisted. The legislature did not require a sexual assault victim to resist and we will not \u201cadd language [to the statute] that the legislature did not see fit to include.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Here, the complainant\u2019s direct testimony indicated that the juvenile put his hand down her shirt and touched her breasts. She further stated that the juvenile put his hand down her pants and \u201cran it\u201d down to her ankle. This evidence, however, fails to describe in what way the juvenile overcame her with the actual application of physical force. Nor does the surveillance video support the State\u2019s position. In fact, the video shows no movement consistent with the juvenile engaging in any conduct that can be characterized as overcoming the complainant through the actual application of physical force.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">To the extent that the complainant\u2019s testimony regarding her prior statement can be considered as substantive evidence, it is also insufficient to support a conviction in this case. The complainant indicated in her statement that the juvenile \u201csqueezed and rubbed\u201d her breasts, and \u201ctouched [her] privates and . . . rubbed them\u201d despite her telling him to stop. Although these descriptions may have supported a finding that the sexual contact was not consented to, they are not sufficient to support a finding that the juvenile overcame her by the actual application of physical force. <em>Cf. Com. v. Berkowitz, </em>641 A.2d 1161, 1164 (Pa. 1994) (finding that the complainant\u2019s testimony that she stated \u201cno\u201d throughout the incident with the defendant \u201cwould be relevant to the issue of consent\u201d but \u201cnot... to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>issue of force\u201d). In her statement, the complainant also reported that the juvenile\u2019s conduct was \u201crough\u201d and \u201churting\u201d her. However, rough, hurtful conduct is not, standing alone, among the circumstances the legislature has enumerated as a basis for a sexual assault conviction. Therefore, such evidence is insufficient to support a finding that the complainant was <em>overcome </em>by the application of physical force.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">We have previously determined that each of the statutory variants of sexual assault listed under RSA 632-A:2,1, \u201crequires proof of an element or elements the others do not.\u201d <em>State v. Nickles, </em>144 N.H. 673, 678 (2000) (quotation omitted). The delinquency petition, equivalent to an indictment for the purposes of our analysis, <em>see In re Nathan L., </em>146 N.H. 614, 617 (2001), charged the \u201covercoming by physical force\u201d variant of sexual assault. Even if the evidence may have been sufficient to establish one of the other variants of sexual assault, <em>see </em>RSA 632-A:2, I(m) (when victim indicates consent is not freely given), considering all of the evidence and all reasonable inferences to be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the State, we conclude that no rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the juvenile committed misdemeanor sexual assault within the meaning of RSA 632-A2,1(a), as charged under RSA 632-A:4 in the petition. Because no rational trier of fact could have found that the juvenile \u201covercame] the victim through the actual application of physical force, physical violence or superior physical strength,\u201d RSA 632-A:2, 1(a), we reverse the trial court\u2019s finding of true. <em>Cf. State v. Ramos, </em>149 N.H. 272, 276 (2003) (failure to prove an element of the particular variant charged requires acquittal).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">In light of our ruling on the juvenile\u2019s first argument, we do not reach the juvenile\u2019s second argument that the State failed to produce sufficient evidence for a reasonable trier of fact to find that his conduct was for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b75-8\">DALIANIS, C.J., and HICKS, Lynn and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
