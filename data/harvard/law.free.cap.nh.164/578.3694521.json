(Signal), appeals an order of the Superior Court <em>{Vaughan, </em>J.) granting the motion to dismiss filed by the respondent, City of Lebanon (City). We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-17\">The following facts are found in the record. The City owns the Lebanon Municipal Airport. In July 1996, the City entered into a twenty-year lease with HL Leasing for certain airport land. HL Leasing assigned its rights under the lease to Sierra Nevada Helicopters, which then assigned the rights to its affiliate, Signal. In the lease, the City agreed, among other things, that it would not allow any other provider of commercial aeronautical services to operate at the airport \u201cunder rates, terms [or] conditions\u201d that were more favorable than those set forth in the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-18\">Signal\u2019s leased premises consist of approximately nine acres upon which various improvements have been constructed, including a main hangar, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>terminal facility, and a \u201cfuel farm for the storage of relevant petroleum products.\u201d In 2006, the City increased the assessed value of Signal\u2019s leased land, not including the improvements, from $77,400 to $868,300, which resulted in a corresponding increase in Signal\u2019s property taxes. The rate at which the City assessed the land, not including the improvements, was approximately $97,452 per acre.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Signal claims that the City assessed its land disproportionately \u201cas compared to other entities operating and leasing land at the [a]irport.\u201d It observes that the City has taxed two airport tenants with parcels similar to Signal\u2019s at rates of approximately $61,000 per acre and approximately $30,000 per acre, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Signal unsuccessfully applied to the City\u2019s assessors for an abatement of its 2006 and 2007 taxes and then appealed to the New Hampshire Board of Tax and Land Appeals (BTLA). In an August 2009 decision, the BTLA dismissed the appeals because Signal failed to present any evidence of the market value of its property. Absent such evidence, the BTLA ruled that it could not determine \u201cwhether [Signal] is over[-]assessed or whether [the properties of the other airport tenants] are under[-]assessed or some of both.\u201d <em>See Verizon New England v. City of Rochester, </em>151 N.H. 263, 272 (2004) (To prove disproportionality, taxpayer must establish \u201cthat its property is assessed at a higher percentage of fair market value than the percentage at which property is generally assessed in the city.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Although Signal argued that its lease with the City precluded the City from assessing the other two similarly situated properties \u201con a different per acre basis,\u201d the BTLA decided that it had no jurisdiction to adjudicate Signal\u2019s breach of contract claim. Nonetheless, the BTLA observed that the City was required to \u201cassess relative to market value\u201d and could \u201cnot be bound by any contractual restriction\u201d on its taxing authority, unless otherwise provided for by statute. <em>See </em>RSA 75:1 (2012) (all taxable property except as identified in statute must be assessed \u201cat its market value\u201d); <em>Pheasant Lane Realty Trust v. City of Nashua, </em>143 N.H. 140, 143 (1998) (power to tax arises solely by statute); <em>Mack v. Jones, </em>21 N.H. 393, 395 (1850) (municipalities may not \u201cchange or modify the public law regulating taxation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Signal did not appeal the BTLA\u2019s 2009 decision. Nor did Signal contest the City\u2019s 2008 and 2009 assessments of its property by applying to the assessors for abatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">In February 2010, Signal filed the instant petition against the City, alleging that the City \u201cmaterially breached its obligations under the Lease by providing more favorable and disproportionate tax assessments and taxation schemes\u201d to \u201cother entities at the [a]irport.\u201d Signal specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>alleged that: (1) the City \u201cdisproportionately assessed\u201d Signal\u2019s property \u201cas compared to [the property of] other entities operating and leasing land at the Airport\u201d; and (2) as a result of the disproportionate assessment, \u201cSignal\u2019s tax bill amounts to disproportionate rates and terms for operation of its commercial aeronautical services provided at the Airport as compared to other tenants operating there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Signal also alleged that it \u201cis obligated to pay taxes on a larger portion of the airport property\u201d than similarly situated competitors. Signal alleged that \u201c[t]he method used by the City to attribute taxable land to tenants\u201d at the City\u2019s \u201cnewly constructed Executive Ramp facility\u201d leaves \u201ca significant portion of the land comprising the Executive Ramp untaxed.\u201d Signal alleged that, accordingly, the Executive Ramp tenants had more favorable terms and conditions than those under which Signal operates and that these favorable terms and conditions gave the Executive Ramp tenants \u201ca competitive advantage over Signal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">For this conduct, Signal sought damages, including a set-off against current taxes due to the City. Signal also brought a claim for equitable relief \u201cin the form [of] an order prohibiting further disparate tax assessment of providers of aeronautical services on leased land at the Airport\u201d and \u201cgranting a stay of the imposition of interest and penalties against Signal for taxes owed on [its leased land].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The City moved to dismiss Signal\u2019s \u201cclaims for tax relief,\u201d arguing that the monetary relief Signal sought in its lawsuit \u2014 abatement of its 2006-2010 taxes \u2014 was outside of the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to grant. The City contended that the statutory abatement process was Signal\u2019s exclusive remedy for disproportionate taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">The trial court agreed with the City \u201cthat although the petition is styled as a breach of contract, the relief sought by [Signal] is abatement of five years of taxes.\u201d Accordingly, the court determined that Signal could not maintain its claims for abatement of its 2006 and 2007 taxes because it failed to adhere to the statutory process for abating taxes. The court ruled that once Signal lost its appeal of the assessors\u2019 denial of its abatement requests, its \u201conly recourse ... would have been an appeal [of the BTLA\u2019s decision] to the Supreme Court.\u201d The court decided as well that Signal could not seek abatement of its 2008 and 2009 taxes in superior court because it failed to request abatement first from the assessors. Finally, the court ruled that any claim Signal had that its 2010 taxes were disproportional was not yet ripe for review because its request for abatement was still pending before the assessors.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">Having concluded that Signal\u2019s breach of contract claim was actually a request for tax abatement and that none of Signal\u2019s abatement requests were properly before it, the trial court dismissed Signal\u2019s breach of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>contract claim. Because the court found that Signal\u2019s breach of contract claim failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, the court also denied its request for equitable relief based upon that claim. Signal unsuccessfully moved for reconsideration, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">\u201cIn reviewing a motion to dismiss, our standard of review is whether the allegations in the [petitioner\u2019s] pleadings are reasonably susceptible of a construction that would permit recovery.\u201d <em>Suprenant v. Mulcrone, </em>163 N.H. 529, 530 (2012). We assume the petitioner\u2019s allegations to be true and construe all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to it. <em>Id. </em>However, we need not accept allegations that are merely conclusions of law. <em>Id. </em>\u2018We then engage in a threshold inquiry, testing the facts alleged in the pleadings against the applicable law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530-31. \u2018We will uphold the trial court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss if the facts pleaded do not constitute a basis for legal relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">\u201cThe New Hampshire tax abatement statutes <em>are </em>remedial in nature\u201d and \u201cprovide <em>the exclusive remedy </em>available to a taxpayer dissatisfied with an assessment made against his property.\u201d <em>LSP Assoc. v. Town of Gilford, </em>142 N.H. 369, 374 (1997) (emphasis added). Under our tax abatement statutory scheme, municipal assessors have the authority to abate taxes \u201cfor good cause shown.\u201d RSA 76:16,1 (2012). If the assessors refuse to do so, the taxpayer may appeal to either the BTLA, <em>see </em>RSA 76:16-a (2012), or the superior court, <em>see </em>RSA 76:17 (2012). \u201cThe taxpayer may choose which forum to use, but may not use both.\u201d <em>LSP Assoc., </em>142 N.H. at 373. \u201cThe superior court\u2019s jurisdiction in an abatement proceeding is appellate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Signal argues that the trial court erred when it concluded that its breach of contract claim was a claim for abatement of taxes and, therefore, to be justiciable, Signal first had to adhere to the statutory tax abatement scheme set forth above. To support this assertion, Signal contends that its lease constituted an \u201cadditional layer of bargained for protection\u201d against disproportionate taxation and that it should be allowed contractual remedies for the City\u2019s breach of its contractual obligation not to tax Signal disproportionately. Alternatively, Signal argues that its lease required the City to treat \u201cparties equally\u201d and that the City violated this requirement when it used a scheme \u201cto determine the amount of taxable land attributable to other tenants at the Airport\u201d different from the scheme used to determine the amount of taxable land attributable to Signal.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Our decision in <em>Porter v. Town of Sandwich, </em>153 N.H. 175 (2006), is dispositive. <em>Porter </em>concerned an agreement between the plaintiff taxpayers and the defendant town entered into pursuant to RSA chapter 79-D, which allows \u201ctowns to enter into agreements to reduce taxes imposed upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>residents who own structures that are both historical and agricultural, because the maintenance of such structures benefits the public interest.\u201d <em>Porter, </em>153 N.H. at 176. The parties\u2019 agreement required the plaintiffs to maintain their two historical, agricultural buildings and accept an easement on their land. <em>Id. </em>In exchange, the town agreed to assess the buildings for twenty-five percent less than their full value as of a certain date, and to not increase the assessment as a result of repairs or improvements the plaintiffs made pursuant to the agreement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">After the agreement, the town re-evaluated all properties in the town and increased the assessment of the plaintiffs\u2019 two properties from $8,407 to $50,527. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiffs eventually sued the town for breach of contract and for violation of RSA chapter 79-D. <em>Id. </em>The trial court dismissed their lawsuit, concluding that because the plaintiffs failed to follow the statutorily required procedure for tax abatement in RSA 76:17, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to decide their breach of contract and statutory claims. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">We concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were not for an abatement of taxes, and, therefore, they \u201cwere not required to follow the statutorily prescribed abatement procedure to confer jurisdiction on the superior court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178. The issue in an abatement proceeding, we explained, is \u201cwhether the government has taxed the plaintiff out of proportion to other property owners in the taxing district.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 177. \u2018We have also held that an abatement proceeding may address a claim of inability to pay a tax levy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We reasoned that if the plaintiffs were seeking an abatement of taxes in their lawsuit, they would have argued \u201cthat they were unable to pay the higher taxes levied by the Town,\u201d or that \u201cthe Town assessed them disproportionately.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The plaintiffs, however, made neither of these arguments, asserting, instead, only that the town had violated the agreement and misinterpreted RSA chapter 79-D. <em>Id. </em>We concluded, therefore, that their claims were not for tax abatement and that the superior court had jurisdiction over them. <em>Id. </em>at 177-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Consistent with <em>Porter, </em>we conclude that to the extent that Signal\u2019s breach of contract claim sought relief from \u201cdisproportionate taxation,\u201d its claim is unavailing. Contrary to Signal\u2019s assertions, a claim for \u201cdisproportionate taxation\u201d is, in effect, a claim for abatement of taxes, and, as such, may be pursued only through the tax abatement statutory scheme. <em>Id. </em>at 177. We, therefore, uphold the trial court\u2019s decision insofar as it relates to Signal\u2019s allegations of \u201cdisproportionate taxation.\u201d However, to the extent that Signal\u2019s breach of contract claim sought relief from \u201cunequal treatment,\u201d specifically with respect to the amount of taxable land the City attributes to Signal and to other airport tenants with which the City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>contracts, Signal may pursue this claim without complying with the tax abatement statutory process. <em>See id. </em>at 177-78. We, therefore, reverse the trial court\u2019s decision insofar as it concerns Signal\u2019s allegations about unequal treatment unrelated to disproportionate taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">In arguing that it should be allowed to pursue a breach of contract claim for disproportionate taxation, Signal mistakenly relies upon our recent decision in <em>Lebanon Hangar </em>Assocs. <em>v. City of Lebanon, </em>163 N.H. 670 (2012). In that case, the plaintiff, Lebanon Hangar Associates (Lebanon Hangar), like Signal, had a lease with the City to rent land at the Lebanon Airport. <em>Lebanon Hangar, </em>163 N.H. at 671. Lebanon Hangar\u2019s lease required it to pay \u201ctaxes lawfully levied or assessed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and ellipsis omitted). Nevertheless, from 1996 until October 2006, the City did not tax Lebanon Hangar on the value of the land itself; it limited its assessment of taxes to the value of Lebanon Hangar\u2019s building. <em>Id. </em>In October 2006, the City changed its practice and assessed a tax upon the value of Lebanon Hangar\u2019s land, which increased the total assessment of Lebanon Hangar\u2019s property from $77,400 in 2005 to $360,400 in 2006. <em>Id. </em>Lebanon Hangar sought an abatement of its taxes from the assessors, who denied it, and then appealed to the superior court. <em>Id.; see </em>RSA 76:17. Lebanon Hangar also claimed that the City breached the lease by demanding the payment of taxes. <em>Lebanon Hangar, </em>163 N.H. at 671. The City sought to arbitrate the breach of contract claim. <em>Id. </em>The sole issue for our review in the appeal was whether, in deciding that the lease did not require Lebanon Hangar to pay taxes to the City based upon the value of its land, the arbitrator exceeded the scope of his authority. <em>Id. </em>at 672-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Signal relies upon <em>Lebanon Hangar </em>to support its contention that a taxpayer can have both a contractual and a statutory remedy when a municipality engages in disproportionate taxation. Signal argues that in <em>Lebanon Hangar </em>we upheld the notion that a municipality\u2019s statutory authority to tax can be modified by contract. <em>But see Piper v. Meredith, </em>83 N.H. 107, 113 (1927) (\u201ca town cannot, by grant or stipulation in a conveyance, exempt land from taxation\u201d); <em>Mack, </em>21 N.H. at 396 (any attempt by town to grant land permanent exemption from taxation was \u201cillegal and void\u201d). Although our decision could be read to imply approval of this notion, in fact, this was not an issue in the <em>Lebanon Hangar </em>appeal. As the City aptly observes in its brief, in <em>Lebanon Hangar, </em>\u201c[t]he merits of the underlying action were not before the Court, and the legality or enforceability of the underlying contract was not decided.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; reversed in part; and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b608-8\">Hicks, Conboy and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
