(River Run), is permitted under the Town of Bartlett\u2019s Zoning Ordinance (ordinance). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-16\">The following facts are drawn from the trial court\u2019s order and the record. River Run maintains vacation ownership units at Attitash Mountain Village, a resort in Bartlett. In September 2009, River Run applied to the Selectboard for a permit to place a sign on Route 302, advertising, \u201cThe Suites at Attitash Mountain Village.\u201d In January 2010, the Selectboard approved River Run\u2019s application, and the sign was erected at the westerly entrance to the resort area. At some point, an additional, smaller sign was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>affixed underneath the approved sign, reading \u201cREGISTRATION .3 MILES BACK ON LEFT.\u201d The registration office to which the sign refers is the office at which patrons register for Attitash Mountain Village. The office is located on a lot within Attitash Mountain Village, separate from the lot on which the sign is located.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-3\">In June 2010, the Seleetboard informed River Run that the additional sign violated the ordinance. In response, River Run submitted an amended sign permit application, seeking approval of the additional sign. The Seleetboard denied River Run\u2019s request pursuant to Article XVI, Section A-10 of the ordinance, which prohibits the erection of an outdoor sign \u201con any premises other than on the premises where the activity to which the sign pertains is located,\u201d and Section D, which prohibits off-premise signs \u201cin all districts except as provided elsewhere in [the] Ordinance.\u201d The Seleetboard reasoned that because the \u201csign advertises the registration office which is not on the property where the sign is, it is considered an off premise sign and therefore not permitted.\u201d River Run appealed to the ZBA, arguing that the sign was \u201ca directory sign\u201d under Article XVI, Section H.4 of the ordinance, which exempts from the ordinance \u201c[d]irectional, informational, warning, and/or safety oriented signs not directed to or readily visible from the public way and/or required by State law or regulation or for the control, movement, and/or protection of patrons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">The ZBA held a public hearing at which it noted that the ordinance does not define the word \u201cpremises.\u201d The ZBA then discussed whether the word might \u201cmean the total holdings of the landowner,\u201d rather than individual lots. Ultimately, the ZBA found \u201cthat the sign served as a directional sign for patrons\u201d under Article XVI, Section H.4, and was exempt from the provisions of the ordinance prohibiting off-premise signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The Seleetboard moved for rehearing, arguing that the ZBA\u2019s decision that the sign was a directional sign was unlawful or unreasonable. It also noted that the \u201cZBA meeting minutes contain a fair amount of discussion about the word \u2018premises,\u2019 \u201d and contended \u201cthat the term \u2018premises\u2019 cannot be interpreted to mean more than a single lot of land, and cannot mean multiple lots under the same ownership.\u201d According to the Seleetboard, \u201c[a]ny interpretation that \u2018premises\u2019 means more than a single lot is in error.\u201d River Run objected, asserting that the ZBA\u2019s decision was lawful because the sign was either exempt as a directional sign under Article XVJ, Section H.4, or was not an off-premise sign and, thus, was permitted under the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">After the ZBA denied the Selectboard\u2019s request for rehearing, the Seleetboard appealed to the superior court. The Seleetboard again argued that River Run\u2019s sign was not exempt as a directional sign, and \u201cthat the term \u2018premises\u2019 cannot be interpreted to mean more than a single lot of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>land, and cannot mean multiple lots under the same ownership.\u201d The trial court ruled that the sign was not an off-premise sign. In doing so, the trial court rejected the Selectboard\u2019s argument that the court should refuse to address this issue because it was not properly before the court on appeal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-3\">The Selectboard argues that the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction by upholding the ZBA\u2019s decision upon a ground not set forth in the motion for rehearing. <em>See </em>RSA 677:2 (Supp. 2012), :3,1 (2008). It further contends that the trial court erred by: (1) construing the term \u201cpremises\u201d in the ordinance to mean a unified vacation resort complex located on multiple tax lots; and (2) failing to find that the sign is an \u201coff-premise\u201d sign not subject to exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Judicial review in zoning cases is limited. <em>Brandt Dev. Co. of N.H. v. City of Somersworth, </em>162 N.H. 553, 555 (2011). Factual findings by the ZBA are deemed <em>prima facie </em>lawful and reasonable, and the ZBA\u2019s decision will not be set aside by the superior court absent errors of law unless it is persuaded by the balance of probabilities, on the evidence before it, that the ZBA decision is unlawful or unreasonable. <em>Id.; </em>RSA 677:6 (2008). We will uphold the superior court\u2019s decision unless the evidence does not support it or it is legally erroneous. <em>Brandt Dev. Co. of N.H., </em>162 N.H. at 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">We begin by addressing the Selectboard\u2019s challenge to the superior court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. The Selectboard argues that the trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction in a zoning matter is circumscribed by the issues raised in a motion for rehearing under RSA 677:2. Thus, it contends that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider whether the sign was not an off-premise sign because River Run did not file a motion for rehearing with respect to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Under RSA 677:3, I, \u201cno ground not set forth in the [motion for rehearing] shall be urged, relied on, or given any consideration by a court unless the court for good cause shown shall allow the appellant to specify additional grounds.\u201d This \u201cstatutory scheme is based upon the principle that the local board should have the first opportunity to pass upon any <em>alleged errors </em>in its decisions so that the court may have the benefit of the board\u2019s judgment in hearing the appeal.\u201d <em>Atwater v. Town of Plainfield, </em>160 N.H. 503, 511-12 (2010) (quotation omitted; emphasis added). Nevertheless, we are aware of no authority, and the Selectboard cites none, that River Run, <em>which prevailed before the ZBA, </em>had a statutory obligation to file a motion for rehearing in order to establish the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction over its alternative argument <em>in support of </em>the ZBA\u2019s decision. <em>Cf. Mack v. Board of Appeals, Town of Homer, </em>807 N.Y.S.2d 460, 463 (Sup. Ct. 2006) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>(finding that petitioners were not required to appeal town code enforcement officer\u2019s interpretation to board of appeals \u201cbecause they were not aggrieved by it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-3\">Moreover, although the Selectboard asserts that its \u201crequest for rehearing was based exclusively on the ZBA\u2019s interpretation of Zoning Ordinance Article XVT, Section H.4,\u201d and that neither it nor River Run appealed the ZBA\u2019s conclusion that the sign was an off-premise sign, the Selectboard <em>itself </em>raised the issue in its motion for rehearing when it contended \u201cthat the term \u2018premises\u2019 cannot be interpreted to mean more than a single lot of land, and cannot mean multiple lots under the same ownership.\u201d River Run then also raised the issue in its objection to the Selectboard\u2019s motion for rehearing. Thus, insofar as the Selectboard maintains that the issue was raised for the first time before the superior court, it is mistaken. Accordingly, we conclude that, when reviewing the ZBA\u2019s decision that River Run\u2019s sign was exempt from the terms in the ordinance prohibiting off-premise signs, the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to consider initially whether River Run\u2019s sign was, in fact, an off-premise sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">We next address the Selectboard\u2019s argument that the trial court misconstrued the word \u201cpremises.\u201d \u201cThe interpretation of a zoning ordinance is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo!\u2019 Town of Barrington v. Townsend, </em>164 N.H. 241, 246 (2012) (quotation omitted). \u201cWhen the language of an ordinance is plain and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the ordinance itself for further indications of legislative intent. <em>Fox v. Town of Greenland, </em>151 N.H. 600, 605 (2004). We determine the meaning of a zoning ordinance \u201cfrom its construction as a whole, not by construing isolated words and phrases.\u201d <em>Feins v. Town of Wilmot, </em>154 N.H. 715, 719 (2007) (quotation omitted). Because the ordinance in this case does not define \u201cpremises,\u201d we will look \u201cto the common and approved usage of\u2019 the word. <em>Townsend, </em>164 N.H. at 246 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Black\u2019S Law Dictionary defines \u201cpremises,\u201d in relevant part, as \u201c[a] house or building, along with its grounds.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1300 (9th ed. 2009). Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines \u201cgrounds,\u201d in relevant part, as \u201can area appropriated to or used for a particular purpose.\u201d WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 1002 (unabridged ed. 2002). It further defines \u201cpremises,\u201d in pertinent part, as \u201ca specified piece or tract of land with the structures on it\u201d or \u201cthe place of business of an enterprise or institution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1789.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\"> We have relied upon similar definitions of \u201cpremises\u201d in other contexts. <em>See State v. Thiel, </em>160 N.H. 462, 466 (2010) (looking to plain and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>ordinary meaning of word \u201cpremises\u201d as \u201cthe place of business of an enterprise or institution\u201d in addressing defendant\u2019s argument that her conduct did not meet requirements of shoplifting statute (quotation omitted)); <em>Gen. Linen Servs. v. Franconia Inv. Assocs., </em>150 N.H. 595, 597 (2004) (defining \u201cpremises\u201d as relevant to the parties\u2019 agreement as \u201ca specified piece or tract of land with the structures on it,\u201d or \u201cthe place of business of an enterprise or institution\u201d (quotations omitted)). Indeed, in <em>General Linen Services, </em>we said that \u201c \u2018[premises\u2019 can identify single premises or multiple premises,\u201d and \u201cthe word, as used in a particular situation, must be understood in light of the circumstances, disclosures and context attendant to the situation.\u201d <em>Gen. Linen Servs., </em>150 N.H. at 597-98. While we need not define the precise parameters of \u201cpremises\u201d as used in the ordinance, we conclude that the word \u201cpremises\u201d in this case includes the buildings and grounds associated with the place of business of Attitash Mountain Village \u2014 namely, vacation ownership units, including its registration office \u2014 regardless of whether the buildings and grounds are located on separate lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-3\">The Selectboard argues that a plain meaning analysis \u201cleads to the conclusion that the term \u2018premises\u2019 refers more accurately to a single lot of land.\u201d In support of this interpretation, it contends that \u201cpremises,\u201d as referred to in the ordinance, \u201chas been defined in practice to mean either a single lot under the same ownership, or separate businesses on a single lot.\u201d The \u201cwords used in a zoning ordinance will be given their ordinary meaning unless it appears from their context that a different meaning was intended.\u201d <em>Feins, </em>154 N.H. at 719 (quotation omitted). Here, while the ordinance does not define \u201cpremises,\u201d it defines \u201clot\u201d as \u201ca tract, parcel, or plot of land.\u201d Had it been the intent of the drafters of the ordinance to interpret the word \u201cpremises\u201d as a single lot of land, they could have done so by using the word \u201clot.\u201d <em>See Scotland Yard Ltd. Liab. P\u2019ship v. Uxbridge Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>No. 377478 (AHS), 2010 WL 2690532, at *3 (Mass. Land Ct. July 8, 2010) (finding that had the drafters of the zoning bylaws intended the word \u201cpremises\u201d to mean a single parcel, \u201cthey could have used the term \u2018lot\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">Additionally, we fail to see how the First Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 explanation of the distinction between \u201consite\u201d and \u201coffsite\u201d signs in <em>Ackerley Communications v. City of Cambridge, </em>88 F.3d 33, 34 n.1 (1st Cir. 1996), supports the Seleetboard\u2019s argument. In <em>Ackerley, </em>the First Circuit explained that \u201c[a]n onsite sign carries a message that bears some relationship to the activities conducted on the premises where the sign is located____An offsite sign____carries a message unrelated to its particular location.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Vono v. Lewis, </em>594 F. Supp. 2d 189, 194 n.9 (D. R.I. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>2009) (utilizing same explanation for \u201con-premise\u201d signs and \u201coff-premise\u201d signs). Nothing in that explanation suggests that the meaning of the word \u201cpremises\u201d is limited to a single lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-3\">The Selectboard further argues that our interpretation \u201cis incompatible with the other uses of the word \u2018premises\u2019 in the ordinance.\u201d It cites four provisions of the ordinance, arguing that our interpretation would \u201cfrustrate the clear intent\u201d of one and render another \u201ccompletely impractical and unworkable.\u201d Upon review of the ordinance, we are not persuaded that our interpretation will have either effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">Nor are we persuaded that our interpretation frustrates the clear intent of the ordinance. The ordinance limits the placement of outdoor signs to \u201cthe premises where the activity to which the sign pertains is located.\u201d At oral argument, the Selectboard explained that the concern addressed by this provision is the proliferation of business signs in Bartlett. The effectiveness of the provision in addressing this concern, however, is not undermined by our holding. Interpreting the word \u201cpremises\u201d to mean the buildings and grounds associated with the place of business of Attitash Mountain Village merely allows for the placement of outdoor signs <em>on the premises of Attitash Mountain Village. </em>While River Run may own several businesses at different properties, we do not read the word \u201cpremises\u201d so broadly as to refer to multiple businesses located throughout Bartlett, which happen to be operated by a single owner. Here, although the sign and the registration office are on different lots, both are geographically located at the place of business of Attitash Mountain Village and, therefore, are on the same \u201cpremises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">In light of our interpretation of the word \u201cpremises,\u201d we need not address the parties\u2019 arguments concerning whether the sign is a directional signal exempt from the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b787-7\">Hicks, Conboy, Lynn and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
