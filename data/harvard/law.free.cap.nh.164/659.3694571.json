Axenics cross-appeals, challenging the amount of damages awarded and the trial court\u2019s failure to find the defendants liable on its breach of contract and New Hampshire Consumer Protection Act (CPA) claims, <em>see </em>RSA ch. 358-A (2009 &amp; Supp. 2012). We affirm in part, reverse in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The trial court found, or the record establishes, the following facts. This case arises out of the construction of a biotech facility (facility) in West Lebanon. Biotech operates the facility, and Sales owns the property where it is located. Turner was hired as the general contractor to build the facility. Axenics provides \u201cmanufacturing, installation, and field services for ultra-pure gas and liquid distribution systems in the biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and semiconductor industries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">On April 15, 2004, Axenics entered into a subcontract with Turner to furnish labor, materials, equipment, and services for the installation of \u201cprocess pipe\u201d at the facility. The original subcontract price was $1,992,506. Both parties agreed that the facility would be completed as quickly as possible. The \u201cmechanical completion\u201d date for the facility, including the process pipe installation, was December 2004. Ultimately, Axenics\u2019 last day on the job was June 2, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">The subcontract contemplated the possibility of delays and hindrances as well as changes to the scope of the work and its cost. The subcontract provided that \u201call instructions given to [Axenics\u2019] supervisory or management personnel by Turner\u2019s Superintendent, Engineer, or other duly authorized representative shall be understood to be included as part of this Subcontract.\u201d If Axenics believed \u201cwork to be beyond the scope of\u2019 the subcontract, it was required to inform Turner before proceeding. In the event that the parties could not reach an agreement at that time, Turner could issue \u201can S.I.S. (Superintendent\u2019s Instructions to Subcontractors) for record purposes until such an agreement [could] be reached.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">In the event that Turner directed additional work to be performed \u201cand the value of such work [was] to be determined other than by actual signed tickets for material,\u201d Axenics was to \u201csubmit a lump sum proposal accompanied by an itemized breakdown of material, using established contract unit rates where applicable.\u201d The \u201clump sum proposal\u201d had to be \u201caccompanied by accurate written estimates of the cost\u201d and \u201cbe submitted to Turner within five (5) calendar days of the receipt of the directive.\u201d If the \u201c[proposals for additional work\u201d were not received within five calendar days, Turner would \u201cassign a fair and reasonable value for the additional work, and the additional work w[ould] become part of [Axenics\u2019] scope of work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">Likewise, when Axenics initiated requests for changes to the work, it had to \u201cprovide [a] written request for change and obtain Turner\u2019s written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>concurrence <em>before </em>proceeding with any Work believed not to be within the scope of [the] subcontract.\u201d The subcontract further provided that if Axenics was \u201cdelayed, obstructed, hindered or interfered with in the commencement, prosecution or completion of the\u201d work, it was required to notify Turner in writing about what caused the delay within forty-eight hours \u201cof the commencement thereof.\u201d Axenics also had to demonstrate that it could not have anticipated or avoided the delay and had \u201cused all available means to minimize the consequences thereof.\u201d This notice was \u201can essential condition precedent to [Axenics\u2019] rights in connection with any such delays, obstructive hindrances or interferences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">In addition, in the subcontract, Axenics agreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">that .it shall not be entitled to nor claim any cost reimbursement, compensation or damages for any delay, obstruction, hindrance or interference to the Work except to the extent that Turner has actually recovered corresponding cost reimbursement, compensation or damages from the Owner under the Contract Documents for such delay, obstruction, hindrance or interference, and then only to the extent of the amount, if any, which Turner on behalf of [Axenics], actually received from the Owner on account of such delay, obstruction, hindrance or interference. Notwithstanding any term or provision herein to the contrary, [Axenics] expressly waives and releases all claims or rights to recover lost profit (except for profit on work actually performed), recovery of overhead (including home office overhead), and any other indirect damages, costs or expenses in any way arising out of or related to the [subcontract], including the breach thereof by Turner, delays, charges, acceleration, loss of efficiency or productivity disruptions and interferences with the performance of the work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Axenics\u2019 \u201cwork [was] to be coordinated with the structural, architectural and [mechanical, electrical, and plumbing] services prior to fabrication,\u201d and \u201c[p]roject coordination procedures [were] outlined in [an] attached project coordination plan.\u201d The project coordination plan provided that: (1) Turner was responsible for scheduling, facilitating, and controlling the \u201ccoordination process\u201d; (2) the engineer was responsible for supporting and reviewing \u201cdesign changes required due to field coordination issues\u201d; and (3) Axenics was responsible for producing, maintaining, and approving \u201ccoordination drawings\u201d as well as implementing \u201ceoordination[-]driven images.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Several delays, which affected Axenics\u2019 work, arose during construction of the facility. Some of the delays caused the schedule to be compressed and required Axenics personnel to work overtime to complete the work on time. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>In addition, there were occasions when Turner requested changes to the process piping, which Axenics believed to be a \u201cchange in scope.\u201d When this occurred, Axenics was instructed to continue working and that \u201cSISs [would] follow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">During construction, Turner met with Stryker weekly to review change order requests. Change order requests, as well as applications for payment, had to be approved by Stryker. Axenics submitted eight written change orders, which upon approval by Turner and Stryker, increased the contract price to $2,518,078. The change orders that increased the contract price contained the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">Through acceptance of this Change Order, [Axenics] acknowledges that it has reviewed the progress of the Work related to this Project and the potential impact of the added work on the progress of the project in the future. As a result, this Change Order includes compensation to [Axenics] for any and all effects, delays, inefficiencies or similar demands associated with this Project and [Axenics] recognizes that there is no basis for any such claim in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">Please note that all other terms and conditions of the subcontract remain unchanged and that all costs to maintain our original contract schedule with the inclusion of the adjusted scope of work as set forth by this change order are included within the lump sum change order amount stated herein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">Axenics later submitted a ninth change order, in the amount of $435,929, which it characterized as a \u201cClaim Settlement.\u201d The defendants did not pay this change order.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">In late 2004, a dispute arose when Axenics notified Turner of additional change orders related to delays and work that it believed to be outside the scope of the contract. Turner initially responded to Axenics\u2019 request with an email \u201crejecting the claim.\u201d However, during the next several months, Axenics worked with Turner to obtain payment from Stryker for these change orders. Stryker questioned some of the work for which Axenics sought payment and requested that Axenics submit backup documentation for its requests. Turner assisted Axenics in preparing a presentation for Stryker regarding the requested funds, and Axenics made its presentation to Stryker in April 2005. Before the presentation, Turner representatives provided Stryker with rebuttal to some of Axenics\u2019 requests for additional payment, but also told Stryker that it agreed with several of them. Subsequently, Stryker refused to pay Axenics the requested funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">In November 2007, Axenics sued the defendants, asserting that Turner had breached the subcontract when it failed to pay Axenics sums due. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Axenics also brought claims against Turner and Stryker for violation of the CPA and unjust enrichment. It sought $1.7 million in damages for materials, labor, equipment, and services as well as enhanced damages under the CPA and attorney\u2019s fees. In response, the defendants counterclaimed, alleging breach of contract and violations of the CPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">At the conclusion of the eighteen-day trial, in its post-trial memorandum Axenics alleged that \u201cTurner deviated from the . . . subcontract... in so many material respects\u201d that Turner had \u201cabandoned the [subcontract, and [Axenics], rather than declaring breach, continued working.\u201d According to Axenics, this reflected the parties\u2019 mutual agreement to abandon the subcontract, making unjust enrichment \u201cavailable to compensate [Axenics] for the benefits it conferred on Turner and Stryker through its work at the\u201d facility. Axenics further alleged that Turner breached the subcontract by intentionally delaying payments and failing to coordinate Axenics\u2019 work with that of the other subcontractors, which hindered and delayed Axenics\u2019 performance of its contractual duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The court issued a lengthy decision in which it found that neither party had abandoned the subcontract and ruled against Axenics on its breach of contract claim. However, the trial court ruled in favor of Axenics on its unjust enrichment claim, concluded that the defendants were jointly liable, and awarded Axenics $1,080,000 in restitution damages. With respect to Axenics\u2019 CPA claim, the court ruled \u201cthat neither Stryker\u2019s nor Turner\u2019s actions\u201d violated the CPA. Finally, the court ruled against the defendants on all of their counterclaims, including their request for attorney\u2019s fees. This appeal and cross-appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">On appeal, the defendants argue that the trial court erred in allowing Axenics to recover \u201cin unjust enrichment because a valid, express contract governed the precise subject matter of Axenics\u2019 unjust enrichment claim, and that contract was neither abandoned nor breached.\u201d They further contend that the court erred in finding them \u201cliable for unjust enrichment when they did not receive a benefit that would be unconscionable to retain,\u201d and \u201cthe record was devoid of any evidence showing the value of any extra-contractual benefit [they] purportedly received.\u201d Finally, they argue that the court violated New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 408 by failing to exclude evidence of an offer to compromise.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Axenics cross-appeals, arguing that the trial court erred in failing to find that the parties had abandoned the subcontract. In the alternative, Axenics argues that the trial court should have found \u201cthat Turner breached the [subcontract.\u201d Axenics also claims that, regardless of whether the subcontract was abandoned or breached, the trial court erred by not awarding it \u201cdamages measured by its costs plus reasonable profit, or $1.7 million.\u201d In addition, Axenics maintains that the trial court erred in failing to find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>the defendants violated the CPA. We first address the parties\u2019 arguments regarding abandonment and breach of contract and then turn to their arguments regarding unjust enrichment, damages, and the CPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">\n<em>I. Contract Abandonment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Axenics argues that the trial court erred in failing to find that the subcontract was abandoned because it was \u201creferred to by all parties on a \u2018guideline\u2019 basis if at all and was never adhered to by any of the parties.\u201d \u201cGenerally, contract abandonment occurs when both parties depart from the terms of the contract by mutual consent.\u201d <em>J.A. Jones Constr. v. Lehrer McGovern Bovis, </em>89 P.3d 1009, 1019 (Nev. 2004); <em>see Young v. Barry, </em>107 N.H. 294, 296 (1966). Abandonment \u201cmay be accomplished by express mutual consent or by implied consent through the actions of the parties.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien &amp; Gere Technical v. Fru-Con/Fluor Daniel, </em>380 F.3d 447, 455 (8th Cir. 2004) (quotation omitted) (applying Missouri law). \u201cWhere acts and conduct are relied on to constitute an abandonment, they must be positive, unequivocal and inconsistent with an intent to be further bound by the contract.\u201d <em>Fru-Con/Fluor Daniel v. Corrigan Brothers, </em>154 S.W.3d 330, 335 (Mo. Ct. App. 2004); <em>see also Harris v. IES Associates, Inc., </em>69 P.3d 297,308 (Utah Ct. App. 2003) (\u201cA contract may be [abandoned] by acts or conduct of the parties inconsistent with the continued existence of the contract.\u201d (quotation omitted)); 17A Am. JUR. 2d <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 528 (2004) (\u201cA contract will generally be treated as abandoned when one party acts in a manner inconsistent with the existence of the contract and the other party acquiesces in that behavior.\u201d). Abandonment of a construction contract may occur because of \u201cthe aggregation of numerous changes to the contract over time.\u201d <em>Clarendon America v. General Sec. Indem., </em>124 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1, 6 (Ct. App. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">\u201cAbandonment of a contract is a mixed question of law and fact; what constitutes an abandonment is a matter of law, and whether there has been an abandonment is a question of fact.\u201d 17A Am. JUR. 2d <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7 529. <em>But see J.A. Jones Constr., </em>89 P.3d at 1019 (\u201cThe issue of whether contract abandonment has occurred generally presents a question of fact.\u201d); <em>Fru-Con/Fluor Daniel, </em>154 S.W.3d at 335 (same). \u2018We will not overturn the trial court\u2019s ruling on a mixed question unless it is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Hogan Family Enters. v. Town of Rye, </em>157 N.H. 453, 456 (2008) (quotation omitted). If the cornt misapplies the law to its factual findings, however, we will review the matter <em>de novo. See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">In this case, there was no express agreement to abandon the contract. Rather, in support of its abandonment theory, Axenics points to specific instances where Axenics and Turner deviated from, or failed to follow, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>provisions of the subcontract, and it argues that the parties\u2019 conduct evinced an intention to abandon the subcontract. We disagree. Although there were a number of change orders that caused the work and its cost to differ from that to which the parties originally agreed, the scope of the work \u2014 the installation of process pipe \u2014 did not change. <em>See Clarendon America, </em>124 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 6 (finding there was no \u201cevidence that an excessive number of changes to the scope of work resulted in abandonment\u201d). In <em>Fru-Con/Fluor Daniel, </em>154 S.W.3d at 335, the Missouri Appeals Court found that, despite a large number of changes, the parties had not abandoned the construction contract because the contract itself allowed such changes. Likewise, the subcontract in this case contemplated that there might be changes to the work and its cost. Importantly, the subcontract also provided for possible schedule adjustments, delay, hindrances, and obstructions. Accordingly, the fact that there were numerous change orders does not evidence the parties\u2019 intent to abandon the subcontract. Moreover, there is no evidence that either party failed to preserve its rights under the contract. <em>See Clarendon America, </em>124 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 6 (finding no contract abandonment, in part, when underlying parties expressly retained rights under contract); <em>EMF General Contracting Corp. v. Bisbee, </em>774 N.Y.S.2d 39, 43 (App. Div. 2004) (citing cases in which abandonment was found when parties took steps inconsistent with enforcing their rights under contract). Under these circumstances, we conclude that the trial court correctly determined that the parties did not abandon the subcontract.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">\n<em>II. Breach of Contract</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Axenics next argues that the trial court erred in failing to find that Turner breached the subcontract. Axenics maintains that the trial court conflated breach of contract with contract abandonment, \u201cwhich led [it] to erroneously conclude that because it found no abandonment there was no breach, although the court\u2019s specific findings detailed numerous breaches.\u201d Thus, Axenics asserts that \u201cthe court failed to consider the elements of breach... and failed to consider whether Turner had breached the contract by any means other than abandoning it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">The defendants maintain that Axenics waived this issue by failing to raise it in its notice of cross-appeal. <em>See Progressive N. Ins. Co. v. Argonaut Ins. Co., </em>161 N.H. 778, 784 (2011). Axenics\u2019 notice of cross-appeal presented the question: \u201cDid the Superior Court err in determining that the parties had not abandoned the subject Subcontract?\u201d Supreme Court Rule 16(3)(b) provides, in relevant part</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-8\">While the statement of a question [in a brief] need not be worded exactly as it was in the appeal document, the question presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>shall be the same as the question previously set forth in the appeal document. The statement of a question presented will be deemed to include every subsidiary question fairly comprised therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Because of the fashion in which the trial court addressed Axenics\u2019 breach of contract and abandonment claims, we conclude that Axenics\u2019 abandonment question fairly encompasses the issue of whether the trial court erred in conflating abandonment with breach of contract. <em>Cf. In re Juvenile </em>2008-187, 151 N.H. 14, 16 (2004) (concluding that, under facts and circumstances of case, question of whether evidence of juvenile\u2019s <em>actus reus </em>was sufficient was \u201cinextricably linked with, and fairly comprise[d] a subsidiary question to, the ultimate issue of the sufficiency of the evidence as to the juvenile\u2019s <em>mens rea </em>with regard to that action\u201d). Accordingly, we will address this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">We agree with Axenics that the trial court conflated breach of contract and contract abandonment and, therefore, failed to rule specifically on Axenics\u2019 breach of contract claim. In its order, the trial court characterized Axenics\u2019 breach of contract claim as alleging \u201cthat Turner breached its contractual agreement by abandoning the contract.\u201d It then analyzed whether the parties had abandoned the subcontract, finding that \u201cneither Axenics nor Turner expressed any intent to abandon the contract,\u201d and concluding not only that \u201cthe contract was not abandoned,\u201d but that Turner had not breached the subcontract.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Whether the parties abandoned the subcontract, and whether Turner breached the subcontract, however, are two separate questions. As stated above, \u201ccontract abandonment occurs when both parties depart from the terms of the contract by mutual consent.\u201d <em>J.A. Jones Constr., </em>89 P.3d at 1019. On the other hand, \u201c[a] breach of contract occurs when there is a failure without legal excuse to perform any promise which forms the whole or part of a contract.\u201d <em>Lassonde v. Stanton, </em>157 N.H. 582, 588 (2008) (quotation and brackets omitted). Here, because the trial court conflated contract abandonment with contract breach, it failed to specifically address Axenics\u2019 claim that Turner breached the subcontract. We, therefore, vacate the trial court\u2019s finding against Axenics on its breach of contract claim and remand for the trial court to determine whether Turner breached the subcontract as alleged by Axenics. <em>See Barrows v. Boles, </em>141 N.H. 382, 388 (1996) (\u2018Whether conduct is a material breach is a question for the trier of fact to determine from the facts and circumstances of the case.\u201d (quotation and brackets omitted)). It is within the trial court\u2019s discretion as to whether it should hold an additional hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>\n<em>III. Unjust Enrichment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The defendants argue that the trial court erred in ruling that they were unjustly enriched. \u201cThe propriety of affording equitable relief in a particular case rests in the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Clapp v. Goffstown Sch. Dist., </em>159 N.H. 206, 210 (2009) (quotation omitted). Consequently, we review a trial court\u2019s equitable determination for an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>See id. </em>To show an unsustainable exercise of discretion, the defendants must demonstrate that the court\u2019s ruling was clearly unreasonable or untenable to the prejudice of their case. <em>Id. </em>Although the award of equitable relief is within the sound discretion of the trial court, that \u201cdiscretion must be exercised, not in opposition to, but in accordance with, established principles of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We will first address the trial court\u2019s finding that Turner was unjustly enriched and, therefore, liable to Axenics.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">\n<em>A. Turner</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The defendants maintain that the trial court erred in allowing recovery against Turner under the theory of unjust enrichment \u201cbecause the precise subject matter of Axenics\u2019 claim \u2014 the Extra Work purportedly performed in completing the piping installation \u2014 was covered by the parties\u2019 contract.\u201d Axenics counters that it was entitled to recover under a theory of unjust enrichment because the extra work that it performed was outside the scope of the subcontract.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Unjust enrichment is an equitable remedy that is available when an individual receives \u201ca benefit which would be <em>unconscionable </em>for him to retain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). It is not a boundless doctrine, but is, instead, \u201cnarrower, more predictable, and more objectively determined than the implications of the words unjust enrichment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). One general limitation is that unjust enrichment may not supplant the terms of an agreement. <em>Id. </em>It is a well-established principle that the court cannot allow recovery under a theory of unjust enrichment when there is a valid, express contract covering the subject matter at hand. <em>Id. </em>at 210-11; <em>see Singer Asset Finance Co. v. Wyner, </em>156 N.H. 468, 476 (2007) (finding that, in absence of valid and enforceable contract, trial court properly entered summary judgment for plaintiff on unjust enrichment claim). This is so because \u201cRestitution is ... subordinate to contract as an organizing principle of private relationships, and the terms of an enforceable agreement normally displace any claim of unjust enrichment within their reach.\u201d RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF RESTITUTION AND UNJUST ENRICHMENT \u00a7 2 comment c at 17 (2011). Nevertheless, unjust enrichment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>may be available to contracting parties if the benefit received is outside the scope of the contract. <em>Clapp, </em>159 N.H. at 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">We agree with the defendants that Axenics cannot recover against Turner under an unjust enrichment theory. The gravamen of Axenics\u2019 unjust enrichment claim is that Turner\u2019s failure to properly coordinate construction of the facility caused Axenics personnel to work overtime and to incur additional costs that it would not have had to incur in order to fulfill its obligations in a timely manner. This subject matter \u2014 Turner\u2019s responsibilities for coordinating changes to the work and Axenics\u2019 entitlement to payment for any resulting extra work it performed or extra costs it incurred \u2014 was addressed in the subcontract itself. Axenics does not argue that the ultimate contractual objective \u2014 installing process piping \u2014 changed during the course of the contract. Instead, it argues that to achieve that objective on time required extra work and costs. As laid out above, the terms of the subcontract expressly addressed the possibility of delays and hindrances as well as the process by which Axenics would receive payment for any extra work that it performed because of change orders. The subcontract also established a mechanism for proceeding when Axenics believed the \u201cwork to be beyond the scope of\u2019 the subcontract, and delineated Turner\u2019s responsibilities for coordinating changes to the work. Since the subcontract governed the subject of Axenics\u2019 unjust enrichment claim, and the subcontract was not abandoned by the parties, the trial court erred in allowing Axenics to recover against Turner under a theory of unjust enrichment. <em>See id. </em>at 211-12; <em>ADP Marshall, Inc. v. Noresco, LLC, </em>710 F. Supp. 2d 197, 230 (D.R.I. 2010) (applying Rhode Island law and finding that subcontractor could not recover against general contractor under theory of unjust enrichment when majority of subcontractor\u2019s claims were based upon work that was within scope of parties\u2019 agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Axenics argues that the parties orally modified the change order process set forth in the subcontract and that the extra work it performed pursuant to the modifications necessarily fell outside the scope of the subcontract. It asserts, therefore, that it is entitled to unjust enrichment damages. As discussed above, we disagree that the extra work performed fell outside the scope of the subcontract. Simply because the parties may have orally modified the change order <em>process </em>does not render the <em>work </em>Axenics performed after such modifications outside the scope of the subcontract itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Axenics further relies upon <em>R.J. Berke &amp; Co. v. J.P. Griffin, Inc., </em>116 N.H. 760 (1976), in arguing that it is entitled to recover against Turner on a theory of unjust enrichment. In <em>R.J. Berke, </em>we held that <em>quantum meruit </em>is a restitutionary remedy available to a party that materially breaches a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>contract, and thus, has no contract remedies. <em>R.J. Berke, </em>116 N.H. at 764. This holding does not support Axenics\u2019 argument. Here, Axenics does not argue that <em>it </em>breached the subcontract, is therefore without contract remedies, and, consequently, would be entitled to recover the value of the labor and materials furnished under the breached subcontract. Rather, Axenics claims that \u201cthe parties orally modified the change order procedure for Axenics\u2019 extra work and that the extra work fell outside the scope of the Subcontract.\u201d Thus, <em>R.J. Berke </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Axenics\u2019 reliance upon <em>Puritan Mills, Inc. v. Pickering Construction Co., </em>262 S.E.2d 586 (Ga. Ct. App. 1979), is also misplaced. In <em>Puritan Mills, </em>the defendant entered into a contract with the plaintiff to construct loading docks. <em>Puritan Mills, </em>262 S.E.2d at 587. Upon completion, the defendant sought recovery against the plaintiff in <em>quantum meruit </em>for expenses incurred resulting from a change order, which required the removal of rock. <em>Id. </em>The Georgia Court of Appeals found that \u201c[t]he contract between the parties clearly set[] forth the work to be performed and none of the five items describing the work or the drawings reflect[ed] the removal of rock as a part of the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, since the contract did not contemplate the removal of rock, and there was no question that the plaintiff knowingly accepted the defendant\u2019s services in removing the rock, the court upheld the trial court\u2019s monetary award for the reasonable value of removal of rock. <em>Id. </em>at 587-88. Here, however, the subcontract addressed the subject matter of Axenics\u2019 unjust enrichment claim. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision finding Turner liable to Axenics on its theory of unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">\n<em>B. Stryker</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The defendants further argue that Axenics\u2019 \u201cunjust enrichment claim [against Stryker] must fail as a matter of law because [Stryker] has paid for the contractual benefit it received \u2014 the construction of [the facility] according to [the] contract.\u201d They maintain that any benefit received by Stryker was both bargained and paid for and that Stryker, therefore, should not be required to \u201cmake restitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">\u201cThe party seeking restitution must establish not only unjust enrichment, but that the person sought to be charged had wrongfifily secured a benefit or passively received one which it would be unconscionable to retain...\u201d <em>Gen. Insulation Co. v. Eckman Constr., </em>159 N.H. 601, 611 (2010) (quotation omitted)). When, as here, no express contractual relationship exists between the parties, \u201ca trial court may require an individual to make restitution for unjust enrichment if he has received a benefit that would be unconscionable to retain.\u201d <em>Pella Windows and Doors v. Farad, </em>133 N.H. 585, 586 (1990) (quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>\u201c[T]he circumstances under which an unjust enrichment claim maybe brought by a subcontractor against an owner, absent privity, are . . . limited.\u201d <em>Haz-Mat Response v. Certified Waste Serv., </em>910 P.2d 839, 847 (Kan. 1996). There may be \u201cspecial circumstances that would justify requiring the owner to pay,\u201d such as when the owner accepts \u201cbenefits rendered under such circumstances as reasonably notify the owner that the one performing such services expected to be compensated therefor by the owner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-5\">[t]he general rule in this area is that a subcontractor who furnishes material or labor pursuant to an agreement with, or upon the order and credit of[,] a general contractor cannot recover against the property owner upon the basis of an implied promise to pay arising from the owner\u2019s receipt and acceptance of the benefit of the material and labor furnished.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-6\"><em>Great Plains Equipment v. N.W. Pipeline, </em>979 P.2d 627, 641 (Idaho 1999) (quotation omitted); <em>see also A &amp; V 125 LLC Contracting v. RED 55th St., </em>830 N.Y.S.2d 637, 646 (Sup. Ct. 2007) (\u201cIt is a firmly established principle that a property owner who contracts with a general contractor does not become liable to a subcontractor on a quasi-contract theory unless it <em>expressly </em>consents to pay for the subcontractor\u2019s performance.\u201d (quotation and brackets omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Consistent with this rule, other courts have found that \u201c[w]here an owner has fulfilled its financial obligation to a general contractor, a subcontractor cannot rely on the owner to satisfy the relationship between the subcontractor and the general.\u201d <em>DJ Painting v. Baraw Enterprises, </em>776 A.2d 413, 418 (Vt. 2001) (collecting cases). This is so, in part, because \u201c[t]he point of hiring a general contractor for a construction job is for the general to manage the job and hire the subcontractors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 419. \u201cThe owner pays the general contractor, but if the general does not pay the subcontractors, the subcontractors have the statutory lien mechanism to attach money as yet unpaid to the general contractor.\u201d <em>Id.', see </em>RSA 447:5 (Supp. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">Here, there appears to be no dispute that Stryker has fulfilled its financial obligation to Turner. Nor is there any indication that Stryker accepted benefits under circumstances reasonably notifying it that Axenics expected to be compensated directly by Stryker rather than by Turner. While the trial court found that Stryker \u201cthanked all of the subcontractors for staying on schedule despite several problems that occurred,\u201d the court\u2019s reliance on this finding to support its award against Stryker is misplaced. In our view, Stryker\u2019s expression of gratitude does not demonstrate that Stryker had knowledge that it would be directly liable to Axenics for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>cost of additional work requested by Turner; to the contrary, this finding arguably supports the conclusion that Stryker did not expect to pay additional sums directly to subcontractors such as Axenics. Thus, there is no evidence that Stryker accepted a benefit that would be unconscionable to retain. <em>See Pella Windows and Doors, </em>133 N.H. at 586; <em>see also S &amp; M Rotogravure Service, Inc. v. Baer, </em>252 N.W.2d 913, 916-18 (Wis. 1977) (reviewing cases involving actions for money by subcontractors against property owners upon whose property subcontractor had performed construction work pursuant to agreement with general contractor and finding rationale to be that when \u201cthe defendant had paid another for the benefits conferred, ... it was not inequitable to permit the defendant to retain the benefits without paying the plaintiff\u2019). Indeed, as the trial court itself found, what Stryker \u201creceived was a project completed on time and in accordance with the contract specifications.\u201d Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred in allowing Axenics to recover against Stryker under a theory of unjust enrichment. We, therefore, reverse its decision with respect to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">In view of our rulings that the trial court erred in finding the defendants liable under the theory of unjust enrichment, we need not address Axenics\u2019 argument concerning the proper measure of damages under that theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">\n<em>IV. Damages \u2014Admission of Internal Memoranda</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The defendants argue that the trial court erred in admitting and considering as evidence of damages a communication regarding an offer to compromise in contravention of New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 408. Because this issue may arise on remand, we address it. <em>See George v. Al Hoyt &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>162 N.H. 123, 138 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">At trial, Axenics sought to admit an internal email memorandum composed by Turner, which listed possible contribution amounts from both Turner and Stryker toward a potential settlement with Axenics. The defendants objected on the ground that the memorandum constituted a statement made in compromise negotiations and, thus, was inadmissible under New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 408. The trial court overruled the defendants\u2019 objection, finding that because the memorandum \u201cwas never communicated to the . . . other side,\u201d it was not a statement made in compromise negotiations. In its final order, the court reaffirmed this ruling and relied upon the memorandum in its determination of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 408 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-10\">[E]vidence of (1) furnishing or offering or promising to furnish, or (2) accepting or offering or promising to accept, a valuable consideration in compromising or attempting to compromise a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>claim which was disputed as to either validity or amount, is not admissible to prove liability for or invalidity of the claim or its amount.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">Evidence of conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations is likewise not admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The Rule \u201cstates the basic proposition that evidence of compromise offers[,] compromise agreements, and conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations is inadmissible on questions of liability and damages.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 408 Reporter\u2019s Notes. \u201cThe Rule . . . reflects both doubt as to the probative value of the fact of settlement and a policy to encourage settlements.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">To the extent that Axenics argues that the internal memorandum did not constitute a statement made to compromise the claim or during compromise negotiations, we disagree. The language in the memorandum demonstrates that the amounts listed were under consideration by the defendants as part of a settlement package to be submitted to Axenics. <em>Cf. Slattery v. Norwood Realty, </em>145 N.H. 447, 450 (2000) (finding that statement was not offer to compromise disputed claim but was admission of contractual obligations). The trial court itself observed that the memorandum \u201csuggests an \u2018offer\u2019 to settle the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">We have not had occasion to address whether an internal memorandum, evincing an offer to compromise, which has not been disclosed to the opposing party, is protected under Rule 408. However, \u201c[t]he [federal] circuits that have addressed this issue have agreed that internal memoranda, although not communicated to the opposing side, are encompassed within\u201d the similar Federal Rule of Evidence 408. <em>Xcoal Energy &amp; Resources, LP v. Smith, </em>635 F. Supp. 2d 453, 454 (W.D. Va. 2009) (discussing cases from the Third, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, and Eleventh Circuits). Conversely, in <em>Blue Circle Atlantic v. Falcon Materials, </em>760 F. Supp. 516, 522 (D. Md. 1991), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>960 F.2d 145 (4th Cir. 1992) (unpublished opinion), the United States District Court for the District of Maryland ruled that Federal Rule of Evidence 408 \u201cdoes not apply to internal memoranda unless communicated to the other side in an attempt at settlement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">We now join the federal circuits in concluding that the policy objectives of Rule 408 weigh in favor of exclusion of internal memoranda prepared for the purpose of compromise negotiations. \u201cThe spirit of the Rule, as recognized by several circuits and as set forth in the commentary to the Rule, supports the exclusion of certain work product, internal memos, and other materials created specifically for the purpose of concili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>ation, even if not communicated to the other party.\u201d <em>Xcoal Energy &amp; Resources, LP, </em>635 F. Supp. 2d at 454 (quotation omitted). Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred in admitting the internal memorandum outlining the defendants\u2019 possible contributions to a settlement with Axenics. Since we have found the internal memorandum was admitted in error, we further find that the trial court erred in relying upon it in assessing damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">\n<em>V. CPA Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Finally, Axenics challenges the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendants did not violate the CPA. \u201cThe trial court\u2019s findings of fact and rulings of law will be upheld unless they lack evidentiary support or constitute clear error of law.\u201d <em>George, </em>162 N.H. at 129 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Axenics argues that the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendants\u2019 conduct did not violate the CPA was erroneous \u201cas a matter of law because the court did not make adequate findings\u201d and \u201cmerely jumped to an unsupported conclusion.\u201d Axenics maintains that Turner instructed it to perform extra work, which was necessary to complete the facility on time, and \u201cthen secretly subvert[ed] Axenics\u2019 legitimate efforts to be paid.\u201d Specifically, Axenics asserts that Turner assured Axenics that it would support Axenics\u2019 claims for payment from Stryker for the extra work performed and \u201cthen presented [a] rebuttal to Stryker without disclosing to Axenics the existence of the rebuttal or that Turner had given it to Stryker.\u201d According to Axenics, these actions constituted unfair or deceptive acts under the CPA. Axenics also argues that \u201c[g]iven [the defendants\u2019] business sophistication and the length and breadth of the steps each took to subvert, delay, and deny Axenics\u2019 claims, the only reasonable conclusion is that their [conduct] constitutes a willful or knowing violation of the [CPA],\u201d entitling Axenics to exemplary damages. We note that the parties do not dispute on appeal that RSA chapter 358-A applies. .</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\"> RSA 358-A:2 (2009) states that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to use any unfair method of competition or any unfair or deceptive act or practice in the conduct of any trade or commerce within this state.\u201d We have previously recognized that, although this provision is broadly worded, not all conduct in the course of trade or commerce falls within its scope. <em>Id. </em>\u201cAn ordinary breach of contract claim, for example, is not a violation of the CPA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). In determining which commercial actions not specifically delineated are covered by the CPA, we have employed the \u201crascality\u201d test. <em>Id. </em>Under the rascality test, \u201cthe objectionable conduct must attain a level of rascality that would raise an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>eyebrow of someone inured to the rough and tumble of the world of commerce.\u201d <em>Becksted v. Nadeau, </em>155 N.H. 615, 619 (2007) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Here, the trial court found that Turner\u2019s conduct in attempting to rebut certain claims by Axenics for payment for the extra work it performed \u201cmay have been unjustified or inaccurate based on its own failure to coordinate, but neither Turner\u2019s nor Stryker\u2019s behavior rose to the level of rascality required under the\u201d CPA. Although the court noted Axenics\u2019 allegation that \u201cTurner <em>never </em>requested additional funds from Stryker\u201d for the extra work performed by Axenics, it ultimately found that was \u201cnot the case.\u201d The court found that \u201cTurner merely requested back-up from Axenics [to support its claims for payment] and provided Stryker with a rebuttal to some of Axenics\u2019 claims.\u201d Indeed, the court found that Turner provided documentation to Stryker concerning Axenics\u2019 claims for payment, \u201cstating that many of Axenics\u2019 claims had merit.\u201d The trial court further found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-6\">Although Turner\u2019s own documents suggest that it knew that Axenics\u2019 claim had value, Axenics did a poor job of documenting why its claims exceeded the amount bid. Moreover, both the documents introduced at trial and the public record of the litigation established] a level of brinkmanship and hard bargaining, by both sides, which is hardly commendable, but far from uncommon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">These findings are sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s ultimate conclusion \u201cthat the parties\u2019 conduct, in the context of the \u2018rough and tumble\u2019 construction business, did not violate the CPA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Moreover, the record supports the trial court\u2019s findings that Turner made efforts to collect and organize back-up documents to support some of Axenics\u2019 claims for payment, and that Turner supported the validity of some of Axenics\u2019 claims for payment. In addition, trial testimony indicated that \u201cthere was no secret\u201d that Turner was going to review the back-up. Although Turner did not inform Axenics that it was preparing a rebuttal to some of Axenics\u2019 claims because it believed it \u201chad an obligation to Stryker to review the backup and present it to them,\u201d this conduct is not of the type proscribed by the CPA. <em>Cf. State v. Moran, </em>151 N.H. 450, 453-54 (2004) (defendant violated CPA by inducing homeowners to enter into contract with him to install siding when he did not intend to perform work, and he made misrepresentations to homeowners in effort to avoid performing work or refunding deposit).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">Axenics further contends that certain of the defendants\u2019 litigation strategies violated the CPA because they were \u201cunfair\u201d and were \u201cdesigned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>to further delay the adjudication of Axenics\u2019 claim and make the litigation prohibitively expensive.\u201d Assuming, without deciding, that unfair litigation tactics fall within the scope of the CPA, Axenics has failed to demonstrate that the defendants\u2019 litigation tactics in this case were so egregious as to satisfy the rascality test. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in finding that the defendants did not act \u201cin a way that would raise an eyebrow of someone inured to the rough and tumble of the world of commerce.\u201d <em>Boles, </em>141 N.H. at 391 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; reversed in part; vacated in part; and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b701-6\">Dalianis, C.J., and HICKS, CONBOY and LYNN, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
