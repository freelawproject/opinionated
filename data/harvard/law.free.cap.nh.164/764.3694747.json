We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The following facts are undisputed. The petitioner owns and operates a 36,541 square foot supermarket on Route 101 in Bedford\u2019s commercial district. The petitioner obtained planning board approval for its supermarket in November 2006, shortly after the Town of Bedford (Town) enacted a zoning ordinance amendment restricting the size of any single building in the commercial district to 40,000 square feet. Retail Management and Development, Inc. (RMD), the intervenor in this case, develops supermarkets for Demoulas Super Markets, Inc. In November 2010, RMD filed an application with the ZBA seeking a variance to exceed the 40,000 square foot restriction in order to construct a 78,332 square foot supermarket on Route 114 in the commercial district. The location of RMD\u2019s proposed supermarket is 3.8 miles from the petitioner\u2019s supermarket.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Although the petitioner objected to the variance application, the ZBA granted it. The ZBA found, among other things, that the \u201cspirit of the ordinance\u201d was intended to limit the size of buildings on Route 101, but not on Route 114, where RMD sought to build. In doing so, it accepted RMD\u2019s arguments that: the area on Route 101 where the petitioner\u2019s property is located cannot support buildings with a footprint larger than 40,000 square feet due to the limited depth of the commercial zone along Route 101; there was a desire to maintain the \u201crural character\u201d of the area and to avoid \u201cmassing,\u201d or visual takeover of the area; and RMD\u2019s seventeen-acre parcel on Route 114 is a \u201cunique piece\u201d of commercially zoned land surrounded by industrial properties. The ZBA denied the petitioner\u2019s motion for rehearing, finding that the petitioner was not a \u201cperson directly affected\u201d by its decision and, thus, lacked standing to move for rehearing. <em>See </em>RSA 677:2 (Supp. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">The petitioner appealed to the superior court under RSA 677:4, which allows appeal by \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by any order or decision of the zoning board of adjustment.\u201d The Town and RMD moved to dismiss the petitioner\u2019s appeal, arguing that the petitioner lacked standing under RSA 677:4. The trial court granted the motion, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\"> The petitioner argues that the trial court erred in dismissing its appeal based upon a lack of standing. When a motion to dismiss challenges a petitioner\u2019s standing to sue, the trial court must look beyond the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>petitioner\u2019s allegations and determine, based on the facts, whether the petitioner has sufficiently demonstrated its right to claim relief. <em>Johnson v. Town of Wolfeboro Planning Bd., </em>157 N.H. 94, 96 (2008). Under RSA 677:4, \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved\u201d by an order of a zoning board of adjustment may petition the superior court for review. A \u201c \u2018person aggrieved\u2019 includes any party entitled to request a rehearing under RSA 677:2.\u201d RSA 677:4. Under RSA 677:2, a person entitled to apply for rehearing includes \u201cany party to the action or proceedings, or any person directly affected thereby.\u201d Here, the petitioner does not argue that it has standing as a \u201cparty to the action\u201d; thus, we consider whether the petitioner is a \u201cperson directly affected\u201d by the ZBA\u2019s decision. To prove that it is a \u201cperson directly affected\u201d for standing purposes, the appealing party must show \u201csome direct, definite interest in the outcome of the action or proceeding.\u201d <em>Golf Course Investors of NH v. Town of Jaffrey, </em>161 N.H. 675, 680 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">\u201cWhether a person\u2019s interest in the challenged administrative action is sufficient to confer standing is a factual determination to be undertaken on a case by case basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When evaluating whether an appealing party has standing in this context, we consider the following factors: (1) the proximity of the challenging party\u2019s property to the subject site; (2) the type of change proposed; (3) the immediacy of the injury claimed; and (4) the challenging party\u2019s participation in the administrative hearings. <em>See Weeks Restaurant Corp. v. City of Dover, </em>119 N.H. 541, 545 (1979). This list is not exhaustive; we also consider any other relevant factors bearing on whether the appealing party has a direct, definite interest in the outcome of the proceeding. <em>See id. </em>at 544-45. We generally review the trial court\u2019s factual findings deferentially, <em>see Richmond v. Hutchinson, </em>149 N.H. 749, 751 (2003); however, where, as here, \u201cthe underlying facts are not in dispute, we review the trial court\u2019s [standing] determination <em>de novo.\u201d Johnson, </em>157 N.H. at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">We begin by evaluating the undisputed facts in light of the <em>Weeks </em>factors. First, the petitioner concedes that because it is located 3.8 miles away from RMD\u2019s development site, it lacks proximity. Regarding the \u201ctype of change proposed\u201d by RMD, there is no question that it is substantial: it seeks to construct a building nearly double the 40,000 square foot restriction. Thus, the second factor weighs in the petitioner\u2019s favor. Further, because the petitioner actively participated in the initial ZBA hearings, the fourth factor weighs in its favor. <em>See Weeks, </em>119 N.H. at 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The petitioner focuses its argument on the third <em>Weeks </em>factor \u2014 \u201cimmediacy of the injury claimed,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u2014 as to which it advances two arguments. The petitioner first argues that the ZBA and RMD conferred standing upon it by \u201cdirectly referencing and implicating [the petitioner\u2019s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>business interests, property interests and development rights.\u201d Specifically, the petitioner points out that when considering the \u201cspirit of the ordinance\u201d requirement for granting a variance, <em>see </em>RSA 674:33,1(b) (Supp. 2012), the ZBA drew a comparison between the petitioner\u2019s location on Route 101 and RMD\u2019s proposed location on Route 114, finding that the ordinance was intended to limit the size of buildings on Route 101 but not on Route 114. The petitioner argues that \u201cbecause this comparison occurred in the context of the \u2018spirit of the ordinance\u2019 \u201d analysis (rather than the \u201cunnecessary hardship\u201d analysis based upon the property\u2019s unique physical conditions, <em>see Chester Rod &amp; Gun Club v. Town of Chester, </em>152 N.H. 577, 580 (2005)), the ZBA created a policy-setting and precedential interpretation that \u201cwill form the basis of future determinations about variances from the 40,000 square foot requirement,\u201d thereby limiting the petitioner\u2019s \u201coperations and future expansion options.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">We disagree that the ZBA\u2019s comparison of the petitioner\u2019s location in the district to RMD\u2019s proposed location establishes sufficient injury to confer standing. To accept the petitioner\u2019s argument would disregard our statutory mandate to limit standing to persons \u201cdirectly affected\u201d by the ZBA\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>RSA 677:2, :4. In evaluating any petition for a variance, the ZBA is required to determine whether the proposal complies with the \u201cspirit of the ordinance.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 674:33,1(b)(2). \u201c[F]or a variance to be... inconsistent with the spirit of the ordinance, its grant must violate the ordinance\u2019s basic zoning objectives.\u201d <em>Harborside </em>Assocs. v. <em>Parade Residence Hotel, </em>162 N.H. 508, 514 (2011) (quotation omitted). \u201c[Ojne way to ascertain whether granting the variance would violate basic zoning objectives is to examine whether it would alter the essential character of the locality.\u201d <em>Farrar v. City of Keene, </em>158 N.H. 684, 691 (2009) (quotation omitted). Thus, one of the accepted ways for the ZBA to accomplish its task of evaluating the merits of RMD\u2019s variance petition is to consider the character of the locality.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\"> Under the petitioner\u2019s rationale, <em>any </em>property owner within the zoning district whose property is considered in the ZBA\u2019s evaluation of the \u201ccharacter of the locality\u201d would have standing to appeal. This is not the state of our law. \u201c[W]hen the issue of standing is raised, the party challenging the administrative action ... must sufficiently demonstrate his or her right to claim relief\u2019 by demonstrating \u201csome direct, definite interest in the outcome of the action or proceeding.\u201d <em>Golf Course Investors, </em>161 N.H. at 680. \u201cStanding will not be extended to all persons in the community who might feel that they are hurt by a local administrator\u2019s decision.\u201d Goldstein v. <em>Town of Bedford, </em>154 N.H. 393, 395 (2006) (brackets and quotation omitted). The ZBA identified a characteristic of RMD\u2019s property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>that it found made a variance consistent with the spirit of the ordinance: its location on Route 114. In the process, the ZBA also identified a feature of the petitioner\u2019s property that may make it less likely to obtain a variance should it apply for one in the future: its location on Route 101. At most, the petitioner had only a generalized interest in the outcome of the ZBA proceedings. Such generalized interest is insufficient to confer standing. <em>See, e.g., Nautilus of Exeter v. Town of Exeter, </em>139 N.H. 450, 451-52 (1995) (rejecting petitioners\u2019 argument \u201cthat their status as citizens of the town, property owners, taxpayers, and owners of a business within the commercial district gave them standing to raise issues concerning the proper application and use of zoning districts,\u201d concluding that the only adverse impact on petitioners was increased business competition).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Indeed, to have standing, a party is required to identify an \u201cinjury that [its] particular property] would incur\u201d as a result of the administrative decision. <em>See Golf Course Investors, </em>161 N.H. at 683; <em>see also Appeal of Londonderry Neighborhood Coalition, </em>145 N.H. 201,203 (2000) (\u201cIn order to have standing to appeal a decision of an administrative agency denying a motion for rehearing, an appellant must demonstrate that the appellant has suffered or will suffer an injury in fact.\u201d). The petitioner argues that the ZBA\u2019s interpretation will directly affect its operations and <em>future </em>expansion options; yet, it does not specify when or even if it actually intends to expand its supermarket beyond 40,000 square feet. Thus, the petitioner\u2019s claimed injury is, at most, \u201cspeculative,\u201d and \u201cdoes not give rise to a \u2018definite\u2019 interest in the outcome of th[e] appeal.\u201d <em>Joyce v. Town of Weare, </em>156 N.H. 526, 530 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">The petitioner also argues that it has suffered a direct injury because the ZBA\u2019s decision allows for \u201cunfair or illegal\u201d competition. The petitioner acknowledges that \u201cincreased\u201d business competition is not a type of harm sufficient to confer standing. <em>See Nautilus, </em>139 N.H. at 452; <em>see also Weeks, </em>119 N.H. at 545 (\u201c[I]njury resulting from competition is rarely classified as a legal harm but rather is deemed a natural risk in our free enterprise economy.\u201d). In arguing that this case presents an issue of unfair or illegal competition, the petitioner draws the following distinction: increased competition from a conforming 40,000 square foot business in the district would not confer standing; however, competition from a 78,332 square foot supermarket under an illegally-granted variance from a generally-applicable zoning restriction does confer standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">The petitioner\u2019s argument is unavailing. The petitioner contends that its injury stems from unfair or illegal competition by RMD. What makes the competition unfair or illegal, according to the petitioner, is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>the ZBA granted RMD a variance from a \u201cgenerally-applicable\u201d zoning ordinance. Yet, a variance by definition grants authority to the owner to use its property in a manner that otherwise contravenes generally-applicable zoning ordinances. <em>See New London v. Leskiewicz, </em>110 N.H. 462, 466 (1970). In effect, the petitioner argues that any business should be permitted to challenge the validity of any ZBA decision to grant a variance to a competitor. This argument improperly conflates the merits of an appeal with the standing requirement: according to the petitioner, because it alleges that the ZBA\u2019s decision is unlawful, it has standing to appeal. We reject such a standard. <em>See Weeks, </em>119 N.H. at 545 (whether an appealing party is a \u201cproper party\u201d is a question \u201cseparate from the merits of the appeal\u201d). An appeal of a ZBA decision is not a weapon to be used to stifle business competition. <em>See Nautilus, </em>139 N.H. at 452. Thus, the petitioner fails to allege any concrete injury to its particular property, and the third <em>Weeks </em>factor weighs against standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Although the second and fourth <em>Weeks </em>factors weigh in favor of standing, we conclude that because the petitioner lacks proximity and has failed to allege any concrete injury to its particular property as a result of the ZBA\u2019s determination, the <em>Weeks </em>factors, on balance, do not support the petitioner\u2019s standing to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">In addition to the <em>Weeks </em>factors, we also consider any other factors relevant to evaluating whether the petitioner has a direct, definite interest in the outcome. <em>See Weeks, </em>119 N.H. at 544-45. Here, the petitioner asserts two additional grounds in support of its standing argument. First is its claim under the State Constitution\u2019s Equal Protection Clause and RSA 674:20 (2008). The petitioner argues that under these provisions, it has a direct interest in seeing that zoning regulations relating to the commercial district are applied even-handedly, so that all property owners in the commercial district stand on equal footing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">\u201cAn equal protection challenge to an ordinance is an assertion that the government impermissibly established classifications and, therefore, treated similarly situated individuals in a different manner.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Town of Plaistow, </em>152 N.H. 142, 146 (2005) (brackets omitted). Similarly, RSA 674:20 provides, \u201cAll regulations shall be uniform for each class or kind of buildings throughout each district.\u201d The trial court rejected the petitioner\u2019s argument on the ground that the petitioner was not \u201csimilarly situated\u201d to RMD because \u201cit never applied for a variance from the limitation on square footage.\u201d The petitioner argues that it need not show that it applied for a variance to be \u201csimilarly situated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">Whether the petitioner is \u201csimilarly situated,\u201d however, is relevant only to the merits of the petitioner\u2019s claim and does not address the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>threshold issue of standing. In other words, merely alleging violations of the Equal Protection Clause and RSA 674:20 does not confer standing to challenge the ZBA\u2019s decision. There is no provision in RSA 674:20 relieving the petitioner from its burden to prove standing under RSA 677:4. Even when a constitutional challenge is alleged, an appealing party must prove that its \u201cown personal rights have been or will be <em>directly and specifically affected!\u2019 Appeal of Richards, </em>134 N.H. 148, 154 (1991) (emphasis added); <em>see also Joyce, </em>156 N.H. at 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">The petitioner has failed to show how the ZBA\u2019s decision has directly and specifically affected its own rights. It asserts only that it has a right to ensure that all owners in the district \u201cstand on an equal footing.\u201d In <em>Golf Course Investors, </em>we rejected a similarly broad argument, finding that residents do not have standing to prevent an administrative body from approving plans on the basis that, in the residents\u2019 view, the plans would violate a Town ordinance. <em>See Golf Course Investors, </em>161 N.H. at 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">The petitioner contends that if it does not have standing to appeal under the Equal Protection Clause or RSA 674:20, then \u201cno person within a zoning district could challenge a zoning ordinance which was applied in a discriminatory manner.\u201d We disagree. Simply because the petitioner fails to sustain its burden to prove standing does not mean that others in the district would not be able to challenge ordinances applied in a discriminatory manner. So long as an appealing party can establish a direct injury to its own property or rights, that party will have standing to assert a challenge. <em>See Appeal of Richards, </em>134 N.H. at 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Finally, the petitioner contends that it has standing because the ZBA acted in a \u201cquasi-judicial capacity\u201d when it granted RMD a variance. It distinguishes a zoning board of adjustment\u2019s role in considering a variance request from a planning board\u2019s role in evaluating site plans. It maintains that \u201cwhen granting a variance, a zoning board is by definition establishing the relative rights of similarly-situated parties in the same zone, and setting precedent for future action.\u201d Assuming that there is any meaningful distinction, for standing purposes, between a zoning board of adjustment\u2019s role in considering variance requests and a planning board\u2019s role in evaluating site plans, <em>but see Weeks, </em>119 N.H. at 544 (\u201cThe interests of the parties and the type of issues presented in a site plan review do not differ substantially from those present in the granting of a special exception or a variance, and no rationale appears for a different definition of persons entitled to appeal.\u201d), the petitioner again has not identified any direct interest in the outcome of the ZBA\u2019s decision. By its own admission, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>the petitioner is concerned only with possible \u201cfuture action.\u201d This indefinite interest does not support standing to appeal the ZBA\u2019s determination. <em>See Joyce, </em>156 N.H. at 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Based upon the foregoing, we conclude that the petitioner has failed to demonstrate that it has a \u201cdirect, definite interest in the outcome of the [ZBA\u2019s] action,\u201d <em>Golf Course Investors, </em>161 N.H. at 680; thus, it lacks standing to appeal the ZBA\u2019s decision under RSA 677:4. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in granting the joint dismissal motion of the Town and RMD.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b796-7\">Dalianis, C.J., and HICKS, LYNN and BASSETT, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
