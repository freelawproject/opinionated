He argues that the trial court erred in finding that Alderberry Lane in Moultonborough, where the accident resulting in his arrest occurred, is a \u201cway\u201d for purposes of the DWI statute. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>The following facts are derived from the record. In September 2010, the defendant was returning to his home on Alderberry Lane after having dinner and \u201ca few drinks\u201d at a Chinese restaurant. He failed to make the turn into his driveway and went off the road, over a concrete barrier, and into a utility box.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">A couple visiting family on the street discovered the car with its door open and wheels spinning. Because the driver appeared to be unconscious, the couple called 911. Emergency responders and the Moultonborough police were dispatched to the scene. One of the officers approached the vehicle to try to elicit a response from the defendant. When he did so, he observed that the defendant\u2019s breath smelled strongly of alcohol, his speech was extremely slurred, his eyes were bloodshot, his face was flushed, and, after being removed from his vehicle, he could not walk on his own and had to be carried to the cruiser. As a result, the defendant was charged with \u201cdriv[ing] a vehicle, a 2000 Mercedes Benz 4-door, upon a way, Alderberry Lane, while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Before trial, the defendant presented notice of his demand for formal proof that Alderberry Lane is a \u201cway\u201d as defined in RSA 259:125 (Supp. 2012). <em>See </em>DlST. Div. R. 1.22. The trial court determined that Alderberry Lane is a \u201cway\u201d for purposes of the DWI statute and found him guilty of DWI. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Alderberry Lane is in a subdivision on Lake Winnipesaukee in Moultonborough. A large sign posted at the entrance identifies the community as: \u201cWildwood On Winnipesaukee[.] A Private Community.\u201d In addition, a sign nearby reads: \u201cSTOP[.] DO NOT ENTER[.] PRIVATE ROAD[.] MEMBERS &amp; GUESTS ONLY.\u201d Although these signs indicate that Wildwood is privately-owned, no gates or bars prevent entrance to the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">RSA 259:125, II defines \u201cway,\u201d in pertinent part, as \u201cany privately owned and maintained way open for public use.\u201d The sole issue on appeal is whether Alderberry Lane is \u201copen for public use\u201d and, therefore, a \u201cway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">The interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we decide <em>de novo. State v. Brooks, </em>164 N.H. 272, 291 (2012). In matters of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of a statute considered as a whole. <em>Id. </em>We first examine the language of the statute, and, when possible, ascribe the plain and ordinary meanings to the words used. <em>State v. Moussa, </em>164 N.H. 108, 128 (2012). Our goal is to apply statutes in light of the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting them and in light of the policy sought to be advanced by the entire statutory scheme. <em>State v. Brooks, </em>164 N.H. at 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">Focusing upon the private nature of the community, the defendant argues that Alderberry Lane is not \u201copen for public use\u201d because it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>posted against trespass and available for travel only to residents, guests, and specific invitees, such as delivery persons, municipal snow plow drivers, and emergency vehicles. As the defendant suggests, \u201copen\u201d can mean \u201crequiring no special status, identification, or permit for entry or participation.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1579 (unabridged ed. 2002). Here, he maintains, because only members, guests, and a loosely defined category of invitees are permitted to use the road, it is not \u201copen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The State counters, however, that the question is not whether members of the public have the right to access the road but, rather, whether the road is open for public use. It asserts that the road is \u201copen\u201d because there is no physical impediment to enter the road and travel on it. Pointing to a dictionary definition of \u201copen,\u201d the State contends that the road is \u201cso arranged or governed as to permit ingress, egress, or passage\u201d and, is, therefore, \u201copen.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">We conclude that both proffered interpretations of the statute are reasonable in the context of this case and, therefore, the statute is ambiguous. <em>See Union Leader Corp. v. N.H. Retirement Sys., </em>162 N.H. 673, 677 (2011). Although signage indicates that the road is private, there is no barrier to entry. Hence members of the public may in fact drive on the road, even though they may not be authorized to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\u2018Where more than one reasonable interpretation of the statutory language exists, we review legislative history to aid our analysis.\u201d <em>Duquette v. Warden, N.H. State Prison, </em>154 N.H. 737, 740 (2007). In 1981, the legislature, in an effort to close various \u201cloopholes\u201d and \u201cget tough on DWI,\u201d made comprehensive changes to the DWI law. HOUSE JUDICIARY COMM. H\u2019rg ON HB 354 (March 4,1981) (reprinted in State\u2019s Appendix at 12); <em>see </em>Laws 1981, ch. 543. One of these changes was to expand the definition of \u201cway\u201d to include \u201cprivate ways among the areas upon which persons may be convicted of DWI.\u201d N.H.H.R. JOUR. 110 (1981). In the hearings concerning the proposed legislation, private roads in lake developments were specifically referenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\"> We construe statutes to address the evil or mischief that the legislature intended to correct or remedy. <em>Appeal of Coastal Materials Corp., </em>130 N.H. 98, 103 (1987). Public safety requires that DWI statutes apply to any property to which the public has access. It would be contrary to legislative intent to construe the statute to provide that a private road in a lakeside community that is used by residents, guests, and select invitees is a DWI-free zone. Accordingly, we uphold the trial court\u2019s determination that Alderberry Lane is a \u201cway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>We reject the defendant\u2019s contention that our decision today will adversely affect areas of law outside of the DWI statute. The application of the definition of \u201cway\u201d in RSA 259:125, II is specifically limited to four statutes \u2014 RSA 265:71, IV (Supp. 2012)(Additional Parking Regulations); RSA 265:79 (Supp. 2012)(Reckless Driving; Minimum Penalty); RSA 265-A:2,1 (Supp. 2012)(Driving or Operating Under Influence of Drugs or Liquor; Driving or Operating With Excess Alcohol Concentration); and RSA 265-A:3 (Supp. 2012) (Aggravated Driving While Intoxicated). The hypothetical effect on other areas of the law is, therefore, unsupportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b495-6\">Hicks, Conboy, Lynn and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
