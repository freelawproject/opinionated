Any laborer, materialman . . . whose claim has not been paid . . . may, at any time prior to thirty days after the recording of the assessment \u25a0 for said work, file with the superintendent of streets, a verified statement of his or its claim, together with a statement that the same, or some part thereof, has not been paid. At any time within ninety days after the filing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>such claim, the persons . . . filing the same . . . may commence an action ... on said bond . . . \u201d  Because there is neither allegation, nor proof, nor finding of fact, that plaintiff had filed his claim within the time prescribed,_ his judgment, recovered on a bond given under this section by the appealing sureties, must be reversed. This was the conclusion reached in <em>Republic Iron &amp; Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Patillo, </em>(1912) 19 Cal. App. 316 [125 Pac. 923], where provisions of the Vrooman Act, in all essentials identical with the provisions quoted above, were applied. It is a conclusion further supported by <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Baley, </em>(1915) 170 Cal. 151 [149 Pac. 45] ; <em>San Dimas Quarry Co. </em>v. <em>American Surety Co., </em>(1916) 30 Cal. App. 3 [157 Pac. 548] ; <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Shackelford, </em>(1923) 64 Cal. App. 750 [222 Pac. 846], See, also, the discussion in <em>Hub Hardware Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Accident &amp; Liability Co., </em>(1918) 178 Cal. 264 [173 Pac. 81], and in <em>California Portland Cement Co. </em>v. <em>Boone, </em>(1919) 181 Cal. 35 [183 Pac. 447],</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The judgment is reversed in so far as it affects appellants P. H. Dolan and Josephine PI. Dolan.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Conrey, P. J., and York, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
