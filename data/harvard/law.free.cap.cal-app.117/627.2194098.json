The defendant\u2019s demurrer to plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was sustained by the trial court without leave to amend; and it is from the ensuing judgment that this appeal is prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">It is undisputed by appellants that the passage of the ordinance in question was an act by the City of Whittier in the exercise of a governmental function. In such circumstances, in the absence of any statute to the contrary, the principle of law is well established that an action for damages against the city will not lie. (18 Cal. Jur. 1091; 19 R. C. L. 1083.)</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">In the case of <em>Bertiz </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>74 Cal. App. 792, 796 [241 Pac. 921, 923], the following excerpt from the case of <em>Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Village of Keeseville, </em>148 N. Y. 46 [51 Am. St. Rep. 667, 30 L. R. A. 660, 42 N. E. 405], is quoted with approval, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">\u201cWhen we find that the power conferred has relation to public purposes and is for the public good, it is to be classified as governmental in its nature, and it appertains to the corporation in its political character. But when it relates to the accomplishment of private corporate purposes, in which the public is only indirectly concerned, it is private in its nature, and the municipal corporation, in respect to its exercise, is regarded as a legal individual. In the former ease, the corporation is exempt from all liability, whether for nonuser or misuser; while in the latter case it may be held to that degree of responsibility which would attach to an ordinary private corporation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>See, also, <em>Chafor </em>v. <em>City of Long Beach, </em>174 Cal. 478 [Ann.

Rep. 1], it is held that a municipality is not civilly liable in damages which may result from the passage by its council of an illegal ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Conrey, P.
