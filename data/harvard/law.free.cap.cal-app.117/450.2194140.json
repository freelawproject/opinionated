A motion to quash the service was made and denied. The present proceeding followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">While we are at a loss to understand under what authority the commissioner of corporations accepted service, prohibition is not the proper remedy. The error of the superior court in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to quash the service of summons may be reviewed on appeal from any adverse judgment rendered. It is well settled that where a person has a right of appeal and such appeal will afford an adequate and complete remedy, such error can be corrected on appeal and the writ does not lie. <em>(Lumas Film Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>89 Cal. App. 384, 386 [264 Pac. 792]; <em>Bullard </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>106 Cal. App. 513, 516 [288 Pac. 629]; 21 Cal.
