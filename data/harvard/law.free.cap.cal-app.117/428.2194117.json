Defendants contend, therefore, that the sales were made in violation of the terms of the permit, and that consequently the agreements are unenforceable. The same contention, based upon the identical form of subscription agreements here challenged, for the sale of stock by the same corporation under the authority of the same permit, was made and sustained in the case of <em>Commercial Building Co. </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>108 Cal. App. 54 [290 Pac. 1048], decided since the actions herein were tried. Therefore, upon the authority of that case and for the reasons set forth therein, the judgments in the present cases are reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">Tyler, P. J., and Cashin, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
