Respondent\u2019s assignor, L. F. Cowan, is an investment broker and financial counselor. Appellant in December, 192'5, owned a substantial part of the capital stock of the Central Mendocino Power Company. Her holding consisted of an interest in a pool of 79,776 shares of common stock which was then held in escrow to secure the repayment of a loan. The due date of the loan was approaching and appellant was faced with the necessity of saving her stock. At the same time the financial condition of the power company was not satisfactory; and on December 15, 1925, appellant first consulted Cowan to advise and assist her both in saving her own stock and in reorganizing or refinancing the company. After a number of consultations and on April 6, 1926, appellant executed and delivered to Cowan the following memorandum of agreement;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>\u201cSan Francisco, Calif.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">\u201cApril 6, 1926</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">\u201cMr. L.

Thereafter this action was commenced by respondent, as Cowan\u2019s assignee, to recover the sum of $1500 with interest from April 25, 1927, and the judgment appealed from followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">It was the theory of the trial court that the contract bound appellant to pay Cowan $1500 at any time after its execution that she might transfer her interest in the stock described. Appellant urges that the obligation to pay the $1500 expired when her interest in such stock remained untransferred in September, 1926.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">One of the cardinal rules for the construction of contracts is that they must be considered as a whole, each part thereof being construed in the light of every other part. This rule has' been recently well stated in <em>Ogburn </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>207 Cal. 50, 51, 52 [276 Pac. 1004, 1005], in the following language: <em>\u201cA </em>contract should be construed, however, as an entirety, the intention being gathered \u25a0 from the whole instrument taking' it by its four corners. Every part thereof should be given some effect. (Sec. 1641, Civ. Code.) In other words, \u2018the sense and meaning of the parties to any particular instrument should be collected <em>ex anteoedentibus et consequentibus; </em>that is to say, every part of it should be brought into action, in order to collect from the whole one uniform and consistent sense, if that may be done. <em>(Balfour </em>v. <em>Fresno C. &amp; I. Co., </em>109 Cal. 221, 227 [41 Pac. 876, 878].) \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Applying this rule to the contract before us we find that appellant, upon the transfer of her interest in the stock described, was to pay Cowan $1500 not absolutely,- but \u201cas a guarantee\u201d that he should receive a contract to purchase 105,000 shares of common stock on certain designated terms. In the sense in which the term is here used \u201cguarantee\u201d is synonymous with \u201csecurity\u201d. The $1500 was to be paid to. secure or insure Cowan that he would receive the contract to purchase 105,000 shares. A further examination of the contract shows that it contemplated that Cowan should receive the contract to purchase 105,000 shares prior to September, 1926, because Cowan is to \u201crefund\u201d the $1500 if prior to that date he has sold seventy-five per cent of the 105,000 shares. That the payment of the $1500 was intended to be made prior to September, 1926, is clearly shown by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>use of the word \u201crefund\u201d in this clause. To refund is to pay back and the $1500 could not be paid back prior to September, 1926, unless it had first been paid to Cowan prior to that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Reading the contract as a whole, we think that it clearly appears that the parties contemplated not that appellant should pay Cowan $1500 absolutely and at any time that she might transfer her interest in her stock, but only if such transfer was made by her prior to the date when Cowan was to receive the contract to purchase 105,000 shares, i. e., not later than September, 1926. The provision that the $1500 is to be paid \u201cas a guarantee\u201d that Cowan will receive such contract, and the provision that Cowan is \u201cto refund\u201d the $1500 upon the sale of seventy-five per cent of the 105,000 shares before September, 1926, both become meaningless if the contract is construed otherwise. It is patent that the $1500 could not be paid \u201cas a guarantee\u201d for the performance of an act at a time already past, and equally patent that the provision for its being refunded on the performance of an act at a time already past would by such a construction be shorn of any meaning or effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The language of the agreement \u201cthat in event of my release of my rights, claims and interests . . . that I am to pay you the sum of fifteen hundred dollars\u201d if standing alone would support the construction sought to be placed upon it by respondent. But it does not stand alone and \u201cthe rules of construction forbid seizing upon some isolated provision of a contract in order to compel a certain result, and require that the intention be derived from a consideration of the entire instrument\u201d. <em>(Skookum Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>162 Cal. 539, 547 [123 Pac. 363, 366].)</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The construction which we have placed upon this agreement is fortified, if need be, by the situation of the parties at the time it was drawn. At that time Cowan believed that he had a purchaser for appellant\u2019s interest in the pooled stock for $15,000. So believing, the contract was drawn in the expectation that the transfer and sale of appellant\u2019s stock would be shortly made and long prior to September, 1926; Cowan did not guard against the contingency that the sale of appellant\u2019s stock might not be made until after that date. In fact, however, the purchaser whom Cowan believed he had secured refused to pay $15,000 for the stock and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>sale fell through. This was Cowan\u2019s misfortune, but cannot justify us in construing a contract for the payment of a sum of money \u201cas a guarantee\u201d for the performance of another act into a contract to pay\u2019 absolutely and at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The judgment accordingly must be and is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Nourse, P. J., and Sturtevant, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">A petition for a rehearing of this cause was denied by the District Court of Appeal on November 6, 1931, and a petition by respondent to have the cause heard in the Supreme Court, after judgment in the District Court of Appeal, was denied by the Supreme Court on December 3, 1931.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
