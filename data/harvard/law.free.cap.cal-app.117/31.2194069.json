At the time the matter came on for hearing plaintiff presented a counter motion to retain the action in San Mateo County upon the ground of convenience of witnesses; and subsequently the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion. Prom the order made in that behalf defendant prosecutes this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-13\">The law is well settled that unless answer has been filed at the time the demand for change of venue is made', a counter motion to retain the case on the ground of convenience of witnesses will not lie, for the obvious reason that until the issues of fact are settled by answer the court cannot determine what testimony will be material. <em>(Sheffield </em>v. <em>Pickwick </em>Stages, 191 Cal. 9 [214 Pac. 852]; <em>Gordon </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>v. <em>Perkins, </em>203 Cal. 183 [263 Pac. 231]; <em>San Jose Hospital </em>v. <em>Etherton, </em>84 Cal.

There was no answer filed in the present case; and therefore, since plaintiff did not challenge the legal sufficiency of defendant\u2019s moving papers, nor question the merits of his motion, he was entitled to have the action transferred to the county in which he resided. The order appealed from is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Tyler, P. J., and Cashin, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
