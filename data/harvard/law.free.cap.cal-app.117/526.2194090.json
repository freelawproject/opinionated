We may not, therefore, disturb it on the ground that it is excessive. (Ware v. <em>McPherson, </em>(1931) 213 Cal. 120 [1 Pac. (2d) 433].)</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">Nor do we believe that the trial court erred in denying defendant a new trial when the only other matter complained of was plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s statement in his argument to the jury that defendant was a \u201cpotential murderer\u201d. Granting that such an expression had no place in the case, its unfortunate presence, in the opinion of the trial court as shown by the ruling on the motion for a new trial, did not result in a miscarriage of justice, and we are not more impressed than he with its seriousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">The judgment is affirmed. The appeal from the order denying a new trial is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-14\">Conrey, P. J.,. and Houser, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
