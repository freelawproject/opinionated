We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">The issues for our review are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-11\">1. Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in its finding that Mr. Doig was an independent contractor rather than an employee at the time of his injury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-12\">2. Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in its finding that Mr. Doig was not a statutory employee under the provisions of \u00a7 39-71-401(3), MCA?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-13\">Mr. Doig, a horseshoer, advertised his availability as an experienced horseshoer in veterinary clinics and feed stores in and around Deer Lodge, as well as in the <em>Western Shopper </em>newspaper. Mr. Doig set his own appointments, and shod the horses where they were kept, not at his own home. He was paid on a per horse basis in the amount of $30 per horse for shoeing and $20 per horse for trimming. He had not applied to the Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation for a certificate to designate himself as an independent contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-14\">Mr. Charles Graveley, of the Graveley Ranch, called Mr. Doig and arranged for him to come to the ranch to shoe three horses on May 21, 1988. This was the first time Mr. Doig had ever shod any of the Graveley Ranch horses. Mr. Graveley caught the horses and tied them to the corral for Mr. Doig to replace the shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-15\">One of the horses, Hobo, had been diagnosed as having navicular disease, which is a hoof condition not uncommon in Western Montana. Mr. Graveley conveyed brief instructions to Mr. Doig that he be shod \u201cshort in the front and long in the heels.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>When Mr. Doig began his work with Hobo, Mr. Graveley left to buy horseshoes. When he returned to the ranch, he found Mr. Doig dazed, wandering around looking for a lens to his glasses. Mr. Doig told Mr. Graveley he had been kicked by the horse. Mr. Doig then went back to work finishing Hobo and filing the hooves of the second horse. Mr. Graveley stayed with Mr. Doig because of concern for his injury. Mr. Graveley did not assist with the horseshoeing, but only talked to Mr. Doig and was available if the second horse gave him trouble. Mr. Doig was trimming the third or fourth leg of the second horse when a sharp pain in his head caused him to fall to his knees. Mr. Graveley immediately drove him to the hospital in Deer Lodge.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">Mr. Doig was 34 years old at the time of the accident. The injury has left Mr. Doig confined to a wheelchair and totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Mr. Doig filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits with the State Compensation Mutual Insurance Fund as an employee of the Graveley Ranch. Liability was denied, based on its conclusion that Mr. Doig was an independent contractor at the time of the accident. Mr. Doig filed a request for rehearing in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court claiming that he was an employee rather than an independent contractor. A rehearing was denied. Mr. Doig appeals the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in its finding that Mr. Doig was an independent contractor rather than an employee at the time of his injury?</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">This appeal presents both questions of law and questions of fact. The parties agree that the proper standard of review in such cases was set out in <em>Solheim v. Tom Davis Ranch </em>(1984), 208 Mont. 265, 272, 677 P.2d 1034, 1037-1038:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">\u201cWhere both factual determinations and legal conclusions are challenged, two standards of review apply. To the extent that factual determinations are questioned, we must apply the test set forth in <em>Sharp </em>and defer to the fact-finder where substantial evidence exists to support the determinations. When, however, an issue raises only a question of law, this Court is free to reach its own conclusions from the evidence presented.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">Mr. Doig maintains that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred in concluding that he was an independent contractor rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>than an employee. The applicable statute, \u00a7 39-71-120, MCA (1987), defines \u201cindependent contractor\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-4\">\u201c(1) An \u2018independent contractor\u2019 is one who renders service in the course of an occupation and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\">\u201c(a) has been and will continue to be free from control or direction over the performance of the services, both under his contract and in fact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-6\">\u201c(b) is engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession, or business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\">\u201c(2) An individual performing services for remuneration is considered to be an employee under this chapter unless the requirements of subsection (1) are met.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">The key element is the control factor. There are four factors to consider when determining a right of control in a given situation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-9\">(1) Direct evidence of right or exercise of control;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-10\">(2) Method of payment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-11\">(3) Furnishing of equipment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-12\">(4) Right to fire.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-13\"><em>Sharp v. Hoerner Waldorf Corp. </em>(1978), 178 Mont. 419, 584 P.2d 1298.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-14\">\n<em>Direct Evidence of Right or Exercise of Control</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b88-15\">Mr. Doig maintains that the instructions as to how Hobo should be shod \u201cshort in the front and long in the heels\u201d established that Mr. Graveley was in control. He also contends that the fact he would always defer to the wishes of the horse owner and proceed only on the instructions of the rancher revealed control by Mr. Graveley.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-16\">State Fund maintains that the instructions as to how a horse should be shod are nothing more than control over those few matters necessary to insure a satisfactory end result. State Fund further maintains that the fact that Mr. Doig was hired on a one-day, 2-3 hour horseshoeing job where there was no evidence that a continuing employment relationship was intended to exist past the completion of the job, is indicative of an independent contractor. We agree. Therefore, we conclude that there is substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the court that the first factor indicated an independent contractor status.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-17\">\n<em>Method of Payment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b88-18\">Mr. Doig maintains that his method of payment on a per horse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>basis is an indication of employee status. This method of payment is the standard for horseshoers.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">State Fund urges that given the method of payment and the fact that this was the only time Mr. Doig had worked on the Graveley Ranch, it cannot be said the Mr. Doig was under the control of Mr. Graveley.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court held that there was no payment on a per-hour, per-week or per-month basis that would indicate an employee status, and that \u201cpayment on a completed project basis is consistent with, but not conclusive of, an independent contractor status.\u201d The court also found that at the time of the injury, Mr. Doig had shod one horse and trimmed all four feet of another horse. Mr. Graveley paid Mr. Doig on the per-unit basis of one horse shod and one horse trimmed. We conclude that substantial evidence supports the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">\n<em>Furnishing of Equipment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Mr. Doig maintains that the type and manner of the equipment furnished for the shoeing operation, such as those provided by the ranch in this case, are of significant importance as a contribution by the horse owner. He argues that while he did bring his own tools to perform the services, these items were of no greater significance than the facilities, halters, and shoes provided by the Graveley Ranch. Mr. Doig relies on Larson\u2019s <em>The Law of Workman\u2019s Compensation, </em>by Arthur Larson, for the proposition that when an employer furnishes valuable equipment, an employment relationship almost invariably exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">State Fund maintains that the only \u201ctools\u201d or \u201cequipment\u201d allegedly provided by the Graveley Ranch are generic ranch items, not analogous to the professional tools Mr. Doig brought to the ranch. The Ranch provided a halter and lead rope, a corral fence and horseshoes. State Fund urges that the items provided by the Graveley Ranch are not \u201cequipment\u201d as contemplated by the Larson treatise. Mr. Doig provided nippers, a nail clincher, a hammer, anvil, nails, rasps and horseshoeing chaps. State Fund argues that the tools provided by Mr. Doig himself are the tools of the trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">The fact that a horse owner supplies a halter for his horse is not indicative of supplying \u201cequipment\u201d for the horseshoer. The halter itself is not part of horseshoeing equipment anymore than a corral or enclosure that the horse is kept in. We conclude that substantial evidence exists to support the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s holding that the tools necessary to perform the service were furnished by Mr. Doig, indicating an independent contractor relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>\n<em>Right to Fire</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Mr. Doig maintains that the right existed for either party to end the operation without liability, a fact not consistent with the concept of an independent contractor relationship. He argues that Mr. Graveley could have terminated the horseshoeing for any reason with no obligation to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">State Fund maintains that Mr. Doig\u2019s argument disregards the nature of both the horse-owner\u2019s property interest and of the horseshoeing operation itself. State Fund contends that an incompetent horseshoer can lame a horse. It argues that a horse owner cannot be expected to stand quietly by while a horseshoer lames his horse. State Fund maintains that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court correctly held that an independent contractor can be terminated if the services are not being performed to the accepted standards. We agree. We affirm the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s conclusion that the right to terminate services of the claimant was consistent with independent contractor status.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\n<em>Independent Occupation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">The second part of the test set forth in \u00a7 39-71-120(l)(b), MCA (1987), requires that the worker must be engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession, or business. Mr. Doig maintains that as part of his general ranch work throughout his working life, he has done horseshoeing. Mr. Doig argues that as a part-time horseshoer, he was not engaged in an independent occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">State Fund maintains that there is substantial evidence to support the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that horseshoeing is itself an independently established trade. State Fund cites <em>Taylor v. Local No. 7, Int\u2019l Union of Journeyman Horseshoers </em>(4th Cir. 1965), 353 F.2d 593, for its holding that horseshoers were not employees of the horse trainers and owners. State Fund contends that Mr. Doig was clearly engaged in an independent trade or business as an independent contractor because he: (1) publicly advertised his services as a horseshoer; (2) brought his own tools to the work place; (3) maintained an appointment book in the course of his business; (4) had no social security, FICA or other deductions or withholding by Mr. Graveley or any of the other ranchers for whom he had shod horses; and (5) continued horseshoeing in the area prior to his injury even though he had begun full-time work at the Montana State Prison two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>weeks before his injury. We agree with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Doig met the independent occupation test.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">We affirm the conclusion of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court that Mr. Doig was an independent contractor at the time of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in its finding that Mr. Doig was not a statutory employee under the provisions of \u00a7 39-71-401(3), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Section 39-71-401(3)(a), MCA (1987), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">\u201c(3)(a) A sole proprietor or a working member of a partnership who holds himself out or considers himself an independent contractor ... <em>must elect to be bound personally and individually </em>by the provisions of compensation plan No. 1, 2, or 3, <em>but he may apply to the division for an exemption from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act for himself.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">Mr. Doig contends that during the 1983 legislative session, the Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation attempted to address the problem of independent contractors who seek to become employees after an industrial injury. He urges that it was the position of the Division that the solution to this recurring problem was to establish a system whereby any person who wished to be exempt from workers\u2019 compensation coverage had to seek certification from the Division as an independent contractor. If so certified, the person in question would then be exempt from coverage under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Mr. Doig urges that if a person hired someone to do work for him or her, such person would be required to ask if the prospective worker had a certificate of exemption as an independent contractor or could show proof of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">In the present case, Mr. Doig did not have coverage on himself, and did not have a certificate of exemption from the Division. Mr. Graveley did not inquire as to Mr. Doig\u2019s exemption or coverage. Therefore, Mr. Doig maintains that he is to be treated by the insurer as an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court addressed this issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-12\">\u201cAs enacted, Section 39-71-401(3)(a), MCA (1987) <em>allows </em>an independent contractor to elect to be bound by the provisions of compensation plan No. 1, 2, or 3, <em>or </em>he may apply to the Division for an exemption from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act for himself. Nowhere in the statutes or the Division rules is the independent contractor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>exemption from workers\u2019 compensation coverage made specifically mandatory in order for independent contractor status to exist. No Court has held that any independent contractor without such a certificate is <em>automatically </em>an employee and such an interpretation is not warranted from a reading of the statute or its history since enactment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">\u201cAdministrator Gary Blewett\u2019s statement in favor of HB 277 suggested a result which was not achieved by the Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation rules adopted to implement this legislation. Such administrative ruled did <em>not </em>create a \u2018statutory employee\u2019 if an independent contractor failed to obtain a certificate of exemption in ARM 24.29.706 (Eff. 6/30/84). In fact, the opposite result was reached in ARM 24.29.706(5), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-5\">\u201c \u2018The exemption provided for under this rule is for workers\u2019 compensation purposes. <em>The fact that an independent contractor neither applies for nor receives an exemption does not imply independent contractor status.\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">\u201cHad the legislature intended in 1983 ... that an independent contractor exemption was to be mandatory, it could have been clearly stated. Absent such specific language in Sections 39-71-401, 39-71-118 and 39-71-120, MCA, this Court must conclude that failure to obtain an independent contractor exemption does not create a \u2018statutory employee\u2019 by operation of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">As the lower court explained, the failure to obtain a certificate of exemption did not specifically create a statutory employee. In the construction of a statute, a judge is \u201csimply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, <em>not to insert what has been omitted ... </em>\u201d \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA. We agree with the interpretation of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. We hold that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not err in its finding that Mr. Doig was not a statutory employee under the provisions of \u00a7 39-71-401(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b92-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICES HARRISON, McDONOUGH and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b92-10\">JUSTICE HUNT</author>\n<p id=\"A5q\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">I dissent. I do not agree with the analysis and result of this case. I would hold that Mr. Doig was not an independent contractor but was an employee of Mr. Graveley. I would reverse the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
