Kittelson appeals from summary judgment granted on September 28,1990, by the District Court of the Thirteenth Judicial District, Yellowstone County, Montana, in favor of Archie Cochrane Motors, Inc. Kittelson claimed that by refusing to disburse severance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>pay, Archie Cochrane Motors was negligent and had breached the employment contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The issue is whether the District Court erred in determining that no genuine issues of material fact exist and improperly granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">\n<em>Summary of Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Gary O. Kittelson was fired on August 11, 1986, after having been employed by Archie Cochrane Motors (ACM) for seventeen years, working his way up from salesperson in 1968 or 1969 to General Sales Manager in 1979. When he was promoted to General Sales Manager on July 1, 1979, Kittelson signed an employment contract which provided that he receive a salary of $1,700 per month plus two per cent of the company\u2019s operating profits, as well as a year-end bonus of two per cent of the company\u2019s operating profits. The contract did not refer to a definite time period of employment. Kittelson\u2019s base salary increased over the years, and although his profit percentage remained the same, he was making over $50,000 a year as General Sales Manager during the last few years of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">When Kittelson began working for ACM, the company was owned by Archie Cochrane, who sold ACM in January 1974 to James and Dave McNally. After McNallys bought the car dealership, an employee handbook was distributed to all ACM employees. The handbook did not state procedures or policies for discharging employees except for a section providing that severance pay would be decided on a case by case basis, but would not be given if the employee had engaged in \u201cimproper conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">According to James McNally, the President of ACM, Kittelson\u2019s performance began to decline in late 1984. On January 27, 1986, McNally wrote Kittelson a letter, constituting \u201ca formal and final warning on the problems you and I have been discussing over the past ninety days.\u201d The letter listed Kittelson\u2019s shortcomings in \u201cinventory management\u201d and \u201cpeople management.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">Kittelson told McNally in June 1986 that he felt his performance had improved. McNally disagreed and demoted Kittelson to truck manager, temporarily taking over as General Sales Manager himself. McNally said that because he and Kittelson were friends, he switched Kittelson\u2019s position rather than terminating his employment, to \u201cjar\u201d him back to \u201cfunctioning like he used to.\u201d According to McNally, Kittelson\u2019s performance continued to decline, leading to his termination in August 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Following his termination, Kittelson approached Jim McNally about the possibility of obtaining severance pay. McNally instructed Kittelson to write down the reasons that he felt entitled to severance pay, and assured Kittelson that he would present the matter to the Board of Directors. According to Kittelson, McNally also commented that if anyone deserved severance pay, Kittelson did. The Board rejected Kittelson\u2019s request for severance pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\">McNally stated that approximately a year later, Kittelson told him that he needed a letter of recommendation because of difficulty in finding employment. Against his attorney\u2019s advice, McNally wrote the letter and backdated it to the time Kittelson\u2019s employment was terminated. McNally said that he did this because \u201cI was trying to help him out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Before Kittelson\u2019s termination, ACM had never given an employee severance pay. Subsequent to Kittelson\u2019s discharge, two ACM employees received severance pay after termination of their employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Kittelson filed this action against ACM alleging negligent discharge, negligent infliction of emotional distress, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and breach of contract for failing to provide severance pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Before discussing the issues concerning Kittelson\u2019s termination, we must address the preliminary question of whether the Montana Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act, \u00a7\u00a7 39-2-901 to -914, MCA, applies to this case. Since Kittelson was discharged in August 1986, this action is not controlled by the Montana Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act, which took effect July 1,1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">We now turn to Kittelson\u2019s claim that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to ACM because genuine issues of material fact existed. Summary judgment is proper when no genuine issues of material fact exist, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P.; <em>First Security Bank of Bozeman v. Jones </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 301, 303, 794 P.2d 679, 681. Initially, the moving party must allege the absence of genuine factual issues. To prevail, the nonmoving party must set forth facts demonstrating that a genuine issue exists. <em>O\u2019Bagy v. First Interstate Bank of Missoula </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 44, 46, 785 P.2d 190, 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">Kittelson argues that the following material facts were at issue: (1) whether Kittelson was entitled to severance according to provisions of the employee handbook; (2) whether ACM terminated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Kittelson\u2019s employment \u201cfor an act of improper conduct;\u201d (3) whether McNally\u2019s statements to Kittelson in regard to his request for severance pay imposed obligations on ACM; and (4) whether the question of Kittelson\u2019s severance pay was presented to the Board by Jim McNally. Examination of the record reveals that no genuine issues of material fact existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">In Montana, employment \u201chaving no specified term may be terminated at the will of either party on notice to the other ...\u201d Section 39-2-503, MCA. In asserting claims of wrongful discharge, Kittelson relied on the exceptions to \u201cat will\u201d termination of employment listed in <em>Prout v. Sears, Roebuck and Co. </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 152, 157, 772 P.2d 288, 291. Aside from statutory exceptions, <em>Prout </em>lists four exceptions to \u201cat will\u201d termination of employment: (1) violation of public policy; (2) breach of express or implied promise of job security; (3) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (4) negligent discharge. As noted in <em>Prout </em>and as our discussion will demonstrate, these exceptions frequently overlap. <em>Prout, </em>236 Mont. at 157, 772 P.2d at 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">\n<em>Negligent Discharge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">In a recent decision, we held that an employer is not under a \u201cduty to use reasonable care in decision making, based upon a theory of negligence.\u201d <em>Heltborg v. Modern Machinery </em>(Mont. 1990), [244 Mont. 23,] 795 P.2d 954, 961, 47 St.Rep. 1254, 1264. Therefore, negligent discharge is no longer a recognized exception to termination of employment \u201cat will,\u201d and we need not further review Kittelson\u2019s claim that he was negligently discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">\n<em>Violation of Public Policy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">In cases not controlled by the Montana Wrongful Discharge of Employment Act, a plaintiff must show a violation of public policy by his employer in order to establish that he has been wrongfully discharged. <em>Rupnow v. City of Poison </em>(1988), 234 Mont. 66, 70, 761 P.2d 802, 804. Administrative rules promulgated by state agencies are one source of public policy, and an employer\u2019s violation of administrative rules in terminating an employee may constitute wrongful discharge. <em>Nye v. Department of Livestock </em>(1982), 196 Mont. 222, 639 P.2d 498. Termination of an employee for refusing to participate in illegal or immoral activities also violates public policy. <em>Stark v. Circle K Corporation </em>(1988), 230 Mont. 468, 475-76, 751 P.2d 162, 167 (employee discharged for refusing to sign false report).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">Kittelson does not claim these types of public policy violations. Instead, he alleges that ACM violated public policy by breaching the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Since the covenant is \u201cimplied as a matter of law based on the public policy of this State,\u201d breach of the covenant amounts to a violation of public policy. <em>Stark, </em>230 Mont. at 475, 751 P.2d at 166. Thus, we must determine whether any genuine issue of material fact exists to demonstrate breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\">\n<em>Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Montana has long recognized the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in employment contracts. <em>Dare v. Montana Petroleum Marketing Co. </em>(1984), 212 Mont. 274, 687 P.2d 1015; <em>Gates v. Life of Montana Insurance Co. </em>(1982), 196 Mont. 178, 638 P.2d 1063. Whether an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing exists in an \u201cat will\u201d employment context depends upon objective manifestations by the employer that would give rise to the employee\u2019s reasonable belief that he had job security and would be treated fairly. <em>Barrett v. Asarco, Inc. </em>(Mont. 1990), [245 Mont. 196,] 799 P.2d 1078, 1081, 47 St.Rep. 1980, 1982. Both parties are protected by the reciprocal nature of the covenant, which imposes on the employee an obligation of good faith performance of his job duties. <em>Barrett, </em>799 P.2d at 1081, 47 St.Rep. at 1082.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Kittelson had worked for ACM for seventeen years and for McNallys since they bought ACM in 1974. In 1979, ACM promoted Kittelson to General Sales Manager, a managerial position which required Kittelson to supervise the other sales managers and salespersons. Kittelson received base salary increases and a percentage of profits over his base salary, as well as a year-end bonus. These facts could give rise to a reasonable belief that Kittelson had job security. See <em>Barrett, </em>799 P.2d at 1081, 47 St.Rep. at 1982 (receiving regular raises and bonuses in salaried, managerial position for fifteen years were sufficient objective manifestations of existence of covenant).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing requires \u201c \u201chonesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade\u2019 \u201d by both parties. <em>Story v. City of Bozeman </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 436, 450, 791 P.2d 767, 775 (quoting \u00a7 28-1-211, MCA). \u201c[T]o rebut allegations by an employee that the employer breached the covenant, the employer need only show a fair and honest reason for termination.\u201d <em>Barrett, </em>799 P.2d at 1081, 47 St.Rep. at 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Kittelson\u2019s primary contention is that ACM\u2019s refusal to disburse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>severance pay was unfair and contrary to the policy stated in ACM\u2019s employee handbook:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-4\">\u201cG. Separation for Cause. If you are separated for cause, whether or not you are given severance pay depends upon the reason you were leaving our organization, and each case will be handled individually. Severance pay will not be given, however, for separation because of an act of improper conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">No other portions of the handbook commented on procedures for discharge of employees. Kittelson maintains that he was entitled to severance pay because he was not terminated for \u201can act of improper conduct,\u201d precluding severance pay according to the handbook.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">An employee handbook distributed after the employee was hired is not an employment contract because the handbook constitutes a unilateral statement of company policies and procedures, because its terms are not bargained for, and because no meeting of the minds occurred. <em>Gates, </em>196 Mont. at 183, 638 P.2d at 1066. Nevertheless, an employer can breach the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by failing to follow its own policies as set forth in the employee handbook. <em>Gates, </em>196 Mont. at 184, 638 P.2d at 1067.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">On January 27, 1986, Jim McNally wrote Kittelson a letter comprising \u201ca formal and final warning on the problems you and I have been discussing over the past ninety days.\u201d The letter cataloged \u201cshort- comings as to inventory management that we discussed\u201d and \u201cshort- comings as to people management that we have discussed,\u201d listing three items in each category, and informed Kittelson that he had to improve his performance by June 1, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">About a year after Kittelson\u2019s employment was terminated, Mc-Nally, at Kittelson\u2019s request, wrote a letter of recommendation, addressed \u201cTo Whom It May Concern,\u201d citing Kittelson\u2019s \u201cloyalty and honesty\u201d and \u201cabilities as a Sales Manager.\u201d The letter, backdated to August 22,1986, also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-9\">\u201cAbout two years ago, Gary and I started differing on management methods. As these differences grew it became apparent we would be better served if Gary were to seek employment with a firm whose philosophies were more in line with his thoughts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">Kittelson maintains that this letter raises a question of fact regarding the reasons for his termination. Kittelson further argues that the letter of recommendation shows that he was not terminated for \u201can act of improper conduct,\u201d and thus was not precluded from receiving severance pay by the provisions of the employee handbook.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">The January 27, 1986, letter demonstrates that Kittelson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>performance was lacking. In June 1986, Kittelson was demoted to truck sales manager and given a final warning. The letter of recommendation, written approximately a year after Kittelson was terminated in August 1986, cannot be characterized as giving Kittelson the reasons for ending his employment. The letter was written at Kittelson\u2019s request for the purpose of helping him obtain other employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\">But, we need not decide whether Kittelson was discharged for \u201can act of improper conduct.\u201d The language of the employee handbook clearly states that \u201ceach case will be handled individually\u201d in deciding whether severance pay is given.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">At some time shortly after he received notice of termination, Kittelson approached McNally about receiving severance pay. Mc-Nally told Kittelson that he would bring the matter before the Board of Directors of ACM and suggested to Kittelson that he record the reasons which entitled him to severance pay. Kittelson sent his written reasons for receiving severance pay to the other two Board members. Kittelson contends that a factual dispute remains over whether McNally presented the matter of Kittelson\u2019s severance pay to the Board of Directors as he had described to Kittelson. Kittelson also emphasizes that McNally said to him, \u201cIf anyone has severance pay coming, you do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Kittelson\u2019s reasoning fails because the employee handbook does not outline the procedures ACM must take to reach a decision regarding severance pay. As stated by the District Court, \u201c[t]he <em>contents </em>of the employment handbook paragraph regarding such pay, the <em>content </em>of the conversation between McNally and Kittelson, and the <em>result </em>of the Board\u2019s determination regarding the severance pay are not at issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">McNally stated in his deposition that because ACM had continued to employ Kittelson for some time after his performance declined, he and the Board \u201cfelt that we had paid Mr. Kittelson probably a year\u2019s salary that was unearned.\u201d The action of the ACM Board of Directors, however the Board may have arrived at the decision and for whatever reasons, complies with ACM policy to handle each case individually as stated in the employee handbook. McNally\u2019s statement that Kittelson had severance pay coming if anyone did is neither a promise to Kittelson that he would receive severance pay nor a representation to Kittelson that the Board decision would be in Kittelson\u2019s favor. The District Court did not err in concluding that genuine issues of material fact did not exist and that ACM did not breach the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by denying severance pay to Kittelson.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>We briefly discuss Kittelson\u2019s last two claims. Kittelson does not have a breach of contract claim based on the employee handbook because, as noted in the above discussion, an employee handbook is not an employment contract. <em>Gates, </em>196 Mont. at 183, 638 P.2d at 1066. Finally, we note that Kittelson\u2019s claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress is without basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b546-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICES GRAY, McDONOUGH and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b546-6\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER,</author>\n<p id=\"Azl\">specially concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">I concur with the result of the majority\u2019s decision, but not with all that is said therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">The plaintiff has alleged five causes of action. However, all causes are based on plaintiff\u2019s assumption that he was entitled to severance pay which his employer wrongfully refused to give him.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s assumption that he was entitled to severance pay was based on the following provision found in his employer\u2019s Employee Handbook:</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">\u201cIf you are separated for cause, whether or not you are given severance pay depends upon the reason you are leaving our organization, and each case will be handled individually. Severance pay will not be given, however, for separation because of an act of improper conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">Plaintiff contends that it is reasonable to interpret the above provision as, \u201cthe assurance that an employee terminated for cause, other than an act of improper conduct, is entitled to and will receive benefits from Respondent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">Plaintiff\u2019s proffered interpretation is not reasonable. All that is guaranteed by the Employee Handbook is that each case will be handled individually and that consideration will be given to the circumstances of an employee\u2019s departure. That is what the employer did in this case, and therefore, there was no employment policy violation which could form the basis for any of the plaintiff\u2019s five causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-13\">For this reason, I would affirm the judgment of the District Court, even though I do not concur with all that is said in the majority opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b546-14\">JUSTICE HUNT concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
