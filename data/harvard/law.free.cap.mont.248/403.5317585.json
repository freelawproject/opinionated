We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-19\">The defendant raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>1. Did the District Court err in admitting prior acts under Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-4\">2. Did the District Court err in giving the State\u2019s Jury Instruction No. 1?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\">3. Did the record contain sufficient evidence to support the defendant\u2019s convictions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">4. Was the sentence imposed by the District Court excessive?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">On January 13, 1989, the Yellowstone County Attorney\u2019s Office moved for leave to file an Information charging the defendant with sexual assault against C.B., a nine-year-old boy. The affidavit in support of the motion stated that on at least five occasions diming October and November 1988, Croteau put his hands down C.B.\u2019s pants to fondle his penis while C.B. sat on Croteau\u2019s lap, and in this manner caused C.B. to have an erection. The Information was filed on January 17, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">The county attorney filed notices with the District Court and the defendant notifying them that the county attorney intended to introduce evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts involving C.B.\u2019s older brother, R.B., and M. S. Specifically, the notice stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-9\">\u201cCOMES NOW Teresa McCann O\u2019Connor, Deputy County Attorney for the County of Yellowstone, State of Montana, and gives notice to defendant of her intention to introduce evidence at the trial of the above- entitled cause of the following other crimes, wrongs, or acts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-10\">\u201ca. That as a course of conduct between 1982 and 1985, the defendant did fondle [R.B.], DOB: 9-14-72, and that one specific incident took place in Wyoming in 1982 and another on a trip to Mexico in 1985.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-11\">\u201cb. That the defendant, between 1985 and 1988, made physical advances toward [M.S.], DOB: 1-25-73, by putting his hand on [M.S.\u2019s] knee, squeezing it and moving his hand up [M.S.\u2019s] thigh. This evidence is being offered for the purpose of showing the defendant\u2019s opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident in committing the offenses charged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">On August 9,1989, the State filed an amended Information charging Croteau with two additional counts of sexual assault against M. S. and Z.B., both of whom were less than 16 years of age. The State then filed a second notice of its intention to use evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts committed by Croteau against B.W.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-14\">On June 20, 1990, the State moved to dismiss Count II of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>amended Information, alleging sexual assault against M.S. That motion was granted. The next day, four days before trial, the State issued its third notice of its intention to use evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts committed against N.B., J.B., S.C., and T.M. Following a two day trial commencing on June 25, 1990, the jury found the defendant guilty of two counts of sexual assault against C.B. and Z.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">At the time of the alleged offenses, the defendant lived and worked in Billings, Montana. The children in Croteau\u2019s neighborhood would often visit his house to play pool and watch television. Croteau had been close friends with C.B. and R.B.\u2019s family for over ten years. On several occasions the children would spend the night at Croteau\u2019s house. Croteau also took C.B. and R.B., and other children, on overnight trips.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">In November 1988, C.B. told his mother, and later testified at trial, that Croteau had \u201cslobbered on [his] neck\u201d and put his hands down C.B.\u2019s pants while C.B. was sitting on Croteau\u2019s lap watching television. C.B. testified that these incidents took place almost every weekend when he visited Croteau during October and November 1988. At trial, C.B. also testified how Croteau made sounds \u201clike a bear growling,\u201d rubbed his whiskers against C.B. \u2019s chin, and touched C.B.\u2019s penis until it \u201cwould stand up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">C.B. further testified that Croteau\u2019s activities ceased in late November 1988 after C.B.\u2019s mother confronted Croteau about C.B.\u2019s allegations at Thanksgiving dinner. Croteau denied ever abusing C.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Z.B. testified that he was introduced to Croteau while at an air show with his family in Billings when he was nine years old. Z.B.\u2019s family were also friends of Croteau. After the show, Z.B. and his brother went over to Croteau\u2019s house to play pool and watch television. While at Croteau\u2019s home, Croteau laid Z.B. on top of his stomach so that Z.B. could feel Croteau\u2019s penis. Z.B. testified that Croteau held him there until his penis got hard and then went soft. Croteau repeated the same acts on Z.B. when Z.B. and his brother spent the night at Croteau\u2019s house. Z.B. also testified that he spent the night at Croteau\u2019s house two or three other times, and on each occasion the same incident occurred. Croteau also denied abusing Z.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">During the trial, over the defendant\u2019s objection, the District Court allowed the State to introduce evidence of other acts of the defendant under Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid. Although the State listed a number of witnesses in its notices, the State only called S. C. and R.B. to testify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>to other acts of the defendant. Only the \u201cother crimes\u201d testimony of R.B. is at issue on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">In December 1988, R.B., C.B.\u2019s older brother, gave a statement to the police describing instances of Croteau sexually molesting him. These molestations took place on trips R.B. took with Croteau outside of Billings. R.B. told the police, and later testified at trial, that Croteau fondled his penis on a trip to Mexico in 1982. These acts were described in the State\u2019s first <em>Just </em>notice. On June 25, 1990, the day of the trial, the county attorney handed Croteau\u2019s counsel a new statement from R.B. dated March 1990. In this second statement, R.B. claimed that Croteau touched and fondled him in Croteau\u2019s house. The defendant objected to the admission of testimony concerning incidents occurring at his house, arguing that the State failed to properly notify him under <em>State v. Just. </em>The District Court disregarded Croteau\u2019s objection and allowed the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">In that testimony, R.B. described a number of fondling incidents while spending the night at Croteau\u2019s house. These incidents occurred from the time R.B. was in the second grade until 1987, when he was in the eighth grade. Croteau denied abusing R.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Did the District Court err in admitting other acts under Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid.?</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Croteau contends that the District Court should have excluded R.B.\u2019s testimony regarding other acts because the testimony did not meet the substantive and procedural requirements of prior crimes or prior acts evidence as set forth in <em>State v. Just, </em>184 Mont. 262, 602 P.2d 957 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">The general rule is that evidence of other crimes or prior acts must be excluded. Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid. The reason for this longstanding rule is that prior acts or crimes are highly prejudicial to the defendant, and usually irrelevant for purposes of the charged crime. In <em>State v. Tiedeman, </em>139 Mont. 237, 242, 362 P.2d 529, 531 (1961), we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-10\">\u201cThe general rule should be strictly enforced in all cases where applicable, because of the prejudicial effect and injustice of such evidence, and should not be departed from except under conditions which clearly justify such a departure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">Evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior acts or uncharged misconduct creates the risk that the jury will penalize a defendant simply for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>past bad character. E. Imwinkelried, <em>Uncharged Misconduct Evidence, </em>\u00a7 1:03 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">However, under Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior acts or prior crimes may be \u201cadmissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d In <em>Just, </em>we set forth specific procedural requirements which must be followed before prior acts or crimes can be admitted for one of the reasons set forth in Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Croteau\u2019s procedural claim of error relates to the notice requirements in <em>Just. </em>In <em>Just, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">\u201cEvidence of other crimes may not be received unless there has been notice to the defendant that such evidence is to be introduced. The procedures set forth in Section 46-18-503, MCA, should serve as guidelines for the form and content of such notice. Additionally, the notice to the defendant shall include a statement as to the purposes for which such evidence is to be admitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-7\"><em>Just, </em>602 P.2d at 963-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">The defendant contends the State violated the notice requirements under <em>Just </em>by failing to notify him that evidence of prior acts occurring at his house would be introduced into evidence. At trial, R.B. testified to several incidents of inappropriate touching while spending the night at Croteau\u2019s house. However, in the original <em>Just </em>notice concerning R.B.\u2019s testimony, there is no mention of improper activity occurring at Croteau\u2019s house. The notice only stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-9\">\u201cThat as a course of conduct between 1982 and 1985, the defendant did fondle [R.B.], DOB: 9-14-72, and that one specific incident took place in Wyoming in 1982 and another on a trip to Mexico in 1985.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">The State argues that the phrase \u201cas a course of conduct between 1982 and 1985,\u201d covered any incidents that happened at Croteau\u2019s house between Croteau and R.B. We disagree. The purpose of the notice requirement is to allow the defendant to prepare for and respond to the allegation of previous conduct. The State\u2019s original notice did not further that purpose, and therefore, was insufficient to satisfy the notice requirement under <em>Just.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">Despite this lack of notice, the State contends that Croteau was aware of the State\u2019s intention to introduce testimony of prior acts occurring at Croteau\u2019s house. On the morning of the trial, the State delivered to Croteau\u2019s counsel a new statement from R.B. dated March 1990. This statement expanded and changed R.B.\u2019s previous statement to include Croteau\u2019s touching and fondling of R.B. in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Croteau\u2019s house. The State claims this last minute delivery adequately informed Croteau of the State\u2019s intent to introduce the testimony. Furthermore, the State claims any prejudice to Croteau could have been cured by Croteau requesting a continuance to familiarize himself with the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">In order for Croteau to prepare to defend against prior acts or crimes testimony, the State must give Croteau a timely and specific notice of intent to introduce such evidence. A review of the notice reveals the State\u2019s notice was neither timely nor specific. The notice requirement must be given sufficiently in advance of trial to afford a defendant a reasonable opportunity to prepare to meet the evidence against him. That requirement is not satisfied by information delivered on the first day of trial. The State\u2019s willingness to consent to a continuance to allow Croteau to review R.B.\u2019s new statement does not cure the State\u2019s defective notice and the prejudice to Croteau. It is not acceptable to give the defendant the option of waiving his constitutional right to a speedy trial so that he can deal with the State\u2019s untimely notice. The defendant has the right to a speedy trial and proper notice under <em>Just, </em>and cannot be compelled because of untimely notice to choose between the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Next, Croteau contends that the State\u2019s <em>Just </em>notice was procedurally defective because the State did not specifically state the relevant purpose for admitting the evidence. The notice stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">\u201cThis evidence is being offered for the purpose of showing defendant\u2019s opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident in committing the offenses charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">In <em>Just, </em>we explained that \u201cthe notice to the defendant shall include a statement as to the purposes for which such evidence is to be admitted.\u201d <em>Just, </em>602 P.2d at 964. Here, the State simply used a \u201cshotgun\u201d approach and named all of the possible reasons, with the exception of motive, set forth in Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid. This type of \u201cshotgun\u201d notice fails to specifically state the relevant reason to admit other acts of the defendant. Recently, in <em>State v. Sadowski, </em>[247 Mont. 63,] 805 P.2d 537, 542, 48 St.Rep. 93, 96 (Mont. 1991), we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-8\">\u201cThe State must also demonstrate that the evidence is logically relevant towards one of the Rule 404(b) examples or some other fact in issue and not merely introduced as proof of a character defect or propensity of the defendant in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">In <em>Sadowski, </em>the defendant claimed self-defense and the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>sought to admit prior acts of the defendant under Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., to prove the defendant\u2019s intent when he shot the victim and to rebut his claim of self-defense. In <em>Sadowski, </em>the intent of the defendant was at issue, and prior acts under Rule 404(b) were properly admitted to disprove the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense. In this case, the State did not specify the reason under Rule 404(b) for which the defendant\u2019s other acts were logically relevant. The trial court and this Court should not be required to speculate which, if any, of the Rule 404(b) examples stated in the State\u2019s notice applies, or was intended to apply, in this case. Future notices which simply incorporate all, or substantially all, of those reasons set forth in Rule 404(b) will not be satisfactory under the <em>Just </em>notice requirements. The notice to the defendant must identify the specific Rule 404(b) purpose for which it is to be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Accordingly, the State has failed to meet the procedural requirements under <em>Just. </em>Failure to adhere to the procedural mandates of <em>Just </em>constitutes error. <em>State v. Case, </em>190 Mont. 450, 460, 621 P.2d 1066, 1072 (1980); <em>State v. Gray, </em>197 Mont. 348, 353, 643 P.2d 233, 236 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Croteau also contends that R.B.\u2019s testimony should have been excluded because it fails to meet the substantive requirements under <em>Just. </em>However, the evidence was that much of the conduct which formed the basis of the charges against the defendant occurred during shared seating arrangements or roughhousing of some type. Prior similar incidents would have been probative to show that the contact was not by accident, and therefore, admissible under Rule 404(b). Here, we reverse because the State did not comply with the procedural safeguards which would have enabled the defendant to adequately prepare for trial and defend himself against claims of prior bad acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Did the District Court err in giving the State\u2019s Jury Instruction No. 1?</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">The defendant contends that it was reversible error for the District court to instruct the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-9\">\u201cWhere two witnesses testify directly opposite to each other on a material point and are the only ones that testify [on] that same point, you are not bound to consider the evidence evenly balanced or the point not proved; you may regard all the surrounding facts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>circumstances proved on the trial and give credence to one witness over the other if you think the facts and circumstances warrant it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">This Court has historically disapproved of this instruction in criminal cases. <em>State v. Jones, </em>48 Mont. 505, 523-24, 139 P. 441, 448 (1914); <em>State v. Darchuck, </em>117 Mont. 15, 21, 156 P.2d 173, 175 (1945); <em>State v. Carns, </em>136 Mont. 126, 139, 345 P.2d 735, 743 (1959). The reason for this Court\u2019s disapproval has been that the instruction reduces the State\u2019s burden of proof in a criminal case from guilt beyond a reasonable doubt to that applicable in a civil case, which is a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Jones, </em>48 Mont. 505, 139 P. at 448; <em>Carns, </em>136 Mont. 126, 345 P.2d at 743. Likewise, we hold the District Court erred in giving the State\u2019s Jury Instruction No. 1, and should avoid giving such an instruction during any retrial of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Since the defendant\u2019s conviction is reversed and this case is remanded to the District Court for retrial, based on our consideration of Issue No. 1, it is not necessary to consider the last two issues raised by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">We reverse.</p>\n<judges id=\"b437-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICES HARRISON, McDONOUGH, HUNT, GRAY and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
