The insurer, State Compensation Mutual Insurance Fund, has cross appealed the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s judgment which held that Mrs. Hash suffered a compensable injury to her hands. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">The only issues we find necessary for review are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-13\">1. Whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s decision that Carol Hash failed to prove she suffered a compensable back injury is supported by substantial evidence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-14\">2. Whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s decision that Carol Hash suffered a compensable hand injury is supported by substantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-15\">At the time of trial, Carol Hash (claimant) was fifty years old. She had worked for Montana Silversmith since 1981. Apparently she worked in the \u201cbuckle department\u201d on a full time basis until she terminated her employment on April 24, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-16\">In 1985, claimant began having problems with her hands. In response to these problems, she sought medical attention from Dr. Phillip Griffin, a Billings rheumatologist. Dr. Griffin noted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>formation of Heberden nodes in the claimant\u2019s fingers and concluded that the pain in her hands was caused by degenerative or primary osteoarthritis. According to Dr. Griffin, osteoarthritis is a disease of unknown cause or origin. During his deposition, he testified that the claimant\u2019s work activities could aggravate her condition. However, this aggravation would be temporary in character. Once the work activity ceased, the aggravation would cease as well. In his opinion, no permanent damage would result from claimant\u2019s job related activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">In December 1986 claimant saw Dr. Dernbach and complained about back pain, which was hurting to the point that she had numbness in her right leg. Eventually, she was referred to Dr. James Johnson who diagnosed her back condition as spondylolisthesis or spondylolysis. He prescribed physical therapy for her back. Dr. Johnson did not recall making any inquiry as to the nature of claimant\u2019s work and consequently did not have an opinion as to whether her condition was related to her employment. However, he did state his belief that her back condition was a congenital problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">In early 1987, claimant informed her immediate supervisor that her job was aggravating her back and hands. On April 15, 1987, claimant informed her employer that she was going to file a claim for compensation on her back. Eventually the claimant terminated her employment due to ongoing problems with her back and hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">As a result of claimant\u2019s filing for benefits, respondent, the State Fund, sent her to Dr. Susan English. Dr. English diagnosed osteoarthritis of the hands and spondylolisthesis of her back. In Dr. English\u2019s opinion the hand and back problems were not related. Based upon her examination of the claimant, Dr. English concluded that the claimant\u2019s job duties did not cause the osteoarthritis. She believed that claimant\u2019s work would, at the most, temporarily aggravate claimant\u2019s hand condition and that the work would not produce any permanent effect. During her deposition, Dr. English testified that the claimant would have the same osteoarthritis problems regardless of her employment. It is \u201cmedically possible\u201d however that micro trauma, associated with claimant\u2019s job could aggravate her osteoarthritis.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Initially, the State Fund agreed to accept liability for Mrs. Hash\u2019s claim as an occupational disease. The State Fund agreed to pay disability benefits until an occupational disease panel evaluation could be performed to determine what percentage of claimant\u2019s osteoarthritis was caused or contributed to by her employment. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>panel evaluation was performed by Dr. William Shaw on June 19, 1989. Based upon this evaluation, Dr. Shaw concluded that claimant\u2019s disability was unrelated to occupational causes. As a result, claimant\u2019s benefits were terminated on September 11, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Claimant then filed a petition for a hearing before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. Following trial, before hearings examiner Robert J. Campbell, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court found that claimant suffered a compensable injury to her hands. However, it found that she did not suffer a compensable injury to her back. The court could not determine, from the evidence presented, the nature and extent of her permanent disability. It therefore ordered her to file a new petition \u201cwith evidence of maximum healing and an election of permanent partial entitlement supported by appropriate evidence.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Our function in reviewing a decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court is to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the findings and conclusions of that court. We cannot substitute our judgment for that of the trial court as to the weight of evidence or questions of fact. <em>Steffes v. 93 Leasing Co. Inc. </em>(1978), 177 Mont. 83, 580 P.2d 450. However, decisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court must be based upon substantial credible evidence. <em>O\u2019Brien v. Guaranty Fund Services </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 267, 786 P.2d 1169. If the conclusions of law are not supported by the court\u2019s findings of fact, those conclusions must be reversed. <em>Hume v. St. Regis Paper Co. </em>(1980), 187 Mont. 53, 608 P.2d 1063.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">In accordance with this standard of review, the claimant argues that she established that she suffered a compensable injury to her back and that this Court should reverse the conclusions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. Claimant correctly points out that an employer takes an employee the way he finds him. An employee who suffers from a preexisting condition is entitled to compensation if the condition was aggravated or accelerated by an industrial injury. <em>Shepherd v. Midland Foods Inc. </em>(1983), 205 Mont. 146, 666 P.2d 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">However, before a worker is entitled to Workers\u2019 Compensation benefits, she must establish by a preponderance of evidence that an \u201cinjury\u201d in fact occurred. <em>Dumont v. Wickens Bros. Const. Co. </em>(1979), 183 Mont. 190, 598 P.2d 1099. For the purposes of this case, injury is defined as</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">\u201ca tangible happening of a traumatic nature from an unexpected cause or unusual strain resulting in either external or internal harm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>and such physical condition as a result therefrom and excluding disease not traceable to injury ...\u201d Section 39-71-119, MCA (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">The claimant argues that she suffered an injury to her back, as defined by the above statute. She maintains that her back problems were a preexisting condition which was exacerbated by her employment. Eventually, her back condition became so bad she was forced to quit. In making this argument, claimant relies upon <em>Shepherd v. Midland Foods Inc. </em>(1983), 205 Mont. 146, 666 P.2d 758 and <em>Hoehne v. Granite Lumber Co. </em>(1980), 189 Mont. 221, 615 P.2d 863.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">In <em>Shepherd, </em>the claimant suffered from degenerative arthritis in his knees. This preexisting condition was aggravated by the heavy work requirements of his job. Eventually, the claimant\u2019s knees collapsed and he was forced to quit work. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court held he was ineligible for future benefits because he could not show that his condition was work related. On appeal, we reversed and held that uncontested medical evidence supported the conclusion that Mr. Shepherd\u2019s work related activities accelerated the arthritic condition of his knees and led to their eventual breakdown. <em>Shepherd, </em>666 P.2d at 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">In <em>Hoehne, </em>this Court recognized that a \u201ctangible happening of a traumatic nature\u201d need not be a single isolated incident, but may well be a \u201cchain of incidents\u201d leading to an injury. In <em>Hoehne, </em>the claimant\u2019s injury resulted from his job which required him to stack lumber on a daily basis. Eventually, this activity led to the development of carpal tunnel syndrome, which this Corut found to be an injury arising out of the claimant\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Neither of these cases are applicable to the facts surrounding Mrs. Hash\u2019s back injury. In both cases, it was clear that the claimants\u2019 conditions were caused by their work activity. In <em>Shepherd, </em>the medical evidence established that the claimant\u2019s work aggravated his preexisting condition until his knees eventually broke down following a fall, which occurred at work. In <em>Hoehne, </em>the claimant established that the repetitive nature of his work directly led to the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. There was medical evidence to establish that Mrs. Hash suffered from a preexisting condition which was neither caused nor aggravated by her work.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">All doctors agree that her back condition was a congenital defect which was not created by her employment. Because her spondylolysis is not traceable to any injury, the condition is not compensable and the judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Corut on this issue is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>The court did find, however, that claimant was entitled to compensation for her hands. The State Fund maintains that her hand condition, like that of her back, is not a compensable injury. It argues that the medical testimony illustrates that the osteoarthritis in claimant\u2019s hands would have been no different had she not engaged in her employment with Montana Silversmith and that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred in awarding benefits. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Both Dr. English and Dr. Griffin testified that it was possible that micro-trauma associated with Mrs. Hash\u2019s work aggravated her underlying condition. Proof of medical possibility can be used in conjunction with other evidence to support a grant of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits because of such aggravation. <em>Viets v. Sweetgrass County </em>(1978), 178 Mont. 337, 583 P.2d 1070.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">It is uncontroverted that Mrs. Hash\u2019s hand condition manifested itself while she was employed with Montana Silversmith. Eventually, the pain in her hands became so severe she was forced to quit work. The micro-trauma associated with her work combined with her underlying condition to produce her disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">After trial and after reviewing the witness testimony, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court found that Mrs. Hash suffered a compensable injury to her hands. We cannot reverse this judgment unless there is no substantial evidence to support it. Taking all of the testimony as a whole, we hold that the judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court is supported by substantial evidence. The finding of the court that Mrs. Hash suffered a compensable injury to her hands is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Finally, Mrs. Hash maintains that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred when it failed to determine the amount of permanent compensation benefits she was entitled to. We have reviewed the pretrial order in this matter and it is apparent that the issue of permanent benefits was not submitted to the court for resolution during trial. Therefore it would have been inappropriate for the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court to decide this matter. In order to determine the extent of her entitlement, Mrs. Hash must submit appropriate evidence to determine the nature and extent of her permanent disability rating. The judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, on this issue, is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b186-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, HUNT and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
