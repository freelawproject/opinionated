He appealed from the order, but, as there was no power in the trial court to stay the execution of the warrant, he also applied for an injunction. He alleged that his term had not ended, and that the summary proceedings taken against him by the defendant were void because the justice presiding in the municipal court had not acquired jurisdiction. It appeared that the defendant, in. his petition in the proceedings in the municipal court, had merely alleged that he was the \u201clandlord\u201d of the premises occupied by the plaintiff, and did not describe his interest in the premises, stating the facts as required by section 2235 of the Code.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1035-16\">The following is the opinion of the Special Term:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1035-17\">' \u201cLEVENTRITT, J.
