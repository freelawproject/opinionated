Opposite the title, there is a memorandum to the effect that it is a case agreed upon in a controversy submitted without action, pursuant to the Code of Civil Procedure. That does not form any part of the submission, but is merely descriptive. And, furthermore, it is not stated that the case agreed upon contains a statement of the facts as required by the Code. There is no stipulation whatever between the parties that the papers constitute a case dontaining a statement of the facts which has been agreed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-13\">The submission must therefore be dismissed, with leave to file a new submission.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
