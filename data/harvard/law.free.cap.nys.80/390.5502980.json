Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 3253. While a railroad crossing accident case may be difficult and require much labor and expense in the trial, such a case cannot be said, in any sense, to be extraordinary. Cases of this kind are very common. Our courts are continually trying them and reviewing them on appeal. Extra allowances should not be granted in these cases unless they come clearly within the provisions of the statute. The verdicts are ordinarily large enough, and create a sufficient burden upon the railroads, without granting extra allowances. In this case the plaintiff is adequately compensated in the verdict and the statutory costs. The order should therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-18\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion, denied. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
