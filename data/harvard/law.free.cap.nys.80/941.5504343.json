The plaintiff, upon the trial, gave evidence tending to prove that the accident which resulted in her injuries was due to the negligence of the defendant\u2019s motorman upon the car in question; but the trial court, instead of putting the defendant to its proof, directed a nonsuit at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, upon the ground that she had released the defendant from all liability for any injuries sustained by her arising out of the defendant\u2019s negligence. Subsequently a motion for a new trial was granted, and from the order granting the same this appeal was taken.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b962-19\">Argued before ADAMS, P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ap_q\">For the purposes of this review it must be assumed that the defendant\u2019s negligence was established, and consequently the only question now to be considered is whether or not it stands absolved from all liability therefor. The contention that it does so stand is based, of course, upon the words printed upon the front cover of the passbook issued to the plaintiff by the defendant pursuant to its agreement to furnish her free transportation over its railroad in part consideration for the conveyance by her to it of a strip of land for a right of way over her premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">We think there are two reasons why this contention cannot be sustained. \u25a0 In the first place, the written agreement in question specified the sole condition upon which transportation should- be furnished the plaintiff, and that was that the passes issued therefor should be used by no other persons than those to whom they were issued, and that a violation of this condition should work a forfeiture of the same. Subject to this single condition, the defendant agreed to provide the plaintiff with an annual pass each and every year of her life, to be used by her for transportation over the defendant\u2019s railroad \u201cas often as [she] may desire.\u201d No limitation was placed upon this right, and the agreement contains no language which, by the most liberal construction,' can be said to attach any conditions to its enjoyment, other than the one already mentioned. In these circumstances, we think the defendant obligated itself to furnish the plaintiff with transportation, relieved from any other condition; and that when it assumed to attach to the fulfillment of such obligation an additional condition, and one which was never within the contemplation of the parties, it foisted upon 'the plaintiff a new contract, for which no consideration passed. In other wprds, the defendant was bound by the subsisting contract between it and the plaintiff to furnish the latter with transportation over its road for a consideration agreed upon; but when it undertook to make for itself what was, in effect, a new contract, by imposing upon the plaintiff a condition which was not contained in the original contract, it furnished no consideration therefor, and consequently is in no position to enforce the same. Corcoran v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 25 App. Div. 479, 49 N. Y. Supp. 701, affirmed 164 N. Y. 587, 58 N. E. 1086; Trolan v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 31 App. Div. 320, 52 N. Y. Supp. 257; Seybolt v. N. Y., L. E. &amp; W. R. Co., 95 N. Y. 562, 47 Am. Rep. 75; Vanderbilt v. Schreyer, 91 N. Y. 392. If, therefore, the lack of consideration rendered the alleged release nudum pactum, then, within the authority of one of the cases above cited (Seybolt v. N. Y., L. E. &amp; W. R. Co.), the plaintiff\u2019s acceptance of the passbook with the new condition printed upon its cover did not indicate any intention upon her part to assent to the terms thereof; and this view is not a little strengthened by the fact, made manifest by an examination of the book itself, that the only condition' to which the plaintiff expressly assented over her signature was the one specified in the agreement, viz., that the passes therein contained were to be offered for fare by no one but herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>But if we are in error in the views thus far expressed, we think that our second reason for sustaining the order appealed from is one which cannot be successfully controverted. Although there was at one time apparently some contrariety of opinion in the Court of Appeals respecting the right of a carrier to limit its common-law liability for its negligent acts by a contract which did not contain express words to that effect (Cragin v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 51 N. Y. 61, 10 Am. Rep. 559; Mynard v. S. B. &amp; N. Y. R. R. Co., 71 N. Y. 180, 27 Am. Rep. 28; Holsapple v. R. W. &amp; O. R. R. Co., 86 N. Y. 275), it seems to be now pretty well settled that, where such a limitation is intended, it must be expressed in language so plain and unequivocal that it may be readily comprehended by every one (Nicholas v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 89 N. Y. 370; Jennings v. G. T. R. Co., 127 N. Y. 438, 28 N. E. 394; Rathbone v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 140 N. Y. 48, 35 N. E. 418); and that this rule is as applicable to the carrier of passengers as to the carrier of freight (Kenney v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 125 N. Y. 422, 26 N. E. 626; Mc-Elwain v. Erie R. Co., 21 Wkly. Dig. 21). It is to be observed that the release in question is very general'in its terms. It does not even hint at any exemption from liability for negligence, but simply provides that the defendant shall be released \u201cfrom all claims for damages for personal injuries from whatever cause.\u201d We are not unmindful of the contention of the appellant\u2019s counsel that no effect whatever can be given to this language unless it be held to embrace negligence, inasmuch as a carrier of passengers is not an insurer of their safety; nor have we overlooked the language of. some of the earlier decisions, which is to the effect that, where general words may operate without including negligence, it will not be assumed that they were intended to include it; but we think the rule laid down by the more recent authorities is based upon the broad principle that considerations of public policy require that, before a .carrier may claim immunity from the consequences of its own negligence, such immunity must be written into the contract of release stricti sensus (Kenney v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. Co., supra), and, while we do not think it impossible to affirm this order upon the ground that the language of the release might, under some circumstances, become operative without including the defendant\u2019s negligence, and therefore will not be presumed to be thus inclusive, we prefer to rest our decision upon the broader principle to which allusion has been made, and which, we think, it must be conceded now obtains in this state. The order appealed from should be of-, firmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">Order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
