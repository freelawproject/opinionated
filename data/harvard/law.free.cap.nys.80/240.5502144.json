Berlin, \u201cthe name Zachariah being fictitious, real first name being unknown to plaintiff.\u201d The plaintiff did not summon Bardler, but obtained a judgment against Berlin by default. Thereafter Zax K. Berlin moved the court for vacation and cancellation of the judgment, upon his affidavit \u201cthat he was the defendant above named, that judgment was rendered against him as by a default, that he was never served with a summons herein or authorized any one to appear for him.\u201d The court denied the motion upon the ground, inter alla, that it did not appear to its satisfaction that the applicant was the defendant in the action. I think that the order may be affirmed upon this ground. It does not appear that there was any judgment entered against Zax K. Berlin. The judgment is against a Berlin named as Zachariah, which name is fictitious. It does not appear that the plaintiff has moved in any way to enforce his judgment against the affiant Zax K. Berlin. A judgment against Zachariah (fictitious) or against Zachariah would not warrant proceedings against the property of Zax. Farnham v. Hildreth, 32 Barb. 277. On the other hand, if the plaintiff really aimed his suit against the affiant, and hereafter seeks, under section 1251 of the Code of Civil Procedure, to amend the judgment, it must be upon such notice as the court may direct. An objection based upon the nonservice of the summons is not based upon an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>irregularity, but strike's at the validity of the judgment, and may be heard at any time.
