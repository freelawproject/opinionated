As Joseph Henry Walker was in all but form the creator of the trust, we shall refer to-him-as the settlor. The controversy relates to distribution of principal upon the death of the last life beneficiary. More particularly, the question is whether the principal should be distributed equally among the seven living grandchildren of the settlor or according to the stocks of the two deceased children of the settlor who had issue surviving, namely: Agnes W. Claflin, the mother of the respondents Mildred Marshall and William W. Claflin; and Joseph Walker, the father of the respondents Joseph It. Walker, Richmond Walker, George R. Walker, Katharine W. Bradford, and Evelyn W. MacDuffie. The Probate Court entered a decree that the trust \u201cproperty shall be distributed in equal shares to the respondents, they being the seven surviving children of the issue of said Joseph H. Walker and in equal degree of kinship to their parents.\u201d The respondents Marshall and Claflin appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The source of the controversy is the provision: \u201cAnd upon the decease of the last survivor of said three children<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of said Joseph Henry Walker, then in trust to convey, transfer and make over the principal ... to the issue of said three children, if any such issue there may be, \u2014 absolutely and free from any trust ... To hold to them and their heirs and assigns forever, each line of issue taking thereof its proper share as the shares of income are herein-before provided to be paid, and in such conveying, transferring and making over among such issue, if said issue or descendants of said children of said Joseph Henry so living <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>shall all be in equal degree of relationship to their respective parents or ancestors (meaning the deceased said children of said Joseph Henry) they shall take the said Trust fund or Trust property equally, otherwise they shall take it by right of representation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">By the words, \u201ceach line of issue taking thereof its proper share as the shares of income are hereinbefore provided to be paid,\u201d we are directed for guidance to the income provisions. After payment of the income to the settlor\u2019s wife for life, the trustee was \u201cto pay said net income ... to the said Joseph Walker, George Walker and Agnes Walker, children of said Joseph Henry Walker, in equal shares during their joint lives.\u201d If any child were to die without issue, the income was to go to the surviving child or children in equal shares. \u201cBut.so long as one of said three children survives, if any one or both of said other children shall have died leaving issue living at his or her decease, such issue shall stand in the place of its parent or ancestor, and shall be entitled to receive said parents\u2019 <em>[sic] </em>or ancestor\u2019s share ' of said net income during the life of the survivor of the said three children by right of representation: \u2014 And so long as one of said children survives, if one of the others of said children shall have died leaving no issue living at his or her decease, and the other of said children shall have died leaving issue living at his or her decease, then the surviving child and said issue of said deceased child so leaving issue shall be entitled to the whole of said net income in equal shares, said issue if in the same degree of kindred to take equally, otherwise by right of representation: \u2014 And if, while one of said children survives, the issue of any deceased child shall have become entitled to its parents\u2019 [sfc] or ancestor\u2019s share in said net income and all of said issue of any deceased child shall thereafter decease while one of said three children survives, the interest and right of such issue under this trust shall inure to and vest in the surviving child or children and the issue of any .other deceased child . or children who would under this trust be entitled to said interest, if the parent or ancestor of said extinct issue had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>died at the time of the death of the last survivor of said issue leaving no issue living at such parents\u2019 [sic] or ancestor\u2019s decease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">To summarize, the income was to go to the children \u201cin equal shares\u201d for life, and (so long as at least one of the three children survived) upon the death of a child: the income of his or her share was to go to his or her issue, \u201c said issue if in the same degree of kindred to take equally, otherwise by right of representation.\u201d There was no provision for one \u201cline of issue\u201d to participate in the income of another \u201cline of issue\u201d unless such other \u201cline of issue\u201d had become extinct. As applied to the family situation which eventuated, no income of the Claflin \u201cline of issue\u201d was to go to the Walker \u201cline of issue\u201d so long as there was living issue in the Claflin line. There is no provision for. \u00e1 per capita division of the income among the issue of the two lines at any time. The- language, achieving a per stirpes division headed by the settlor\u2019s children, is particularly clear and forceful throughout.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Returning to the provision for the distribution of principal, we are of opinion that the clause \u201ceach line of issue taking thereof its proper share as the shares of income are hereinbefore provided to be paid,\u201d taken in connection With all the language of the instrument of trust, means \u25a0 that each \u201cline of issue\u201d \u2014 of the settlor\u2019s children, and not of his grandchildren \u2014 is to take its own share of principal per stirpes, and not that the two lines are to take the entire principal per capita. It seems to us that the settlor\u2019s intention was directed toward the distribution of one share among the members of one \u201cline of issue\u201d when he added to that clause the words, \u201cand in such conveying . . . \u2019among such issue; if said issue or descendants of said children . . . shall all be in equal degree of relationship to their respective parents or ancestors (meaning the deceased said children of said Joseph Henry) they shall take . . . equally, otherwise ... by right of representation.\u201d The introductory conjunction \u201cand\u201d suggests the engrafting of a detail consistent with the settlor\u2019s previous - instructions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>rather than the inconsistent annexation of a limitation or qualification in the nature of a proviso. The reference to \u201csuch issue\u201d apparently is to \u201ceach line, of issue\u201d mentioned earlier in the same sentence. The use of \u201crespective\u201d before \u201cparents or ancestors\u201d seems conclusive that the language is directed toward a distribution of each of the respective shares among the members of \u201ceach line of issue.\u201d Likewise, no other interpretation would give due effect to the broad mandate that the distribution should be in accordance with the scheme for distribution of income \u201chereinbefore provided to be made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">As the result depends upon the precise language of the trust deed, we omit citation or discussion of the cases to which we have been referred and which concern trust instruments expressed in substantially different language.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The decree of the Probate Court is reversed, and a new decree is to be entered instructing the petitioners that one half of the principal is to be distributed in equal shares to the respondents Mildred Marshall and William W. Claflin and one half of the principal is to be distributed in equal shares to the respondents Joseph R. Walker, Richmond Walker, George R. Walker, Katharine W. Bradford, and Evelyn W. MacDuffie. The allowance of costs and expenses shall be in the discretion of the Probate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-8\"> The third child, George Walker,-died without issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
