The agreed facts, which were adopted by the reviewing board, indicate that the employee suffered a compensable injury on January 3, 1947, while working for The Gamewell Company, by reason of which the retina of his left eye became detached. At the time he began work with The Gamewell Company, his vision in his right eye was less than twenty seventieths, not correctable with glasses. This loss of vision in the right eye was due to congenital dislocation of the lens, was permanent, and represented loss of use of said eye for industrial purposes. The insurer executed an agreement with the employee for the payment of compensation for the injury of January 3, 1947, the former reserving \u201ccarrier\u2019s <em>[sic] </em>rights\u201d under \u00a7 37 of the act. On the joint petition of the insurer and the Attorney General the foregoing facts were reported by the single member to the reviewing board for its determination and decision as to the liability of the Commonwealth to contribute to the compensation payable under \u00a7\u00a737 and 65 of the act. The board ordered the Treasurer under the provisions of these sections to reimburse the insurer for one half of the payments made by it and in the future to pay one half of the compensation to which the employee was entitled. On certification to the Superior Court, the decree was entered from which the present appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The principal question presented is whether the employee is one who has \u201cpreviously suffered a personal injury\u201d under the provisions of \u00a7 37, as amended by St. 1937, c. 321. By this section, whenever \u201can employee who has previously suffered a personal injury resulting in . . . the reduction to twenty seventieths of normal vision of one eye with glasses, incurs further disability by . . . the reduction to twenty seventieths of normal vision in an eye, by reason of a personal injury for which compensation is required by this chapter, he, or his dependent, if death results from the injury, shall be paid the compensation provided for by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>sections thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-four, thirty-four A or thirty-five, in the following manner: One half of such compensation shall be paid by the state treasurer from the fund established by section sixty-five, and the other half by the insurer, but the additional compensation required by section thirty-six shall be paid by the insurer.\u201d There is provision in \u00a7 65, as appearing in St. 1939, c. 465, \u00a7 3, and as amended, .for the creation of a special fund in the custody of the State Treasurer \"who shall make payments therefrom upon the written order of the department for the purposes set forth in section thirty-seven.\u201d If the defect in the employee\u2019s right eye is due to a personal injury previously suffered, it is the Treasurer\u2019s duty, on order of the department, to pay from this special fund one half of the compensation payable to the employee; if not due to a previous personal injury, the insurer must pay the entire compensation. Statute 1919, c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, now G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 65 and 37, was passed by the Legislature in 1919 after the decision in Branconnier\u2019s <em>Case </em>(1916), 223 Mass. 273, which held that an insurer was liable to provide compensation for the total incapacity of an employee due to loss of an eye after he had previously lost his other eye. The purpose of the statute was to encourage the employment of persons who have previously suffered certain defined personal injuries by relieving the employer or the insurer from the burden of paying the entire compensation for further disability of the employee due to the combined effect of his previous injury and one later received in the course of his employment. <em>Fallon\u2019s Case, </em>322 Mass. 61, 62-63. <em>Hebron\u2019s Case, </em>247 \u2022 Mass. 427, 430. It was said in <em>Burns\u2019s Case, </em>218 Mass. 8,12, \"In common speech the word \u2018injury,\u2019 as applied to a personal injury to a human being, includes whatever . . . change in any part of the system produces harm or pain or a lessened facility of the natural use of any bodily activity or capability.\u201d If we assume that a personal injury, as so defined and as the term is employed in \u00a7 37, includes an injury to the foetus previous to birth, which we do not intimate (see <em>Dietrich </em>v. <em>Northampton, </em>138 Mass. 14), there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>was no evidence before the board which would warrant a finding of such injury. The testimony of the medical expert, to which the board refers in its decision, goes no farther than an expression of opinion that the dislocation of the lens in the right eye was caused by the absence of some of the fibres which normally hold the lens in place and that \u201cthe absence of the fibres may be due to disease, toxic conditions in the mother, and it may be a transmitted characteristic from parents to child.\u201d The board was, therefore, in error in finding that the claimant is \u201can employee who has previously suffered a personal injury.\u201d Decisions in other jurisdictions, some of which are cited by the insurer, which have permitted congenital defects to be the basis for payments from a State fund similar to that provided for in \u00a7 65, arose under statutes different in language from \u00a7 37 and are, therefore, not in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">It is contended by the insurer that the Treasurer of the Commonwealth was without authority to appeal from the decree of the Superior Court. The Attorney General was notified by the board to appear at the hearing before it and in its \u201cFindings, Decision and Order\u201d it states that it considered that the Attorney General represented the Treasurer of the Commonwealth as custodian of the special fund. See <em>Hurley\u2019s Case, </em>302 Mass. 46. On the hearing before the Superior Court, the Attorney General filed an appearance for the Treasurer. In our opinion the Treasurer was a party to the proceedings. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>315 Mass. 335, 338. He was the custodian of the special fund set up under the provisions of \u00a7 65 and it was his duty to make payments therefrom on the written order of the department for the purposes set forth in \u00a7 37. See <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Bureau of Old Age Assistance of Cambridge, </em>324 Mass. 63. The correctness of the departmental order, being made under the provisions of the act, could be questioned by the one to whom it was directed under the procedure established by the act. It was the Treasurer\u2019s duty as a public official to make no payments unless warranted by law. He was a party in interest before the Superior Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>under \u00a7 11, as amended, and as a party aggrieved he could appeal to this court from an adverse decision. G. L., (Ter. Ed.) c. 214, \u00a7 19. See <em>Kline </em>v. <em>Shapley, </em>232 Mass. 500, 502; <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>235 Mass. 33, 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The decree is reversed and a decree is to be entered dismissing the claim. c \u201e7 , \u00b0 <em>So ordered.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
