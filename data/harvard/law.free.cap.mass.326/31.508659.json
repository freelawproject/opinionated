The action is one of contract or tort. In each of the three counts of the amended declaration, the first being in contract and the second and third in tort, it is alleged that the plaintiff went to the office of the defendant, a real estate broker, and employed the defendant to draft an agreement for the purchase by her of certain real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>In count 1 the plaintiff alleges that she employed the de.fendant to \u201cfind certain real estate suitable for the plaintiff to buy\u201d and \u201cemployed the defendant, for consideration paid, to draw up such a legal agreement to buy and sell whereby she was to buy certain property, on certain terms, and the defendant promised and agreed to render such services.\u201d She alleges that the defendant prepared an agreement in such a. \u201ccareless, negligent and unskilled manner that said agreement did not correctly and legally state the terms on which the plaintiff wished to buy said property\u201d; that she executed said agreement with the owner of said property but \u201cwas not able to buy said property under the terms of said agreement, as executed, which was contrary to her intentions and instructions to the defendant, and as a result she was unable to . . . recover her deposit of one thousand ($1,000) dollars paid to the owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Count 2 is similar to count 1, except that it omits to allege a promise by the defendant, and states that he drew the agreement in such a careless, negligent and unskilled manner that said agreement did not legally set forth the terms and conditions as intended by the plaintiff and which she had instructed the defendant to incorporate in said agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">In count 3 she alleges that she stated to the defendant that \u201cshe would buy certain property that the defendant showed her upon condition that she could secure certain financing, for the purchase price of said sale\u201d; that on the defendant\u2019s representation that he was \u201ccompetent, skilled and experienced\u201d to draw up an agreement to buy and sell real estate she employed him to draw up agreements (in both long and short form) \u201cwhereby she was to purchase said property from the owner, upon certain definite terms and conditions, and pay a deposit of one thousand dollars ($1,000)\u201d; and that relying upon the representation of the defendant that the agreements were properly drawn and \u201clegally provided for the terms and conditions which she had instructed the defendant to place therein,\u201d she executed said agreements and paid to the owner of said property a deposit of $1,000. .She further alleges that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>was \u201cnot authorized to practise law under this Commonwealth, that said agreements were illegal and, further, that said agreements were so carelessly and negligently drawn up that they did not contain the terms and conditions which the plaintiff had instructed the defendant to place therein, and as a result the plaintiff was not able to carry out the agreement to buy and sell as prepared by said defendant, and, therefore, lost the one thousand dollar deposit which she had paid thereunder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Of several causes of demurrer assigned with respect to the amended declaration the third cause is stated as follows: \u201c3. Said declaration and the several counts thereof do not state a cause of action substantially in accordance with the rules set forth in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 7, in that several counts thereof are vague and indefinite and do not allege facts and particulars such that this defendant ought to be required to answer the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 7, Second, requires that \u201cThe declaration shall state concisely and with substantial certainty the substantive facts necessary to constitute the cause of action.\u201d \u201cA defendant is entitled to know with reasonable certainty the ground upon which the plaintiff seeks to recover, that he may be able to make answer thereto and be informed of the issues he is called upon to meet. Unless the declaration sets forth in definite terms what those issues are, it cannot be determined what rules of law are applicable thereto.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>H. S. &amp; M. W. Snyder, Inc. </em>252 Mass. 29, 37. No intendment can be made in favor of the pleader when the sufficiency of the pleading is challenged by demurrer. See <em>Second Society of Universalists in Boston </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co. Ltd. </em>221 Mass. 518, 521; <em>Gabriel </em>v. <em>Borowy, </em>324 Mass. 231, 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Here the causes of action relied upon are the breach of a contract and the violation of a duty arising from that contract. It is therefore essential that the terms of the alleged contract be stated with \u201csubstantial certainty.\u201d <em>Pollock </em>v. <em>New England Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. </em>289 Mass. 255, 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>. In count 1 the plaintiff alleges that the defendant contracted to draw an agreement for her to buy real estate on \u201ccertain terms\u201d and that the agreement as drawn did not state those \u201cterms.\u201d In count 2 it is alleged that the agreement as drawn, by reason of the defendant\u2019s negligence, did not state the \u201cterms\u201d which the plaintiff had instructed the defendant to incorporate in the agreement. In count 3, while stating that the plaintiff told the defendant that she would purchase on condition that she \u201ccould secure certain financing for the purchase price,\u201d the allegation of negligence is based on failure to include in the agreement \u201ccertain definite terms and conditions\u201d which she \u201chad instructed the defendant to place therein.\u201d It is not stated that the terms and conditions which the defendant failed to include were those in reference to financing which she had previously stated to the defendant. In no one of the counts are the terms and conditions to which reference is made stated definitely and with certainty. The defendant is not advised as to what he is charged with omitting or misstating. The allegation in the third count that the agreements as drawn by the defendant were illegal for the reason that the defendant was not authorized to practise law adds nothing to the plaintiff\u2019s case. The owner of the property acquired no rights adverse to the plaintiff because of the alleged illegality of the broker\u2019s act in drawing the agreements. No damage thereby resulted to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The demurrer was properly sustained on the third assigned cause of demurrer above quoted. It does not appear that the plaintiff moved or was given leave to amend, and judgment should be entered for the defendant. <em>Keljikian </em>v. <em>Star Brewing Co. </em>303 Mass. 53, 61-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\n<em>Order sustaining demurrer affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant. .</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
