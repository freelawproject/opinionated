The exceptions of the defendant bring the cases here.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">In each case the defendant excepted to the denial of his motion for a directed verdict of not guilty. The evidence may be summarized as follows. The manager of the First National Store at 820 Western Avenue in Lynn left the store locked on Saturday night, January 15, 1949. At seven o\u2019clock on Monday morning, when he opened the store, he heard a noise in the cellar, and, looking down, saw a man there. The manager went out, found a police officer, and returned to the store with the officer. As they neared the store, they saw two men coming out of an alley, apparently from the cellar. The two men ran, and the manager and the officer ran after them, but did not catch them. A few minutes later, two other police officers saw the defendant peering out from behind a building three quarters of a mile away from the store and arrested him after a chase. The defendant was taken back to the store, where the manager identified him as the man he had run after. The defendant said, \u201cLet\u2019s get it over with. You have got me, get it over with.\u201d During the chase, the trousers of one of the men were torn on a barbed wire fence that he climbed, about one hundred fifty feet from the store, and later a piece of cloth caught on the fence was found to match a tear in the defendant\u2019s trousers. When arrested, the defendant said that he had become sweaty and dirty from running away from the police because he had been drinking and feared arrest. But the police officers found no evidence of liquor upon him. There was a hole about two and one half feet square, broken that very night, in the brick wall between the cellar of the store and an adjoining cellar, and from the latter cellar one could pass into the alley. When arrested, the defendant was covered with dust like that from bricks and mortar.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">In the store there was a safe, and a pinch bar was found protruding from the outer door of the safe. The safe had not been fully opened. Around it on the floor were found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>an axe, a screw driver, a bitstock and bit, a file, and a punch. These had not been there before the night in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">In our opinion the evidence warranted findings of guilty on both indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">- The remaining questions relate to the admissibility of evidence. A witness for the' Commonwealth testified that the defendant was covered with a light dust. Subject to the exception of the defendant he was allowed to testify that the dust was \u201csimilar to the dust that one might get on one\u2019s self'from the mortar on bricks.\u201d In this there was no error. Though the witness was not an expert, he was competent to make comparisons as to matters of common knowledge which were hard to describe without resort to such comparisons. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sturtivant, </em>117 Mass. 122, 132, et seq. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brayman, </em>136 Mass. 438, 440. <em>Ross </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>222 Mass. 560, 562. <em>Crafts </em>v. <em>McCobb, </em>303 Mass. 172, 175-176. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>313 Mass. 590, 599-600. <em>Tafralian </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>316 Mass. 429, 431. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>323 Mass. 70, 76-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">A police officer testified that he talked with the defendant at the police station, and that, in answer to a question as to why he had run, the defendant said that it was because he had \u201ca police record.\u201d To this the defendant excepted. The evidence of his flight warranted an inference against the defendant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>212 Mass. 88, 91. The statement as to his police record was voluntarily made by the defendant himself in explanation of his flight. Even if the police record indicated the commission of another crime, \u201cIf evidence material to prove an issue in the case discloses the defendant\u2019s participation in another crime, it does n.ot for that reason become incompetent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercier, </em>257 Mass. 353, 368. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>300 Mass. 45, 56; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>West, </em>312 Mass. <em>438. </em>We find no error in respect to this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">The wife of the defendant was called by him as a witness. She testified that she had had no talk with a police officer about where the defendant was on the night of the crime, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>and that she did not tell the officer that she and her husband went to bed about one o\u2019clock. Over the defendant\u2019s exception, the Commonwealth introduced the testimony of a police officer that she said her husband was out with her until midnight and that they then went to bed about one o\u2019clock. Since this tended to contradict her testimony, it was admissible. <em>Perrott </em>v. <em>Leahy, </em>302 Mass. 318, 322. <em>Kislowski </em>v. <em>Monkiewicz, </em>310 Mass. 257, 258. Moreover, it is hard to see how its admission harmed the defendant. <em>Furbush </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>318 Mass. 511, 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Officer Grady was called by the defendant and asked about a conversation that he had with the defendant\u2019s former employer about the time when the defendant had last worked for him. That conversation was not in the presence of the defendant. The Commonwealth cross-examined as to what was said in that conversation, subject to the defendant\u2019s exception. As the defendant says in his brief, \u201cBoth attorneys apparently asked the same question and received the same answer.\u201d We think that the defendant cannot object to a cross-examination on the same subject as the direct examination. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>1 Allen, 89, 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The defendant excepted to the admission in evidence of the tools found in the store. They were admissible. \u201cArticles found at the scene of a crime . . . have been frequently admitted in evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Giacomazza, </em>311 Mass. 456, 470. It was no objection to this evidence that it came in after the case was otherwise closed, for the order of evidence is in the discretion of the judge. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fine, </em>321 Mass. 299, 304. The jury could find that the defendant, as well as his companion in the entering, had possession of the tools. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tilley, </em>306 Mass. 412, 417. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tivnon, </em>8 Gray, 375, 381. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conlin, </em>188 Mass. 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
