The defendant paid the plaintiff \u201ca retainer of $175\u201d and promised to pay \u201ca final fee of $200\u201d upon sale of the property. The property has been sold, and the plaintiff brings this action to recover the \u201cfinal fee\u201d of $200 and interest. The judge directed a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The contract between the parties was obviously not a brokerage contract. The plaintiff did not undertake to find a purchaser for the property. The terms of the contract make it clear that the employment of a broker or brokers who should perform the usual services of brokers was contemplated in addition to the employment of the plaintiff. By the terms of the contract the plaintiff was to perform services which were described in general terms in the contract and which included studying the factors affecting the salability of the property, advising the \u201cclient,\u201d preparing illustrated advertising matter and distributing it among brokers, submitting information in response to inquiries from brokers and prospective buyers, stimulating active and intelligent selling interest among brokers by means of correspondence and personal discussion, selecting, when considered advisable, brokers in the neighborhood for handling co-brokerage inquiries from distant brokers, and informing brokers of changes in the property or terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The only witness at the trial was one Lee, called by the plaintiff, who described himself as \u201cthe present department manager of the plaintiff.\u201d He testified in considerable detail as to what the plaintiff had done along the general lines indicated by the terms of the contract. Several exhibits of printed matter prepared by the plaintiff, some of them containing photographs and attractive descriptions of the defendant\u2019s property and other properties, were introduced in evidence.' There were three so called news letters and a \u201cbooklet\u201d of one hundred forty-two pages which described many properties, including the defendant\u2019s, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>which was \u201csold for $1.00 apiece to the public and sent to the brokers.\u201d On cross-examination the witness stated that it was \u201cfair to say that the services that the company performed consisted in sending out the news letters, and the exhibits presented, in the $1.00 magazine, one trip to Williamstown and over to Heath, and possibly two other news letters which haven\u2019t been introduced as exhibits, taking the photographs and having telephone conversations with Miss Nichols, a broker, and with other brokers, and perhaps interviewing some customers in the office. That is stating the facts fairly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The bill of exceptions states that \u201cNo contention was made by the defendant that the evidence offered by the plaintiff was or might be untrue.\u201d We assume, without deciding, that this is to be treated as an admission that Lee\u2019s testimony was trac. It is plain, however, that the defendant did not concede that a verdict could be directed for the plaintiff. The defendant insisted, and still insists, that there was an issue for the jury. We think there was.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The plaintiff had contracted to perform certain services for the defendant. It had impliedly promised to perform those services in a reasonably diligent, skilful, workmanlike, and adequate manner. <em>Abrams </em>v. <em>Factory Mutual Liability Ins. Co. </em>298 Mass. 141, 143. <em>Damiano </em>v. <em>National Grange Mutual Liability Co. </em>316 Mass. 626, 629. The burden was upon the plaintiff to prove at least substantial performance of the contract on its part. <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Kupfer Brothers Co. </em>213 Mass. 218, 221. <em>Pye </em>v. <em>Perry, 217 </em>Mass. 68, 69. <em>Waldo Bros. Co. </em>v. <em>Platt Contracting Co. Inc. </em>305 Mass. 349, 359. If we accept the testimony of Lee as true, the plaintiff rendered services under the contract which it would seem the jury might have found to be sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to recover. But it is plain that the plaintiff could have done much more than it did. The law can supply no standard of performance beyond the bare statement of the rule that a contract for services must be performed in a reasonably diligent, skilful, workmanlike, and adequate manner. Whether the requirement of the role has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>met in a particular instance is commonly a question of fact, even if the evidence as to what was done is undisputed. In general, where two conflicting inferences from established facts are possible, there is a question for the jury. <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Learned, </em>117 Mass. 190, 194. <em>Mercier </em>v. <em>Union Street Railway, </em>230 Mass. 397, 404. <em>Ambrose </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>309 Mass. 219, 222. <em>American Institute for Economic Research </em>v. <em>Assessors of Great Barrington, </em>324 Mass. 509, 514. See <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Washburn, </em>119 Mass. 224, 227. This case is to be distinguished from cases where the question is whether some act has been performed within a reasonable time. In such cases, if the facts are undisputed, what constitutes a reasonable time is commonly a question of law for the court. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Malden, </em>321 Mass. 46, 52, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">The question whether the services called for by the contract were performed in a reasonably diligent, skilful, workmanlike, and adequate manner should have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
