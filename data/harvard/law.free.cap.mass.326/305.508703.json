S. Sts. at Large, 193) in \u00a7 209 (a), as amended in subdivision (2) by Act of March 30, 1948, \u00a7 204 (a), 62 U. S. Sts. at Large, 98, provided in part, \u201cNo action or proceeding to recover possession of any controlled housing accommodations . . . shall be maintainable by any landlord . . . unless \u2014. . .. (2) the landlord seeks in good faith to recover possession of such housing accommodations for his immediate and personal use and occupancy as housing accommodations, or for the immediate and personal use and occupancy as housing accommodations by a member or members of his immediate family . . ..\u201d The 1948 act in \u00a7 204 (e) also adds a provision requiring the landlord to notify the tenant of the purpose for which he desires to recover possession. 62 U. S. Sts. at Large, 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">If, as seems altogether probable, judgment was in fact rendered in the action for possession in favor of the present defendant, the case would fall within the authority of a number of recent decisions holding that the purpose of the landlord in dispossessing the tenant is a matter for determination in the original action for possession and is in fact determined there, if the judgment is for possession, and cannot be litigated anew in an action for deceit. <em>Gabriel </em>v. <em>Borowy, </em>324 Mass. 231, 236. <em>Sher </em>v. <em>Perlman, </em>324 Mass. 390, 392. <em>Noyes </em>v. <em>Shanahan, </em>325 Mass. 601, 604. <em>David </em>v. <em>Fayman, </em>273 App. Div. (N. Y.) 408, affirmed 298 N. Y. 669. <em>Rosenbluth </em>v. <em>Sackadorf, </em>274 App. Div. (N. Y.) 794, affirmed 298 N. Y. 761. See <em>Wishnewsky </em>v. <em>Saugus, </em>325 Mass. 191, 194-196, and cases cited; 62 Harv. L. Rev. 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">But since it does not positively appear that judgment was in fact entered in the action for possession, we prefer to place this decision upon another ground. A declaration in an action of tort for deceit is demurrable unless it alleges some legal damage to the plaintiff. The mere deceit does not create a cause of action. <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>118 Mass. 239. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Corbin, </em>195 Mass. 520. <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Dick, </em>220 Mass. 556, 558. <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>286 Mass. 311, 315. <em>Pearl </em>v. <em>Wm. Filene\u2019s Sons Co. </em>317 Mass. 529, 532. <em>Dubois </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>v. <em>Atlantic Corp. </em>322 Mass. 512, 520-521. The general allegation of damage \u201cas alleged in his writ <em>\u201d </em>is not enough. <em>Antokol </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>248 Mass. 393, 395. The only damages set forth in the declaration before us are that the plaintiff incurred great cost and expense in buying and repairing a house and in moving into it. This is not enough. The plaintiff has the house, with the benefit of the repairs. So far as appears he paid only what the house and the repairs were worth. He may even have paid less and so profited by the transaction. See <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>McKleroy, </em>206 Ala. 342, 348; <em>Trepanier </em>v. <em>Hujber, </em>134 Conn. 24; <em>Camp Realty Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>77 Ga. App. 149. As to the expense of moving, without implying that the cost of moving out of a tenement as the result of a deceit could never constitute legal damages, we do not see how such cost can be recoverable in a case like this where the moving was a mere incident to the purchase of a house which may have involved no loss and may even have involved a profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">The order sustaining the demurrer is affirmed and judgment is to be entered for the defendant. <em>Keljikian </em>v. <em>Star Brewing Co. </em>303 Mass. 53, 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
