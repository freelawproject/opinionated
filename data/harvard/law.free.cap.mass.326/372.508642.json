The plaintiffs excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-17\">There was evidence tending to prove the following. The defendants employed the plaintiffs to procure a buyer at a commission of five per cent. The plaintiffs procured one Shaw and his wife as buyers, and the Shaws entered into a written contract, the( validity of which is not questioned, for the purchase and sale of the real estate for $8,000, subject to the ability of the buyers to obtain a certain mortgage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>for $7,000. The buyers were able to obtain such a mortgage. But the buyers refused to perform their contract to buy. After that \u2014 though nothing appears to turn on it \u2014 the defendants made a sale at the same price to one Stan-hope, who obtained a similar mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The evidence was not that the passing of title was required for the earning of a commission. The plaintiffs were merely to \u201cprocure a buyer,\u201d and the commission was to be payable \u201cfor obtaining a buyer.\u201d By entering into a valid contract of sale and purchase with the Shaws, the defendants accepted them as customers able, ready and willing to buy, and made unnecessary any further proof that they were such. <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>148 Mass. 518. <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>174 Mass. 408. <em>Roche </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>176 Mass. 595, 597. <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Plant, </em>218 Mass. 148, 152, 153. <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>237 Mass. 371, 372.
