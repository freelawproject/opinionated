All three cases raise the question whether the employing enterprise with which the cases are concerned, operated by successive employing units, was entitled to a more favorable contribution rate than that with which it had been charged and at which it had paid for parts of the years 1944 and 1945, and the questions now before us are whether, in what manner, and to what extent the successive employing units or any of them can realize the benefit of the \u201coverpayments.\u201d The first case is a bill in equity by the fourth and latest employing unit praying for a declaratory judgment that it is entitled to the benefit of all the \u201coverpayments\u201d by way of having them applied against qontributions payable by it under the act. The second and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>third cases are actions of contract brought under \u00a7 18 of the act as appearing in St. 1941, c. 685, \u00a7 1, by the second and third employing units to recover the \u201coverpayments\u201d made by each respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">From the facts agreed it appears that prior to May 9, 1944, Walsh Holyoke Steam Boiler Works, Inc., hereinafter called Walsh Holyoke Steam, the first employing unit, operated the enterprise and because of its previous record enjoyed a contribution rate of one half of one per cent. On that day Franklin Machine &amp; Foundry Company, the second employing unit, hereinafter called Franklin, by acquisition of the capital stock and all the assets and employees of Walsh Holyoke Steam, succeeded to the enterprise; but the director denied to Franklin the benefit of the wage experience of Walsh Holyoke Steam and assessed Franklin as a new employing unit at the rate of two and seven tenths per cent, at which rate Franklin paid until March 31, 1945. On April 1, 1945, Franklin transferred to Walsh Holyoke Boiler Works, Inc., hereinafter called Walsh Holyoke, a new corporation, being the third employing unit, the assets, employees, and business of the employing enterprise in exchange for all the stock of the new corporation, and Walsh Holyoke became a succeeding employing unit. The director assessed it as a new employing unit at the rate of two and seven tenths per cent. Finally, in May, 1946, Continental-United Industries Co., Inc., hereinafter called Continental, which then owned all the stock of Walsh Holyoke, exchanged its stock ownership for the assets of the latter corporation and continued the business and so became the fourth employing unit operating the enterprise. In each instance the successor employing unit took over the entire business of its predecessor, continued it without interruption, and assumed all its liabilities. In each instance the predecessor unit wholly ceased to do business in this Commonwealth, and the successor unit had no business in this Commonwealth other than that to which it \u25a0succeeded. Moreover, at all times Continental owned all the stock of Franklin and through stock ownership was at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>all material times the sole real owner and in control of the entire enterprise through all the changes hereinbefore narrated. We read the brief of the Attorney General in behalf of the director as conceding that the second, third and fourth of these employing units was each in turn a successor employing unit within the meaning of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">It now becomes necessary to turn to the pertinent statutes. By St. 1945, c. 516, certain changes were made in subsection (c) of \u00a7 14 of the act. As so modified the subsection, so far as here material, read, \u201c(c) For the purposes of this section, when the employing enterprises of an employer or employers are continued solely and without interruption by an employing unit not previously subject to this chapter, the contribution record of the predecessors and the record of workers\u2019 benefit wages which were charged or would have been charged to the predecessor employer or employers, if no change in legal identity or form had occurred, shall cease to be the records of the predecessor employer and shall become part of the records of the successor employing unit in determining his benefit wage ratio in the following cases: \u2014 . . . 7. Where a corporation so succeeds to the employing enterprises of an individual, partnership or other corporation, without substantial change in the nature of the business.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After providing that the subsection should apply retrospectively for (as relates to this case) the years 1944 and 1945, the subsection contained a proviso \u201cthat the provisions of this subsection shall not authorize the refund of any moneys except in accordance with section eighteen. The director may, however, issue credit memoranda as against future contributions to any employer entitled thereto under this chapter. Said credit memoranda shall be personal to the employer to whom issued and shall not be assigned or encumbered, or be subject to trustee or mesne process.\u201d This act became effective September 26, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>1945.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The reference to \"credit memoranda\u201d was new in the act of 1945. The \u00a7 18 to which reference is made appears in St. 1941, c. 685, \u00a7 1. It provides that if, upon application within three years of a person who has paid a contribution, the director shall determine that the contribution \"was erroneously collected,\u201d he \"shall allow such person to make an adjustment thereof in connection with a subsequent payment, or shall authorize the refund of said amount . . ..\u201d It further provides that where the director denies an application for a readjustment or a refund, \u201cwhich application has been filed by an applicant who has paid a contribution under this chapter, such applicant, in addition to any other remedy which he may have, may bring an action of contract against the director to recover the whole or any part of such contribution.\u201d Further details of this section are not here material.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">After the act of 1945 became effective on September 26, 1945, the director issued to Franklin \"a credit memorandum\u201d in the amount of $10,991.06 to cover so much of its previous contributions as would be an \"overpayment\u201d when according to the retrospective feature of the 1945 act Franklin became entitled to the benefit of the record of its predecessor with respect to the years 1944 and 1945; but Franklin had no opportunity to use this \"credit memorandum\u201d against any contributions due from it because its successor, Walsh Holyoke, had taken over the enterprise before the 1945 act took effect and before this credit memorandum was issued. Similarly the director issued a \"credit memorandum\u201d to Walsh Holyoke;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but that employer was able to use only a small part of its' \u201ccredit memorandum\u201d against contributions due from it before its successor, Continental, took over the enterprise. The unused portion of this \u201ccredit memorandum\u201d is $4,645.63. From the time when the 1945 act took effect the director has given Walsh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Holyoke and Continental the benefit of their predecessors\u2019 wage experience in calculating their contributions as they have fallen due; but he has refused to allow Continental to apply against its own contributions the \u201ccredit memoranda\u201d issued to its predecessors because of the provision of \u00a7 14 (c) that \u201cSaid credit memoranda shall be personal to the employer to whom issued and shall not be assigned or encumbered, or be subject to trustee or mesne process,\u201d and he has denied refunds under \u00a7 18 to Franklin and Walsh Holyoke because when the \u201coverpayments\u201d were made the 1945 act had not yet taken effect and therefore, as he contends, the payments were not \u201cerroneously collected\u201d within the meaning of those words in \u00a7 18. Franklin and Walsh Holyoke have acted in all respects in compliance with the provisions and within the limitations of \u00a7 18. Thus it appears that because of the rapid succession of employing units in this business enterprise and the positions taken by the director the enterprise has been unable as yet to realize through any of its successive employing units the benefit of contributions aggregating $15,636.69 which according to the retrospective feature of the 1945 act were \u201coverpayments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">In our opinion the director rightly refused to allow Continental to apply against its own contributions the \u201ccredit memoranda\u201d issued to its predecessors. Its only possible claim to such right of application is as assignee of these \u201ccredit memoranda\u201d by virtue of its acquisition in general of the assets of its predecessors. But the Legislature made doubly sure in the next to the last paragraph of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 151A, \u00a7 14, subsection (c), as appearing in St. 1945, c. 516, that \u201ccredit memoranda,\u201d for which provision was first made in that act, should not become assignable assets. Not only were they to be \u201cpersonal to the employer to whom issued\u201d but they were not to \u201cbe assigned or encumbered, or be subject to trustee or mesne process.\u201d The purpose seems to have been to set up merely bookkeeping credits to be availed of only as offsets against subsequent charges in the same accounts. The director in keeping the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>accounts was to be relieved of all questions relating to assignments in whole or in part or to attachments or other liens. He need not look beyond his credits and charges. The statute admits of no exceptions. Justice does not require any exception in the case of a .succeeding employer. Ordinarily there is no inherent reason why a successor should acquire the right to credit past overpayments of his predecessor against his own future obligations. The relation of predecessor and successor employer may arise in many ways. Sometimes all the assets may be transferred and sometimes they may not be. Not infrequently the predecessor may retain all receivables or some of them. Conveyances and contracts between predecessor and successor may contain complicated provisions. In instances of successive employers, as in other instances, questions could be involved with which it was intended that the director should not concern himself in any degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Continental relies upon the cases of <em>Packard Clothes </em>Inc. v. <em>Director of the Division of Employment Security, </em>318 Mass. 329, and <em>Bartels </em>v. <em>Director of the Division of Employment Security, ante, </em>1, but in those cases the plaintiffs were the same employers that had made the payments, and no question of assignment was involved in either case.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">It must be remembered, however, that an employer\u2019s right to avail himself of a \u201ccredit memorandum\u201d is distinct from his right to a refund. The right to a refund may still exist, even where a \u201ccredit memorandum\u201d has been issued. That right is recognized in \u00a7 14, subsection (c), as appearing in St. 1945, c. 516, by the reference therein to \u00a7 18, which governs the exercise of the right. The right is to be availed of by application by \u201ca person who has paid such contribution\u201d and, if the director denies the application, by action, of contract against the director (\u00a7 18).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiffs Franklin and Walsh Holyoke are such persons. They have brought such actions and have qualified within the provisions of \u00a7 18. They are entitled to refunds. Continental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>does not claim any right to refunds. And it is agreed by all parties in the case stated that Continental does not seek even the benefit of the \u201ccredit memoranda,\u201d if both Franklin and Walsh Holyoke are entitled to refunds. By means of refunds to Franklin and Walsh Holyoke the \u201cover-payments\u201d will be set right, and will be returned to the employers which paid them. If because of arrangements between these plaintiffs and Continental the money should ultimately go to Continental, that is a matter not here involved and of no concern to the director. There will have been compliance with the statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">We cannot agree with the position taken by the director that Franklin and Walsh Holyoke are not entitled to refunds because the \u201coverpayments\u201d were not <em>\u201cerroneously </em>collected\u201d (emphasis supplied) from those employers before September 26, 1945, when St. 1945, c. 516, took effect, whereby those employers acquired express statutory rights to avail themselves of the contribution records of their predecessors in the determination of their own benefit wage ratios. We think that under our previous decisions, and in the circumstances of these cases, Franklin and Walsh Holyoke had similar rights before St. 1945, c. 516, took effect, and independently of that statute. In the case of <em>Packard Clothes Inc. </em>v. <em>Director of the Division of Employment Security, </em>318 Mass. 329, at page 335, speaking of \u00a7 14 as it appeared in St. 1941, c. 685, \u00a7 1, before the insertion of any subsection (c) whereby express provision was made giving a successor employing unit the benefit of the record of its predecessor, and speaking also of subsection (c) as inserted by St. 1943, c. 534, \u00a7 1A, which was the immediate precursor of subsection (c) as appearing in St. 1945, c. 516, we said, \u201cWe are of opinion that the absence from \u00a7 14 as it appears in St. 1941, c. 685, \u00a7 1, of any provision for the transfer of merit ratings does not mean that a successor' employing unit, such as the plaintiff, is not entitled to enjoy the merit ratings acquired and enjoyed by the predecessor employing unit at the time of the succession. That the Legislature did not so intend is evidenced by the provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>of St. 1943, c. 534, \u00a7 1A.\u201d And on page 336 we said, \u201cWe think that the amendment [\u00a1expressly providing for the transfer of merit ratings] was intended to clarify the subject matter and to assure transfer of merit ratings in the particular cases specified, leaving the subject as to cases such as the present one to be governed by those provisions of \u00a7 14 that were unaffected by the amendment.\u201d That case was followed in <em>Bartels </em>v. <em>Director of the Division of Employment Security, ante, </em>1, 5-7. We do not repeat the reasoning fully set forth in those cases. We think it applies in the cases before us, where the enterprise was continuous, remained at all material times the same, and throughout all the changes in corporate form was wholly owned by Continental. It follows that the \u201coverpayments\u201d by Franklin and Walsh Holyoke <em>were </em>\u201cerroneously collected\u201d at the times when these payments were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">In the suit in equity a decree is to be entered to the effect that Continental is not entitled to have the \u201ccredit memoranda\u201d for the \u201coverpayments\u201d applied in payment of contributions due from it. In the actions of Franklin and Walsh Holyoke judgment is to be entered for the plaintiffs respectively in the sums of $10,991.06 and $4,645.63, to be paid out of the clearing account as provided in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 151A, \u00a7 18, as appearing in St. 1941, c. 685, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b472-6\"> This subparagraph numbered 7 was the first express statutory recognition of the right of a single corporate employer succeeding another single corporate employer to the benefit of the predecessor\u2019s merit rating in calculating the successor\u2019s contributions.
