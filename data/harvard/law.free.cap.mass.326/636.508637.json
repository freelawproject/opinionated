There was a verdict for the plaintiff. The defendant\u2019s one exception is to the denial of its motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The jury could have found these facts. Shortly after 10 a.m. on July 13, 1948, the defendant\u2019s driver parked the truck close to the rear of another parked truck. The driver went to the rear of the defendant\u2019s truck, which was just off the crosswalk, and lifted the door. The door was held up and open by automatic snaps on \u201cbraces which run over knobs.\u201d To shut the door it was necessary to push the braces up on both sides. The door was approximately four feet long and, when opened up, extended four feet. The open door was \u201cflatwise\u201d and protruded one foot to two thirds of the way over the crosswalk. It was silver colored, of very thin metal, one eighth to one quarter of an inch at the edge. The driver took his tools out of the back of the truck and, without closing the door, returned to the sidewalk and looked after the delivery of oil. He had been so engaged about ten minutes when the plaintiff was hurt. The plaintiff, seventy-one years of age, was crossing in the direction of the building which was receiving the oil. The section was one of busy traffic at the junction of four streets leading into Central Square. The plaintiff \u201cwas walking in between\u201d the white lines marking the crosswalk. He noticed the defendant\u2019s parked truck, but did not observe the sharp edge of the door until he struck his head against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The defendant\u2019s contention is that the alleged dangerous condition was obvious to a person of ordinary intelligence. It relies upon such cases as <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Rail</em>way, 243 Mass. 469, 472, <em>Pastrick </em>v. <em>S. S. Kresge Co. </em>288 Mass. 194, 196, and <em>Bannister </em>v. <em>Berkshire Street Railway, </em>301 Mass. 598, 601. We think, however, that these cases do not apply, and that the case was rightly submitted to the jury. The plaintiff was lawfully using a crosswalk at a busy intersection in one of our larger cities. Proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>regard for his own safety required that he give heed to traffic on four streets. His conduct is not to be judged according to the same criterion as if the defendant\u2019s truck and he were alone on those streets. He was not contributorily negligent as matter of law. The jury could find that it was negligent for the defendant\u2019s driver to raise the thin, sharp edged, silver colored door to a horizontal position encroaching upon the crosswalk and to leave it unattended at a height above the ground where it might be expected to escape the observation of some pedestrians. <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>American Express Co. </em>219 Mass. 314, 317. <em>Agnew </em>v. <em>Franks, </em>255 Mass. 539, 541. See <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. </em>292 Mass. 526; <em>Giacomuzzi </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>324 Mass. 689; <em>Keeley </em>v. <em>Miller Drug Co. </em>324 Mass. 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
