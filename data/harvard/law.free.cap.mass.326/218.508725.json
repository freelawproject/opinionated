An expert witness testified that \u201cthe firing pin was a standard part and could be tooled by a machinist from a large nail or spike and that he inserted a firing pin\u201d in the gun and fired it. The defendants excepted to the denial of their motions for directed verdicts presented at the conclusion of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">It is their contention that in the absence of the firing pin, without which the gun could not be fired, the gun was not a machine gun within the meaning of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 140, \u00a7 121, as amended, which provides that \u201cAny gun of small arm calibre designed for rapid fire and operated by a mechanism, or any gun which operates automatically after the first shot has been fired, either by gas action or recoil action, shall be deemed to be a machine gun for the purposes of . . . sections [one hundred and twenty-two to one hundred and twenty-nine, inclusive], and of sections one hundred and thirty-one and one hundred and thirty-one B.\u201d The offence of having in possession a machine gun is set forth in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 269, \u00a7 10, as most recently amended by St. 1937, c. 250, \u00a7 1, wherein it is also made an offence for a person to carry \u201con his person or under his control in a vehicle, a pistol or revolver, loaded or unloaded, without permission under section one hundred and thirty-one of chapter one hundred and forty.\u201d The intent .of \u00a7 10, which also penalizes the carrying of dirk knives, metallic knuckles and certain other dangerous weapons, is to protect the public from the potential danger incident to the unlawful possession of such weapons. It is to be noted that it is no less a crime to carry without a license a revolver or pistol which is unloaded than to carry one which is loaded. <em>Redus </em>v. <em>State, </em>82 Ala. 53, 54. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>State, </em>61 Ga. 417, 418. <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>State, 7 </em>Ohio N. P. 224. <em>Steele </em>v. <em>State, </em>73 Tex. Cr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>352. While it may be conceded that a weapon designed for firing projectiles may be so defective or damaged that it has lost its initial character as a firearm, see <em>Burnside </em>v. <em>State, </em>105 Miss. 408, this character is not lost when a relatively slight repair, replacement, or adjustment will make it an effective weapon. <em>Atwood </em>v. <em>State, </em>53 Ala. 508. <em>Redus </em>v. <em>State, </em>82 Ala. 53. <em>Fielding </em>v. <em>State, </em>135 Ala. 56. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grab, </em>54 D. &amp; C. (Pa.) 233. In the instant case the absence of the easily replaceable firing pin did not destroy the character of the implement in question as a machine gun. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>State, </em>61 Ga. 417. <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>State, </em>99 Miss. 579. Compare <em>People </em>v. <em>Boitano, </em>18 N. Y. Sup. (2d) 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The defendants further excepted to the submission to the jury by the judge of the following four questions relating to the gun which had been marked exhibit 1: \u201c1. Do the jury find that the defendant Bartholomew was in possession of the weapon marked Exhibit #1? 2. Do the jury find that the defendant Hughes was in possession of the weapon marked Exhibit #1? 3. Do the jury find that the weapon marked Exhibit #1 when in the possession of the defendants, or either of them, was capable of firing a shot or bullet? 4. Do the jury find that the weapon marked Exhibit #1, was a machine gun as defined in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 140, \u00a7 121?\u201d Having been instructed \u201cthat if they answered the first two questions in the negative, there would be no further instructions necessary, but that if either of the first two questions were answered in the affirmative, then they should answer the third and fourth questions after which further instructions as to their duties, if necessary would be given them,\u201d the jury answered questions 1, 2, and 4 in the affirmative and question 3 in the negative. The record states that \u201cThe jury thereupon returned verdicts of guilty against each defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">No part of the judge\u2019s charge is reported. Whether a judge in the trial of a criminal case may submit specific questions of fact to be answered by a jury, so far as we are aware, has never been decided in this Commonwealth. Such a practice in civil cases is of long standing and does not de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>pend upon G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 124. <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Ludwig, </em>292 Mass. 251, 259. <em>Burgess </em>v. <em>Giovannucci, </em>314 Mass. 252. General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 278, \u00a7 11, which contains without substantial change the provisions of St. 1807, c. 140, \u00a7 15, provides that in a criminal case \u201cThe jury shall try ... all criminal causes committed to them, and, after having received the instructions of the court, shall decide, in their discretion, by a general verdict, both the fact and the law involved in the issue, or they may, at their election, find a special verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">It is not necessary to determine here whether the judge could properly adopt this established civil practice and submit specific questions over the objections of the defendants because, if he was in error, such error was cured by the subsequent return of general verdicts. The answers were not inconsistent with and were superseded by the verdicts. If the answers be considered as incorporated in the verdicts and thereby a part of them, the validity of the verdicts is not affected. \u201cA verdict may ... be good as a general verdict, though some fact is specially found, by way of exception or qualification.\u201d <em>Dyer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>23 Pick. 402, 404. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fischblatt, </em>4 Met. 354, 355. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stebbins, </em>8 Gray, 492; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lang, </em>10 Gray, 11; <em>Ashton </em>v. <em>Touhey, </em>131 Mass. 26, 29; <em>Minot </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>201 Mass. 10, 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">A like conclusion is reached if, as contended by the defendants, the answers of the jury to the special questions be considered as a special verdict. \u201cIn the ordinary case of a general verdict of guilty, the jury, by the very terms of their verdict, find the prisoner guilty of all the material allegations in the indictment. Not so in a special verdict, for the very object of this departure from the usual form is presumed to be for the purpose of declaring the prisoner guilty of certain facts only, with a view of submitting the question, whether those facts authorize a general verdict of guilty, to the judgment of the court. In such a case, if the facts thus found do not include all the essential elements of the offence charged upon the prisoner, he cannot be convicted.\u201d <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Call, </em>21 Pick. 509, 514. Here the answers to the questions appear to include findings as to all the essential elements of the offence charged. It was stated, however, by Chief Justice Shaw in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anthes, </em>5 Gray, 185, at pages 206-207, \u201calthough they [the jury]] may return a special verdict, they are not bound to do so.\u201d See 1 Chitty\u2019s Cr. Law (4th Am. ed.) 642; 1 Starkie, Cr. PI. (2d ed.) 351. The history of special verdicts in England and in this Commonwealth need not be related. See <em>Frati </em>v. <em>Jannini, </em>226 Mass. 430, 431-432. Instances of their return may be found in the following cases. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Call, </em>21 Pick. 509. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>21 Pick. 523. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fischblatt, </em>4 Met. 354. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>10 Met. 263, 282; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Strain, </em>10 Met. 521. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davidson, </em>1 Cush. 33. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>8 Cush. 571. See <em>Dyer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>23 Pick. 402. If the answers here amount to a special verdict and if as matter of law the return of such verdict is a privilege of the jury and something which cannot be ordered by the judge, which we do not decide, the error, if any, was remedied by the return of the general verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">An additional objection to the submission of the fourth question to the jury is on the ground that whether the gun was a machine gun as defined in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 140, \u00a7 121, as amended, was a question of law for the judge to decide and not a question of fact for the ju,ry. We perceive no merit in this contention. The question was one of fact to be answered under appropriate instructions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Squire, </em>1 Met. 258, 259. <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>State, </em>62 Ala. 3. <em>People </em>v. <em>Tardibuono, </em>174 Misc. (N. Y.) 305. <em>Farris </em>v. <em>State, </em>64 Tex. Cr. 524, 530. <em>Miles </em>v. <em>State, </em>77 Tex. Cr. 597. Compare <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>State, </em>99 Miss. 579. As above stated, the answer, if erroneously received, was superseded or cured by the general verdicts and it is to be assumed that full and accurate instructions were given the jury before they returned their verdicts. <em>M &amp; M Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Hood Rubber Co. </em>226 Mass. 181, 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
