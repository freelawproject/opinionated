Hoehn and his wife Elizabeth Hoehn from a final decree of the Superior Court dismissing their claim for death payments under the workmen\u2019s compensation act. It was admitted that their son Richard A. Hoehn was killed on July 15,1948, while in the employ of the American Woolen Company, and that his death arose out of and in the course of his employment. The issue is that of dependency. The \u201cfindings and decision\u201d of the reviewing board state that \u201cOn consideration of all the evidence we find and rule that the claimants were not dependent for support upon the earnings of the deceased at the time of his fatal injury and deny their respective claims for compensation.\u201d The words \u201cfind and rule\u201d import that the conclusion stated is permissible as matter of law and is found as matter of fact. <em>Roney\u2019s Case, </em>316 Mass. 732, 734. It is the contention of the claimants that this finding is erroneous because based upon the ruling stated in the decision that \u201cthe claimants must show need, and dependence for support on the earnings of the deceased.\u201d There was evidence that the decedent, who was nineteen years of age, made his home with his parents, as did a younger brother sixteen years old. The parents owned^their own home subject t\u00f3 a mortgage. Richard O. Hoehn earned $75 to $77 per week. The younger brother, who was a student, earned from $4 to $10 a week in the summer. The mother was employed and had during the year preceding her son\u2019s death earned $1,189.48, receiving a salary of $42 per week. The decedent earned about $50 per week. All members of the family turned over their earnings to the mother who used the money to operate the household, make tax and mortgage payments, buy clothing, pay medical expenses, and make repairs on the house. The decedent received about $7 per week back from his mother for spending money. The father owned two automobiles which apparently were used for pleasure. There was no presumption of dependency in the present case under the provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 32, as amended, and the burden was upon the claimants to prove that they of either of them was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>\u201cwholly or partly dependent upon the earnings of the employee for support at the time of the injury.\u201d C. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 1 (3), 31, as amended. <em>Ferriter\u2019s Case, </em>269 Mass. 267, 268. It is not enough to show that the money received from the son was a benefit to the claimants or the claimants\u2019 family. There must be evidence that the claimants depended in some degree for their support upon the earnings of the son and that there was \u201cneed\u201d on the part of the parents for contributions from the son. <em>Doherty\u2019s Case, </em>277 Mass. 339, 341. <em>Musgrave\u2019s Case, </em>281 Mass. 416, 421. The statute, however, does not \u201crequire absolute poverty on the part of the dependent, although it does imply some degree of need.\u201d <em>Connor\u2019s Case, </em>295 Mass. 106, 109. \u201cThough proof that a person could not have subsisted without aid from the employee is not essential to establish the existence of a relation of dependency . . . dependency implies some degree of need. This is a clear inference from the cases in which the financial ability or the ability to work of the alleged dependents has been taken into consideration as material.\u201d <em>Ferriter\u2019s Case, </em>269 Mass. 267,270, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The ruling of the board on the law and its finding of fact were distinct and separate. The ruling was correct and the finding was supported by the evidence. See <em>Di Clavio\u2019s Case, </em>293 Mass. 259, 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
