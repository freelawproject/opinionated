According to the findings of the single member, which were adopted by the reviewing board, the employee had been employed by Glenwood Range Company as a molder for about forty-three years, during which time he had been exposed to silica dust. On December 15, 1948, the last day on which he worked, he had inhaled the \u201cmaximum amount\u201d of this dust and received \u201ca personal injury arising out of and in the course of his employment . . . namely, a moderately advanced bilateral silicosis.\u201d \u201cHe is able to do many types of light work but is unable to do the work of a molder.\u201d His average weekly wage was $65.59 and his earning capacity in \u201cnon-laborious\u201d work is $35 per week. Compensation was awarded by the reviewing board and, on certification to the Superior Court, by a decree of that court at the rate of $25 per week plus $2.50 per week for dependency compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">The self insurer contends that there was not sufficient evidence to warrant the finding of the reviewing board. It is settled that findings of fact by the board are final if there is any evidence to support them, <em>Pigeon\u2019s Case, </em>216 Mass. 51; <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 388, 390; <em>Minns\u2019s Case, </em>286 Mass. 459, 464; <em>Chapman\u2019s Case, </em>321 Mass. 705, 707, and cases cited; and cannot be reversed unless required as matter of law. <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>258 Mass. 489, 493. <em>Perangelo\u2019s Case, </em>277 Mass. 59, 62. <em>McCann\u2019s Case, </em>286 Mass. 541, 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">.There was testimony by the employee that he was sixty-two years old and had worked about forty-three years for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>self insurer as a molder. During this period he was subjected to dust. \u201cIn his early stage there was more dust than there was the last because they used black lead, lead and charcoal and there was dust all the time, but it was worse at the last of it on account of the dry dust.\u201d \u201cAround 1944 or 1945 he began to slow up in his wind.\u201d Since 1944 when getting up in the morning \u201che has hard work to get going, he is all choked up, has to sit around before he can eat his breakfast, cough and get the stuff up.\u201d \u201cIn the morning he coughs an awful lot, he has to wait to eat his breakfast, he does not eat any breakfast until he gets straightened out, sometimes after he eats his breakfast he coughs and loses his breakfast.\u201d He has done no work since December 15, 1948, when the plant shut down. He does not think he is able to do any work. He tried to help out a fellow feeding chickens and could not carry pails of grain, \u201che got tired, his legs were tired.\u201d \u201cHe was short of breath, he could not carry.\u201d He does not know any trade besides the molder\u2019s trade. Assuming the plant shut down on a Thursday, \u201che would have been back to work Friday but for the fact they shut the plant down ... if the plant \"was going ... he [would] have been working.\u201d From December 1 until December 15, 1948, he had shortness of breath. \u201cAsked if he would tell why he worked the last fifteen days there if he had all the trouble he talked about, the witness replied, it had been rumored around there the place was going out of business and he was going to stay to the finish. Asked in spite of the way he felt, the witness replied, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">There was medical evidence that the employee had a moderately advanced case of bilateral silicosis. The physician called by the self insurer testified that \u201cboth lung fields are filled with medium sized nodularities and there is a dense patch of infiltration at the right base,\u201d and that the degree of silicosis which the employee has \u201cis disabling for very heavy work and ... is disabling for work as a molder.\u201d The impartial physician-reported that \u201cwork which is less laborious than that which he has been doing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>can be allowed with safety.\u201d There was evidence that the sand with which the employee worked contained seventy-five and sixty-eight one-hundredths per cent silica.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Silicosis, although termed a disease, is traceable to a personal injury within the meaning of the workmen\u2019s compensation law. <em>Panagotopulos\u2019s Case, </em>276 Mass. 600, 604. The personal injury is caused by the gradual accumulation in the body of harmful foreign matter and, when such accumulation becomes so great that it results in incapacity for work, the injury becomes compensable. <em>Fabrizio\u2019s Case, </em>274 Mass. 352, 354. <em>DeFilippo\u2019s Case, </em>284 Mass. 531, 533-534. <em>Crowley\u2019s Case, </em>287 Mass. 367. <em>Wnukowski\u2019s Case, </em>296 Mass. 63. <em>Gustafson\u2019s Case, </em>303 Mass. 397. <em>Duggan\u2019s Case, </em>315 Mass. 355, 359. The history of his symptoms given by the employee plus the medical evidence justified the finding of the board that the employee had received a personal injury which, on December 15, 1948, had become compensable. <em>Crowley\u2019s, Case, </em>287 Mass. 367, 373. This injury clearly was of such a nature that it incapacitated the \u201cemployee from earning full wages for a period of at least seven days.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 29, as appearing in St. 1937, c. 382. Although the employee continued to work until the plant shut down and filed no claim for compensation until the following February, these facts were not decisive of the issues as to personal injury and incapacity. In <em>Gustafson\u2019s Case, </em>303 Mass. 397, where the employee quit work because there was no further work for him, it was held that the finding that he received a personal injury from silicosis on the date he stopped work was warranted. If the silicosis of the employee had, on the day the plant closed, developed to such a point that the employee was disabled for continued work as a molder, the intention of the employee to keep on working, while material to his belief in his ability to work, did not determine his physical incapacity. See <em>Anderson\u2019s Case, </em>288 Mass. 96, 99; <em>Hunnewell\u2019s Case, </em>220 Mass. 351, 355. Compensation for partial incapacity may be awarded where the employee is unable to continue his usual work but can perform other labor of a less remuner<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>ative kind. <em>Percival\u2019s Case, </em>268 Mass. 50, 54. <em>Biscardi\u2019s Case, </em>284 Mass. 14, 19-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The employee testified that he had applied for unemployment benefits and in his application had said that he was available for work. No evidence was presented, however, that he had received such benefits and on the record the principle of <em>Pierce\u2019s Case, </em>325 Mass. 649, does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Costs under G. L. (Ter.
