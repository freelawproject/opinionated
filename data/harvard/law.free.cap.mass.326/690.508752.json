It appears that the defendant was indicted on September 14, 1949, and was arraigned on September 19, 1949; on the latter date counsel representing him filed an appearance in the case. The case was called for trial on October 7, 1949, and the defendant, who had just been tried on another indictment, requested through counsel a continuance for a week. The reason given by counsel was that he had not been able to look into the case. The request was denied subject to the defendant\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>It has often been said that the granting of a continuance rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Friedman, </em>256 Mass. 214, 216. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Millen, </em>289 Mass. 441, 463. The defendant had the burden of showing that the ruling complained of was erroneous. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>311 Mass. 82, 87. We find nothing in the record indicating an abuse of discretion. Moreover, the bill of exceptions nowhere states that it contains all the evidence material to the challenged ruling. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McIntosh, </em>259 Mass. 388, 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
