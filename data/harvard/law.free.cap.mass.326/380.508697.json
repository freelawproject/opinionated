G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 120. Thereafter the judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion to enter a verdict for him under leave reserved. The action comes here on exceptions of the defendant to the denial of these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The only issues argued by the defendant are, first, whether or not there is any evidence upon which the jury could find negligence on the defendant\u2019s part, and, second, assuming there is evidence upon which negligence on the part of the defendant could be found, whether or not there is evidence which would warrant a finding that there was a causal connection between such negligence and the plaintiff\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The plaintiff and her hpsband were so injured that they could remember none of the events leading to the accident except that they were on their way to Millers Falls.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">On evidence most favorable to the plaintiff the jury could reasonably have found the following facts: The plaintiff was a passenger on the front seat of an automobile owned and operated by her husband and there were two passengers on the rear seat of this automobile, which will be hereinafter referred to as the plaintiff\u2019s automobile. The defendant was the operator and alone in the other automobile, which will be hereinafter referred to as the defendant\u2019s automobile. The accident happened on Route 2 which runs east and west from Orange to Greenfield. Route 2A branches off the southerly side of Route 2 at an acute angle and proceeds in a westerly direction to Millers Falls. The accident happened on June 19, 1947, at about 10:15 p.m. about three hundred feet east of the junction of Routes 2 and 2A at a point where the highway is about forty-two feet wide. On the southerly side of Route 2 east of the junction there is a gravel turnout about four hundred fifty feet long and thirteen feet wide at its widest point, gradually coming to a point at each end. The accident happened about opposite the widest point of this turnout. There is also an area several feet wide on the northerly side of Route 2 which is not a shoulder but could be driven on. There is a downgrade on Route 2 to a point just west of the junction and an up<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>grade from this point running easterly from the junction. There is a hill approximately three hundred feet west of the junction from the top of which the view is unobstructed for a considerable distance in both directions. The defendant came down this hill in an easterly direction at a speed of thirty-five to forty miles an hour. As he came down this hill he first saw the plaintiff\u2019s automobile, approaching from the east, when it was at least \u201ca good thousand feet away.\u201d He crossed through the junction on his right side of the road. The other automobile coiitinued to come, and when it was within a hundred feet of him, his attention was attracted to it when it then started to veer to his side of the road. He did not apply his brakes and did not decrease his speed. He did not alter his course and did nothing to avoid the accident. After the collision the front ends of the automobiles were jammed against each other so that they had to be pulled apart. After the accident there was room enough on the left side of the defendant\u2019s automobile, on the northerly side .of the highway, for two automobiles to go by \u201cand then some.\u201d There were no other vehicles, on Route 2 in this vicinity at the time of the accident. The defendant was familiar with this junction. The defendant at the hospital the day after the accident stated, \u201cI\u2019m sorry the accident happened. It\u2019s \u00e1ll my fault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">-We are of opinion that there was sufficient evidence to warrant the jury in finding that the defendant was negligent and that his negligence was the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. There was no error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The jury could reasonably find that he was familiar with this junction; that when he first saw the plaintiff\u2019s automobile approaching from the east, he should have realized that it might turn into Route 2A to go to Millers Falls; that his attention was attracted to it when it was one hundred feet away veering toward his side of the road; that from this he could have reasonably inferred that it apparently was then about to enter Route 2A; that even then he took no adequate precaution to avoid the collision which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>subsequently occurred; that he did not apply his brakes; that he did not decrease the speed of his automobile; and that he did not alter the course of his automobile although there was ample room to go to his left and avoid the accident. <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Ashler, </em>320 Mass. 475, 478. The jury likewise could have found that the defendant did not exercise the precaution of an ordinary prudent man. See <em>Barow </em>v. <em>Modoono, </em>325 Mass. 522, 524. The defendant argues that, because the plaintiff\u2019s automobile was on its wrong side of the road when the collision occurred, that in itself is fatal to the plaintiff\u2019s case. This, however, is not true for we have said, \u201cThe mere fact that a vehicle, whose presence on the highways generally is not unlawful, is temporarily in a position on the street violative of a statute or ordinance does not require the conclusion that its presence is, as matter of law, a cause, or the sole cause, of a collision in which another vehicle is involved.\u201d <em>Nash </em>v. <em>Heald, </em>306 Mass. 518, 520. See also <em>Wall </em>v. <em>King, </em>280 Mass. 577, 581; <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Curran, </em>302 Mass. 1, 3-4; <em>Reardon </em>v. <em>Marston, </em>310 Mass. 461, 462; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Ashler, </em>320 Mass. 475, 478; <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Conti, </em>321 Mass. 743, 744-745. Compare <em>Newcomb </em>v. <em>Boston Protective Department, </em>146 Mass. 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The facts in <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>278 Mass. 132, relied upon by the defendant, are not similar to the facts in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Another point to be considered involves the admission of fault by the defendant. An admission while not conclusive has definite probative value. <em>Cassidy </em>v. <em>Hollingsworth, </em>324 Mass. 424, 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
