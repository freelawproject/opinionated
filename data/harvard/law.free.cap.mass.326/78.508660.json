The defendant operates a night club in the city \u25a0 of Lowell. The premises comprise a \"Melody Lounge\u201d I where dancing takes place, and a grill room in which there I are a bar and tables. About 9:30 in the evening of Janu- I arv 23, 1946, the plaintiff and four companions went to the I defendant\u2019s premises. While there, except for some time I .spent in the Melody Lounge, they sat at the bar. Around I 11:30 a disturbance arose in the Melody Lounge and the H hostess (Miss Boyle) whp was in charge of the Lounge tele- I phoned to the police for assistance, as she had been instructed H to do when she was unable to preserve order. Three police I officers of the city of Lowell, Sullivan, Corkery and Lock- H wood, responded to this call, arriving at the defendant\u2019s \u25a0 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>premises shortly before 12:40 a.m. Two \" of the officers, Sullivan and Corkery, were in uniform, but Lockwood, who had finished his tour of duty and was on his way home, had taken off his tunic and had put on his civilian jacket and top coat. Neither the plaintiff nor any member of his group had participated in the disturbance which resulted in the police being called in. Those who were involved in the disturbance left the premises at the request of the officers. The officers then entered the grill room and entered the kitchen.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Around 12:45 the plaintiff and his companions \"ordered another round of beers\u201d but were told by the bartender that it was \"closing time and they could have no more to drink.\u201d One of the group, whose home was in New Jersey, said, \u201cIn New Jersey our bars close at three in the morning.\u201d The bartender replied, \"Well this is Massachusetts and under our law bars close at one o\u2019clock.\u201d The plaintiff and his companions then finished their drinks and around 12:50 went to a coat rack near the door to get their hats and coats. The plaintiff testified that while they were putting on their coats he saw the bartender speak a few words to the police officers (who had meanwhile returned from the kitchen) and point in the direction of the plaintiff and his companions. One of the police officers testified that the bartender said to him, \u201cThis group . . . [meaning the plaintiff\u2019s group] are boisterous; try to get rid . . . [of them], they\u2019re shut off.\u201d The bartender testified that he said to the officers, \"It is closing time. These boys are getting rough. Will you see that they leave the premises?\u201d He also testified that the plaintiff was not drunk but \u201cthe boys were feeling their liquor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The officers then went over to where the plaintiff and his companions were and one of the officers told them to leave. While the plaintiff was picking up some rubbers for one of the group, Officer Lockwood \"punched him in the jaw.\u201d The force of the blow sent him through the door into the vestibule, \u201cknocking him out momentarily.\u201d Lockwood came into the vestibule, \u201cpicked him up and punched bim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>again,\u201d forcing him out of the vestibule into a parking space I outside. \u201cLockwood followed him out and struck him and I knocked him down a third time.\u201d After that \u201cLockwood I struck him two or three times more.\u201d Immediately there- I after the plaintiff and two of his companions were arrested I and taken to the police station. I</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">It was the duty of the bartender to \u201cpreserve order in I his bar and see that things were properly conducted.\u2019.\u2019 In I the event of disturbance or disorderly conduct he was not to I eject anyone physically but was to call the police and to I inform them of the disturbance. \u201cIt was a police matter I then.\u201d If anyone was to be ejected the police were to do it. I</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">At the conclusion of the evidence, which in its aspect I most favorable to the plaintiff has been summarized above, I the judge granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed I verdict. The plaintiff\u2019s exception to this action brings the I case here. I</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">Plainly it could have been found that the plaintiff while I on the defendant\u2019s premises was assaulted and beaten by I Officer Lockwood without justification. The decisive ques- I tian is whether the evidence would have warranted a find- I ing that the defendant was answerable for Lockwood\u2019s I conduct. We are of opinion that it would not. The evi- I dence shows no more than that the defendant\u2019s bartender \u25a0 requested the police officers to try to get rid of the plaintiff I and his companions because they were getting boisterous. I While it could be found that the bartender acted within his \u25a0 authority in calling upon the police officers for assistance, \u25a0 there is no evidence that he directed the officers to assault I the plaintiff or gave them any instructions or information I from which the likelihood of such an assault was reasonably \u25a0 to be anticipated. Nor is there any evidence that would I have supported a finding that they were acting in any other I capacity than as police officers. What they did after the I bartender spoke to them was done on their own initiative I and responsibility as police officers in view of what they I had seen and heard. It was not conduct for which the H defendant was answerable. The case falls within the au- H <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>thority of such decisions as <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>New England Railroad, </em>179 Mass. 242, 249, <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Collateral Loan Co. </em>179 Mass. 268, 274, <em>Zinkfein </em>v. <em>W. T. Grant Co. </em>236 Mass. 228, 232, and <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>261 Mass. 255, 258-259. See note 55 A. L. R. 1204 et seq. This is not a case where the acts complained of could have been found to be committed by persons employed as servants or agents of the defendant. Nor is it a case where the tortious conduct of the officers was actively instigated by the defendant or its agents or servants. Consequently such cases as <em>Hirst </em>v. <em>Fitchburg &amp; Leominster Street Railway, </em>196 Mass. 353, <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Jacot, </em>235 Mass. 521, <em>Hartigan </em>v. <em>Eastern Racing Association, Inc. </em>311 Mass. 368, <em>McDermott </em>v. <em>W. T. Grant Co. </em>313 Mass. 736, 738, and <em>Schultz </em>v. <em>Purcell\u2019s, Inc. </em>320 Mass. 579, cited by the plaintiff, are not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
