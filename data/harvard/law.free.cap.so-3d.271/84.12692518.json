Icon appeals the trial court's order summarily denying his motion for additional credit time served, filed pursuant to Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.801. Even if (as Icon asserts) the three-year prison sentence imposed in the instant case was ordered to run concurrently with a prison sentence previously and separately imposed in the circuit court for Palm Beach County,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   this would not entitle him to receive any additional credit for county jail time served in the instant case. Icon was awarded a total of 577 days of jail credit, and has failed to allege or establish an entitlement to any additional jail credit.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Brito v.
