Donald Willie Carey appeals from the circuit court's dismissal of his motion for post-conviction relief. Carey's claims for relief are without merit. Therefore, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62. In January 2006, Carey was convicted of aggravated assault and armed robbery in Madison County Circuit Court. The court sentenced him to concurrent terms of fifteen years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC). The court suspended nine years of each sentence conditioned on Carey's good conduct and satisfactory completion of a five-year term of post-release supervision (PRS). Following a term of imprisonment, Carey was released, but he failed to complete his term of PRS. On March 25, 2013, Carey pled guilty to the offense of kidnapping, which he committed while on PRS. The same day, the circuit court also revoked Carey's concurrent suspended sentences for aggravated assault and armed robbery and ordered Carey remanded to the custody of the MDOC until he had served the sentences in full.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b63. On January 23, 2018, Carey filed a motion for post-conviction relief alleging that his suspended sentences had been unlawfully revoked. Carey asserted that there was insufficient evidence to support his revocation for new criminal activity. The circuit court dismissed Carey's motion as time-barred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2099-39-5\">\n    Miss.

Carey filed a timely notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b64. We affirm. The circuit court properly dismissed Carey's motion because it clearly fails on the merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2099-39-11\">\n    Miss.

On appeal, Carey advances a new argument: that he was entitled to credit against his concurrent nine-year suspended sentences for the approximately two years and eight months that he served on PRS. That argument is procedurally barred because it is raised for the first time on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Gardner v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7563212\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/531/805/#p808\">\n    531 So.2d 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 808-09 (Miss. 1988). It is also without merit. As this Court has held, \"probation does not equal time served and cannot be credited toward a suspended sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    Simmons v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8912138\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/913/1011/#p1012\">\n    913 So.2d 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1012 (\u00b6 7) (Miss.

Therefore, upon revocation of Carey's PRS, the circuit court had authority to order Carey to serve his full suspended sentences for aggravated assault and armed robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b66. Carey's claims for relief are plainly without merit.

Carey's revocation order found that Carey had committed two new offenses, kidnapping and sexual battery. The record does not disclose the final disposition or underlying facts of the sexual battery charge. However, the issue is immaterial because Carey's conviction for kidnapping clearly provided a sufficient basis for the court to revoke his suspended sentences.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
