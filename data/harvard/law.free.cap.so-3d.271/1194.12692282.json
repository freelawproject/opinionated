Padron, Ph.D. Because the trial court failed to find (1) that Allen had exhausted all discovery tools prior to seeking President Padron's deposition and (2) that the information Allen sought from President Padron was necessary and unavailable from another source, we grant the petition and quash the order under review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 6, 2015, Allen sued the College, alleging,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   that she was terminated from her position as a faculty member in violation of Florida's Whistle-blower's Act. The petition before us stems from Allen's attempt to depose President Padron in order to question him about two letters Allen sent disclosing the College's purported violations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In December 2015 and January 2016, Allen served interrogatories on the College. Allen did not direct her interrogatories to President Padron, and she did not seek information concerning the letters or President Padron's alleged personal involvement in her termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 20, 2018, Allen filed an Amended Complaint with three additional counts and four new defendants: Drs. Eduardo Padron, Lenore Rodicio, Malou Harrison, and Joy Ruff \"in their respective official capacity as president of MDC, provost of MDC, president of the North Campus of MDC, and MDC's Coordinator of Equal Opportunity Programs.\" The College moved to dismiss the new counts and also moved to strike Padron, Rodicio, Harrison, and Ruff as defendants, arguing that there was no stated cause of action for suit against any of them. On June 26, 2018, the\n   trial court granted the College's motion to dismiss two of the new counts (Counts II and III) without prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 9, 2018, Allen filed an \"Amended Counts II and III of Existing Complaint,\" attempting to restate two of the three recently dismissed claims. Allen listed Padron, Rodicio, Harrison, and Ruff as defendants in their \"official capacity.\" The College again moved to dismiss. According to the College, its motion to dismiss remains pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 28, 2018, Allen filed a Notice of taking Deposition, seeking a videotaped deposition of President Padron. The College filed a Motion for Protective Order, arguing that Allen could not show that President Padron had \"particularized, first-hand knowledge that cannot be obtained from any other source[.]\" On October 11, 2018, the trial court entered an order denying the College's motion, finding that \"Dr. Pardon [sic] has particularized first-hand knowledge of material facts.\" The court further determined that Allen was \"entitled to depose Dr. Padron as to his receipt of her letters and any knowledge he has about the circumstances surrounding her termination.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the denial of its Motion for Reconsideration, the College petitioned this Court for certiorari review of the trial court's order denying its Motion for Protective Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A party seeking certiorari review of a non-final order must first demonstrate that the order under review would result in a material injury that cannot be corrected on appeal (often referred to as \"irreparable harm\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miami-Dade Cty. v.

Although the order under review found that President Padron has particularized knowledge of material facts, it is silent as to whether Allen exhausted all discovery tools or whether President Padron's testimony was necessary and unavailable from another source. Based on our review of the record, we determine that Allen did not comply with the exhaustion requirement. Moreover, Allen concedes that at least some of the information she seeks regarding President Padron's involvement was available from other witnesses. Therefore, the trial court departed from the essential requirements of the law when it denied the College's Motion for Protective Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In her Response to the College's Petition, Allen states that she has \"concluded all other discovery,\" including serving two sets of interrogatories and taking depositions \"of the other named defendants in the case.\" While it is true that Allen served two sets of interrogatories on the College, not a single interrogatory was directed to President Padron, nor did the interrogatories seek information concerning the letters that Allen sent to President Padron or President Padron's alleged personal involvement in Allen's termination. Further, Allen did not serve requests for production or any other discovery directed to President Padron concerning the letters or his knowledge of the circumstances surrounding her termination. With respect to the depositions of the other named defendants, Allen seems to concede, in her response to the College's Motion for Protective Order, that she was able to obtain some of the information she seeks from President Padron from other witnesses: \"Allen has already presented ample evidence to prove that MDC and Defendant Padron violated Florida's Whistle-blower's Act ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In short, Allen has not shown, and the trial court did not find, that she had exhausted all other discovery tools in an attempt to obtain the information she seeks from President Padron or that the information was necessary and unavailable from another source.
