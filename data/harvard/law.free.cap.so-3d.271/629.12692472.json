In December 2004, North Dallas Bank &amp; Trust Company (North Dallas) obtained a default judgment in Texas against John Mabry. In December 2014, North Dallas enrolled the judgment in Mississippi. In February 2016, Mabry filed a motion to set aside the enrollment of the judgment pursuant to Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4). The Alcorn County Circuit Court granted Mabry's motion, holding that the judgment was unenforceable because it was enrolled more than seven years after the Texas judgment was entered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2015-1-45\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 15-1-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Rev. 2012). Accordingly, the court ordered the circuit clerk to mark the judgment as cancelled on the county judgment roll.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. On appeal, North Dallas argues that the circuit court erred because Mabry waived his statute of limitations defense and did not file his Rule 60(b)(4) motion \"within a reasonable time.\" However, we conclude that the circuit court correctly applied the precedent of this Court holding that attempts to enroll or enforce a foreign judgment after the expiration of the statutory limitations period are void ab initio. Therefore, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. On December 14, 2004, North Dallas obtained a default judgment against Mabry in state court in Texas for a total of $470,521.43 plus post-judgment interest. Almost ten years later, on December 11, 2014, North Dallas filed a notice of enrollment of the judgment in the Alcorn County Circuit Court. North Dallas's certificate of service shows that it mailed a copy of the notice to both an address in Savannah, Tennessee, and a restaurant in Corinth, the Chop House Shiloh Ridge (Chop House). North Dallas alleged, on information and belief, that the Savannah address was Mabry's last known address and that Mabry could also be found at the Chop House, where he was once employed. The docket appears to show that the circuit clerk sent notice of the enrollment to both addresses by certified mail, but the notice\n   sent to the Savannah address was returned to the clerk marked not deliverable/unable to forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. In January 2015, North Dallas sought to enforce the enrolled judgment through a writ of garnishment directed to the Chop House. A sheriff's return shows that the writ and a summons were served on the Chop House, but the Chop House failed to respond. North Dallas subsequently filed a motion for a conditional judgment against the Chop House as garnishee. In July 2015, the circuit court granted North Dallas's motion and ordered the Chop House to appear at a show-cause hearing. However, hearing notices mailed to the Chop House were returned as undeliverable. The Chop House apparently ceased operations at some point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. In January 2016, counsel for Mabry filed an entry of appearance. In February 2016, Mabry filed a motion to set aside the judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4) of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure. Mabry argued that the enrollment of the judgment was \"void\" because it was filed in Mississippi more than seven years after the judgment was entered in Texas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2015-1-45\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 15-1-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In response, North Dallas denied that the judgment was void. North Dallas argued that Mabry had waived his statute of limitations defense and that his Rule 60(b)(4) motion was untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. Following a hearing, the circuit court granted Mabry's Rule 60(b)(4) motion. The court found that the judgment was unenforceable because it was enrolled more than seven years after it was entered in Texas. North Dallas appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7. North Dallas argues that the circuit court erred by granting Mabry's Rule 60(b)(4) motion. North Dallas contends that the judgment was not void, that Mabry waived his statute of limitations defense, and that Mabry's Rule 60(b)(4) motion was untimely. Our standard of review is de novo because the circuit court's ruling and the issues raised by North Dallas on appeal concern \"the application of law to a set of undisputed facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Enters.

However, this Court rejected that argument as well.

This Court subsequently reached the same conclusions in\n   <em>\n    Valsamakis\n   </em>\n   . In that case, National Enterprises (National) obtained a judgment in 1994 in Tennessee against Valsamakis.\n   <em>\n    Valsamakis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9217591\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/879/523/#p523\">\n    879 So.2d at 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 1). Valsamakis was a Mississippi resident, so section 15-1-45's three-year statute of limitations applied to any action to enforce the judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9217591\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/879/523/#p523\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 3). National enrolled the judgment in Mississippi in 1995 but did not obtain a writ of garnishment against Valsamakis's employer until 1999.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9217591\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/879/523/#p523\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6\u00b6 1-2). In 2003, Valsamakis filed a motion to vacate the garnishment, which the circuit court granted.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9217591\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/879/523/#p523\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 3). The circuit court held \"that National had requested a writ of garnishment more than three years after its judgment\n   was rendered, the writ of garnishment was void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   , and all withheld funds should be returned to Valsamakis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9217591\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/879/523/#p523\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12. On appeal, this Court affirmed. We held that the garnishment action \"was void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   \" because the underlying judgment \"lapse[d]\" and \"was extinguished by the expiration of the limitations statute.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9217591\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/879/523/#p523\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9217591\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/879/523/#p523\">\n    at 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 7).

The holdings of\n   <em>\n    Magallanes\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Valsamakis\n   </em>\n   are on-point and controlling in this case. Those cases establish that efforts to enroll or enforce a foreign judgment outside the limitations periods set by section 15-1-45 are void-indeed, according to\n   <em>\n    Valsamakis\n   </em>\n   , \"void ab initio.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those two cases further hold that if a judgment is void for that reason, then the passage of time does not bar a motion to set it aside as void.\n   <em>\n    Valsamakis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9217591\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/879/523/#p523\">\n    879 So.2d at 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 8) ;\n   <em>\n    Magallanes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9452466\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/802/174/\">\n    802 So.2d at 176-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 14. This is consistent with Mississippi law in general regarding a motion to set aside a judgment as \"void.\" Rule 60(b)(4) provides that a court may set aside a final judgment if \"the judgment is void.\" M.R.C.P. 60(b)(4).

In this case, North Dallas enrolled the foreign judgment nearly ten years after it was entered in Texas-almost three years outside the limitations period set by section 15-1-45. As in\n   <em>\n    Magallanes\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Valsamakis\n   </em>\n   , the judgment was unenforceable, and its enrollment in Mississippi was void because it was not timely filed under section 15-1-45. Mabry filed his Rule 60(b)(4) motion fourteen months after the judgment against him was enrolled. In the circuit court, Mabry did not dispute that he received notice of the enrollment. However, Mabry correctly argued that the enrollment of the judgment in Mississippi was \"void.\" As in\n   <em>\n    Magallanes\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Valsamakis\n   </em>\n   , Mabry was not barred from seeking relief from the void judgment. \"[T]here can be no time limitation for relief from a void judgment as 'no amount of time or delay may cure a void judgment.' \"\n   <em>\n    O'Neal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7059914\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/17/572/#p575\">\n    17 So.3d at 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 14) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kirk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8314489\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/973/981/#p988\">\n    973 So.2d at 988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 19) ;\n   <em>\n    Overbey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11293650\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/569/303/#p306\">\n    569 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   306 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 16.
