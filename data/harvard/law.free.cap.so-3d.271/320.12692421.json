The evidence seized pursuant to the plain view exception to the warrant requirement, and on the basis of a search warrant issued thereafter, was lawfully obtained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The search of defendant's apartment occurred on June 28, 2017, and resulted in defendant being charged by bill of information with possession with intent to distribute heroin (count one), possession of a firearm by a convicted felon (count two), possession with intent to distribute marijuana (count three), possession of Buprenorphine (Suboxone ) (count four), possession of Tramadol (count five), and obstruction of justice (count six), in violation\n   of La. R.S. 40:966(A), 14:95.1, 40:966(A), 40:968(C), 40:969(C) and 14:130.1, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The hearing on the motion to suppress was held in July 2018. After the motion was denied, defendant withdrew his not guilty pleas and entered a\n   <em>\n    Crosby\n   </em>\n   plea of guilty as charged on all counts, reserving his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court sentenced defendant to imprisonment at hard labor for fifteen years each on counts one, two and three and imprisonment at hard labor for five years each on counts four, five and six, with the sentences on all counts to run concurrently with each other and with any other sentence he is currently serving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant was on parole at the time of these offenses, having been convicted of possession with intent to distribute marijuana, possession with intent to distribute cocaine and attempted possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in 2004. His parole supervision was transferred from East Baton Rouge Parish to Jefferson Parish in February 2017, a few months before the events in question. His assigned parole officer in Jefferson Parish, Agent Steven Becnel, had been to his apartment two or three times, during routine visits to monitor his compliance with the conditions of his parole, but Agent Becnel did not participate in the June 28 visit because he was scheduled for office duty that day. He testified that it was normal for other agents to assist an agent who is on office duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Parolees are required by law to refrain from engaging in criminal conduct. La. R.S. 15:574.4.2(A)(1). As a condition of parole, they agree to submit to unannounced visits from their parole officer at their residence or place of employment and to searches of their person, property, residence or vehicle when reasonable suspicion exists that they have engaged in criminal activity while on parole.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \u00a7 574.4.2(A)(2)(i);\n   <em>\n    State v.

This occurred within a short time after one of the Probation and Parole officers, Agent Douglas Black, was contacted\n   by a sergeant with the New Orleans Police Department's Fourth District Task Force and advised that the Task Force had been conducting surveillance of a residence in Algiers and had observed defendant engaging in what appeared to be illegal narcotics activity there, including selling narcotics in hand-to-hand transactions. Algiers is part of Agent Black's area of supervision, and he testified that he is the person who is generally contacted when the police learn that someone who may be engaged in criminal conduct in Algiers is on probation or parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Agent Black and other Probation and Parole agents attempted to contact defendant at the residence in Algiers, but he did not appear there. His address of record with the Probation and Parole office was in Harvey, in an area supervised by Probation and Parole Agent Jacob Rieux.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Agent Black testified that on June 28, 2017, he, Agent Rieux, and Agent Stephen Favorite went to defendant's apartment in Harvey to determine whether he was in compliance with the conditions of his parole. Agent Rieux arranged to have Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Detective John Wiebelt and other narcotics officers accompany them on the compliance check. Detective Wiebelt testified that the defendant was not under investigation by the Sheriff's Office and said he had no prior knowledge of the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The three parole agents approached the apartment first, while Detective Wiebelt and his officers remained nearby. Agent Rieux knocked on the door and defendant answered. Agent Rieux identified himself and asked the defendant to step outside so they could speak with him. Defendant complied. One of the agents told defendant that they were there for a compliance check. Defendant and the agents then entered the apartment and the agents detained the defendant, for their safety and his. Detective Wiebelt also entered the apartment. Agent Black initially testified that the New Orleans Police Department had issued a warrant for defendant's arrest, but the parties later stipulated that there was no warrant for his arrest in June 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   While clearing an area for defendant to sit on a sofa in the front room, Agent Black observed a small plastic bag sticking out from between the sofa cushions. The agents retrieved the bag, which contained eighteen smaller bags of what appeared to be heroin. The contents were field tested and tested positive for heroin. Detective Wiebelt then obtained a search warrant to search the residence. Other illegal drugs and a gun were confiscated in the search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the search warrant affidavit and in his report of defendant's arrest, Detective Wiebelt stated that he had accompanied agents with the Department of Probation and Parole as they conducted a compliance check at Spriggs' residence. He did not say anything about the criminal investigation being conducted by the New Orleans Police Department (NOPD). Detective Wiebelt testified that he intentionally omitted any reference to that because it was a different jurisdiction's investigation, it may have still been ongoing, and it was irrelevant to the search warrant request and the arrest report. He testified that no one from the NOPD was present during the search of defendant's apartment and that he did not speak with the NOPD about their investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As noted above, defendant's assigned parole officer, Agent Becnel, did not go with the other parole officers to defendant's apartment on June 28 because he was assigned to office duty that day. Agent Becnel testified that Agent Black had told him the Fourth District Task Force was looking into Mr. Spriggs in connection with\n   some illegal activity that was going on in Algiers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    TRIAL COURT RULING\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In ruling on the motion to suppress, the trial court stated, \"I find no subterfuge here. This is a compliance check on a parolee, and a search warrant was ultimately obtained. The motion to suppress is denied.\" The court implicitly rejected defendant's contention that the initial entry into his residence by parole officers was unlawful because it was conducted by parole officers other than his assigned officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress because the State failed to carry its burden of proof sufficient to justify the warrantless entry and search of his residence. He maintains that the unlawfulness of the initial entry tainted the seizure of the heroin without a warrant and the seizure of the other evidence with a warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant's argument is twofold. First, he asserts that La. C.Cr.P. art. 895(A)(13)(a) requires that the initial entry into and warrantless search of a parolee's residence be conducted by the parole officer assigned to the parolee. Additionally, he contends the officers here had no reason to believe he was in violation of the conditions of his parole when they decided to conduct a \"compliance check,\" making their visit to his apartment a subterfuge to help another police agency that desired to conduct a search but lacked probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assigned Parole Officer\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The law cited by defendant in support of his assertion that only a parolee's assigned parole officer may enter and search the parolee's residence without a warrant- La. C.Cr.P. art. 895(A)(13)(a) -applies only to probationers, not to parolees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    State v.

La. R.S. 15:574.4.2(1). The same is true for probationers. La. C.Cr.P. art. 895(A). A probation or parole officer who receives information that a person under supervision may be engaging in criminal activity, and thus violating a condition of probation or parole, has a duty to investigate and determine whether or not the person is in compliance with the conditions of his release from custody.\n   <em>\n    State v.

This information, which Agent Black shared with other parole officers, provided them with a reasonable suspicion that defendant was engaging in criminal activity while on parole for past drug crimes. The parole officers had a duty to investigate and determine whether that information was accurate and were entitled to do so through a random unannounced visit to defendant's apartment. In such circumstances, the fact that they were accompanied by sheriff's officers does not negate that the purpose of their visit was to determine whether the defendant was in compliance with the conditions of his parole.\n   <em>\n    See and compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Wesley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7436680\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/685/1169/\">\n    685 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1175 ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

The sheriff's office was not investigating the defendant, and no one from the investigating agency in New Orleans participated in the visit or the search that followed. This case is factually distinguishable from cases in which a purported compliance check was found to be a subterfuge for a criminal investigation, such as\n   <em>\n    State v. Saulsby\n   </em>\n   , 04-880 (La.

At the time of these offenses, parole officers other than the officer assigned to a defendant could lawfully conduct compliance checks. The record clearly supports the trial court's finding that the visit to defendant's apartment was a legitimate compliance check and was not a subterfuge for a criminal investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The officers were lawfully inside the apartment when they observed a bag of what appeared to be heroin that was sticking out from between the sofa cushions. The heroin was seized under the plain view exception to the warrant requirement, which allows seizure of evidence in plain view when there is prior justification for an intrusion into the protected area and it is immediately apparent, without close inspection,\n   that the items seized are evidence or contraband.\n   <em>\n    State v.
