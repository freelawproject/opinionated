Keith Porter pleaded guilty to armed robbery and unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. For his armed-robbery conviction, the court sentenced him to twenty-five years, with twenty years suspended and five years to serve, in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC). As for the unlawful-possession-of-a-firearm conviction, the court sentenced him, as a habitual offender, to serve ten years in the custody of the MDOC. The circuit court also sentenced Porter to five years of post-release supervision and ordered his sentences to run consecutively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. Since his conviction, Porter has filed four motions for post-conviction relief (PCR). In his fourth PCR motion-the subject of this appeal-he attacks his guilty plea to possession of a firearm as a convicted felon. Finding the petition successive-writ barred, the circuit court dismissed the petition without an evidentiary hearing. Porter now appeals. Finding no error in the circuit court's dismissal, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3.

And \"this [C]ourt will affirm the summary dismissal of a PCR motion if the movant fails to demonstrate a claim is procedurally alive substantially showing the denial of a state or federal right.\"\n   <em>\n    Pinkney v.

To determine whether the circuit court erred in summarily dismissing Porter's petition, this Court must look to the merits of the petition. Under the Uniform Post-Conviction Collateral Relief Act (UPCCRA), the dismissal of a PCR motion\n   is a final judgment and acts as a bar to a second, or successive, motion raising the same issue or issues.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2099-39-23\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 99-39-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6) (Rev. 2015). \"Essentially, [a movant] is granted one bite at the apple when requesting post-conviction relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Dobbs v.

Ct. App. 2009). Because Porter previously filed two PCR motions attacking his guilty plea to possession of a firearm as a convicted felon, his current claim is successive-writ barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6. We acknowledge that \"errors affecting fundamental constitutional rights are excepted from the procedural bars of the UPCCRA.\"\n   <em>\n    Rowland v.

State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12142965\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/203/730/#p731\">\n    203 So.3d 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 731 (\u00b6 7) (Miss.

Additionally, \"there must at least appear to be some basis for the truth of the claim of a fundamental-constitutional-rights violation.\"\n   <em>\n    Evans v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7003029\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/115/879/#p881\">\n    115 So.3d 879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 881 (\u00b6 3) (Miss.
