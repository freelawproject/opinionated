On appeal, Williams contends that the trial court abused its discretion in rejecting allegations that her attorneys colluded with one another to defraud her out of settlement proceeds. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The trial court was charged with apportioning settlement proceeds following the resolution of litigation. The court declined to summarily adjudicate the competing interests, and, instead, convened a duly scheduled, multi-hour evidentiary hearing prior to rendering its final ruling. The record on appeal contains no transcript of the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"It is well established that the party seeking appellate review has the burden of providing the court with an adequate record of the proceedings in the lower tribunal.\"\n   <em>\n    Kass Shuler, P.A. v.

This is because \"[w]ithout a record of the trial proceedings, the appellate court can [not] properly resolve the underlying factual issues so as to conclude that the trial court's judgment is not supported by the evidence or by an alternative theory.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Applegate v.
