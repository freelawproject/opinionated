That is, according to Heath's motion, the federal authorities have not permitted Heath to serve his state and federal sentences concurrently. Heath's motion therefore sought an order from the circuit court resentencing Heath \"to time served nunc pro tunc to his original sentencing date\" in lower tribunal case number F16-22715 in order to effectuate the terms of Heath's alleged plea deal. Indeed, there is precedent in Florida that would authorize a trial court to resentence a defendant under such circumstances by granting postconviction relief sought pursuant to a rule 3.850 motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Glenn v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11077727\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/776/330/#p331\">\n    776 So. 2d 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 331 (Fla. 4th DCA 2001) (\"Where a condition of a guilty plea is that the defendant will serve the agreed-upon state sentence in federal prison concurrently with a longer federal sentence, the defendant is entitled to postconviction relief if the terms of the agreement are not met.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

R. App. P. 9.141(b)(2)(D) ;\n   <em>\n    Ahedo v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9209694\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/877/926/#p927\">\n    877 So. 2d 926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 927 (Fla. 5th DCA 2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For us to affirm the trial court's summary denial of Heath's motion, the record must conclusively demonstrate that Heath is not entitled to relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fla. R. App. P. 9.141(b)(2)(D). Because the record before us fails to make the required showing, we reverse and remand for further proceedings. If, on remand, the trial court again enters an order summarily denying Heath's postconviction motion, the lower court shall attach record excerpts conclusively showing that Heath is not entitled to any relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Reversed and remanded with instructions.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    The State charged Heath with resisting an officer without violence and possession of a controlled substance in lower tribunal case number F16-22715.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    Specifically, Heath's motion asserts that, because Heath was sentenced to 319 days in jail with credit for time served, the parties and the lower court agreed that Heath would receive \"319 days credit towards his Federal sentence.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    Neither a transcript of Heath's plea colloquy, nor a written plea agreement, have been provided to this Court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
