Ira Joseph Clayton appeals his conviction of the unlawful possession of a motor vehicle and argues there is insufficient evidence to support the conviction and the verdict is against the overwhelming weight of the evidence. We find no error and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62. In March 2017, Clayton moved in with his girlfriend, Rikiesha Williams, at her apartment in Southaven. Williams owned a 2012 Volkswagen Jetta. Since Clayton did not have a vehicle, he would use Williams's car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63. On the morning of May 26, 2017, Clayton and Williams went to Memphis for an appointment and subsequently returned to Southaven. Clayton drove them to and from the appointment in Williams's car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64. When they returned home, Clayton and Williams got into a series of arguments. During the second argument, Williams told Clayton she no longer wanted to be in the relationship and asked him to pack his belongings and leave. Clayton began to pack but subsequently left the apartment and walked to Williams's aunt's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65. Approximately two to three hours later, Clayton called Williams and asked her to come pick him up so he could get the rest of his belongings. Williams agreed. When they returned to Williams's apartment, Clayton and Williams got into another argument. During the physical altercation, a gun discharged and Williams was shot twice, once in her right leg, and once in her left leg. Williams's phone was also broken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66. Following the shooting, Clayton grabbed Williams's car keys and left the apartment complex in Williams's car. According to Williams's neighbor, Queen Rice, Clayton ran out of the apartment to the car, jumped in, and sped off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67. Clayton was indicted as a habitual offender pursuant to Mississippi Code Annotated section 99-19-81 (Rev. 2015) on Count 1, possession of a weapon as a convicted felon; Count 2, aggravated assault; and Count 3, unlawful possession of a motor vehicle. Clayton was convicted of Count 3 only. The jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict as to Count 1, and found Clayton not guilty on Count 2. Clayton was sentenced as a habitual offender to serve ten years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections, to run consecutively to any current sentence. He was further ordered to pay a $1,000 fine and $503.83 in restitution to the Southaven Police Department. Clayton subsequently filed a motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) or, alternatively, a new trial, which the circuit court denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68. Clayton timely appealed. Clayton's appellate counsel filed a brief and raised the following assignments of error: (1) the evidence is insufficient to support the conviction of unlawful possession of a motor vehicle, and (2) the verdict is contrary to the weight of the evidence. Clayton filed a pro se supplemental brief and asserted eight additional assignments of error. We separately address each issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    I. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69. Clayton first argues the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction of the unlawful possession of a motor vehicle. In considering whether the evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction, \"the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045491\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/35/480/#p485\">\n    35 So.3d 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 485 (\u00b6 16) (Miss. 2010) (citation omitted). Where the facts and inferences \"point in favor of the defendant on any element of the offense with sufficient force that reasonable [jurors] could not have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty, the proper remedy is for the appellate court to reverse and render.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045491\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/35/480/#p485\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted). However, if \"reasonable fair-minded [jurors] in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions on every element of the offense, the evidence will be deemed to have been sufficient.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7045491\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/35/480/#p485\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610. Pursuant to Mississippi Code Annotated section 97-17-42(1), it is unlawful for \"[a]ny person [to] willfully and without authority, take possession of or take away a motor vehicle of any value belonging to another ....\" Clayton argues there is insufficient evidence to show that he took possession of Williams's vehicle \"without authority.\" He claims that because he shared the vehicle with Williams and Williams had not revoked his permission to use the vehicle, he had the authority to take possession of the vehicle following the shooting. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611. The record shows Williams and Clayton had been fighting throughout the day. Williams told Clayton she no longer wanted to be in the relationship and asked Clayton to get his stuff and leave. Clayton began to pack up his belongings and eventually left the apartment. Importantly, when Clayton left Williams's apartment, he did not take the car. Instead, Clayton walked. Clayton subsequently called and asked Williams to come pick him up so he could get the rest of his belongings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612. Following the shooting, Clayton did not leave on foot, as he had done earlier that day. Instead, he grabbed Williams's car keys and took her car. Thus, although Clayton had previously left the apartment on foot, it was only after Williams had been shot twice and her phone broken during the altercation that Clayton grabbed the keys and took the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613. Although Williams explained that she and Clayton shared her car, Williams specifically testified that she did not give Clayton permission to take her car on that day. Williams subsequently advised the police that they could call the financial company to try to locate Clayton in the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b614. Considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we find sufficient evidence was presented to support Clayton's conviction of the unlawful possession of a motor vehicle. Thus, Clayton's motion for a JNOV was properly denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    II. Weight of the Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b615. Clayton next argues the verdict is against the overwhelming weight of the evidence. \"In reviewing the denial of a motion for a new trial based on an objection to the weight of the evidence, this Court will only disturb a verdict when it is so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence that to allow it to stand would sanction an unconscionable injustice.\"\n   <em>\n    Kirk v.

The evidence is weighed\n   in the light most favorable to the verdict.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879222\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/160/685/#p697\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"A new trial should be granted on the basis of the weight of the evidence 'only in exceptional circumstances, when the evidence weighs heavily against the jury's verdict.' \"\n   <em>\n    Hughes v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8215842\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/983/270/#p277\">\n    983 So.2d 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 277 (\u00b6 22) (Miss. 2008) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

Clayton asserts the verdict is contrary to the weight of the evidence \"because the [S]tate failed to show a lack of authority to use Williams's vehicle.\" However, the record shows the jury heard all of the testimony and resolved any conflicts in the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7035722\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/64/1029/#p1033\">\n    64 So.3d 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1033 (\u00b6 13) (Miss.Ct. App. 2011) (\"Conflicts in the evidence are for the jury to resolve.\"). \"Any factual disputes [we]re properly resolved by the jury and do not mandate a new trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Sneed v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7040638\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/31/33/#p43\">\n    31 So.3d 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 43 (\u00b6 33) (Miss.Ct. App. 2009) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Moore v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9051626\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/859/379/#p385\">\n    859 So.2d 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 385 (\u00b6 26) (Miss. 2003) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b617. Having considered the evidence presented, we do not find the verdict to be so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence that to allow the verdict to stand would sanction an unconscionable injustice. Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in denying Clayton's motion for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    III. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b618. Clayton further argues he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, Clayton claims his trial counsel was ineffective for: (1) \"not showing the routine habit of ... Williams fighting and [accus]ing Clayton of messing with other women,\" (2) not objecting to Williams's failure to identify her live-in cousin, (3) \"not demanding a medical expert's testimony [regarding the] hospital treatment of [Williams] [or] any medical records of [Williams],\" (4) not objecting to the instructions regarding a directed verdict, and (5) \"not objecting to [the] Southaven police officer['s] [failure to] giv[e] [a] gunshot residue test.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b619. To prove ineffective assistance of counsel, Clayton must show: (1) his counsel's performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced his defense.\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 687,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). \"We look at the totality of the circumstances to determine whether counsel's [performance was] both deficient and prejudicial.\"\n   <em>\n    Dartez v.

State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6998209\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/121/269/#p273\">\n    121 So.3d 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 273 (\u00b6 11) (Miss.Ct. App. 2013). \"Only where it is reasonably probable that, but for the attorney's errors, the outcome would have been different, will we find that counsel's performance was deficient.\"\n   <em>\n    Dartez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6836017\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/177/420/#p423\">\n    177 So.3d at 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b620. \"[G]enerally, ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims are more appropriately brought during post-conviction proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell v.

This Court may address \"ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims on direct appeal only where (1) the record affirmatively shows ineffectiveness of constitutional dimensions, or (2) the parties stipulate that the record is adequate and the Court determines that findings of fact by a trial judge able to consider the demeanor of witnesses, etc., are not needed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189261\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/202/1239/#p1242\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b621. The record does not affirmatively show ineffectiveness of constitutional dimensions. Additionally, there is no stipulation by the parties that the record is adequate to address this claim. In fact, the\n   State asserts that \"[Clayton's] claims are not ripe for direct appeal.\" Thus, we are unable to adequately and properly address Clayton's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim on direct appeal. We therefore deny this issue without prejudice to afford Clayton the option to pursue his claim in a post-conviction proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12382597\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/228/949/#p952\">\n    228 So.3d 949\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 952-53 (\u00b6 14) (Miss.Ct.

Brady Violation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b622. Clayton next argues the circuit court violated\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Maryland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    373 U.S. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    10 L.Ed.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963) by refusing to admit into evidence a post from Williams's social-media page. In the social-media post, Williams stated that she had recently considered suicide and had \"picked up a gun and almost ended her life.\" Clayton claims the post \"shows that [Williams] had an altered mental state\" and was \"a danger to herself [and] the people around her ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b623. In\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   , the U.S. Supreme Court held that \"the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    at 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, there is no evidence of a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation by the State. The transcript shows the State did not suppress the social-media post or information regarding the post. In fact, the transcript makes clear that Clayton was aware of the social-media post and provided a copy of it to the prosecution prior to trial. As Clayton fails to show that the State suppressed material evidence, his claim regarding an alleged\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b625. Assuming Clayton intended to argue that the circuit court erroneously excluded the social-media post on other grounds, he fails to state those grounds or cite any case law in support thereof. \"[A]n appellant must present to us a record sufficient to show the occurrence of the error he asserts and also that the matter was properly presented to the [circuit] court and timely preserved.\"\n   <em>\n    Byrom v.

Because there was a likelihood that the jury would reach a verdict on the two remaining counts, the circuit court did not err in instructing the jury to continue its deliberations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b631. Additionally, as previously noted, the jury had reached a unanimous verdict as to Count 3; thus, the\n   <em>\n    Sharplin\n   </em>\n   instruction was given as to Counts 1 and 2. Clayton was convicted of Count 3 only. Therefore, even if the circuit court erred in giving a\n   <em>\n    Sharplin\n   </em>\n   instruction, no prejudice resulted, as the\n   <em>\n    Sharplin\n   </em>\n   instruction did not affect the charge on which Clayton was convicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    IX. Indictment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b632. Clayton was indicted as a habitual offender pursuant to section 99-19-81. Clayton argues the \"indictment was erroneous when the State only used one conviction, the 1995 aggravated assault conviction[,] and did not inform the defen[s]e of the second conviction being ... robbery until the sentencing phase of the trial ....\" Clayton asserts that as a result of this error, his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection were violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b633. The indictment clearly includes both of Clayton's prior convictions. Thus, Clayton had notice of the habitual-offender charge and the basis of the charge. Accordingly, this issue is meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    X. Police Report\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b634. During deliberations, the jury sent a note to the circuit court requesting a copy of the police report. With no objection by the State or Clayton, the circuit court responded and advised the jury that it \"ha[d] all the evidence [it] w[ould] receive in the case.\" Clayton last argues the circuit court erred when \"it refused to let the jury examine [the] police report after [the] jury sent a note ... asking for it.\" In support of his argument, Clayton relies on\n   <em>\n    U.S. v. Bagley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205331\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/667/\">\n    473 U.S. 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205331\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/667/\">\n    105 S.Ct. 3375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205331\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/667/\">\n    87 L.Ed.2d 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985). However, Clayton's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Bagley\n   </em>\n   is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b635. As previously discussed, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   , the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material to either guilt or punishment.\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    373 U.S. at 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Bagley\n   </em>\n   , the Court explained\n   that \"evidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"\n   <em>\n    Bagley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205331\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/667/\">\n    473 U.S. at 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205331\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/667/\">\n    105 S.Ct. 3375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b636. Here, Clayton does not allege, and there is no evidence to suggest, that the police report was suppressed or withheld by the prosecution. Thus, neither\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Bagley\n   </em>\n   apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b637. Moreover, the record reflects that the police report was not admitted into evidence at trial. Instead, an officer and an investigator with the Southaven Police Department testified regarding the incident between Clayton and Williams. Since the police report was not admitted into evidence, the circuit court's response to the jury was proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b638.\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   LEE, C.J., IRVING, P.J., BARNES, CARLTON, FAIR, WILSON, GREENLEE, WESTBROOKS AND TINDELL, JJ., CONCUR.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
