Kelly, Sr., Kandace Kelly McDaniel, Kelly Properties, LLP, and K&amp;L Resources, LLP (hereinafter collectively referred to as \"the Kellys\"). The Kellys filed a cross-appeal in the event the order granting the motion for a new trial was reversed, arguing that the motion for a new trial was due to be granted on an alternative ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2010, Renaissance Petroleum Company, LLC, drilled two oil wells in Escambia County. The wells were known as the Craft-Blackstone 17-5 well (\"the 17-5 well\") and the Craft-Huxford 18-2 well (\"the 18-2 well\"). The wells were part of Renaissance's larger project involving over 100 oil and gas leases and ultimately more than a dozen wells. The Kellys own property in Escambia County and entered into two leases with Renaissance. The leases included property near the two wells.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In December 2010, Ankor acquired an interest in Renaissance's project and leases in Escambia County, including the 17-5 well and the 18-2 well. In January 2011, Renaissance and Ankor petitioned the Oil and Gas Board (\"the Board\") to establish production units for the two wells. A production unit is the maximum area that can be efficiently and economically drained by a particular well. In February 2011, the Board held a hearing to determine what property to include in the production units. The Kellys were represented by counsel at the hearing and argued that their property should be included in the production units. On February 18, 2011, the Board established the production units for the two wells but did not include the Kellys' property. Renaissance continued to operate the project until May 2011, when Ankor took over operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In December 2011, Ankor offered to request that the Board include the Kellys' property in the production units. Ankor took the position that it had not drained any oil from the Kellys' property, and Ankor offered to pay royalties to the Kellys but only after the date the Board included the Kellys' property in the production units. The Kellys did not accept the offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 3, 2012, the Kellys sued Ankor, among others, alleging breach of contract, negligence, wantonness, breach of an implied covenant to develop, breach of an implied covenant to protect from drainage, fraudulent drainage, and tortious breach of implied legal duties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the Kellys alleged that Ankor failed to include their property in the production units presented to the Board, knowing that their property should have been included. They further argued that they suffered a permanent loss of their oil and gas by Ankor's production and capture of oil and gas from adjacent property, thereby draining oil and gas from the Kellys' property. They asserted that the affirmative acts of Ankor, as the Kellys' lessee, caused drainage of their premises and a substantial depletion or destruction and/or impairment in value of the Kellys' oil and gas interest. With the permission of the court, the Kellys later filed a \"restated\" amended complaint under seal. The Kellys alleged that the restated complaint contained references to confidential Ankor documents and, pursuant to earlier trial court orders, had to be filed under seal. Ankor filed a motion to strike the restated complaint on several grounds, including arguing that the restated complaint added a new claim alleging waste.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In response, the Kellys argued that \"waste\" in the oil and gas industry refers to operational losses in oil and gas either from surface loss, destruction of the oil and gas, or underground loss. They argued that their original complaint included a claim alleging waste in that they alleged Ankor had a duty to \"do nothing to impair\" the value of their leases and to use reasonable care to protect the Kellys from drainage or loss by an affirmative act. The Kellys argued that as a proximate result of Ankor's breach of its legal duty not to impair the value of the Kellys' oil and gas interest and its legal duty to use reasonable care to protect the Kellys from drainage or depletion or destruction of their oil and gas interests, Ankor had committed waste. The trial court denied the motion to strike the restated complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At trial, the Kellys withdrew certain of their claims, and the trial court ultimately charged the jury on breach of implied covenants arising under the lease agreements, fraud, wantonness, and waste. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Ankor on all claims. The Kellys filed a motion for a new trial. In their motion, the Kellys alleged, among other things, that a juror had disregarded the trial court's instruction regarding independent research of the issues. The Kellys attached a handwritten affidavit from a juror in which the juror admitted that she had looked in the online Schlumberger Oil Field Dictionary to become familiar with the phrases she heard in testimony such as \"Smackover,\" \"How oil migrates,\" \"reservoirs,\" and \"rock formation.\" In her affidavit, the juror stated that she did not share the results of her online search with other jurors, but that she did use the information to help her understand the proceedings and to help make her decision. The juror signed the affidavit. Counsel for the Kellys notarized the juror's handwritten affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In response, Ankor filed a motion to strike the juror's handwritten affidavit, arguing that it was an impermissible attempt to impeach the jury's verdict. Ankor further argued that, even if the trial court considered the handwritten affidavit, there was no showing of prejudice to the Kellys. It argued that the handwritten affidavit was silent as to whether this juror would have been inclined to rule in favor of the Kellys had she not considered the meanings of the searched terms. Ankor also argued that, because the juror did not share the information with the other jurors, the search could not have affected the other jurors' decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Kellys filed a supplemental response, arguing that the terms searched by the juror online were crucial to the issues of waste and drainage. Both parties presented expert testimony on the question of oil migration, and the oil at issue was found in Smackover rock. The Kellys argued that the online search was presumptively prejudicial because those oil-industry terms are not within the knowledge of most jurors. They further argued that the exposure of one juror to extraneous information warrants a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ankor filed a supplement to its motion to strike. It argued that the juror's affidavit was not a properly sworn statement. It argued that, because to be guilty of perjury the affiant must be properly sworn, the juror could not be convicted of perjury and that, therefore, the document she signed was not a properly sworn statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Ankor attached a second affidavit from the juror in which she stated that counsel for the Kellys had called her numerous times and that she finally had agreed to meet counsel at a McDonald's fast-food restaurant. She further stated that, at the time she signed her statement, she was not swearing to the contents of that statement nor was she aware that it would be \"labeled\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   an affidavit. The juror stated: \"At the time I wrote and signed my statement, I was not placed under oath, and I was not swearing to its contents. I have never sworn to the contents of the statement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In response, the Kellys filed an affidavit from counsel regarding his meeting with the juror at McDonald's. Counsel alleged that he had drafted an affidavit for the juror to sign based on several telephone conversations. He stated, however, that, after meeting at McDonald's, the juror disclosed that she had looked up additional terms and disclosed how she had used that information. Counsel alleged that, instead of having the juror sign the prepared affidavit, he asked the juror to write an affidavit to include the new information. Counsel stated, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"During our meeting at McDonalds, Mrs. [M.] asked me if she would get in trouble for what she did. I told Mrs. [M.] that I did not think she would personally get in trouble, but I have a duty to represent my client and let the Court know what happened. Mrs. [M.] told me something to the effect that 'I do not have anything to hide because that is the truth. I looked those terms up.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"I do not understand how Mrs. [M.] did not know she was giving an affidavit because I let her know that was the entire reason I was immediately dropping what I was doing and driving straight to Brewton.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"I also do not understand how Mrs. [M.] did not know that her affidavit would be filed with the Court. I told Mrs. [M.] that once she gave me her affidavit, she would probably be contacted by Ankor's attorneys to ask her about the substance of her affidavit. Further, I called Mrs. [M.] before we filed her affidavit to give her a 'heads-up' that we were filing it and that she would probably be getting calls from Ankor's attorney very soon. Mrs. [M.] never told me to not file her affidavit. I also called Mrs. [M.] either the day of or the day after the June 21 hearing to let her know that we just had a hearing about her affidavit, and she should expect a phone call from the Ankor attorneys. Mrs. [M.] told me that Ernie White had already called her. Again, Mrs. [M.] did not express any surprise that I filed the affidavit with the Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \"....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Although it appears there must have been a misunderstanding between Mrs. [M.] and I about her affidavit, I note that Mrs. [M.] has never denied the substance of her affidavit. She repeatedly admitted to me (twice on the phone and once in writing) that she looked up technical terms to help her in her jury deliberations in clear violation of this Court's instructions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"Finally, with respect to any issue of the validity of my notarial seal, I specifically asked Mrs. [M.] if I could sign her affidavit when I got back to my office because in my haste to get to Brewton I left my seal in Fort Payne. Mrs. [M.] gave me permission to do so. I can further attest that Mrs. [M.], whose name is signed to the affidavit, was known to me after two weeks of trial, and was the same individual I saw everyday in the courtroom, and as an officer of the Court I again verify the validity of her signature, her identity and the contents of her affidavit.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Subsequently, Ankor filed a third affidavit from the juror. In that affidavit, which was signed by the juror, she stated that she attempted to look up certain terms on her cellular telephone but that she obtained very little information from the search. The juror stated that no other jurors were present when she conducted her search. She further stated that none of\n   the information she viewed motivated her to decide her verdict in any particular way. Following a hearing, the trial court denied the motion to strike the juror's original handwritten affidavit and granted the motion for new trial, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"[The Kellys] sued the Ankor Defendants for drainage and waste of substantial amounts of oil allegedly located under the [Kellys'] property and resulting from the Defendants' operation of the Craft- Blackstone 17-5 No. 1 Well. In brief, the [Kellys] owned acreage immediately adjacent to the 17-5 well. The [Kellys] claimed that the Ankor Defendants' operation of the 17-5 well drained the [Kellys'] lands of oil. This claim was based on the [Kellys'] leases with the Ankor Defendants. At all times relevant to the proceedings, the [Kellys] were under lease with the Ankor Defendants.\n   <sup>\n    1\n   </sup>\n   The [Kellys] also claimed that the Ankor Defendants' operation of the 17-5 well resulted in the waste of the [Kellys'] ability to produce their rightful share of oil from their own lands, the [Kellys'] waste claim was brought under Alabama's oil and gas statutes, specifically, Ala. Code (1975) \u00a7\u00a7 9-17-1(a), 9-17-2, 9-17-11, and 9-17-19(a). The case was tried for two full weeks, and the jury heard highly technical testimony from Ankor engineers and geologists, expert testimony from both parties, the [Kellys], and the representative of a party that settled with [Kellys] on a pro tanto basis prior to trial. At the close of the evidence, the [Kellys'] case was submitted to the jury on breach of contract, wantonness, [fraud], and waste claims. After deliberation, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Ankor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"Under Ala. R. Civ.

I looked up phrases such as Smackover, how oil migrates, resivoirs [sic], rock formation. I did this on my phone to help me get familiar with different meanings. I did not share the information I found with any other jurors. But I did use the information to help me understand the proceedings better to help me make my decision.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \"There is no question that the terms looked up by Ms. [M.] -- Smackover, how oil migrates, reservoirs, rock formation -- are highly technical terms.\n   <sup>\n    2\n   </sup>\n   Nor is there any question that those terms involved the principal issues in the case. The jury was called on to determine, in part, where the reservoir was located under the [Kellys'] property, how and if oil had migrated from the [Kellys'] property, and the extent of the Smackover rock formation under the [Kellys'] property. Those are the very terms [M.M.] undertook to research, and, in this case, it would be difficult to imagine more prejudicial terms for a juror to research extraneously. Indeed, [the Kellys'] proof and Defendants' defenses turned on abstract definitions offered by the parties' experts where such definitions attempted to illustrate or explain substances and events found miles beneath the Earth's surface. Even with the aid of seismic data and other pertinent information, the parties can only describe the events in abstract terms with interpretations of highly technical data. Present technology does not permit the actual viewing of the oil and gas in place and\n   migrating miles beneath the Earth's surface. Accordingly, both the liability and damage issues in the case turned on the very definitions that Ms. [M.] researched. In those circumstances, it is difficult for the Court to presume that Ms. [M.'s] extraneous research into those very terms and definitions did not influence her decision, precisely as she testified in her first affidavit.\n   <sup>\n    3\n   </sup>\n   At the least, the Court, the [Kellys] and the Defendants were entitled to know that Ms. [M.] had looked up such technical definitions, to challenge those definitions if necessary, or to instruct her to ignore them.

In other words, Rule 26 contemplates pretrial disclosure of (1) the identity of an expert witness, (2) the 'subject matter' of his testimony, (3) the 'substance of the facts and opinions,' and (4) a 'summary of the grounds' for his opinion. Moreover, '[a] party is under a [continuing] duty seasonably to\n   <em>\n    supplement\n   </em>\n   [an interrogatory] response with respect to ... the identity of each person expected to be called as an expert witness at trial, the subject matter on which the expert witness is expected to testify and the substance of the witness's testimony.' Rule 26(e)(1).\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In this case, Ankor disclosed during discovery that Hanby would opine, among other things, that, \"[e]ven if there were physically some oil in this Smackover structure underneath the [Kellys'] Section 8 property, that oil could not have been produced through the 17-5 or 18-2 wells.\" The Kellys argue that Hanby should not have been allowed to give his opinion as to whether there was oil under the Kellys' property in 2010. However, the trial court was within its discretion to allow the opinion\n   based on the scope of the expert's disclosure of the subject matter of his testimony. Accordingly, the Kellys were not entitled to a new trial on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   We reverse the trial court's order granting the Kellys' motion for a new trial based on juror misconduct, and we remand the cause to the trial court to reinstate the original judgment entered on the jury's verdict for Ankor. As to the Kellys' cross-appeal, insofar as the order of the trial court granting the Kellys' motion for a new trial denied that motion on the alternative grounds argued by the Kellys, that order is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   1151269-REVERSED AND REMANDED WITH DIRECTIONS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   1160476-AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Parker, Main, Wise, Bryan, Sellers, and Mendheim, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Shaw, J., concurs in the result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   SHAW, Justice (concurring in the result).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   I concur in the result in both appeals. I write to discuss the juror's handwritten affidavit submitted by Jerry M. Kelly, Sr., Kandace Kelly McDaniel, Kelly Properties, LLP, and K&amp;L Resources, LLP (hereinafter referred to collectively as \"the plaintiffs\"), in support of their motion for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Generally, juror affidavits cannot be used to impeach a verdict; however, they can be used to show that extraneous information influenced the jury. Rule 606(b), Ala. R. Evid., states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   \"Upon an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not\n   <em>\n    testify\n   </em>\n   in impeachment of the verdict ...\n   <em>\n    except\n   </em>\n   that a juror may\n   <em>\n    testify\n   </em>\n   on the question whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury's attention ....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Rule 606(b) explicitly states that a juror may\n   <em>\n    testify\n   </em>\n   as to whether extraneous information was brought to the jury's attention. Our caselaw has included affidavit testimony within the term \"testify\" in this situation. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Alabama Power Co. v. Turner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7517006\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/575/551/#p556\">\n    575 So.2d 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 556-57 (Ala. 1991) (\"As a general rule, neither testimony nor affidavits are admissible to impeach a jury's verdict. An exception to this rule exists when an affidavit tends to show extraneous facts that have influenced the jury's deliberations and the resulting verdict.\" (citations omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Ankor Energy, LLC, and Ankor E&amp;P Holdings Corporation (hereinafter referred to collectively as \"the defendants\") argued below, and restate the argument on appeal, that the handwritten affidavit offered by the plaintiffs in support of their motion for a new trial was not a valid affidavit because, although the signature was notarized, the affidavit was unsworn. Thus, the defendants argue, it was not \"testimony\" of a juror that could be used to impeach the verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   I note that the handwritten affidavit does not have the oft-included opening statement that the writing was made under oath. Instead, as part of the notary's recitations, it states that it was \"sworn and subscribed before me.\" The juror, in a subsequent sworn affidavit, states that such language was not on the affidavit when she signed it, that she was not placed under oath, and that she did not intend the statement to be under oath:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   \"After the trial was over, ... one of the Plaintiffs' attorneys ... called me over a dozen times, on both my cell phone and my mother's landline telephone. I do not know how he obtained these phone numbers. [Plaintiffs' counsel] was trying to convince me to provide him a statement\n   that I had looked up information concerning the trial on my phone. Finally, in an attempt to stop the harassing phone calls I was receiving from [Plaintiffs' counsel], I decided to meet him at McDonald's [fast-food restaurant] in Brewton and give him a statement. At that time, I did no[t] know that my statement would be used in Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   \"... At the time I wrote and signed my statement, I was not placed under oath, and I was not swearing to its contents. I have never sworn to the contents of the statement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   \"... The language at the bottom of the version of my statement which was filed in Court which says 'Sworn to and subscribed before me ...' was not on the document at the time I signed my statement. In addition, the word 'Affidavit' was not on the document at the time I signed my statement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   \"....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   \"... At the time I wrote my statement, I did not believe I was swearing to its contents or that it would be labeled an affidavit.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   An affidavit by the counsel for the plaintiffs who took the juror's affidavit indicated that he notarized her affidavit at a later time because he forgot to bring his notary seal to the meeting. He did not indicate that the juror was acting under oath. It is also clear that the \"sworn and subscribed\" language, and the word \"affidavit\" at the top, are in a different handwriting than the rest of the affidavit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   In my opinion, the notarization of the handwritten statement would confirm only that it was signed by the affiant. It does not indicate that the signatory was under oath; subsequent affidavits confirm that the juror did not believe that she was under oath. Thus, it was due to be stricken by the trial court. The defendants may challenge on appeal the trial court's failure to do so; because the defendants objected to the affidavit and moved to strike it in the trial court, the issue whether it was due to be stricken was preserved for appellate review. See\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Secretary of Veterans Affairs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7016335\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/92/771/#p777\">\n    92 So.3d 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 777 (Ala. 2012) (holding, in the context of a motion for a summary judgment, that the failure to move the trial court to strike an affidavit waives \"any objection on appeal regarding the trial court's consideration of the affidavit\"). I believe that the notarized handwritten statement is due to be stricken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   With the affidavit stricken, there was no competent evidence showing that the juror's misconduct resulted in prejudice. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Reed v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7549633\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/547/596/#p597\">\n    547 So.2d 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 597 (Ala. 1989) (\"Once the trial court investigates the misconduct and finds,\n   <em>\n    based on competent evidence\n   </em>\n   , the alleged prejudice to be lacking, this Court will not reverse.\" (emphasis added) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the only proper \"testimony\" before the trial court consisted of a later executed, sworn affidavit by the juror submitted by the defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   This \"testimony\" indicates that the juror considered an extraneous source but\n   that such consideration\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   impact her decision. (\"The information I viewed on my cell phone did not motivate me to decide my verdict in any particular way.\"). Thus, the only\n   <em>\n    testimony\n   </em>\n   before the trial court on this issue showed no \"extraneous\n   <em>\n    prejudicial\n   </em>\n   information\" for purposes of Rule 606(b) and nothing impacting the verdict.
