For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Appellant, Kimble Development, LLC. (\"Kimble\"), entered into a Contract for Development with appellee, Village Shopping Center Partnership (\"Village\"), in 2013 for the purpose of building an O'Reilly Auto Parts store on Village's property in St. Charles Parish. The contract provided that Village would pay Kimble a development fee of $ 35,000, and that Kimble would be responsible for all construction costs of the building that exceeded $ 688,944, with the exception of \"unforeseen\" or \"uncontrollable costs\" such as asbestos or environmental mitigation and site clean-up. A contract addendum executed by the parties in June of 2015, adjusted the project cost to $ 711,576.71 when power lines at the site were required to be run underground and the store's windows had to be upgraded according to building code standards. A subsequent change order dated August 4, 2015, increased the amount again by $ 1,837.77, for a total of $ 713,413.71. When the final price of the project reached $ 751,900.00, Village called upon Kimble for a reimbursement of $ 40,324.28, which was the amount exceeded in the contract addendum that Village had paid to Kimble, the general contractor as well as the vendors and subcontractors that Kimble hired for the project. After unsuccessfully trying to resolve the matter, Village filed the instant lawsuit on December 21, 2016, which further sought penalties, interest, attorney's fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 17, 2017, Kimble filed a peremptory exception of no right of action, which was denied on May 17, 2017. After Kimble filed an answer to Village's petition for damages, Village filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted by the trial court on July 20, 2018. Kimble timely sought the instant devolutive appeal from that judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Kimble asserts that the exceeded estimates in this matter occurred as a result of the cost of materials that it was required to purchase from O'Reilly, referred to as O'Reilly National Account items, which included components such as the building's shell and HVAC system. In the deposition testimony of Kimble's owner, Michael Kimble, he stated that in his prior experience developing O'Reilly's Auto Parts stores, the invoice for the National Account items at the end of the project never exceeded the $ 100,000 estimated amount. Mr. Kimble testified that in the construction of the O'Reilly's store on Village's property, however, the cost exceeded the estimated amount because the square footage of the building increased from 6,800 square feet to 7,125 square feet. Kimble contends that it \"neither foresaw nor controlled the cost of the National Account items as is required under Section 5 of the Contract to hold Kimble Development responsible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Conversely, Village argues that the cost overruns were the result of Kimble incorrectly conveying the correct square footage of the store to O'Reilly. As explained by Village in its brief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Although the contract lists the size at 6,800 square feet, by early 2013, Kimble was aware that the building was actually 7,125 square feet. In April 2013, O'Reilly Auto Parts emailed Peter Glaser of Village a copy of a \"Draft New Construction Building Lease Agreement for 7,125 square foot building,\" and Kimble's project manager, Scott Russell, was copied on the email.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In confirming these facts during his deposition testimony, Mr. Kimble acknowledged that the failure to adjust the estimate to 7,125 square feet was an \"oversight.\" Village also contends that the contract between the parties specifically stated that Kimble, as the project's contractor, was responsible for all construction costs, which the National Account items were a part of.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In its motion for summary judgment, Village asserted that certain facts were undisputed: 1) whether Kimble had warranted that the final cost of the project would not exceed $ 713,413.71; 2) whether the total cost of the project paid by Village amounted to $ 761,700.99, and; 3) whether the costs of the project were foreseeable and controllable. In support of its motion for summary judgment, Village attached several exhibits, which were referenced at the hearing and in the trial court's reasons for judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Conversely, in opposing Village's motion for summary judgment, Kimble argued that the cost overruns for the project were both unforeseen and uncontrollable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignment of error\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On appeal, Kimble asserts that the trial court erred in granting Village's motion for summary judgment. Specifically, Kimble first argues that the trial court incorrectly applied the rules of contractual interpretation to limit the construction costs to environmental related site costs. Kimble also argues that the trial court erred in finding that the questions of fact it raised were inapplicable to the instant case in light of the wording of the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LAW AND ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   According to La.

Specifically, Section 5 of the Contract for Development Services provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   5. PROJECT COSTS-Kimble warrants that the Project construction costs shall not exceed $ 688,944. Kimble shall be responsible for\n   <strong>\n    all construction costs\n   </strong>\n   for the Project exceeding $ 688,944,\n   <strong>\n    except for unforeseen or uncontrollable costs\n   </strong>\n   such as asbestos or environmental mitigation and necessary site clean-up. [Emphasis added.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Kimble argues that in finding that the \"unforeseen or uncontrollable\" costs are exclusively environmental in nature, the trial court altered the terms of the contract. Kimble asserts that the examples provided in Section 5 were merely illustrative. Village argues that this matter is governed by Section 2 of the contract, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   2. SERVICES- Kimble shall handle all aspects of the development and building construction of the Project, including all communications, contracting and invoicing. Further\n   <strong>\n    if the Project costs exceed $ 688,944, Kimble shall bear the risk and be responsible for all such costs over and above that amount.\n   </strong>\n   \" [Emphasis added.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   To ascertain the intention of the parties, who disagreed on the contract's interpretation of the terms, the court properly considered parole evidence. Based upon the evidence presented, the trial court, in its Reasons For Judgment, found that the original contract was drafted by Kimble Development and/or its attorneys and that Kimble Development knew, prior to executing the contract and before the project began, that the proposed building was supposed to be 7,125 square feet yet did not amend its preliminary estimate for the O'Reilly's National Account materials. The trial court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant maintains that the O'Reilly National account cost overruns were \"unforeseen or uncontrollable\" costs for which it is not responsible pursuant to Section 5 of the Contract. However, a plain reading of the above provision leads to the commonsense conclusion that the types of unforeseen and uncontrollable costs referenced in Section 5 are environmental-related site costs. In the instant case, the evidence established that the cost overruns\n   <strong>\n    resulted from underestimation, not unanticipated environmental costs\n   </strong>\n   . The \"questions of fact\" argument raised by the defendant regarding whether the costs were \"unforeseen or uncontrollable\" does not apply to the instant case in light of the wording of the contract. [Emphasis added.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In the instant case, the initial contract between the parties, dated July 10, 2013, makes two references to liability for construction costs of the project, in Sections 2 and 5. Both of those sections are clear that Kimble would be liable for any overruns that qualified as construction costs, although that term is not defined in the contract itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The parties do not dispute that the additional expense incurred by Village beyond the stipulated amount of $ 713,413.71 in the development contract resulted from costs incurred from the actual building or \"construction\" of the O'Reilly store. Kimble argues that it was unforeseeable that the costs of the building itself would increase with the addition of square footage to the store. However, the record indicates that Kimble inadvertently and incorrectly estimated the initial construction cost of a 6,800 square foot store instead of a 7,125 square foot store. We agree with the trial court that Kimble's underestimating the cost of the building materials based upon its error in initially providing the accurate square footage of the completed store does not invoke the \"unforeseen or uncontrollable costs\" exception of Section 5 in the Development Contract between the parties, but instead is governed under section two of the contract which provides that \"Kimble shall bear the risk and be responsible for all such construction costs over and above\" the amount of its own estimate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   To the extent that Kimble relies on the trial court's reasons for judgment to make an argument that the court erred in finding that the \"unforeseen or uncontrollable\" costs are exclusively environmental in nature, we note that that appellate Courts do not review reasons for judgment as a part of the judgment itself.

Lucksinger\n   </em>\n   , 09-0571 (La. 4/1/11),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7030406\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/61/507/\">\n    61 So.3d 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Contrary to Kimble's assertion that the trial court made a finding that the \"unforeseen or uncontrollable\" costs referred to in section five are exclusively environmental in nature, it appears from the record as a whole that the trial court found it unnecessary to make a determination of whether any environmental concerns applied under section five of the agreement. As discussed above, because the trial court concluded that the increased cost was the result of underestimation, a cause that was neither unforeseen nor uncontrollable, he deemed it unnecessary to base his ruling on section five.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   After\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, we conclude that Village established that it will be able to satisfy its evidentiary burden of proving the there was a meeting of the minds on the terms of the project construction costs provision of the contract. Accordingly, we find that Village is entitled to summary judgment, as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DECREE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The district court judgment sustaining Village's motion for summary judgment, and awarding $ 48,347.28, together with legal interest, is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     AFFIRMED\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    As acknowledged by the trial court, these exhibits consisted of:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n    Exhibit A- Deposition of Michael Kimble;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n    Exhibit B- Emails between Amy Richardson and Dr. Glazer;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n    Exhibit C- Email between Amy Richardson and Scott Russell;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n    Exhibit D- Letter to Scott Russell from Amy Richardson;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n    Exhibit E- Contract for Development Services;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n    Exhibit F- Deposition of Kelly Sanders Morgan;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n    Exhibit G-Contract Addendum;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n    Exhibit H- Various Invoices and check images/payments;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n    Exhibit I- O'Reilly Auto Parts Invoice;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n    Exhibit J- Geotechnical Engineering Report;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n    Exhibit K- O'Reilly Auto Part-Shell Package Only;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n    Exhibit L- State of Louisiana-Fire Marshall;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n    Exhibit M- Spreadsheet of O'Reilly's Account;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n    Exhibit N- St. Charles Planning Department-Permit;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n    Exhibit O- Site Order Request/Energy Management System;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n    Exhibit P- Affidavit of Peter Glazer\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
