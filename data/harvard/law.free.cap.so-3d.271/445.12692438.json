Rex Distributing Company was a wholesaler of Anheuser-Busch's beer. When Rex sought to sell its business, Anheuser-Busch asserted a contractual right to \"redirect\" the sale to its preferred buyer, Mitchell Distributing Company. Rex alleges that the redirect provision was void under Mississippi's Beer Industry Fair Dealing Act (BIFDA) and that Anheuser-Busch's interference with the sale caused it damages actionable under the same statute. The trial court dismissed Rex's claims against Anheuser-Busch and Mitchell for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62. We conclude that Rex alleged a valid cause of action, so we reverse the dismissal of Rex's BIFDA claim against Anheuser-Busch and the derivative claims against Mitchell. We affirm the trial court's judgment dismissing Rex's other claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b63. This is an interlocutory appeal from a dismissal under Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The following facts are drawn from Rex's complaint and, for our purposes, must be accepted as true.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pryer v.

Our beer laws are similar to the general franchise laws present in many states.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Anhalt,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 163-64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65. Rex was a beer distributor/wholesaler. Anheuser-Busch is the largest beer supplier in the country. Rex had a longstanding position as Anheuser-Busch's exclusive distributor for a swath of the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The distribution contract between the two gave Anheuser-Busch a right of first refusal if Rex were sold-\"at the price and on the terms and conditions applicable\"-and the right to assign the sale to a third-party purchaser of Anheuser-Busch's choosing. The parties call this a right to \"match and redirect\" the sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66. When Rex attempted to sell, the high bidder was another nearby distributor, Adams Beverages, Inc. The sale contract (called the Asset Purchase Agreement or APA) provided that the price would be determined by each individual distribution contract Rex successfully transferred to Adams. This depended on the approval of each of the suppliers Rex distributed for-but under Mississippi law, the suppliers' consent \"shall not be withheld or unreasonably delayed to a proposed transferee who meets [certain] nondiscriminatory, material and reasonable qualifications and standards.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2067-7-13\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 67-7-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) (Rev. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67. Two days before Rex's sale to Adams was to close, Anheuser-Busch informed Rex it was exercising a right under the distribution contract to \"match and redirect\" the sale of Rex to Mitchell Distributing Company, Inc., another local distributor. According to Rex's complaint, this eleventh-hour interference turned out to be part of a continuing scheme by Anheuser-Busch to manipulate its distributors. Anheuser-Busch had recently tried to convince its Mississippi distributors not to sell beer from one of its competitors, Yuengling and Son, but it had been mostly unsuccessful; Mitchell had been the only Anheuser-Busch distributor to spurn Yuengling at Anheuser-Busch's request.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rex alleged Anheuser-Busch asserted the match-and-redirect claim to reward Mitchell and simultaneously to punish Rex for selling a competitor's beer, since under the terms of the sale contract, Rex bore the risk its other suppliers would refuse the transfer of its distribution rights to the new purchaser. That is what Rex alleged Yuengling ultimately did when Rex acceded to Anheuser-Busch's demand, costing Rex $ 3.1 million and leading to this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68. Rex sued Anheuser-Busch, Mitchell, and Yuengling. Rex accused Anheuser-Busch and Mitchell of common-law tortious interference with contract and civil conspiracy. It also alleged that Anheuser-Busch's exercise of the match-and-redirect provision violated the Mississippi Beer Industry Fair Dealing Act and Anheuser-Busch breached its contract with Rex by failing to ensure Rex received the same price it would have had Anheuser-Busch not redirected the sale. The trial court dismissed all these counts for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). Finally,\n   Rex alleged Yuengling had violated BIFDA by refusing the proposed transfer to Mitchell of Rex's Yuengling distribution rights. This claim survived the motion to dismiss and remains pending in the trial court. This Court granted Rex's petitions for interlocutory appeal from the judgments dismissing its claims against Anheuser-Busch and Mitchell, and the appeals have been consolidated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Beer Industry Fair Dealing Act, Mississippi Code Section 67-7-13\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b69. The Mississippi Beer Industry Fair Dealing Act (BIFDA) provides in part that a supplier \"shall not interfere with, prevent or unreasonably delay the transfer of the wholesaler's business\" so long as the proposed transferee \"meets such nondiscriminatory, material and reasonable qualifications and standards required by the supplier for similarly situated wholesalers.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2067-7-13\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 67-7-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2) (Rev. 2012). In relevant part, the statute further permits the supplier to refuse to accept the transfer only \"in good faith and for good cause related to the reasonable qualifications\" of the transferee.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2067-7-13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b610. At the outset, we observe that we are reviewing the granting of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). At this stage in the litigation, the allegations of Rex's complaint must be accepted as true.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pryer v. Gardner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12672790\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/247/1245/#p1250\">\n    247 So.3d 1245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1250 (Miss. 2018). Thus we are required to credit the allegations in the complaint that the original proposed transferee, Adams, was reasonably qualified and that Anheuser-Busch lacked good cause to refuse to accept the transfer to Adams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b611. BIFDA further provides that wholesalers may not waive its protections: \"[a] wholesaler may not waive any of the rights granted in any provision of this chapter and the provisions of any agreement which would have such an effect shall be null and void.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2067-7-17\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 67-7-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Rev. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b612. Rex alleges BIFDA rendered the \"match and redirect\" contract provision void and that Anheuser-Busch's demand violated Section 67-7-13(2) by \"preventing\" or \"interfering with\" the transfer of its business. Anheuser-Busch responds that it did not violate Section 67-7-13(2) because Rex's business was transferred-just not to the company to which Rex wanted it transferred. The trial court found this reasoning persuasive and dismissed Rex's BIFDA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b613. The interpretation of a statute is a question of law, and the standard of review on appeal is de novo.\n   <em>\n    Natchez Hosp. Co. LLC v. Adams Cty. Bd. of Supervisors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12663111\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/238/1162/#p1163\">\n    238 So.3d 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1163 (Miss. 2018). This Court has never interpreted Section 67-7-13(2), and we are not aware of any decisions interpreting similar provisions found in the law of some other states.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor have the parties cited any outside authorities, either by courts or commentators. We consider this to be a matter of first impression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b614. That being said, Anheuser-Busch's stepping in to insist Rex sell its business to someone else amounted to \"preventing\" the proposed transfer under any definition of the word. Anheuser-Busch likewise \"interfered\" with the proposed transfer. The only conceivable definition of the word \"interfere\" that might not apply would be if it had been used as a\n   term of art referring to common-law tortious interference with contract, which has not been argued by any of the parties to this appeal. Reading \"interfere\" as a term of art would contradict the oft-cited (and statutorily mandated) rule of statutory interpretation that nontechnical \"[w]ords contained in statutes are to be interpreted 'according to their common and ordinary acceptation and meaning.' \"\n   <em>\n    Alfonso v. Diamondhead Fire Prot.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6997387\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/122/54/#p56\">\n    122 So.3d 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 56 (Miss. 2013) (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%201-3-65\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 1-3-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Rev. 2005)). BIFDA defines seventeen different terms, but \"interfere\" is not one of them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2067-7-5\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 67-7-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Rev. 2012). We observe, also, that it is impossible for a supplier like Anheuser-Busch to tortiously interfere with the sale of its distribution rights, because the supplier is a party to the contract for the sale of its distribution rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bama Budweiser of Montgomery, Inc. v.

If \"interfere\" meant \"tortious interference with contract,\" as the separate opinion contends it should, the statute would prohibit something that is already impossible, and it would offer distributors no protection whatsoever from unjustified interference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b615. We also note that Section 67-7-13(2) further protects a distributor's right to pass on her business to specific people after her death, i.e., designated members.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It reads, in its entirety,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The supplier shall not interfere with, prevent or unreasonably delay the transfer of the wholesaler's business, including an assignment of wholesaler's rights under the agreement, if the proposed transferee is a designated member, or if the transferee other than a designated member meets such nondiscriminatory, material and reasonable qualifications and standards required by the supplier for similarly situated wholesalers. Where the transferee is other than a designated member, the supplier may in good faith and for good cause related to the reasonable qualifications refuse to accept the transfer of the wholesaler's business or the assignment of the wholesaler's rights under the agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Miss. Code. Ann. \u00a7 67-7-13(2) (Rev. 2012). Were we to accept Anheuser-Busch's reading of the statute, that there has been no\n   interference with\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   transfer as long as\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   transfer happens, the same interpretation should apply to transfers to designated members. That would permit an end-run around the statute's protections for designated members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b616. Any remaining doubt can be removed by considering the purpose Section 67-7-13(2) serves within Mississippi's regulation of the beer industry. BIFDA was expressly intended to \"maintain stability and healthy competition in the light wine and beer industry in this state.\" Miss. Code. Ann. \u00a7 67-7-3(a) (Rev. 2012). Mississippi law requires separation between manufacturers and distributors; a manufacturer (and its officers, agents, employees, and affiliates) is not permitted to have \"any interest in the license, business, assets or corporate stock of a wholesaler or distributor ....\" Miss. Code. Ann. \u00a7 67-3-46(2) (Rev. 2012). Allowing a manufacturer to choose the owners of its wholesalers in perpetuity would undermine the statutory separation of the beer industry into three tiers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b617. We conclude that Rex has alleged a claim upon which relief can be granted: BIFDA rendered the match-and-redirect provision null and void, and Anheuser-Busch's demands premised on the void provision may have amounted to unjustified \"interference\" with Rex's transfer to Adams, an allegedly qualified transferee. BIFDA expressly provides a remedy for damages resulting from violations of its protections.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2067-7-15\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 67-7-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Rev. 2012). The circuit court's dismissal for failure to state a claim is reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Breach of Contract-Anheuser-Busch\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b618. Rex also claimed that Anheuser-Busch breached its contract with Rex, which Rex contends required Anheuser-Busch to ensure Rex received \"the same price, net of taxes, [Rex] would have received from the disapproved purchaser.\" We have held that under BIFDA the \"provisions [of the contract between Anheuser-Busch and Rex] which would have [the] effect [of permitting interference with the transfer of Anheuser-Busch's distribution rights are] null and void.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2067-7-17\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 67-7-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Rev. 2012). But it is not clear that the statute also nullifies Anheuser-Busch's obligation to pay for the transfer of the rights, and the contract between Anheuser-Busch and Rex includes an explicit severability clause. The enforceability question has not been raised as an issue on appeal by the parties. And we ultimately conclude that Rex has failed to state a claim for breach of contract, so the question of enforceability is moot and will not be addressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b619. The full provision at issue, Paragraph 4(b)(v), states,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   If Anheuser-Busch disapproves a proposed owner in Wholesaler's business solely because of (A) concern with the resulting Territory configuration or (B) market combinations to achieve economies of scale or enhanced sales opportunities, and if a sale is eventually completed to a party preferred and designated by Anheuser-Busch, then Anheuser-Busch shall ensure that the selling Wholesaler receives the same price, net of taxes, Wholesaler would have received from the disapproved purchaser.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b620. We observe, first, that the contract distinguishes between \"disapproval\" of a transfer, which is outlined in Paragraph 4(b), and \"assignment,\" which is found later, in Paragraph 4(d). The same-price provision is found in Paragraph 4(b) (disapproval), and it expressly applies only \"if [Anheuser-Busch] disapproves a proposed owner.\" The match-and-redirect paragraph, Paragraph 4(d), actually specifies\n   its own way for the price to be determined: \"at the price and on the terms and conditions applicable to such proposed [transfer] ....\" Paragraph 4(d) omits the same-price language. Rex does not allege that Anheuser-Busch breached the contract by failing to ensure the price as specified in Paragraph 4(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b621. Even if it did apply to the transfer here, Paragraph 4(b)(v) conditions the \"same price\" language on Anheuser-Busch's disapproving the proposed transferee \"\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   because of (A) concern with the resulting Territory configuration or (B) market combinations to achieve economies of scale or enhanced sales opportunities.\" (Emphasis added.) This is inconsistent with Rex's theory of the case, which was that Anheuser-Busch exercised the assignment provision with the intent of punishing Rex and rewarding Mitchell. Anheuser-Busch is permitted to plead alternative and inconsistent theories, but no allegation is made in the complaint that Anheuser-Busch acted solely for either of the reasons required by the same-price provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b622. Rex also suggests a breach-of-contract claim may have arisen because an officer of Anheuser-Busch promised Rex it would receive the same consideration in the sale to Mitchell as it would have in the sale to Adams. But the breach-of-contract claim as articulated in the complaint alleges that the written contract between Anheuser-Busch and Rex governs, not the later communications. Rex's brief on appeal likewise never argued the representations were binding. Thus, we conclude that the question of whether the later representations were binding is not before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b623. In summary, Rex relies on the same-price language in Paragraph 4(b)(v). That provision, by its own terms, is not applicable to the transfer that occurred here. We affirm the dismissal of the breach-of-contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Other Claims Against Anheuser-Busch\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b624. Rex also alleges, in a cursory fashion, that the circuit court erred in dismissing its other claims against Anheuser-Busch. No authority is cited, and the argument is directed entirely to refuting the reasons the trial court gave for granting the motion to dismiss. That is insufficient to demonstrate reversible error. On appeal from a dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, the appellant must show that it stated a claim, not merely refute the reasons the trial court gave for dismissing the claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Satterfield v.

Mitchell argues it cannot be liable for tortious inference, since\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   is not alleged to have committed any of the acts that constitute interference. The complaint alleges that \"Anheuser-Busch and Mitchell interfered with [the sale to Adams] through an intentional and willful scheme to redirect the sale of Rex's business from Adams to Mitchell,\" but all of the specific acts of interference are attributed to Anheuser-Busch rather than to Mitchell. Nonetheless, there is an allegation of concerted action-Anheuser-Busch and Mitchell worked together, and Anheuser-Busch could not have done it without Mitchell's participation. Thus, Rex alleged Mitchell was a joint tortfeasor and is liable for Anheuser-Busch's wrongful acts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    D &amp; W Jones, Inc. v.

Mitchell goes on to argue that \"Rex does not allege that the match and redirect (or purchase and assign) provision contained in Paragraph 4(d) of the Equity Agreement is unlawful or unenforceable due to BIFDA.\" This claim ignores Rex's arguments throughout the litigation and instead points to a specific word choice in the complaint-the complaint alleged that Anheuser-Busch violated BIFDA when it \"refused to accept Rex's sale to Adams.\" According to Mitchell, this means Rex alleged only that BIFDA was violated by the refusal and not by the assignment to Mitchell.

Mitchell next points out that the sale contract to Adams required the consent of Yuengling, which had not yet been given at the time Anheuser-Busch made the demand for the assignment to Mitchell. According to Mitchell, there can be no\n   cause of action for tortious interference with a contract when performance depends on a condition precedent. Mitchell offers no authority on this point, and our own review suggests the prevailing view is the opposite, as long as the plaintiff can prove the condition precedent would have occurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SCEcorp v.

That allegation was made expressly in the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b630. Next, Mitchell argues there is no allegation it acted with specific animus toward Rex. But the \"malice\" required for tortious inference with contract is a term of art, and under Mississippi law, it can be inferred from certain acts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   The element of willfulness and calculation does not require a showing on the part of the plaintiff that defendant had a specific intent to deprive plaintiff of contractual rights. Rather, the requisite intent is inferred when defendant knows of the existence of a contract and does a wrongful act without legal or social justification that he is certain or substantially certain will result in interference with the contract.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    Par Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11836478\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/708/44/#p48\">\n    708 So.2d at 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Liston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3908512\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/659/276/#p281\">\n    659 F.Supp. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   281 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b631. Mitchell then contends in a cursory fashion that it cannot be found to have committed tortious interference because it had a \"justifiable interest and reason for acting\" or was \"exercising a legitimate interest or right.\" The assertion is essentially that as long as it was to Mitchell's financial advantage to do what it did, its actions could not be tortious interference. That is simply not the rule, as\n   <em>\n    Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts\n   </em>\n   has explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   The defendant is also permitted to interfere with another's contractual relations to protect his own present existing economic interests, such as the ownership or condition of property, or a prior contract of his own, or a financial interest in the affairs of the person persuaded.

Page Keeton et al.,\n   <em>\n    Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 129 (5th ed. 1984) (footnotes omitted). Mitchell had no present existing interest in Rex's business and thus cannot claim the protection of this rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b632. Finally, Mitchell contends the tortious interference claim should be dismissed because Rex failed to plead that it proximately caused Rex's damages. But Rex certainly makes that allegation in the complaint: \"But for [Anheuser-Busch] and Mitchell's interference, Rex would have consummated its sale to Adams and received the full $ 50.5 million purchase price. [Anheuser-Busch] and Mitchell's interference is the proximate cause of Rex's $ 3.1 million loss.\" Mitchell then contends Rex cannot show proximate cause because it went through with selling its business to Mitchell. This contention is unsupported by authority or argument in Mitchell's brief on appeal. \"It is the duty of the briefing party to cite to authority which supports its argument.\"\n   <em>\n    Hatfield v.

Civil Conspiracy-Mitchell\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b634. Finally, Rex contends the trial court erred in dismissing its claim that Mitchell is liable for Anheuser-Busch's acts under a theory of civil conspiracy. Under Mississippi law, the elements of a civil conspiracy are: \"(1) an agreement between two or more persons, (2) to accomplish an unlawful purpose or a lawful purpose unlawfully, (3) an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy, (4) and damages to the plaintiff as a proximate result.\"\n   <em>\n    Bradley v.

First, Mitchell contends there was no underlying tort and therefore no civil conspiracy. But there is an underlying wrong-Anheuser-Busch's alleged violation of the statute prohibiting it from interfering with transfers of Rex's business, the Beer Industry Fair Dealing Act (BIFDA), as we explained above. Mitchell is alleged to have agreed to and participated in Anheuser-Busch's course of action, before and after Anheuser-Busch formally demanded that Rex sell to Mitchell instead of Adams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b636. Mitchell also erroneously contends that its liability for civil conspiracy depends on\n   <em>\n    Mitchell's\n   </em>\n   having committed an overt act that damaged Rex. This is a fundamental misstatement of the nature of civil conspiracy-it exists as a cause of action to hold nonacting parties responsible. Rex has to show an unlawful overt act and it has to show damages, but the overt act need not be by Mitchell.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jeffcoat\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9171089\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/887/777/#p786\">\n    887 So.2d at 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rex and [Anheuser-Busch] entered a Wholesaler Equity Agreement. The Wholesaler Equity Agreement was a valid and binding contract between Rex and [Anheuser-Busch].

Specifically, the Wholesaler Equity Agreement requires that if \"[Anheuser-Busch] disapproves a proposed owner ... and if a sale is eventually completed to a party preferred and designated by [Anheuser-Busch], then [Anheuser-Busch]\n   <strong>\n    shall ensure that the selling Wholesaler receives the same price\n   </strong>\n   , net of taxes, Wholesaler would have received from the disapproved purchaser.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   67.

Ownership of Wholesaler\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   Although this is a personal service agreement and the participation of Manager is vital to both parties, the ownership of Wholesaler is also important because it is the owner or owners who have the right to establish basic policies and have the responsibility of providing financing, personnel, equipment and facilities for the effective operation of the business .... Therefore, because the participation of the owner(s) could also have a significant effect on the sale of Anheuser-Busch Products and the performance of this Agreement, the parties agree as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   (a) Unless Wholesaler shall have followed the procedures set forth in subparagraphs (b) and (c) below, this Agreement shall immediately terminate pursuant to the terms of paragraph 6 whenever there is a change of ownership in Wholesaler's business ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   (b) A change of ownership of Wholesaler's business is a matter of vital concern to both Anheuser-Busch and Wholesaler. Anheuser-Busch recognizes Wholesaler's desire to obtain the best available price for its business. Wholesaler understands that the ability of Anheuser-Busch\n   to successfully market its Products in the Territory is dependent upon the financial, marketing and other qualifications of the prospective purchaser of Wholesaler's business. The parties acknowledge that these objectives are not mutually exclusive and recognizing Wholesale's desire to obtain the best available price for Wholesaler's business from a purchaser who is fully qualified to market the Products and fulfill the obligations set forth in this Agreement, they agree that the following provisions are necessary and desirable for both Wholesaler and Anheuser-Busch:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   (i)\n   <em>\n    If an owner of Wholesaler desires to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any interest in Wholesaler, then Wholesaler shall notify Anheuser-Busch by submitting a Notice of Intent to Sell\n   </em>\n   ... prior to the commencement of any negotiations or related discussions with any prospective purchaser or other third party .... Wholesaler shall cooperate with Anheuser-Busch and provide it with such information as Anheuser-Busch may require in order to extend an offer to purchase such interest in the business.

After considering the motion to dismiss, the circuit court ruled,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   Count I, Breach of Contract, alleges [Anheuser-Busch] breached the Wholesaler Equity Agreement. Rex put its business up for sale to the highest and best bidder, which it considered to be Adams. The Wholesaler Equity Agreement Rex had with [Anheuser-Busch] provided that [Anheuser-Busch] had to approve the purchase or it could \"match and redirect\" it. Prior to the sale's completion, [Anheuser-Busch] exercised this right and redirected the sale of Rex's [Anheuser-Busch] distributorship to Mitchell. Pursuant to the agreement [Anheuser-Busch] had to ensure that the sale was \"at the price and on the terms and conditions\" as set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement between Rex and Adams. Adams had offered Rex a total of $ 50.5 million, which Rex claims is the \"price\" it was entitled to receive from Mitchell. However, before the sale of assets by Rex to Mitchell was consummated, Yuengling, another of Rex's suppliers, withheld its consent to the sale and terminated its contractual relationship with Rex. As a result Rex did not have a Yuengling distributorship to transfer to Mitchell. The Asset Purchase Agreement provides that if one of Rex's suppliers refuses to give consent to the transaction \"then the purchase price shall be reduced by the portion of the purchase price attributable\" to such supplier. The Yuengling distributorship rights were valued at $ 3.1 million which were the deducted from the offered price of $ 50.5 million. The sale to Mitchell was then completed. Rex is attempting to recover the $ 3.1 million.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   Rex specifically agreed to the terms and conditions of the sale by executing the two contracts. [Anheuser-Busch] did not breach its contract with Rex because [Anheuser-Busch] exercised its lawful contractual right to \"match and redirect\" the sale from Adams to Mitchell under the \"terms and conditions\" of the contracts. The Court further notes that even though Rex claims that it was \"forced\" to conclude the sale from Rex to Mitchell, in fact, Rex voluntarily concluded the sale. Rex took the risk that Yuengling would not approve if AB decided to match and redirect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b651. The circuit court was correct to rule that the allegations of the Complaint established that Anheuser-Busch exercised its rights under the \"match and redirect\" provision (Paragraph 4(d)). And the circuit court was correct to rule that Anheuser-Busch was obligated to Rex \"for payment of the purchase price, if such third party violates its obligation to pay such purchase price to Wholesaler.\" The Complaint alleged that Rex received payment of $ 47.4 million of the original purchase price of $ 50.5 million. Rex contends that it lost $ 3.1 million because Yuengling did not consent to the sale of Rex's Yuengling distributorship to the Mitchell Companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b652. The Complaint alleged that, under Paragraph 4(d), Anheuser-Busch had the right to purchase Rex's \"ownership interest\n   at the price and on the terms and conditions applicable to such proposed change\" and that Anheuser-Busch \"remains liable to [Rex] for payment of the purchase price.\" For this, Rex was paid $ 47.4 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \u00b653. As to the loss of $ 3.1 million because Yuengling did not consent to the sale to the Mitchell Companies, the Asset Purchase Agreement provided in Section 5.1(d) that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   Consents. Payoff Letters, and Releases Not Obtained at Closing .... If any Supplier other than Anheuser Busch expressly refuses to deliver a Consent ..., or has conditioned consent on conditions that are unacceptable to Purchaser, in Purchaser's sole discretion (in either event a \"Rejection\", and such Brand for which such Supplier has refused to give Consent shall be an \"Excluded Brand\"), then\n   <em>\n    the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the portion of the Purchase Price attributable to such Excluded Brand\n   </em>\n   , and [Adams] shall not be required to sell and Purchaser shall not be required to purchase such Excluded Brand or any Inventory associated with such Excluded Brand, if such third party violates its obligation to pay such purchase price to Wholesaler.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b654. Yuengling did not consent. Under Section 5.1(d) of the Asset Purchase Agreement, \"then the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the portion of the Purchase Price attributable to such Excluded Brand.\" The circuit court was correct to rule, as a matter of law under the Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) standard, that Rex did not have a contractual right to receive the $ 3.1 million that Adams had agreed to pay for the Yuengling distributorship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b655. The circuit court's analysis was correct and should be affirmed. Because this is consistent with the majority's holding, I concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Violation of Beer-Industry-Fair-Dealing-Act Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b656.

Count V of the Complaint alleges,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   [Anheuser-Busch]'s Violation of Beer Industry Fair Dealing Act\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   87. The Mississippi Beer Industry Fair Dealing Act states that a supplier \"shall not interfere with, prevent or unreasonably delay the transfer of the wholesaler's business, including an assignment of wholesaler's rights under the agreement, if the proposed transferee is a designated member, or if the transferee other than a designated member meets such nondiscriminatory, material and reasonable qualifications and standards.\" Miss.

[Anheuser-Busch] had no good cause related to \"nondiscriminatory, material and reasonable qualifications and standards\" to refuse to accept the transfer of Rex's business to Adams. [Anheuser-Busch]'s refusal to accept the transfer of Rex's business to Adams was in bad faith.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   90. As a result of [Anheuser-Busch]'s violation of \u00a7 67-7-13(2), Rex lost the full purchase price of its sales contract with Adams, and incurred damages of at least $ 3. l million.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   91. [Anheuser-Busch] is liable under \u00a7 67-7-21(2) for all damages incurred by Rex as a result of its violation of\n   \u00a7 67-7-13(2) as well as court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   \u00b658. After considering the motion to dismiss, the circuit court ruled,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   Count V alleges Violations of Mississippi's Beer Industry Fair Dealing Act [BIFDA]. It is Rex's position that AB violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2067-7-13\">\n    Miss.

The section states that a supplier \"shall not interfere with, prevent or unreasonably delay the transfer of the wholesaler's business, including an assignment of wholesaler's rights under the agreement, if the proposed transferee is a designated member, or if the transferee other than a designated member meets such nondiscriminatory, material and reasonable qualifications and standards.\" Rex transferred its business to Mitchell under the same terms and conditions that it negotiated with Adams for the AB assets. Yuengling terminated Rex's right to distribute Yuengling products and transferred those assets to another wholesaler. Thus there was no violation of BIFDA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   \u00b659. The majority concludes the circuit court committed reversible error as to this issue. The majority rules that \"BIFDA rendered the match-and-redirect provision null and void, and Anheuser-Busch's demands premised on the void provision may have amounted to unjustified 'interference' with Rex's transfer to Adams ....\" Maj. Op. \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   \u00b660. This finding is in conflict or inconsistent with the majority's findings on Count 1-Breach of Contract.

I agree with the majority that no Mississippi court has interpreted Mississippi Code Section \u00a7 67-7-13(2).

The fact that the Mitchell Companies are engaged in the business of a beer distributorship is not unlawful.

As discussed above, since the circuit court was correct to dismiss Rex's claims against Anheuser-Busch, there is simply no basis to determine that Mitchell's actions were wrongful or unlawful.

Mitchell Beverage\n   lawfully assumed Adams's rights and obligations under the APA. The conclusory allegations do not support that any acts taken pursuant to the assignment or APA were done with an unlawful purpose. Given the failure of the tortious interference claim, there are insufficient allegations to support a conspiracy to tortiously interfere with Rex's contract with Adams.
