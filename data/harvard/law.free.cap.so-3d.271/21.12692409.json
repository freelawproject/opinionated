Atlantic Civil temporarily stored the fill material on land owned by Key Haven. Swift is the managing member of Key Haven. A dispute arose concerning ownership of the fill material, and as a result, Atlantic Civil filed suit against Swift, individually, and Key Haven.

Additionally, the Proposal requires that the \"Defendants will execute a general release\" and that the Proposal \"shall be deemed rejected unless Defendants accept it,\" thereby conditioning settlement on Swift and Key Haven's \"mutual acceptance of the offer and joint action in accordance with its terms.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schantz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7028909\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/60/444/#p446\">\n    60 So.3d at 446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

A joint proposal shall state the amount and terms attributable to each party.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Atlantic Civil argues that Swift possessed the authority to bind Key Haven at least to an amount of $25,000. The fact that Swift had full authority to do so, however, does not relieve the Proposal of its conditional nature. Indeed, Swift's considerations in determining whether to settle the individual claims may be different from those at issue in determining whether to settle on behalf of Key Haven.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    We note that neither of the two exceptions to the rule articulated in\n    <em>\n     Gorka\n    </em>\n    is applicable here. First, as we explained in\n    <em>\n     Pacheco\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Gorka\n    </em>\n    \"does not apply to a proposal for settlement made by multiple offerors to a single offeree.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12679623\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/254/527/\">\n     254 So.3d at 532\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In the instant case, the Proposal was made by a single offeror to joint offerees. Thus, this exception does not apply. The second limitation on\n    <em>\n     Gorka\n    </em>\n    applies when \"a party is alleged to be solely vicariously, constructively, derivatively, or technically liable\" pursuant to rule 1.442(c)(4).\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12679623\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/254/527/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Atlantic Civil does not assert that it is entitled to attorneys' fees pursuant to subdivision (c)(4) of rule 1.442 and a review of the Amended Complaint shows that Atlantic Civil does not allege that Swift or Key Haven is solely vicariously liable.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12679623\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/254/527/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (\"The plain language of rule 1.442(c)(4) limits its application to scenarios where a party's liability is alleged to be solely vicarious or otherwise indirect.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
