The district court did not err in finding there were genuine issues of material fact precluding summary judgment. Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeal is reversed, and the judgment of the district court denying defendants' motion for summary judgment is reinstated. The case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
