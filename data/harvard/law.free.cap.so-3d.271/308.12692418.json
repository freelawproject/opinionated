R.S. 14:95.1, while reserving his right to appeal the trial court's denial of his motion to quash the bill of information. In this appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash the bill of information because he was not convicted of the predicate felony alleged in the bill of information, which is an essential element of the charged offense. Thus, defendant argues the bill of information fails to charge an offense punishable under a valid statute and, accordingly, must be quashed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Upon review of the record and in light of applicable law, we agree. We find that defendant's prior guilty plea, entered pursuant to Georgia's First Offender Act, does not constitute a conviction for purposes of establishing a violation of La. R.S. 14:95.1, as charged in the bill of information in the instant case. Thus, we find the trial court erred as a matter of law in denying defendant's motion to quash the bill of information. For the reasons set forth in further detail below, we reverse the trial court's ruling, grant defendant's motion to quash the bill of information, and vacate and set aside his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 27, 2017, defendant entered a guilty plea to simple robbery in Case Number 14-CR-3008, in Superior Court of Dekalb County, Georgia, under the provisions of Georgia's First Offender Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ga.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2042-8-60\">\n    Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 42-8-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In accordance with the First Offender Act, the trial court withheld an adjudication of guilt and sentenced defendant to three years on probation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subsequently, defendant's probation was transferred to the State of Louisiana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 26, 2018, the State filed a bill of information charging defendant with possession of a firearm by a felon, a violation of La. R.S. 14:95.1, \"having been previously convicted of a felony, namely simple robbery in Case Number 14-CR-3008 in Dekalb County, GA, Superior Court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On that same date, defendant filed a motion to quash the bill of information. Subsequently, defendant appeared for arraignment and entered a plea of not guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 2, 2018, the trial court denied defendant's motion to quash, and, at that time, defendant changed his plea to guilty while reserving his right to appellate review of the trial court's ruling on his motion to quash, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Crosby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   Defendant waived sentencing delays, and the trial court sentenced defendant to five years at hard labor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant initially filed an application for supervisory writs to this Court, seeking\n   review of the trial court's denial of his motion to quash. However, finding that defendant's guilty plea under\n   <em>\n    Crosby\n   </em>\n   was an appealable judgment, this Court denied defendant's writ.\n   <em>\n    State v. Sparks\n   </em>\n   , unpub., 18-0772 (La. App. 4 Cir. 9/26/18). Defendant then filed a motion for an out-of-time appeal, which the trial court granted. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In his sole assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash the bill of information because it fails to charge an offense punishable under a valid statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. C.Cr.P. art. 532(1). Defendant asserts that he was not convicted of the predicate felony alleged in the bill of information, which is essential to establish a violation of the charged offense, La. R.S. 14:95.1, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When a defendant urges a motion to quash the bill of information on the grounds that it fails to charge an offense punishable under a valid statute, the trial court must accept as true the facts contained in the bill of information, and determine as a matter of law and from the face of the pleadings whether a crime has been charged.\n   <em>\n    State v.

R.S. 14:95.1, alleges that he was previously convicted of simple robbery in Case No. 14-CR-3008, in Superior Court of Dekalb County, Georgia. Defendant admits that he was arrested and charged in that case; and he does not dispute that a conviction for that robbery offense would qualify as \"a crime of violence as defined in La. R.S. 14:2(B) which is a felony.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant asserts, however, that he entered a guilty plea in that case under the provisions of Georgia's First Offender Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ga.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2042-8-60\">\n    Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 42-8-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which withholds an adjudication of guilt during the period of probation; and, because his probation was not revoked and an adjudication of guilt was not entered, defendant asserts that he does not have a prior felony conviction for simple robbery in Case No. 14-CR-3008. Defendant therefore argues that his guilty plea from Georgia may not be used as a prior felony conviction for purposes of charging La. R.S. 14:95.1, and that, consequently, the bill of information fails to charge an offense punishable under a valid statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As the plain language of La. R.S. 14:95.1 indicates, the proscription against possession of a firearm applies to any person who has been \"convicted\" of certain felonies. As defined in La. C.Cr.P. art. 934(3), \" 'convicted' means adjudicated guilty after a plea or after trial on the merits.\" Thus, for the bill of information to charge the offense under La. R.S. 14:95.1, defendant must have been adjudicated guilty, and thus convicted, of the alleged predicate felony, under the laws of the state in which the predicate felony was allegedly committed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

In that case, Davis had been sentenced under the First Offender Act to ten years on probation for armed robbery and possession of a firearm. During the period of his first offender probation, Davis was charged and convicted on separate charges of armed robbery and possession of a firearm. Based upon his prior first offender guilty plea, the trial court sentenced Davis to life without parole under the provisions of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ga.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2017-10-7\">\n    Ga.

Code Ann. \u00a7 17-10-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) because he did not stand \"convicted\" on those prior charges. The Georgia Supreme Court agreed, explaining as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   A first offender's guilty plea does not constitute a \"conviction\" as that term is defined in the Criminal Code of Georgia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   ...

Upon a violation of a first offender's terms of probation, the trial court \"may\" enter an adjudication of guilt; it is not obliged to do so. In fact, despite the later conviction, failure of the State to initiate any revocation proceedings against Davis, and failure of the court to revoke the probation, would result in Davis's completion of the probationary period, and his discharge from probation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"400854\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/273/14/\">\n    537 S.E.2d at 665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added).

R.S. 14:95.1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based upon our\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the record and applicable law, we find that the bill of information in this case fails to charge a violation of La. R.S. 14:95.1, because defendant was not convicted of the alleged predicate felony under Georgia law. Therefore, we find that the trial court erred as a matter of law in denying defendant's motion to quash the bill of information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the trial court's ruling and grant defendant's motion to quash the bill of information. Accordingly, defendant's guilty plea, entered pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Crosby\n   </em>\n   , is hereby vacated and set aside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT REVERSED; CONVICTION VACATED AND SET ASIDE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   LEDET, J., CONCURS IN PART\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   LEDET, J., CONCURS IN PART\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   I concur in the majority's decision to vacate Mr. Sparks' conviction and to reverse the district court's judgment granting the motion to quash. Instead of granting Mr. Sparks' motion to quash, I would remand the case to the district court for further proceedings in light of our opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In all other respects, I join the majority opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    The signed plea/disposition explains the \"First Offender/Conditional Discharge\", stating as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n    The Defendant consenting hereto, it is the judgment of the Court that no judgment of guilt be imposed at this time but that further proceedings are deferred and the Defendant is hereby sentenced ...[.] Upon violation of the terms of probation, upon conviction for another crime during the period of probation, or upon the Court's determination that the Defendant is or was not eligible for sentencing under the First Offender Act or for Conditional Discharge, the Court may enter an adjudication of guilt and proceed to sentence the defendant to the maximum sentence as provided by law. Upon fulfillment of the terms of this sentence, or upon release of the Defendant by the Court prior to the termination of this sentence, the Defendant shall stand discharged of said offense without court adjudication of guilt and shall be completely exonerated of guilt of said offense charged.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    The facts underlying the charge against defendant are not pertinent to this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Our review for errors patent reveals that the trial court imposed an illegally lenient sentence by omitting the requirements that defendant's sentence be served without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, as required by La.
