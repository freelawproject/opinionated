Petitioner was charged with failure to return a hired vehicle, a third-degree felony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 817.52(3), Fla. Stat. (2018). The trial court ordered petitioner held without bond following a failure to appear for jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Petitioner argues the trial court failed to make a finding that his failure to appear was willful and that \"no conditions of release can reasonably protect the community from risk of physical harm to persons, assure the presence of the accused at trial, or assure the integrity of the judicial process.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Blair\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7050760\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/39/1190/#p1192\">\n    39 So.3d 1190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1192 (Fla. 2010) (quoting art.

The State, properly and commendably, concedes error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 907.041, Fla. Stat. (2018) ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

This opinion should not be read to limit the ability of the trial court to take additional evidence or impose ancillary conditions on pretrial release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Petition granted.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
