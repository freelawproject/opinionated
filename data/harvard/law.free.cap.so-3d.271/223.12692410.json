For the reasons set forth herein, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Two state agencies jointly regulate the waterways of the Sabine River, which meanders between Louisiana and Texas: the Sabine River Authority, State of Louisiana (\"SRA-L\") and the Sabine River Authority, State of Texas (\"SRA-T\"). The SRA-L and the SRA-T applied for and received a license from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the construction, operation, and maintenance of a large reservoir, the Toledo Bend Dam,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   a spillway, and a hydroelectric plant. In accordance with the provisions of the Federal Power Act (\"FPA\"), 16 USC \u00a7 791a - 828c, FERC may issue licenses for the construction, operation, and maintenance of dams, water conduits, reservoirs, power houses, transmission lines, or other project works necessary or convenient for the development and improvement of navigation and for the development, transmission, and utilization of power across, along, from, or in any of the streams or other bodies of water over which Congress has jurisdiction. 16 USC 797(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs are all owners of property located in Louisiana in Vernon Parish or Beauregard Parish near the Sabine River, downstream from the Toledo Bend Dam. Defendant, the SRA-L, is an agency and instrumentality of the State of Louisiana. La. R.S. 38:2324(A). In March 2017, plaintiffs filed a Petition for Compensation for Taking of Property, in which they alleged that the erection of the Toledo Bend Dam by the SRA-L caused significant changes to the Sabine River, downstream from the dam, and that those changes to the river increased the risk of flooding in the property near the Sabine River. Plaintiffs alleged that the changes to the river caused catastrophic flooding in the watershed below the Toledo Bend Dam on March 10, 2016, including plaintiffs' properties, and that their properties will continue to flood in the future due to the changes to the river. Plaintiffs contend that the SRA-L's actions causing changes to the river and the resultant flooding constituted a taking of their property without formal expropriation proceedings and without just compensation, in violation of Article I, \u00a7 4 of the Louisiana Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 24, 2017, the SRA-L filed a Notice of Removal to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana, alleging federal question jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 825p\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   . Thereafter, the SRA-L\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' petition, and the plaintiffs filed a motion to remand the matter to the state court. The United States District Court concluded that federal jurisdiction did not exist in this case under either \u00a7 1331 or \u00a7 825p and remanded the matter to the state court. The United States District Court also denied the SRA-L's Motion to Dismiss as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following remand, the SRA-L filed a peremptory exception raising the objections of no cause of action and nonjoinder of a party. After a hearing, the trial court concluded that plaintiffs' suit is preempted under federal law and granted the SRA-L's exception of no cause of action. Because the court dismissed plaintiffs' suit with prejudice for failure to state a cause of action, the exception of nonjoinder was denied as moot. Plaintiffs appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The purpose of an exception raising the objection of no cause of action is to determine the sufficiency in law of the petition.

Const. Art. I, \u00a7 4 and La. R.S. 13:5111\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   are as follows: the SRA-L's construction of the Toledo Bend Dam caused significant changes to the Sabine River, downstream from the dam, which changes caused an increased risk of flooding in the property near the river. The changes to the river resulting from the erection of the dam caused catastrophic flash flooding in the watershed below the Toledo Bend Dam on March 10, 2016, including the property belonging to the plaintiffs. The Toledo Bend Dam was constructed for a public purpose, including providing recreation, irrigation, and flood control for the area. The modification of the watershed so as to cause flooding constituted a taking, in a constitutional sense, of plaintiffs' property by causing increased flooding in the past, which will continue to occur in the future, preventing the plaintiffs from using their properties to their highest and best use and diminishing the value of the properties. No compensation was ever paid for the taking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The SRA-L's exception argued that plaintiffs' petition failed to state a cause of action because their state law claim for inverse condemnation is preempted by the FPA, and is otherwise an impermissible collateral attack on the final and unappealable licensing orders issued by FERC. In concluding that plaintiffs' petition failed to state a cause of action, the trial court reasoned that \"everything concerned with the causation and liability associated with this [\"]taking[\"] falls within federally-perempted [sic] matters.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in concluding that their claim was federally preempted \"after the federal court specifically found that there was no federal question presented by this case,\" and remanded the matter to state court. However, even where a suit is remanded to state court for lack of federal subject matter jurisdiction, the state law claim may nevertheless be preempted by federal law. See\n   <strong>\n    Giles v. NYLCare Health Plans, Inc.,\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11624449\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/172/332/#p337\">\n    172 F.3d 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 337 (5th Cir. 1999). The presence of conflict preemption does not establish federal question jurisdiction. Rather than transmogrifying a state cause of action into a federal one-as occurs with complete preemption-conflict preemption serves as a defense to a state action. In such a case, the federal court, being without removal jurisdiction, cannot resolve the dispute regarding preemption;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   it lacks the power to do anything other than remand to the state court where the preemption issue can be addressed and resolved.\n   <strong>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11624449\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/172/332/#p337\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   In this case, the United States District Court remanded plaintiffs' suit to the state court due to a lack of federal question jurisdiction, which prevented the United States District Court from determining the issue of preemption. This does not equate to a finding that the claim is not preempted. Thus, the issue before us is simply whether the plaintiffs' state law claim for the inverse condemnation of their property by the SRA-L is preempted by federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Federal preemption is based on the Supremacy Clause, which provides that federal law shall be the supreme Law of the Land.

Because operators typically avoid acting in a manner that will expose them to liability, state law claims for damages arising out of the operation of a FERC-licensed dam have just as much potential to change the manner in which a dam is operated as do claims for injunctive relief. Thus, where a property damage claim based in state law alleges damage as a result of the licensee \"negligently\" operating in compliance with a FERC license, the state property damage claim is preempted, because FERC (not state tort law) must set the appropriate duty of care for licensees.\n   <strong>\n    Simmons,\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3710094\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/732/469/#p473\">\n    732 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   476-77 ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20803\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (requiring licensees to conform to FERC's rules and regulations).

The petition\n   merely alleges that the construction of the Toledo Bend Dam caused significant changes to the Sabine River downstream from the dam, which increased the risk of flooding on plaintiffs' properties, resulting in a taking without just compensation. Section 803(c) specifically preserves such state law claims. Assuming plaintiffs are able to prove all of the elements of their inverse condemnation claim and receive compensation for the taking of their property under the Louisiana Constitution and La. R.S. 13:5111, we cannot see how this would interfere with FERC's operational control or stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of the FPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Although the SRA-L argues that in order for plaintiffs to prevail on their inverse condemnation claim, the trial court would have to disregard FERC's determination that the project did not result in an increased risk of flooding downstream; we are limited when reviewing an objection of no cause of action to the well-pleaded facts of the petition (and any documents annexed thereto), which must be accepted as true.\n   <strong>\n    City of New Orleans,\n   </strong>\n   93-0690 at p. 2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7450255\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/640/237/\">\n    640 So.2d at 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
