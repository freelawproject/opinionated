For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In August of 1998, Francois was sentenced to thirty years in state prison after being convicted of two counts of armed robbery. The crimes were committed when Francois was seventeen years old. In August of 2017, Francois moved the trial court for relief under\n   <em>\n    Graham v. Florida\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    560 U.S. 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010),\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Alabama\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    567 U.S. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    183 L.Ed.2d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012), and their Florida progeny. Francois argued that because the sentence imposed was for crimes committed when he was a juvenile, he is entitled to have his sentenced reviewed pursuant to sections 775.082, 921.1401, and 921.1402, Florida Statutes (2017). After a response from the State, the trial court summarily denied Francois's motion finding it to be legally insufficient and successive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We affirm the trial court's denial of relief, albeit on other grounds. Francois was sentenced to serve thirty years in state prison. The State asserts that Francois is \"guaranteed release at the age of forty seven.\" Under these circumstances, Francois has failed to prove a\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    / Miller\n   </em>\n   violation that would entitle him to the benefits of the new juvenile sentencing law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hart v.

In the Notice, Hart acknowledged that the remedy he had sought was a resentencing pursuant to\n    <em>\n     Graham\n    </em>\n    , among others, and pursuant to section 921.1401(2), Florida Statutes (2017) (enacted as part of chapter 2014-220). Hart further noted that the Fourth District had affirmed the denial of his 3.800(a) motion without prejudice to Hart filing a rule 3.800(a) motion to correct an illegal sentence if his sentence violated\n    <em>\n     Heggs v.

Hart was ultimately resentenced to twenty years' imprisonment and released during the pendency of his appeal, which resulted in his filing of the Notice. On November 27, 2018, the Florida Supreme Court recognized Hart's Notice and dismissed his appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
