For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the statements forming the basis for Allen's action are cloaked in absolute immunity, thus we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2013, Allen, then a faculty member at Miami-Dade College (\"MDC\"), collaborated with four other MDC professors, including Santelises, to write a book entitled \"The Freedom to Communicate.\" Early the following year, Allen alleged she discovered plagiarism within the book and the matter was reported to MDC's Office of Academic and Student Affairs. MDC placed Allen and her co-authors on notice that it intended to investigate the plagiarism accusations. In August of the same year, MDC concluded its investigation and\n   determined the allegations were unsubstantiated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Shortly thereafter, two of Allen's co-authors, Adam Vellone and Cherie Cannon, filed charges of discrimination and harassment against Allen, pursuant to MDC's administrative grievance process, with MDC's Office of Equal Opportunity Programs/ADA, Title IX Director, Joy Ruff, Ph.D. In the charges, Vellone and Cannon alleged that Allen directed hostile, discriminatory, and retaliatory acts at several MDC professors, including themselves and the other co-authors of \"The Freedom to Communicate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ruff initiated an administrative investigation of the complaints, in accord with the grievance procedure delineated in MDC's Procedure Manual. During the investigation, Santelises was identified by the complainants as a material witness. Ruff interviewed Santelises regarding his observations. At the conclusion of her investigation, Ruff determined the charges of discrimination and retaliation were substantiated and Allen was eventually terminated from her employment with MDC. Following the termination, Allen filed the instant suit, alleging the interview responses provided by Santelises in the grievance investigation were slanderous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Santelises filed a motion for final summary judgment, alleging three bases for the application of absolute immunity: (1) the statements were made during an administrative investigation; (2) Santelises was required to participate in the investigation by MDC; and (3) the statements made were in the course and scope of Santelises's duties as a professor at MDC. The trial court granted final summary judgment. This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"A trial court's entry of a final summary judgment is reviewed\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Burton v.
