Andrew L. Ward sued Illinois Central Railroad Company on behalf of Larry Seward. Ward alleged that Illinois Central breached its duty of care and failed to provide Seward with a safe place to work, allegedly causing Seward's brain cancer. Illinois Central filed a motion for summary judgment based on a previous settlement and release that Seward had entered into with Illinois Central before his death. The trial court granted Illinois Central's motion for summary judgment. Ward appealed the trial court's grant of summary judgment. The Court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62. Larry Seward worked for Illinois Central Railroad Company from 1961 to 2004. In 2005, Seward settled an asbestosis claim with Illinois Central. He subsequently developed and passed away from anaplastic oligodendroglioma, a type of brain cancer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63. In 2012, Andrew L. Ward sued Illinois Central on behalf of Seward. Ward alleged that Illinois Central breached its duty of care and failed to provide Seward with a safe place to work. The complaint detailed specific issues with the work environment, including Seward's exposure to chemicals and hazardous conditions. The complaint alleged that the working environment\n   \"caused, in whole or in part,\" Seward's brain cancer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64. Illinois Central filed a motion for summary judgment based on the settlement and release that Seward signed in 2005. The 2005 settlement was due to an asbestos-related illness. In pertinent part, the release provided,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [T]he Undersigned alleges [that Releasees (Illinois Central) ] created an exposure or exposures to asbestos, coal, coal dust, welding fumes, brass fumes, diesel fumes, dust, paint vapors, fuel fumes, methyl bromide, ammonia gas, sand, silica, Dow Clean, solvents, cleaners, degreasers, and other fumes, dusts, mists, gases, and vapors from any material, chemical, toxin or other agent. The Undersigned asserts that such exposure caused a condition, injury, disease and/or deficiency (hereinafter, referred to as \"condition\") in the Undersigned including, but not limited to plaques, calcifications, thickening, pneumoconiosis including asbestosis and silicosis, severe and permanent injuries to the lungs, respiratory system, nerves and/or nervous system, cancer, and any and all other conditions, diseases or injuries existing prior to the date of this Release Agreement which are known to the Undersigned or reasonably could have been known prior to the date of this Release Agreement and which may further develop in the future as a result of what now exists, arising from or as a result of the alleged exposures or which may further develop as a result of the Undersigned's current known or unknown conditions, which allegedly developed over time while working in one or more of the Releasees employ, which are expressly released herein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the process of making the settlement, Illinois Central asked Seward to fill out its \"Pulmonary Questionnaire.\" The pulmonary questionnaire asked Seward to \"[p]lease check all chemicals you allege exposures from while employed at Illinois Central.\" Seward placed an \"x\" or a check mark next to asbestos, diesel exhaust, silica, solvents, degreasers, coal, chemicals and weed spray. He also checked that he had been diagnosed with asbestosis, bronchitis and pneumonia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65. Ward presented the testimony of Robert Peirce Jr. Peirce was Seward's attorney at the time of the 2005 settlement and release. Peirce's affidavit stated that \"Mr. Seward and myself were unaware that Mr. Seward has suffered exposures to chemical which would ultimately cause him to contract primary brain cancer ....\" Peirce further provided that he \"did not negotiate or obtain any monies from Illinois Central Railroad Company to compensate Mr. Seward for anything other than his lung injury\" and if he \"[h]ad known that Mr. Seward would subsequently develop anaplastic oligodemdroglioma or any other occupational cancer not listed in the Complaint or Release [he] would have demanded additional compensation for Mr. Seward.\" Peirce also provided the following deposition testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Q. You agree with me that these questionnaires ask about exposure beyond asbestos to each of these individuals; correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   A. No, I don't agree with that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Q. What do you think the purpose of question 3A is?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   A. It says check all the chemicals you allege exposure from while employed at Illinois Central.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Q. So do you think they're looking for exposures beyond just asbestos in answer to that question?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Q. What do you think they're looking for?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   A. I think they're looking for asbestos exposure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Q. Is it your position the railroad didn't want to know that they were exposed to diesel exhaust, they just wanted to know if they were exposed to asbestos?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A. No. But I believe exposure to diesel exhaust could be a contributing force in asbestosis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Q. How is that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A. Well, I think that some people believe that exposure to diesel exhaust can cause asbestosis or asbestosis-related diseases. So that's probably why it was included in there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b66. The trial court granted Illinois Central's motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court concluded that \"[t]he Plaintiff has failed to provide any evidence that would create a question of fact as to whether Mr. Seward did not contemplate (or otherwise have the opportunity to contemplate) the risks of his exposure to the above-listed toxins when he settled his prior claims.\" Ward appealed the trial court's grant of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF THE ISSUE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b67.

Courts around the country have adopted different approaches to interpreting Section 5 of the FELA. In\n   <em>\n    Wicker\n   </em>\n   , the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit stated that \"[t]o the extent that a release chronicles the scope and duration of the known risks, it would supply strong evidence in support of the release defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Wicker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"219405\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/142/690/#p696\">\n    142 F.3d at 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Illinois Central Railroad Co. v.

Ward argues that the trial court overlooked the existence of the affidavit and the deposition testimony of Peirce, Seward's attorney. Ward concludes that Peirce's testimony makes Seward's intent a fact-intensive inquiry. Further, Ward argues that the determination of whether the release was boilerplate is also a jury issue. On the other hand, Illinois Central compares this case to\n   <em>\n    Acuff\n   </em>\n   and argues that summary judgment was appropriate. Illinois Central points to the release and to the pulmonary questionnaire and states that they are \"limited to specific known risks.\" Further, Illinois Central states that Peirce's testimony was \"immaterial and insufficient to create a material issue of fact in light of the other undisputed evidence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b612. Here, under\n   <em>\n    Acuff\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Wicker\n   </em>\n   , the inquiry is two-fold. The Court considers whether the release at issue is boilerplate and whether the risk of developing brain cancer was known and contemplated by Seward at the time he signed the release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b613. Notably,\n   <em>\n    Wicker\n   </em>\n   explained the importance of allowing parties the right to quantify and limit future liabilities. It stated that \"the parties may want to settle controversies about potential liability and damages related to known risks even if there is no present manifestation of injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Wicker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"219405\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/142/690/#p696\">\n    142 F.3d at 700-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, although\n   <em>\n    Wicker\n   </em>\n   supported the use of releases, it also qualified the power of the release, stating,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   But we are wary of making the validity of the release turn on the writing alone because of the ease in writing detailed boiler plate [sic] agreements; draft releases might well include an extensive catalog of every chemical and hazard\n   known to railroad employment. For this reason, we think the written release should not be conclusive. We recognize that what is involved is a fact-intensive process, but trial courts are competent to make these kinds of determinations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"219405\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/142/690/#p696\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"219405\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/142/690/#p696\">\n    at 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The\n   <em>\n    Wicker\n   </em>\n   Court differentiated between releases that \"recite a series of generic hazards to which [the employee] might have been exposed\" and releases that provide \"specific risks the employees faced during the course of their employment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"219405\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/142/690/#p696\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b614.

Similar to\n   <em>\n    Acuff\n   </em>\n   , the analysis was fact-intensive, and the trial judge sat as the finder of fact.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12648250\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/803/346/#p352\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12648250\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/803/346/#p352\">\n    at 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b619.

The\n   <em>\n    Sinclair\n   </em>\n   Court considered the lack of specificity within the release, stating that \"the release does not even specifically mention exposure to manganese poisoning at all.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60. The court then denied summary judgment, concluding that \"the language of the release in this case is not sufficient to show an absence of a genuine issue of material fact ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b620. The Court now turns to the specific language of this release which it states,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   The Undersigned asserts that such exposure caused a condition, injury, disease and/or deficiency (hereinafter, referred to as \"condition\") in the Undersigned including, but not limited to plaques, calcifications, thickening, pneumoconiosis including asbestosis and silicosis, severe and permanent injuries to the lungs, respiratory system, nerves and/or nervous system,\n   <em>\n    cancer\n   </em>\n   , and any and all other conditions, diseases or injuries existing prior to the date of this Release Agreement which are known to the Undersigned or reasonably could have been known prior to the date of this Release Agreement and which may further develop in the future as a result of what now exists ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Turning to our summary-judgment standard, the question is whether \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, ... show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Miss. R. Civ. P. 56(c). Here, the parties disagree on whether Peirce's testimony creates a genuine issue of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b621. The first question is whether the language is boilerplate. Although the release does not address the development of anaplastic oligodemdroglioma, it does clearly provide for the release of cancer. No dispute exists that anaplastic oligodemdroglioma is a type of cancer. Like in\n   <em>\n    Blackwell\n   </em>\n   , although the exact name of the illness was not listed on the release, the illness provided is still sufficiently specific.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blackwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4328552\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/220/113/\">\n    102 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   873 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wicker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"219405\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/142/690/#p696\">\n    142 F.3d at 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (upholding releases that provide \"specific risks the employees faced during the course of their employment\"). Peirce did not testify regarding whether the release's language was boilerplate. While the dissent maintains that Seward's release is not distinguishable from the releases in\n   <em>\n    Wicker\n   </em>\n   as far as an inclusive list of chemical exposures and diseases are concerned, Seward's release is more specific and limited than the\n   <em>\n    Wicker\n   </em>\n   releases. Diss. \u00b630. The releases in\n   <em>\n    Wicker\n   </em>\n   released the railroad from injuries \"known or unknown\" and, in Wicker's release, \"foreseen or unforeseen.\"\n   <em>\n    Wicker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"219405\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/142/690/#p696\">\n    142 F.3d at 693-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Also, if they included any list of exposures at all, the exposures in the releases were phrased in generic, broad terms.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"219405\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/142/690/#p696\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In contrast, Seward released Illinois Central from known and specific injuries and conditions as well as those \"which may further develop in the future as a result of what now exists, arising from or as a result of the alleged exposures,\" which had been listed in the release in specific detail. Therefore, the Court holds that the\n   release was sufficiently specific and that it was not boilerplate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b622. The second question is whether the risk of developing cancer was known and contemplated by Seward at the time he signed the release. While Seward may not specifically have known he would develop anaplastic oligodemdroglioma, as stated above, cancer was clearly and specifically listed on the release. Further, Ward's complaint provides that Seward was exposed to diesel exhaust and additional chemicals and alleges that they \"caused, in whole or in part,\" Seward's brain cancer. The release lists exposure to diesel fumes and provides a list of additional chemicals. Also, Seward checked exposure to diesel exhaust and chemicals on the pulmonary questionnaire. The release and the pulmonary questionnaire illustrate that Seward was on notice of the risk of suffering from cancer due to the listed exposures, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Sinclair\n   </em>\n   , in which the release did not specifically mention exposure to manganese poisoning.\n   <em>\n    Sinclair\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3404230\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/347/395/\">\n    200 P.3d at 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, Seward signed the release after his employment with Illinois Central had ended. Therefore, this suit cannot be due to an exposure to chemical or diesel fumes to which Seward had not already been exposed in 2005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b623. Peirce's after-the-fact testimony fails to change the specific language of the release and fails to affect the additional information and intent evidence illustrated by the pulmonary questionnaire. Thus, we hold that Peirce's testimony fails to create a genuine issue of material fact. Seward was on notice of the risk of cancer, including brain cancer, at the time he signed the release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b624.

I would find that a proper application of the standard yields a different conclusion: that genuine issues of material fact most certainly are present in this case. The majority finds no genuine issues of material fact on whether the release was boilerplate, because Peirce did not testify that it was boilerplate, and because the release is somewhat more specific than the releases in\n   <em>\n    Wicker\n   </em>\n   . With respect to the majority, the absence of testimony from Peirce is irrelevant because the release\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   provides sufficient evidence to enable a reasonable fact finder to conclude the release was boilerplate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The release contains a laundry list of chemical exposures and diseases typical of boilerplate contractual language. In that respect, it is similar to the releases found to be boilerplate in\n   <em>\n    Wicker\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Wicker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"219405\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/142/690/#p696\">\n    142 F.3d at 693-94, 701-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Yet the majority usurps the fact finder role on this issue and deems the release not boilerplate as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b631. The majority then finds no genuine issue of material fact that Seward contemplated his risk of brain cancer when he executed the release, ascribing great importance to the fact that the release listed \"cancer\" as one of the released conditions. The majority then reasons, \"[w]hile Seward may not specifically have known he would develop anaplastic oligodendroglioma, ... cancer was clearly and specifically listed on the release.\" Maj. Op. \u00b6 22. But the release lists \"cancer\" as an existing condition, not as a future condition for which Seward specifically waived liability should he develop it some time after signing the release. The release says that \"any such exposure caused ... cancer, and any and all other conditions, diseases or injuries existing\n   <em>\n    prior to\n   </em>\n   the date of this Release Agreement\n   <em>\n    which are known\n   </em>\n   to[Seward] and which may further develop in the future as a result of what now exists ....\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, an accurate reading of the release shows that it listed \"cancer\" as an existing condition; future\n   conditions effectively were unlimited and included anything \"which may further develop in the future as a result of what now exists.\" There is no dispute that Seward was not diagnosed with brain cancer until after he had signed the release; thus, the brain cancer could have been released only if listed in the category of future claims. This release, most assuredly, did not do that; it did not specifically list cancer, let alone brain cancer, as a potential future claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b632. Even assuming that Seward should have been expected to foresee from his waiver of an existing cancer claim that he also was waiving a future cancer claim, the term \"cancer\" is extremely broad, encompassing a multitude of things from melanoma, a skin condition, to lung cancer, to Seward's primary brain cancer.\n   <em>\n    Wicker\n   </em>\n   held that a release, to be effective, must recite the \"\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   known risk or malady.\"\n   <em>\n    Wicker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"219405\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/142/690/#p696\">\n    142 F.3d at 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). A reasonable fact finder could conclude that the release signed by Seward lacked the requisite specificity to attribute to him an intent to waive a future claim that the chemicals to which he was exposed at Illinois Central gave him brain cancer. This is especially true considering Peirce's averment that he thought the release was limited to Seward's lung injury, that he did not discuss the risk of brain cancer with Seward before Seward signed the release, and that he was unaware that Seward had been exposed to chemicals that carried a risk of brain cancer. The majority finds that, because the release and pulmonary questionnaire listed some of the same chemicals that Ward now alleges caused Seward's brain cancer, no genuine issues of material fact exist that Seward was on notice of the risk of developing brain cancer from those exposures. But because nothing shows that Seward knew that exposure to any of those chemicals carried a risk of brain cancer, I reject that analysis and would allow the fact finder to make the determination of what Seward knew when he signed the release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b633. The majority relies on two cases that found summary judgment was warranted based on the employee's waiver of a known risk. In\n   <em>\n    Jaqua v. Canadian National Railroad, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3462943\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich-app/274/540/\">\n    274 Mich.App. 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=734%20N.W.2d%20228\">\n    734 N.W.2d 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007), much more evidence was presented than was addressed here that the employee knew of the specific risk before signing the release. The employee had signed a release similar to the release in this case; he released all claims for existing cancer and for diseases that \"may further develop in the future as a result of what now exists.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=734%20N.W.2d%20228\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=734%20N.W.2d%20228\">\n    at 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court of Appeals of Michigan adopted\n   <em>\n    Wicker\n   </em>\n   's known-risk approach and found that summary judgment was appropriate on a lung cancer claim brought by the employee's estate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 555-56,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=734%20N.W.2d%20228\">\n    734 N.W.2d 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Critically, it was undisputed that, before the employee had signed the release, his physician had informed him that he was at risk of developing lung cancer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 542,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=734%20N.W.2d%20228\">\n    734 N.W.2d 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . No such information was given to Seward in advance of his signing the release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b634. And in\n   <em>\n    Blackwell v. CSX Transportation, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4328552\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/220/113/\">\n    220 Md.App. 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4328552\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/220/113/\">\n    102 A.3d 864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), the release itself was much more specific than the release at issue here. The release provided that Blackwell \"release[d] and forever discharge[d]\" the employer from liability from a claim that he had been exposed to \"repetitive stress and cumulative trauma [that] allegedly caused [him] to suffer knee injuries and other injuries, disorders, or diseases of the lower extremities.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 866 (third and fourth alterations in original). And the release provided that a substantial portion of the consideration paid to Blackwell had been to compensate him for \"the possibility of ... the development of any new or additional\n   repetitive stress or cumulative trauma injury either presently existing or that may arise in the future to the lower extremities or other body parts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Blackwell had consulted with counsel before signing the release.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, when Blackwell developed bilateral plantar fasciitis, a foot condition that he claimed had been caused by repetitive trauma on the job, the court found that the injury specifically was covered by the language of the release.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 873. Unlike in this case, the release in\n   <em>\n    Blackwell\n   </em>\n   was quite specific and was tailored to cover the exact kind of injury that Blackwell later claimed had arisen from his job duties, namely, a repetitive stress injury to the lower extremities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b635. I find that genuine issues of material fact exist on whether the release signed by Larry Seward was boilerplate and whether at the time Seward signed the release he knew and contemplated the risk that his chemical exposures would culminate in brain cancer. Therefore, I would reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court of DeSoto County and would remand the case for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   KING, P.J., JOINS THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    <em>\n     Boilerplate\n    </em>\n    refers to a standard form contract containing generic language.\n    <em>\n     Wallace v.
