The motion, while purportedly seeking to correct an illegal sentence, was instead an attack on both the conviction\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   the sentence. A motion under rule 3.800(a) is not available where, as here, the defendant seeks to challenge the validity of the conviction (and, by extension, the \"legality\" of the sentence).\n   <em>\n    Lopez v.

Planas could have and should have raised the instant claim on direct appeal from his conviction and sentence or, if appropriate, by a timely motion filed pursuant to Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Affirmed.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
