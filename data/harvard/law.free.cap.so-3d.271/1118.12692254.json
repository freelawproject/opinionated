On November 9, 2018, in accordance with the mailbox rule, appellant filed his relevant notice of appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The notice of appeal incorrectly states the lower court rendered the order appealed on October 10, 2018. Applying Florida Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.020(h),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   we determine the lower court rendered the order under appeal on September 28, 2018, as the trial court's signed, written order denying the motion to correct illegal sentence was filed with the lower court clerk on that date. We reach this conclusion based on the lower court clerk's filing stamp, dated September 28, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Because the notice of appeal was filed more than 30 days after rendition of the order, this court is without appellate jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fla. R. App. P. 9.110(b) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850(k). Thus, we dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction, without prejudice for the filing of a petition for belated appeal pursuant to Florida Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.141(c).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Watkins v.
