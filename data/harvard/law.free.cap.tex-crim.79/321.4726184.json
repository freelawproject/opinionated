The objection was directed at that portion of the testimony in which he said: \u201cI could not limit</p>\n<p id=\"b335-18\">my knowledge of the reputation of this house as just since the defendant began working. It has been disorderly for a long time.\u201d As the testimony shows the reputation of the house was disorderly when appellant began working there and so continued all the time he was connected with it, the bill presents no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-19\">The court did not err in refusing to give peremptory instructions to acquit, as we think the testimony would justify a conviction. The reputation of the house was shown to be a house where prostitutes resorted and resided. Harold Buster testified that the reputation of the three women he saw at this hotel was bad, \u2014 that they we-re common prostitutes \u2014 that he had seen at least one of them in the reservation at Lillian Hall\u2019s. Lewis Scott testified he was porter at the Royal Hotel, and that appellant told him, \u201cIf I found anyone that wanted a woman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>up there, to send them to him.\u201d Ed Carnes testified that he secured a room at this hotel, and said to the porter, Lewis Scott, that he was going down to the reservation to see the girls, when the porter replied, \u201cBoss, we have got any kind of girls you want at the hotel\u201d; the porter took him to his room, and in about twenty minutes a girl opened the door and came in.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
