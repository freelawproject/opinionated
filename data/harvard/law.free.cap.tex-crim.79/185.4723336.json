This is the second appeal, the opinion on the former appeal being reported in 77 Texas Crim. Rep., 300, 178 S. W. Rep., 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The case on the former appeal was reversed because the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction. The State on this trial developed its case more fully, and the prosecutrix testified to many additional facts. On direct examination this time she testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">\u201cMy name is Maggie Davis. On the 28th of November, 1912, I was twenty years old. I know the defendant. He used to come to see me. I have been knowing him all my life. We have been raised together; played together when we were children. He had been coming to see me about two years before November, 1912. He came as my regular suitor. He went out in- public with me, to church and singings and parties, and called on me at my house. He courted me. He proposed marriage to me, at my home, about six months before November, 1912. We became engaged at that time. He had mentioned marriage to me before that; about a month before, and I did not accept him then, but we became engaged about six months before the 28th of November, 1912. The defendant went with me continuously after he became engaged to me.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">\u201cI was with defendant on the night of November 28, 1912. We went to a little entertainment that night at his brother\u2019s. The defendant came to my house after me. Going over there the defendant tried to get me to' show him a good time. He put his arm around me. He took me home that night after the entertainment. Just as soon as we left the party he began to insist on me showing him a good time, and he begged me until we got about a'mile of home, and he promised that he would marry me if I would show him a good time. He says, \u2018You know we intend to marry, and what will this amount to ?\u2019 And he kept on begging me to show him a good time, that he was a man of his word and knew that he -would marry me, and so I submitted to him. We were in the buggy when I submitted to him. I mean, he had sexual intercourse with me.' I believed at that time we would become man and wife. I would not have submitted to him if I had not thought that, and if he had not promised it. That operation gave me pain. The defendant and I were sweethearts when we were boy and girl together.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">\u201cAfter that occurrence I next saw the defendant Christmas' week. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>He came down to our house to use our telephone. I didn\u2019t talk to him of my condition. I afterwards told him of my condition, on the 13th of January, at my house. I reminded him of his promise at that time. He said he would see me out, that he would fill his promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u201cI bore a child by the defendant. He is the father of the child I bore.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u201cAfter I talked to the defendant, on the occasion last mentioned, I next saw him in about two weeks, I guess; something like that. He was at our house at that time, after water.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\u201cI saw the defendant at Hamilton\u2019s. That was in February if I am not mistaken. I told him then about my condition. He said, T will see you out.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">\u201cI made preparations to get married to the defendant. I did part of my sewing, and my sister helped me, my sister, Etta Stewart. The defendant never did marry me.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">\u201cAbout a month before the child was born the defendant, Wilburn Gleason, refused to marry me. He was at our house and I reminded him of it and asked him what he was going to do and he said, \u2018Nothing.\u2019 He said he wasn\u2019t going to do anything; that I could go to hell or any other damn place I wanted to. Before that he had at all times said he would carry out his promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">\u201cAt the time I had intercourse with the defendant in the buggy I was not married to him nor to anyone. This act of intercourse that I have testified about, with the defendant, took place in Jack County, State of Texas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">By reading this evidence and her evidence on the former trial, quoted in the opinion on the first appeal, it will be seen she testifies to many facts and circumstances which go to make a case of seduction that she did not testify to on the first trial. In the first case, from her testimony, it would appear that the promise of marriage took place at the time of the alleged .act of intercourse. On this trial she testifies that they had been engaged some six months prior thereto, and appellant had been coming to see her and courting her for two years next preceding the date of the alleged act of intercourse. Such additional facts furnish grounds for her reliance on his promise, and that she was led array from the path of virtue by the deceitful promises, acts and conduct of appellant. Young people who have associated together from childhood and who while children are \u201csweethearts,\u201d as she testifies in this instance, ordinarily trust each other and place more reliance in promises made than they do in a person whom they have only casually met since becoming grown. If appellant had been \u201ccourting\u201d the girl for \"two years; became engaged to marry her some six months prior to the first act of intercourse, the fact she testified she yielded \"to him because of the promise of marriage, and but for such relation existing she would not have yielded to him, does not raise the issue of \u201cbarter and sale,\u201d where other facts are detailed as the prosecutrix details them on this trial. It is only in cases where no previous relations existed that would suggest love and confidence existed, if she yielded solely in consideration of the man telling her he will marry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>her if she will yield to him that such an issue can arise, hfo such state of case is presented on this trial. The evidence on the former trial, not being fully developed, did present such a state of case, but, as before said, the case was more fully developed on this trial, and this led appellant to give the girl a most severe and rigid cross-examination as to what she had sworn to on the former trial; that she had not testified to him courting her for two years prior to the alleged act, and had not testified to the engagement to marry being of six months standing at that time. This cross-examination might not in and of itself have authorized the State to support the girl by proof of prior statements made before the date of the alleged act of intercourse, but where appellant introduced her testimony on the former trial to impeach her as to a prior existing promise of marriage, then the State could support her testimony and prove by the mother that some two or three months prior to the alleged act of intercourse the witness had told her about she and appellant being engaged to be married. Whenever the opposite side seeks to impeach a witness as to any statement material to the case, then the party calling the witness can support the witness by proving that she had made statements consistent with her testimony on the trial, prior to the time any occasion had arisen for her to testify falsely. This rule of law also renders admissible the testimony of Mrs. Etta Stewart, who testified she helped the prosecutrix in making her wedding clothes. This testimony supported the girl that an engagement to marry existed prior to the date of the alleged. seduction, and appellant having sought to impeach her on that issue, she could be supported.

Rep., 463; Mitchell v. State, 36 Texas Crim. Rep., 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">A number of questions to the prosecuting witness such as, \u201cState whether or not you loved the defendant ?\u201d \u201cState whether or not you would have submitted to the defendant that night if you had not loved him?\u201d were objected to by appellant as leading. Under the record in this case it was not improper to permit such questions to be propounded. Hinman v. State, 59 Texas Crim. Rep., 29, 127 S. W. Rep., 221; Fine v. State,'81 S. W. Rep., 723; Snodgrass v. State, 36 Texas Crim. Rep., 207. And after Miss Davis had testified to meeting appellant several times after she became aware she was pregnant and he always promised that,he would carry out his promise and marry her, it was not improper to permit her to testify that.shortly before the birth of the baby, appellant was at her home, and at that time said he was not going to marry her, and \u201cthat she could go to hell or any other damn place,\u201d and then fled the country and was gone for some six or eight months.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Walter Hamilton was testifying to a conversation he had with ap- \u2022 pellant, and appellant objected to the witness stating what he, witness, said to appellant. As.it was necessary to render intelligible the statements of appellant on that occasion, the court committed no error in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>permitting the entire conversation to he testified to. On that occasion appellant when asked if he \u201cused any preventative or anything to protect the girl, appellant said he didn\u2019t \u2014 he took it straight.\u201d This expression would not be intelligible without the entire connection being stated, but when the whole conversation is related it amounts to a confession of illicit intercourse. Likewise the statement of appellant when he said, \u201che-Avould not mind marrying her if he could get a divorce\u2014 if he would not have to live with her. He said if he had to marry her and live with her he would rather go to the pen.\u201d This statement, when read in the light of the entire conversation, amounted to an admission that he felt legally obligated to marry the girl and is corroborative of her statement that an engagement to marry existed between the parties. Davis v. State, 3 Texas Crim. App., 91; Stockman v. State, 24 Texas Crim. App., 387; Gaither v. State, 21 Texas Crim. App., 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">As in bill Ho. 9 it is not stated what the answer of Dr. Key would have been to the question propounded, the bill is incomplete, and presents nothing for review. The testimony expected to he elicited must always be shown and that it is as to some material fact in the past.. Hay v. State, 25 Texas Crim. App., 114; Schoenfeldt v. State, 30 Texas. Crim. App., 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">As defendant introduced Tom Allen as a witness on this trial and the said witness testified to a state of facts material to his defense, it was not improper to permit witnesses to testify that they had talked with Allen at the former trial and he had then stated he knew nothing derogatory to Miss Davis, the prosecuting witness. On this trial he testified to a very damaging state of facts, which if believed would have a material tendency to show that she was not a virtuous and chaste female, and it was proper to permit testimony to be introduced showing that he had made contrary statements at the time of the former trial. Hor was it necessary to limit this impeaching testimony, as it had no tendency to show appellant\u2019s guilt of the charge. All it would and could be used for by the jury was in passing on what weight they would give Allen\u2019s testimony as affecting the reputation of the girl. Brown v. State, 24 Texas Crim. App., 170; Poyner v. State, 40 Texas Crim. Rep., 640; Schwartz v. State, 53 Texas Crim. Rep., 449; Thompson v. State, 55 Texas Crim. Rep., 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">As hereinbefore stated appellant was severe in his cross-examination of Miss Davis, introduced her testimony on the former trial to impeach her and on his cross-examination asked what the attorneys had said to her since the former trial, etc. Thus it is seen that an effort was made to create the impression that her testimony was of recent fabrication, and the attorneys at least had suggested to her wherein it was necessary that her testimony be added to. Under such circumstances there was no error in permitting State\u2019s counsel to ask her in rebuttal of such cross-examination: \u201cMiss Maggie, state whether or not it is a fact that Mr. McOomb and I told you the case had been reversed, and we wanted to know if there was anything you had forgotten; that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>wanted to know the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth,\u201d and in permitting her to answer the question. The defendant in his cross-examination had already brought out the fact that the case had been reversed on appeal. The court in approving the bill says: \u201cApproved with the explanation that the prosecutrix was asked about a number of matters that she was not asked about on the former trial and her doings and relations with the defendant were by questions propounded by State\u2019s counsel, much more fully developed than had been done on the. former trial. She was severely cross-examined by defendant\u2019s counsel on the difference between her present and former testimony and the impression sought to be made that-the new facts testified to by her were fabrications suggested to her - by State\u2019s counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">When Miss Davis was called as a witness she came into the courtroom with her baby in her arms. As soon as the court\u2019s attention was called to that fact he had the baby carried out of the courtroom. As it does not appear that the jury saw more than she merely had a baby, and that fact was testified to by a number of witnesses, the bill presents no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The court did not err in refusing to give peremptory instructions to acquit. The fabts on this trial will and do sustain the verdict of the jra y-</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">The fact that Mrs. Davis, the mother of the prosecutrix, was permitted to incidentally state that she was a member of the church, without stating what church, or any fact connected with her membership, is not a matter that could have had any bearing on the issues in the case. The severe assault appellant made on the character of the girl, in an effort to show that she was lacking in chastity and virtue, and, therefore, he would not be guilty, even if he had had intercourse with her, certainly rendered testimony admissible that the girl\u2019s reputation for virtue and chastity was good; that she moved in the best circles of society \u2014 attended church, attended the singings, dances and parties and associated generally with the young people of the community, and if in connection therewith it was shown her mother was a member of the church, if error, it was not such error as would call for a reversal of the case. The mother, in a measure, was attacked as well as the girl, by the witness Allen.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">If the young lady had submitted her person to appellant without retying on a promise of marriage, there could be no case of seduction, therefore the court did not err in refusing the special charge asking him to instruct the jury, \u201cif you find that the prosecutrix, Miss Maggie Davis, submitted to appellant wholly on account of his said promise to marry her, you will acquit him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">This is not the law, but, on the contrary, she must have implicit faith in and rely on the promise of marriage to constitute a case of seduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">Appellant asked for peremptory instructions on the ground that there was no evidence corroborative of her testimony as to a promise of marriage, and on the ground that there was no testimony corroborative as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>to her testimony as to an act of intercourse, and then asked a charge that if she was not corroborated both as to promise of marriage and an act of intercourse they would acquit. As hereinbefore shown, the testimony of Walter Hamilton as to admissions of appellant would corroborate her as to both, a promise of marriage and an act of intercourse, for he told that witness he used no preventative but took it \u201cstraight,\u201d /and said he would not mind marrying her if he did not have to live with her, but rather than live with her he would go to the pen. In addition to this testimony there are other facts and circumstances in evidence tending to corroborate the girl\u2019s testimony. The court gave the charge on accomplice testimony approved by this court in the case of Campbell v. State, <em>57 </em>Texas Crim. Rep., 301, 123 S. W. Rep., 583, and it was not necessary to give the special charges requested on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">As the court fully instructed the jury on the presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt, there was no necessity to give the special charges requested on this matter. The court instructed the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\u201cThe term \u2018seduce\u2019 as used in this charge, means to lead a woman away from the path of virtue.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">\u201cNow if you believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant, Wilburn Gleason, did, in Jack County, Texas, on or about the 28th day of November, 1912, by promise of marriage, seduce the witness Maggie Davis and did have carnal knowledge of her, and that said Maggie Davis was at the time an unmarried female under twenty-five years of age, you will find the defendant guilty as charged in the indictment and assess his punishment at imprisonment in the penitentiary not less than two nor more than ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">\u201cBefore you can convict the defendant you must believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt (a) that said witness Maggie Davis was at the time in question under twenty-five years of age; (b) that the defendant had carnal knowledge of her on or about the 28th day of November, 1912; (c) that up to the time that the defendant had carnal knowledge of Miss Maggie Davis, if he did have carnal knowledge of her, she was a chaste female, and (d) that the defendant had carnal knowledge of said Maggie Davis by promise of marriage, and if you have a reasonable doubt as to either one of the matters submitted and designated in this paragraph as (a), (b), (c) and (d) you will acquit the defendant, and say by your verdict, \u2018not guilty.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">After having thus instructed the jury it was wholly unnecessary to give the special charges requested by defendant. Outside of his plea of not guilty, his whole defense was based on evidence introduced by him that the girl was not a virtuous and chaste girl, and this defense was fully presented in the charge above. In addition to the above paragraphs the court instructed the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">\u201cI instruct you that the witness Miss Maggie Davis is what is known in law as an accomplice, and I further instruct you that you can not convict the defendant iipon her testimony alone, unless you first be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>lieve her testimony to be true, and that it connects the defendant with the offense charged, and then you can not convict him upon the testimony of said witness unless you further believe that there is other testimony in the case corroborative of such accomplice\u2019s testimony, tending to connect the defendant with the offense charged, and the corroboration is not sufficient if it merely shows the commission of the offense charged; and in passing upon this issue you may look to all the facts and circumstances in evidence in this case. You are further instructed that the witness Maggie Davis can not corroborate herself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The criticisms of this charge present no error, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\n<em>Affii\u2019med.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">DAVIDSON\", Judge, not present at consultation.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b208-8\">ON REHEABIire.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">March 1, 1916.</p>\n<author id=\"b208-10\">HARPER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AT7\">This case was affirmed at a former day of this term, and appellant has filed a motion for rehearing in which he assigns five grounds in which he thinks the court erred in the original opinion, conceding that the court was perhaps correct in passing' on the other propositions presented. Owing .to the earnest insistence of appellant\u2019s counsel we have again reviewed the five questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">The first contention is that the evidence of the young lady would not make a case of seduction, but shows a case of barter and sale. Her testimony on direct examination is copied in full in the original opinion, and we think it shows a case of seduction and not barter and sale, and would justify a conviction if corroborated.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">The next contention is that the court erred in holding that the testimony of the prosecuting witness could be supported by the testimony of her mother and sister If appellant had made no attack on the witness, his contention would be sound, but it has always been the rule in this court that if defendant\u2019s case is that the witness testified under corrupt motives, or where it is sought to show that the testimony is of recent fabrication, State may sustain witness by proof of similar statements in harmony with her testimony, made before any motive existed to testify falsely. (English v. State, 34 Texas Crim. Rep., 190; Beddick v. State, 35 Texas Crim. Rep., 463; Mitchell v. State, 36 Texas Crim. Rep., 278; Williams v. State, 24 Texas Crim. App., 637; Jones v. State, 38 Texas Crim. Rep., 87; Ballow v. State, 42 Texas Crim. Rep., 263.) Appellant certainly can not contend that he was not endeavoring to show that the additional testimony she gave on this trial to what she had given on the former trial was not of recent fabrication; and can not contend, that he was not insisting that it was conceived by her after a conference with attorneys representing the State. And certainly this was the purpose of appellant introducing, in rebuttal of her testimony on this trial, her testimony given at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>former trial, and that she had made contradictory statements. Certainly under such circumstances the State could support its witness by showing that she had made statements prior to the institution of this prosecution in conformity with her testimony on this trial. It was not permitting a conviction by allowing her to corroborate herself, but such testimony was admissible to aid the jury in determining whether or.not she was speaking the truth on this trial. The court in his charge instructed the jury that \u201cthe witness Maggie Davis could not corroborate herself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The next contention is that we erred in holding that the testimony of Walter Hamilton corroborated the prosecuting witness both as to promise of marriage and sexual intercourse. Appellant concedes that the testimony of this witness does corroborate the prosecutrix as to an act of intercourse, but earnestly insists that it does not corroborate her as to a promise of marriage. We have again read this witness\u2019 testimony, and while the witness does not use the words \u201che told me he promised to marry <em>her,\u201d </em>yet no other deduction could be drawn from the testimony of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">He insists we erred in stating that appellant\u2019s defense, in addition to a plea of not guilty, was that the girl was not a virtuous and chaste girl, and that he had the additional defense that the transaction was one of barter and sale. This would be included in the statement that she was not virtuous and chaste. But we did not hold .that such an, issue was not in the ease\u00bf but if raised it was sufficiently presented in the court\u2019s charge, and the jury found against such contention. It was not proper to charge the jury as requested by appellant, that if the prosecutrix relied solely on the promise of marriage in yielding to appellant, he should be acquitted. It is the yielding, relying on the promise, and appellant\u2019s conduct that a conviction is authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"AOQ\">The fifth contention is that we did not pass on the assignment that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction. We certainly thought that it could be gathered from the opinion that we thought the evidence ample to sustain the verdict. It is true that the baby was born in about eight months from the time the young lady gives as the date of the act of intercourse, but this fact would not render the testimony wholly insufficient. As testified to by the doctor in this case, children who are born in eight months from conception frequently live. The fact that it was born in eight months, its size, condition, etc., is to be considered with all the facts in the case, and we suppose appellant\u2019s able counsel presented this circumstance to the jury with the same force and ability that they present it in their brief and in this motion, yet the jury found adversely to their contention, and we can not say they were not authorized under all the evidence to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.'</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
