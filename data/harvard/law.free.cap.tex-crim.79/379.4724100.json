Article 1026 of the Penal Code provides the punishment to he assessed shall not he less than two years nor more than fifteen. Within these limits the jury has authority to fix the term of imprisonment at any length of time deemed advisable.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-21\">The special charge requested was fully covered by the court\u2019s main charge, and under such circumstances there was no error in refusing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-22\">The only other question presented is, it is insisted that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the conviction. If the evidence for the State was believed by the jury, it makes a plain case of assault to murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-23\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-24\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
