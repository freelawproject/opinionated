The desertion is shown beyond doubt, and his only excuse for deserting them is he did not \u201clike the manner in which her people treated him.\u201d He does not say his wife mistreated him in any way, nor state in what way her people had mistreated him. He contends that she had some supplies when he left, and his mother would have supplied her necessities. We do not think the law contemplates that a wife and children shall be left upon the charity of the mother of the man deserting his wife. The evidence will sustain the verdict, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">\n<em>AfpA'med.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
