The record must disclose that a recognizance has been given, or that the appellant is in jail and has been continuously confined therein, to confer jurisdiction on this court. McHenry v. State, 42 Texas Crim. Rep., 469; Harris v. State, 2 Texas Crim. App., 134; Brinson v. State, 68 Texas Crim. Rep., 49, 150 S. W. Rep., 776, and cases collated under art. 918 of \"Vernon\u2019s Crim.

Attached to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>motion for reinstatement is the certificate of the clerk to an order, omitted from the original transcript, showing that appellant failed to give recognizance and was committed to and confined in jail. Therefore the cause is reinstated and the order of dismissal set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\">It is shown beyond question that appellant had the pistol on the occasion in question and fired it off. His defense is that it was Christmas time, and he did not know it was an offense to .shoot the pistol; that he never got off the premises on which he was living. The' State, by its- evidence, does not make it clear that appellant was off the premises on which he was residing. On another trial, if this be true, this fact should be shown, when the testimony would sustain a conviction for unlawfully carrying a pistol, for the State\u2019s case is that he was not \"celebrating\u201d but shooting for a different reason. However, as the evidence does not show that appellant was off the premises on which he was living, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded. Even though- appellant was guilty of an offense in shooting off the pistol, he would not be guilty of unlawfully carrying a pistol if he did not carry it off the premises on which he was living.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
