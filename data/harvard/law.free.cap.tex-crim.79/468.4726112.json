If the issue is raised by the testimony, appellant properly presents the question by showing that he excepted to the charge because of the failure to so instruct the jury, and he prepared and asked special charges on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-19\">The evidence would show that appellant rented a farm from J. B. Burns that was supposed to contain one hundred and sixty acres of land in cultivation. Appellant, with the consent of the landlord, sublet a portion of the farm to deceased, G. W. Campbell. Over the terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>this rental contract the first trouble arose. Appellant contended that he sublet to Campbell all the land except sixty acres, he retaining that specific number of acres. Campbell contended that he specifically rented one hundred acres, appellant reserving the remainder. There was not one hundred and sixty acres of land in cultivation, and appellant was contending for his sixty acres and deceased for his one hundred acres. Considerable feeling was manifest, but Mr. Burns visited the farm and the matter was adjusted. There was a small house near the residence of appellant, and on the land he was cultivating. At one time there was an agreement that deceased was to be permitted to move this house to the land he was cultivating, he having the most land. Appellant, Mr. Burns and deceased agreeing to this. However, after the adjustment of the land troubles, appellant, on the way to town, told Mr. Burns he did not want to let deceased have this small house, and Mr. Burns then told appellant it was all right with him, and to tell the deceased he said not to move the house. Deceased was not made aware of this change of plans until the morning of the homicide. Deceased secured his brother, J. A. Campbell, and E. W. Dalrymple to assist him in moving the house. Dalrymple and J. A. Campbell say when they got to appellant\u2019s, Dalrymple got Out of the wagon to open the gate, and as he did so appellant came out and said: \u201c \u2018Campbell, I went down there and investigated that business,\u2019 and says, \u2018You had better not come in the yard and move that house.\u2019 He (Campbell) says, \u2018How is that, Smith? Don\u2019t you know that has been our contract and trade all the time?\u2019 And he says, \u2018Yes, I know it has, but I talked to Mr. Burns, and Mr. Burns told me to tell you to leave the house alone,\u2019 and Campbell says, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you get ah order from Mr. Burns and tell him to tell me to leave the house there?\u2019 and he says, \u2018You know I wouldn\u2019t believe any such talk as that,\u2019 and Mr. Smith says, \u2018Well, I didn\u2019t think I needed it,\u2019 and says, \u2018You had better go call in the law to move the house,\u2019 and \u2018Mr. Burns told me to tell you to leave it alone.\u2019 Then Campbell says, \u2018All right, Mr. Smith,\u2019 says T don\u2019t believe that, not a damn word do I believe.\u2019 And Mr. Campbell at that time was sitting on the end of the seat with his feet out on the wheel and Mr. Campbell just got out and went on around the front of the team, and when he got out Mr. Smith says, \u2018Well,\u2019 says, \u2018All right/ and he just wheeled and went back in the house and just jerked the door open, and I saw Mr. Campbell sorter break \u2014 sorter go walking off right fast, and about -that time Mr. Smith just ran out with a shotgun and just as Mr. Campbell looked around why he shot him with a shotgun and he just fell over, staggered over yonder-way, and before he could get straight again he shot him again in the back and he fell over that way and was trying to get behind the wood pile the last shot. He just taken the gun in his left hand and just drawed his pistol this way and just shot him before he ever hardly got straight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\">It will readily be seen by this testimony that the right to kill in defense of property is not even raised, much less defense of his person,for the witnesses show that deceased was unarmed, made no demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>stration, and was nowhere near appellant, nor near the little house. The only other eyewitness to the transaction was appellant, and we must look to his testimony to see if defense of his person is raised by his testimony. On direct examination he testified: \u201cI saw Mr. Campbell and his brother and Mr. Dalrymple in the wagon coming to move this house and when they got to the gate about thirty or forty steps from my house I saw what they had in his wagon and what the consequences was and I slipped a couple of shells in my shotgun, reached up in a little closet and got my pistol and put it in my pocket, and as Campbell drove up in the yard and stopped by this little house I spoke to him and told him, \u2018Mr. Campbell, you are not going to move that house. I went to Waco last night and consulted with the attorney and talked to Mr. Burns and he said to tell you that he strictly forbid you a moving that house; that you would have to go strictly according to law.\u2019 He said, \u2018I wouldn\u2019t believe a damn word that you say. I believe you are telling a damn lie.\u2019 As he started out of the wagon, I says, \u2018Campbell, don\u2019t you get out of that wagon in my yard.\u2019 I saw that he was getting out anyway. I made for my gun. As I come back out with my gun, Campbell had walked up within three or four feet of the back of this shed and there was a plank lying there nailed to- two posts, and Campbell was stooping over in the act of taking hold of this plank \u2014 he had his right side turned towards me. I said, \u2018Campbell,\u2019 and as he wheeled around, why I shot him. The first time I shot him he whirled bade the other way and I let him have the other barrel and he still didn\u2019t fall and I reached and jerked my sixshooter and shot him as quick as I could with that, and he fell some eight or ten feet from where I shot him the last time in a stumbling, falling position.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">\u201cWhen I fired the shot I was kinder excited and mad, too. When Mr. Campbell got out of his wagon I feared an attack on my person. I thought that he had come there for trouble, and I had forbidden him coming in the yard and when I saw him coming I thought he was coming for trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">\u201cI thought it was necessary for me to shoot Mr. Campbell in defense of my property. I was afraid of him otherwise. I had forbidden him moving the house and told him that he wasn\u2019t going to move it and I was afraid to interfere without doing just what I did do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">This is all his testimony on direct examination. On cross-examination'he testified: \u201cQ. Why did you shoot Mr. Campbell? A. Well, as I said a while ago, I had objected to him moving the house and didn\u2019t intend for him to move it without a legal right to do so, and I was afraid to interfere with it. He (Campbell) had the material to move the house with. Yes, sir; it was in his wagon. Ho, sir; he hadn\u2019t put any of those tools out on the ground; I didn\u2019t give him time. Ho, sir; at the time I shot him he had no tool in his hand, as I saw. Q. Why didn\u2019t you say to him, that you didn\u2019t want the house moved ? A- I was afraid to give him any chance. Q. Well, he was thirty feet from you ? A. I didn\u2019t know but what he was armed. ... I did not have my gun presented. Ho, I hadn\u2019t seen any arms and he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>not made any attack on me. He had not put any blocks or rope or anything around the house to move it or prize it up on its pillars. Q. Well, why didn\u2019t you argue the matter with him a little with the shotgun in your hand- before you shot him ? A. a I was afraid to wait any longer. I didn\u2019t know but what he was armed and would get the drop on me. Yes, sir, it was my purpose to kill him after firing the first shot. That is what I shot at him for. Q. Didn\u2019t you think after the firing of the first shot that he was going to leave? Did he turn in the direction to get away? A. I was afraid to quit; afraid to let him get away. I never saw him make any effort to do any shooting after I fired the first shot. I didn\u2019t say anything to him except what I have told the jury, that is, argue with him, or use any other means except what I have stated here to prevent, him moving the house. Ho, sir; I didn\u2019t see any gun in the wagon. I never looked in the wagon. I never went any closer to the wagon, I don\u2019t suppose, than thirty feet, twenty or thirty feet, about the same distance from the wagon that I was from him. Yes, sir; I was mad, too. It made me mad when he drove up there and give me the damn lie and said he wouldn\u2019t believe a damn word I said and believed I was telling a damn lie. Ho, sir, he hadn\u2019t threatened me that morning there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">\u2022' This testimony, we think, demonstrates that deceased had made no demonstration of any character to do appellant any harm personally. He s.ays* he shot him \u201cbecause he was afraid deceased might do something,\u201d not that he had done anything or had said anything, or made any demonstration that would lead one to believe he was in any danger of death or serious bodily injury. As said by Mr. Branch in his work on Criminal Law, section 462: \u201cHot error to fail or refuse to charge on self-defense, although threats of the deceased are in evidence, if there is no evidence, that at the time defendant killed him, deceased was doing any act manifesting an intention to execute the threats,\u201d citing Allen <em>v. </em>State, 17 Texas Crim. App., 637; Penland v. State, 19 Texas Crim. App., 365; Lynch v. State, 24 Texas Crim. App., 350; Irwin v. State, 43 Texas, 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The only evidence of anything done on that occasion, even from appellant\u2019s standpoint, is that deceased got out of his wagon, and from his acts and conduct led him' to believe that deceased was going to move or attempt to move the little house, without the consent and against the will of appellant, and this issue was fully presented by the court in the charge on the right to defend his property. We agree with appellant in his contention that where the evidence had the least tendency to bring the case under the provisions of both articles 675 and 677, it is incumbent upon the court to charge the law governing both such defenses, and they must be stated distinctly and not be blended together. But in this case there is not a particle of testimony tending to raise any other issue, as shown above, than the defense of property. There is no evidence that appellant personally was ever in real or apparent danger,- \u2014 he only stating that he feared, if he did not kill deceased, he might thereafter do something, \u2014 not that he was then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>doing anything to lead him to believe he was in danger of taking his life or suffering serious bodily injury.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b487-11\">[Behearing denied May 3, 1916. \u2014 Beporter.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b487-3\">The next hill of exceptions complains of the paragraph of the charge submitting the issue of murder. As appellant was acquitted of that offense, there is no necessity of discussing that paragraph of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">\u00b0 The paragraph on manslaughter is not subject to the criticisms contained in the third bill of exceptions. It does not reverse the burden of proof as contended by appellant. (Hendricks v. State, 69 Texas Crim. Rep., 209, 154 S. W. Rep., 1005.) And the fact that it \u201cignores the right of defendant to defend himself against an unlawful attack on his person,\u201d is not error, as the evidence raises no such issue.</p>\n<p id=\"AfY5\">The only other bill of exceptions in the record complains of the action =of the court in giving a special charge requested by the State, that \u201cif the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt, under the evidence, that appellant killed deceased in the execution of a previously formed intent or plan to take his life, and not in defense of his property under the law, such killing would not be justifiable,\u201d etc. There is evidence raising such an issue, and the State is entitled to have its theory presented as well as that of defendant. Appellant himself testified .to getting his pistol and putting it in his pocket, and loading his gun and setting it in convenient reach when he saw deceased approaching. He is thus shown to have gotten ready to kill on sight of deceased, and the State\u2019s testimony is that deceased had done nothing more than get out of his wagon and start around the wagon, telling appellant he did not believe that Mr. Burns said for him not to move the house, when appellant rushed in the house, got his gun and shot deceased. As Mr. Dalrymple puts it: \u201cMr. Smith came out of the house like a tiger. He just rushed out of the house with a gun and fired. Mr. Campbell looked like he was fixing to leave \u2014 he was going away from the house in a pretty fast walk, but Mr. Smith just throwed a load of shot into him. Campbell (deceased) did not have anything in his hands when he got out of the wagon or when appellant shot him. The first shot entered the side, and the last two struck deceased in the back.\u201d v.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The court gave appellant\u2019s special charge Ho. 1. Special charges . Hos. <em>2 </em>and 3 relate to defense of his person from an unlawful attack, and of course there was no error in refusing such instructions, the evidence raising no such issue. There is no evidence of any attack or assault of any character in this case. The most the evidence would raise was that deceased, or it might so appear to appellant, was getting ready to attempt to move the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">The court does charge that appellant was in legal possession of the house, therefore there was no necessity to give charge Ho. 4 requested, and as appellant was found not guilty of murder, special charge Ho. 5 relating to that offense need not be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
