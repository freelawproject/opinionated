It follows the form laid down by Judge Willson in Willson\u2019s Texas Criminal Forms Ho. 261, which has been held sufficient in its averments to state this character of ease of sodomy. There were no exceptions to the charge. The motion for new trial is based, first, upon the insufficiency of the indictment; second, that the verdict of the jury is contrary to the law and the evidence, and, third, that the verdict is not supported by the evidence introduced by the State. The first proposition has been met by reference to Judge Willson\u2019s forms. The second and third grounds may be answered by stating that the record is before us without a statement of facts. It was also contended in the motion for new trial that the verdict of the jury is written on an indictment, but does not show which defendant was found guilty of the charge of sodomy. Gomez, appellant, alone was on trial, a severance having been obtained. As this record is presented to the court we find no reversible error. The judgment will, therefore, be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-14\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
