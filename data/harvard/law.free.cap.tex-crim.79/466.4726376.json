He bases this contention on the testimony of Luke Taylor, who testified: <em>\u201cI </em>know Mr. Blackburn, the defendant. Just before the Menard term of court last' spring, as I was going to or coming from breakfast, he met me near the wagon yard and asked me if I wanted some whisky, and I told him that I did. He told me it cost him a dollar in Llano, and that I would have to pay him a dollar and a quarter for it. I told him I would take two quarts, and gave him $2.50, when he says, T haven\u2019t got any whisky here myself, but there is a fellow in the yard that has got some\u2014 maybe I can get it for you.\u2019 He told me to go to his room and wait. I did so, and he came and brought me the two quarts \u2014 he said he had seen the fellow and got it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">We do not think this raises the question that appellant, by the course of dealing, became the agent of Luke Taylor in procuring the whisky. He approached Luke Taylor and asked him if he wanted some whisky, and when Luke Taylor said he did, appellant told him it would cost him $1 in Llano, and he would have to charge Luke Taylor $1.25 for it in San Saba. It was immaterial with Luke Taylor whether appellant got the whisky in a wagon yard at San Saba, or went to Llano and got it. He had been told by appellant that he would have to pay $1 for it, and was going to and did charge him, Luke Taylor, $1.25 per bottle \u2014 appellant having a profit in the transaction \u2014 thus evidencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>by his statements that he was going to buy it at one price, wherever he secured it, and sell it to Luke Taylor at another price. In the case of Bogle v. State, <em>42 </em>Texas Crim. Rep., 391, this court held: \u201cThe beer was ordered from Dallas. The facts show that the real price was $8, and the 50 cents was freight. So, to sum up, the evidence without contradictions shows that the beer was delivered to the purchaser at Greenville, in Hunt County, over the line of railroad, the freight being added to the real price. As we understand the rule in this State, this constituted a sale in Hunt County.\u201d</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b482-8\">[Behearing denied Hay 10,. 1916. \u2014 Beporter.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Place of sale is to be determined by actual delivery and parting of the seller with the property in the liquor. Whenever this occurs the sale is made. Weldon v. State, 36 Texas Crim. Rep., 34; Sinclair v. State, 41 Texas Crim. Rep., 487; Bruce v. State, 36 Texas Crim. Rep., 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The testimony does not make him the agent of Luke Taylor. What he says is, the liquor will cost me (appellant) $1, and it will cost you $1.25. If he was getting it as the agent of Luke Taylor, when the liquor was purchased it would become the property of Luke Taylor, and appellant would have no right to make an additional charge for the whisky. The whole conversation shows that appellant was purchasing the liquor at one price for himself and would sell it to Luke Taylor at another price. The evidence shows a sale by appellant, and does not suggest that he' was merely' acting as agent of Luke Taylor in the transaction. Therefore, the court did not err in submitting that issue. The fact that the indictment alleged two sales to Luke Taylor, and the proof only showed one sale to him, does not vitiate the conviction. The indictment also alleged a sale to G. S.. Biggs, and the proof authorizing a finding that he made these sales, one to Luke Taylor and one to G. S. Biggs, would meet the requirements of the law in requiring that two sales be proven before a conviction for pursuing the occupation can be'sustained. The incidents connected with the sales and the manner of the' sales would support a finding that appellant was pursuing the business, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">\n<em>Affirmed,</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
