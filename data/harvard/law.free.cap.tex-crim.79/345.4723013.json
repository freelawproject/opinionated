There were exceptions to the court\u2019s charge but they are in no way verified by the court. They were filed on the 29th of October. These exceptions should have in some way been verified by the court. But in any event, the exceptions to the charge and the refusal to give special charges requested can not he intelligently revised without the statement of facts. The court\u2019s charge may have fairly submitted the issues raised by the testimony. We are of opinion there is no reversible error shown in regard t'o these matters. There are no bills of exception in the record, therefore from that viewpoint there is nothing that can be revised.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-17\">As-presented by th\u00e9 record the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-18\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
