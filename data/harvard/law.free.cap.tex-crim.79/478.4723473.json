He testified her face was literally torn all to pieces \u2014 that her upper jaw was broken, and all her teeth on the right side were broken loose; her lower jaw was broken, and there were, seven distinct wounds- on her head; that he found a hammer there bloody; that there were wounds practically all over her entire scalp,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>-and there were several places where the outer table o\u00ed her skull was broken. He says he told Mr. Nelson and his wife that he thought it was useless to attempt to do anything for her, but at their request he treated her. That in his opinion the woman was conscious; and he furthermore testified that he informed the woman she was going to die and that she wanted to tell the truth. Mrs. Nelson says the woman was informed that she was going to die, and the doctor thought she was dying.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">The doctor\u2019s testimony and Mrs. Nelson\u2019s testimony would be admissible both under the res gestae rule and as dying declarations. While the statements made to the undertaker were some time after the statements were made to the doctor, yet his testimony would tend strongly to show that she was conscious, and his testimony would be admissible as a dying declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">There are a number, of bills objecting to testimony wherein when asked who did it, she would answer to \u201cSharles\u201d; to others Charles Thompson, and to others would nod her head in the affirmative when asked the question. It is true that witnesses for appellant testified they did not think she was conscious, but this would not render the testimony inadmissible, but go to the weight to be given it by the jury. When the State\u2019s witnesses testified that she was conscious and informed that she was going to diej this made a prima facie case, and rendered the testimony admissible. When the defendant offered testimony that she was not conscious of what she was saying, this rendered it a question of fact to be determined by the jury. None of the bills complaining of the admissibility of this testimony present error.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The testimony of Dr. MacKechney as to what Miss Gossler said to 'him was admissible. Appellant introduced Miss Gossler and had her testify that in her opinion the woman was unconscious when she made the istatements that appellant inflicted the injuries on her head. Any statement she had made to Dr. MacKechney prior to her so testifying would ',be admissible as tending to impeach her, and the court in approving the bill says h\u00e9 so limited the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">The testimony of a previous quarrel between deceased and appellant was admissible as tending to show motive for the crime. The witnesses testify that appellant had told the negro woman that \u201cno other man should have her.\u201d It was shown another man called on her that evening and was to call again that night, and when he did' call he found the negro woman murdered. It is shown that appellant could have and probably did know that Ben Henderson had called that evening and was to call again that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">The court did not err in overruling the application for a continuance. While it is always permissible to show that another probably committed the crime, or that another had made threats, or had ill-will, if the testimony goes further and would place such person in such proximity to the person that he might or could have committed the deed. The fact one absent witness would testify that he \u201cknew the woman was quarrelsome, and knew of two men who had made threats\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>would be immaterial, unless \u2022such other two persons, or one of them, were placed in such position where they had an opportunity to commit the offense. There is no allegation in the motion as to where the two persons were on the night of the homicide, nor is the name of either of them given. The fact that the absent witnesses had never heard appellant make any threats toward deceased, would be immaterial, nor would such testimony tend to weaken the testimony of the State\u2019s witnesses who heard and testified to the threats. Doubtless any number of men could have been picked up who would have testified and testified truthfully they had never heard appellant - make a threat. Before the testimony of such witnesses would become material they would have to place themselves in position to have heard the threats testified to by the witnesses for the State. There is no allegation they were present on such occasion, nor is it so contended in the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Three or four witnesses testify to the fact that deceased, in her dying declaration, said appellant committed the offense and the court did not err in refusing to charge on circumstantial evideneb. It was a case depending on direct and positive testimony. If the jury had not believed the woman rvas conscious when she made the statements ch\u00e1rging appellant with having inflicted the wounds which caused her death, they should not and would not have convicted him, much less assess the highest penalty known to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The judgment, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Ari\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b495-8\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">June 14, 1916.</p>\n<author id=\"b495-10\">HARPER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar4X\">Appellant has filed a motion for rehearing, and .as the death penalty was assessed we have again gone over the entire record, and will again take up each question presented by appellant in his motion. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">He first contends we erred in holding the testimony of Dr. MacKechney admissible as res gestae. The testimony shows the doctor was called as soon as the woman was discovered, and this is shown by the record to have been very soon after the blows were inflicted. The doctor testified that \u201cfrom my examination of her, and observation of her, and talking with her, I believe she was thoroughly conscious. I convinced myself of that fact, and asked her if Sam hit her, and she gave me to understand that he did not. She did not distinctly say \u2018No,\u2019 because in her condition she could not speak plainly, but she said as I understood it, <em>\u2018No/ </em>and shook her head. I then asked her if Charlie did this, and she indicated \u2018Yes,\u2019 nodded her head.\u201d He says that this was about fifteen minutes after he got to the house, and that the woman was suffering intense pain, and he gave her a dose of morphine. That.he did not give her enough morphine to render her unconscious. He testified: \u201cAll of the upper right side of her jaw was badly frac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>tured, and her lip and cheek lacerated, and the teeth on the right hand side were loosened clear back.\u201d He describes her other wounds also, but we have named these to show why she could not speak plainly. In Branch\u2019s Penal Code, page 52, the rule is laid down that \u201cstatements made by the deceased a short time after the homicide as to how it occurred are admissible as res gestae where suffering excludes idea of fabrication,\u201d citing a number of authorities beginning with Boothe v. State, 4 Texas Crim. App., 202; Lewis v. State, 29 Texas Crim. App., 201; Lewis v. State, 43 Texas Crim. Rep., 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Appellant also insists that the testimony of Mrs. Walter Nelson was inadmissible. This lady testifies to going right to the woman and getting there before Dr. Mackechney did, and she says that the doctor told the woman: \u201cNow, Pearl, you are going to die. You probably will die. I think you are dying, and you try to tell who killed you,\u201d and the woman replied, \u201cSharks.\u201d That when this statement was made to her by the doctor, the woman raised herself up on her elbow and said, \u201cSharks.\u201d This would be admissible both as dying declaration and as res gestae. Appellant says it was in answer to a question. That is true, but the statement or question was not such as to suggest the answer to be made. It left her free to name the person who had struck her, without any suggestion as to whom she should name. It has always been the rule that it is no objection to a dying declaration that it was made in answer to questions, if the questions were not calculated to lead the deceased to make any particular statement. Hunnicutt v. State, 18 Texas Crim. App., 498; Pierson v. State, 18 Texas Crim; App., 524; White v. State, 30 Texas Crim. App., 652; Grubb v. State, 43 Texas Crim. Rep., 72; Hunter v. State, 59 Texas Crim. Rep., 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Appellant next insists that the testimony of E. G. Hill was inadmissible wherein the witness testified that he was preparing to shave her hair off and cleaning her head for that purpose, that he knew she was conscious, for when he told her to put her hand in a pan of water she did so, and while shaving her head he would tell her to turn her head and she would do so. He says this was not in regard to nor descriptive of the manner of the death. But this testimony was admissible on the issue of consciousness and was but introductory to permitting the witness to testify that the woman told him that Charlie did it, and that he hit her with a hammer. Under the testimony of Mrs. Nelson above as to what the doctor told the woman about her going to die, we think the testimony admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Appellant now contends that there was no predicate laid to impeach Miss Gossler, and, therefore, Dr. MacKechney should not have been permitted to testify to the impeaching statement without a predicate being laid. It is sufficient to say that the bill does not show that any such objection was urged in the trial court, and it can not be presented now for the first time on motion for rehearing in this court. It comes too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Previous quarrels are always admissible to show motive. Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>insists we were in error in quoting the substance of the threat testified to by Mike Osborn. The exact language is, after the woman had refused to let appellant stay with her: \u201cIf you can\u2019t stay with me, you will never live for nobody else.\u201d This was peculiarly admissible in the light of the facts that another negro was to go to the house the night she was killed, and she was killed before he got there. Appellant was also placed in position that he could have known that the other negro was going to deceased\u2019s home. As to appellant\u2019s objection to the court\u2019s qualification of one of his bills, he should have done this before filing the bill as qualified. Blain v. State, 34 Texas Crim. Rep., 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-3\">After Mrs. Dolman had testified to seeing the woman moaning and swaying her body, raising her body on her elbows, and screaming when the doctor examined her wounds, and heard what the witnesses said to her, and her answers, there was no error in permitting her to state that in her opinion the witness was conscious. This is one of the instances in which the witness in language can not portray what she sees and observes and is permitted to express an opinion. *</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">The only other objection is, that the testimony is insufficient to sustain the death penalty. If the evidence will not sustain the death penalty it is wholly because appellant is not sufficiently identified as the person who committed the crime, and if that is true, no penalty should be sustained. The mode and manner of killing this woman was most cruel and wanton. The doctor testified: \u201cWhen I arrived, in the servant house I found a negro woman lying on the floor, with her face literally beat all to pieces, \u2014 I have practiced medicine for twenty years, and I have never seen anjdhing like it. This upper jaw was broken and all of her teeth on this side, right side, were knocked loose. Her lower jaw was broken and she was beat over the head. I think there was seven distinct marks on her head. It looked like this had been done with a hammer, and in fact I -found a hammer lying there on the floor, bloody, that compared with it; that is, the bit of a hammer compared with the size of the wounds on her head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Appellant\u2019s counsel made an able defense and undertook to fasten the crime on another and prove an alibi for appellant. The jury solved these questions against him, and we can not say they were not authorized to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">The motion for rehearing is overruled</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
