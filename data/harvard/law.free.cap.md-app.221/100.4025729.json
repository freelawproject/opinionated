Appellant timely appealed and presents the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">1. Did the trial court abuse its discretion when it permitted the State to introduce into evidence a notebook, when its probative value was outweighed by its potential for unfair prejudice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">2.

Was the sentence imposed for possession of marijuana illegal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">5. Must Mr. Webster\u2019s sentences for possession of a ri\u00f1e by a person with a disqualifying conviction and possession of a firearm in connection with a drug trafficking offense be merged, where they were based on the possession of a single firearm?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">For the following reasons, we shall reverse appellant\u2019s conviction for possession of BZP. We also shall vacate appellant\u2019s sentence for possession of marijuana and remand for resentencing on that count. Otherwise, the judgments shall be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">At approximately 2:30 p.m. on April 27, 2012, members of the Maryland State Police responded to an address in Frederick as a result of appellant\u2019s failure to appear in court. After knocking on the apartment door and receiving no response, the police obtained a key for the apartment, made entry, and discovered appellant back in the rear bedroom with his two-year-old child. At no point during the entry did appellant make his presence known to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">When they made entry into the apartment, police recovered a loaded rifle inside a closet near the front door of the residence. After securing that weapon, the police then obtained a search warrant. Police then recovered ammunition, drugs, and drug paraphernalia throughout the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">Trooper First Class Jason Stevens, of the Maryland State Police, offered further details during trial. The rifle recovered from the closet was a Hi-Point nine millimeter semiautomatic rifle. Recovered from the medicine cabinet in the bathroom were 28 small bags of suspected cocaine, a small amount of marijuana, and a suspected half pill of Ecstasy. A razor blade and a digital scale with suspected cocaine residue were recovered from a dresser in the bedroom. In the kitchen, police recovered hundreds of baggies that the trooper testified were consistent with packaging materials for con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>trolled dangerous substances. Hundreds of rounds of ammunition were recovered from two plastic bags found underneath a television in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">In addition, a Frederick County Detention Center identification card with appellant\u2019s picture was located on a nearby nightstand in the bedroom, as were two notebooks.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Trooper Stevens testified, without objection, that one of the notebooks contained a list labeled \u201cfiens,\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that, \u201c[a] fiend is a drug addict and many times people involved in distribution of controlled dangerous substances will use a fiend to drive them around to pick up packages and normally the fiend is paid either through cash, or, um, more commonly in drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">As for the items recovered from the medicine cabinet, the parties stipulated that: the tablet was .2 grams of benzylpiperazine (BZP), a schedule one drug; the plant material was .5 grams of marijuana; and, the total gross weight of the 28 bags of cocaine was 9.1 grams. Senior Trooper Austin Fogle, who was accepted as an expert, testified that the cocaine recovered from the apartment was consistent with possession with the intent to distribute. The parties also stipulated that the rifle was an operable nine-millimeter Luger caliber Hi-Point semiautomatic rifle, and that appellant had two prior convictions of second-degree assault which prohibited him from possessing a rifle.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">After the State rested, the defense called Kathleen Bedel, who resided at the apartment in question. She confirmed that appellant had stayed with her the week before the arrest, but not the day before. On April 27, 2012, she called appellant early in the morning and asked him to babysit their son. Bedel was unaware of any cocaine being in her apartment and of the rifle in the closet. She testified that appellant\u2019s older brother sometimes stayed in her apartment. He, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>had moved out of the apartment about a month prior to this incident. She also testified that the lock to her apartment was broken and, on three prior occasions, she had found evidence indicating that someone had been in her apartment. According to Bedel, her apartment door could be opened with a credit card and appellant knew he could access her residence in that manner. She confirmed that, at times, appellant slept over with her in the master bedroom and that he kept clothing at the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Appellant testified on his own behalf that he was in the apartment at the time the police arrived, but he claimed that he did not have any knowledge of the contraband recovered from the apartment. He also denied that his nickname was Yeah-0 and that the notebook admitted into evidence belonged to him. He did agree that boxer shorts found in the master bedroom most likely belonged to him. He kept clothes in the apartment and had been in an \u201con and off\u2019 relationship with Bedel for three years. He also testified that he had been unemployed for the last year and did not have any fixed address.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">We shall include additional detail in the following discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">Appellant first contends the court erred in admitting a notebook because its probative value was greatly outweighed by its potential for unfair prejudice. The State responds that the grounds asserted on appeal are different from those that were raised at trial and that the argument is without merit in any event. We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">Prior to trial, the court granted a motion <em>in limine </em>to preclude any testimony concerning gang-related activity after defense counsel noted that one of the two notebooks recovered mentioned rules for the East Side Bounty Hunters, a subset of the Bloods gang. Thereafter, when Trooper Stevens was asked about the contents of the notebooks, the court sustained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>an objection when the officer replied that there were rules for that gang in one of the notebooks. Subsequently, the State offered to admit the other notebook, identified as State\u2019s Exhibit 9 at trial. Defense counsel objected on the grounds that \u201c[i]t has a lot of gang stuff.\u201d The court reviewed the notebook being proffered and the following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-4\">THE COURT: It, it almost looks like rap poems to me.

I do believe it is relevant as to drug activity and I don\u2019t see anything that to this Court, this looks like some poems and luminati [sic], some poems and things and rap type poems and pictures, phone numbers, grocery list, emails. Nothing to this Court that is overtly gang-related. Nevertheless I don\u2019t think the, there\u2019s anything about any prejudicial information in here. There\u2019s fiends under a bunch of phone and then above phone numbers, several, looks like seven\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-18\">[PROSECUTOR]: Appear to be phone numbers\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-19\">THE COURT: \u2014 phone numbers.

It was this concern that informed the trial court\u2019s analysis. We are unable to conclude, as appellant now asks us to do, that defense counsel\u2019s addition, \u201cor something like that,\u201d raised additional, unstated grounds beyond the explicit concern about gang evidence. Therefore, this issue was not properly preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">But, even if preserved, we conclude that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in admitting the notebook identified as State\u2019s Exhibit 9. This Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">\u201cA ruling on the admissibility of evidence ordinarily is within the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>Blair v. State, </em>130 Md.

As for appellant\u2019s concern about the word \u201cfiens,\u201d it appears that was waived because, as set forth in our background discussion, Trooper Stevens testified, without objection, to the meaning of fiends in the context of drug distribution. <em>See Yates v. State, </em>429 Md. 112, 120-21, 55 A.3d 25 (2012) (\u201cWhere competent evidence of a matter is received, no prejudice is sustained where other objected to evidence of the same matter is also received.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>see also DeLeon v.

Certainly, no objection or argument was raised that the notebook contained inadmissible other crimes evidence, as appellant now asserts on appeal. And, we are not persuaded that the probative value of the drawings of guns, the calculation of grams, and the listing of \u201cfiens\u201d was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice given the relevance of such evidence to the issues before the jury. As to the drawings, it has been often stated, \u201c[t]here can be no serious dispute that there is an intimate relationship between violence and drugs.\u201d <em>Marks v. Criminal Compensation, </em>196 Md.App. 37, 70, 7 A.3d 665 (2010); <em>see also Burns v.

The trial court neither erred nor abused its discretion in admitting the notebook into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Appellant next asserts the trial court erred in admitting evidence of his alleged nickname because that evidence amounted to inadmissible hearsay and improper propensity evidence. The State responds that, to the extent preserved, the trial court properly exercised its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Prior to jury selection, appellant moved <em>in limine </em>to prevent Trooper Stevens from testifying that appellant\u2019s nickname was a slang Spanish word for cocaine. The court denied the motion, noting that it would consider objections to that effect during trial. Thereafter, during Trooper Stevens\u2019 testimony about the seizure of evidence from appellant\u2019s apartment, the following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">There were also two notebooks which were located. The notebooks had information, ah, they, they had the name Yeah-O, which I know to be a nickname for Mr. Webster.

Okay. And you said you know that word to mean what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">A.

Rule 5-801(c). A \u201cstatement\u201d is \u201c(1) an oral or written assertion or (2) nonverbal conduct of a person, if it is intended by the person as an assertion.\u201d Md. Rule 5-801(a). A \u201cdeclarant\u201d is \u201ca person who makes a statement.\u201d Md. Rule 5-801(b). Further, \u201c[except as otherwise provided by these rules or permitted by applicable constitutional provisions or statutes, hearsay is not admissible.\u201d Md. Rule 5-802. \u201cThus, a circuit court has no discretion to admit hearsay in the absence of a provision providing for its admissibility. Whether evidence is hearsay is an issue of law reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d Bernadyn v. State, </em>390 Md. 1, 8, 887 A.2d 602 (2005); <em>accord Thomas v. State, </em>429 Md. 85, 98, 55 A.3d 10 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">Courts generally begin by identifying the proposition that the evidence was offered to prove. <em>See Bernadyn, </em>390 Md. at 10, 887 A.2d 602 (\u201cWe therefore begin our inquiry by identifying the proposition that the medical bill was offered to prove.\u201d) (citation omitted); Murphy, <em>Maryland Evidence Handbook </em>\u00a7 702, at 305 (4th ed. 2010) (\u201cWhen an out-of-court statement is offered in evidence, the trial judge must first determine why it is being offered\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>In this case, the State sought to establish that the notebook admitted into evidence, State\u2019s Exhibit 9, was circumstantially linked to appellant because the front cover of the notebook lists the name \u201cYa Yo,\u201d and the testimony of Trooper Stevens was that appellant was known by the similar nickname \u201cYeah-0.\u201d Appellant contends his nickname qualified as hearsay. Many authorities suggest that is not the case. Professor Wigmore explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">A person\u2019s <em>name </em>is the title by which he himself and others habitually call him. To know a person\u2019s name, therefore, is to have heard him so called by himself and by others. In strictness, such an utterance is not hearsay, except where it is made as an assertion of fact. But, though it may be hearsay, as a source of information, yet is universally relied upon as a source of knowledge. Courts have commonly accepted the testimony founded upon it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">2 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 667a, at 928 (Chadbourne rev.1979) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\">One virtually always learns a name \u2014 even one\u2019s own \u2014 by being told what it is. <em>See United States v.

As to the nickname that tied appellant to the notebook being hearsay, the Ninth Circuit has recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">We do not think that the name is hearsay. In a sense, it is. We can know a person\u2019s name only by being told, either by the person or someone else, unless, of course, we happen to have christened the person.

However, appellant\u2019s only objection to that testimony at trial was that the testimony was non-responsive. And, as appellant concedes, he waived any objection to this evidence by not objecting when Trooper Stevens testified a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>second time that Yeah-0 was slang for cocaine. As the Court of Appeals has reaffirmed, \u201c|o]b,jections are waived if, at another point during the trial, evidence on the same point is admitted \"without objection.\u201d <em>DeLeon, </em>407 Md. at 31, 962 A.2d 383 (citing <em>Peisner v. State, </em>236 Md. 137, 145-46, 202 A.2d 585 (1964)); <em>see also Klauenberg v. State, </em>355 Md. 528, 545, 735 A.2d 1061 (1999) (\u201cThis also requires the party opposing the admission of evidence to object each time the evidence is proffered by its proponent\u201d). Thus, the only issue properly before this Court is whether Trooper Stevens\u2019 testimony about the presence of appellant\u2019s alleged nickname on the notebook amounted to hearsay, and we conclude that there was no error when the trial court overruled the objection and admitted the evidence at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Moreover, we are persuaded that if there was any error it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Bellamy v. State, </em>403 Md. 308, 332, 941 A.2d 1107 (2008) (\u201cOnce it has been determined that error was committed, reversal is required unless the error did not influence the verdict; the error is harmless only if it did not play any role in the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d) (quotation and citation omitted). As indicated, the State was offering appellant\u2019s nickname and its alleged meaning as circumstantial evidence connecting appellant to other evidence recovered in the apartment. And yet, that evidence, <em>i.e., </em>appellant\u2019s purported nickname on a notebook found there, was cumulative to other evidence establishing appellant\u2019s relationship to the apartment and its contents. <em>See Dove v. State, </em>415 Md. 727, 743-44, 4 A.3d 976 (2010) (\u201cIn considering whether an error was harmless, we also consider whether the evidence presented in error was cumulative evidence. Evidence is cumulative when, beyond a reasonable doubt, we are convinced that there was sufficient evidence, independent of the [evidence] complained of, to support the appellant[\u2019s] conviction[ ].\u201d) (quotation and citation omitted). Other evidence tying appellant to the apartment included Trooper Stevens\u2019 testimony that he was familiar with appellant and had spoken with him on prior occasions. He also knew appellant\u2019s address, and that appellant lived at that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>location with his child and the mother of his child. There was also Bedel\u2019s testimony confirming that appellant had stayed in her apartment, specifically sleeping over in the master bedroom and keeping clothes there, and that she had invited him over on the day in question to babysit their two-year-old son. Moreover, in addition to the direct evidence that appellant was present in the apartment when the police arrived, a Frederick County Detention Center identification card with appellant\u2019s picture was located on the nightstand in the bedroom, and appellant admitted that he stayed there on occasion and kept clothes in the apartment. Accordingly, there was other evidence beyond the notebook that demonstrated a strong connection between appellant and the apartment. And, to the extent that appellant\u2019s defense was that he just happened to be present when the police arrived and that the contraband belonged to someone else, a rational finder of fact could nevertheless conclude that appellant jointly and constructively possessed the items in question. <em>See Moye v. State, </em>369 Md. 2, 14, 796 A.2d 821 (2002) (\u201cThe State did not need to show that Moye exercised sole possession of the drugs and paraphernalia.

The State also noted that the penalty remained the same whether the count listed MDMA or BZP. <em>See </em>Crim. Law \u00a7 5-601 (prohibiting the possession of controlled dangerous substances and penalizing such illegal possession by up to four years\u2019 incarceration).

In that case, the defendant was charged with possession with intent to distribute marijuana and simple possession of marijuana. <em>Id. </em>at 386, 749 A.2d 769. Prior to trial, the State was allowed to amend the charge to allege that the substance was crack cocaine. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals concluded that the character of the offense changed and the amendment should not have been permitted. The Court of Appeals reasoned that changing the identity of a controlled dangerous substance changes the identity of the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 392, 749 A.2d 769. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-9\">\u201cthe identification of the particular controlled dangerous substance involved in a given offense is so inextricably tied to the critical matters of the appropriate unit of prosecution and the permissible or mandated punishment that it must be treated as an element of the offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 391, 749 A.2d 769 (quoting <em>State v.

State, </em>431 Md. 1, 63 A.3d 575 (2013) in support of his argument. The State disagrees, arguing that <em>Waker </em>is inapplicable and that <em>Stubbs v. State, </em>406 Md. 34, 956 A.2d 155 (2008) is controlling. We agree with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Appellant was arrested on April 27, 2012. The indictment against him was filed on June 1, 2012. The parties stipulated that the amount of marijuana seized in this case was .5 grams. Appellant was convicted by a jury on October 12, 2012 and then subsequently sentenced on February 21, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Earlier, on May 2, 2012 Governor Martin O\u2019Malley had signed Senate Bill 214, which repealed and reenacted with amendments the penalty provision for possession of marijuana. 2012 Md. Laws, ch. 193. The law, which took effect on October 1, 2012, was enacted for \u201cthe purpose of establishing a reduced penalty for a person convicted of the use or possession of less than a certain quantity of marijuana[.]\u201d The law added the following language to the penalty section for possession of marijuana: \u201cA person convicted of the use or possession of less than 10 grams of marijuana is subject to imprisonment not exceeding 90 days or a fine not exceeding $500 or both.\u201d <em>See </em>Crim. Law \u00a7 5-601(c)(2)(ii). Thus, this penalty provision was in effect on the day appellant was convicted and on the day of his sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">We are guided in our conclusion that appellant\u2019s sentence should be vacated by <em>Waker, supra. </em>There, on March 30, 2009, Waker committed what was then a felony theft \u2014 theft of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>property valued at more than $500, the penalty for which was, at that time, a maximum sentence of 15 years imprisonment and/or a $25,000 fine. <em>See Waker, </em>431 Md. at 5, 63 A.3d 575; Crim. Law \u00a7 7-104(g)(l) (superseded). During the 2009 session, the Maryland General Assembly amended the Maryland theft statute. <em>Waker, </em>431 Md. at 2, 63 A.3d 575. The bill, which became effective October 1, 2009, changed the dividing line between misdemeanor and felony thefts. <em>Id. </em>Under the new law, the dividing line was $1,000, with a maximum sentence for misdemeanor theft under $1,000 being 18 months, a $500 fine or both, and a maximum sentence for felony theft between $1,000 and $10,000 being 10 years, a $10,000 fine, or both. <em>See </em>Crim. Law \u00a7 7-104(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Six weeks after the law took effect, on December 11, 2009, Waker was tried on an agreed statement of facts and found guilty of theft of property having a value of $615 and sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment. <em>Waker, </em>431 Md. at 2, 63 A.3d 575. He appealed arguing that his sentence was illegal because the trial court should have applied the penalty in effect at the time of trial and sentencing, which allowed for a maximum sentence of 18 months of imprisonment and/or a $500 fine. <em>See Waker, </em>431 Md. at 6, 63 A.3d 575; Crim. Law \u00a7 7-104(g)(2). The Court of Appeals agreed, holding that it is \u201cthe penalties ... in effect at the time the trial court imposed sentence\u201d which control. <em>Id. </em>at 11, 63 A.3d 575. Thus, Waker could only be sentenced to no more than 18 months in prison and/or a $500 fine because that was the law in effect when he was sentenced. <em>Id. </em>at 13, 63 A.3d 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The State responds that <em>Waker </em>is inapplicable and that <em>Stubbs v. State, </em>406 Md. 34, 956 A.2d 155 (2008) controls. <em>Stubbs </em>concerned the Maryland General Assembly\u2019s addition in 2004 of a new provision for theft of property valued at less than $100. <em>See Stubbs, </em>406 Md. at 36, 956 A.2d 155; Crim. Law \u00a7 7-104(g)(3). Two years after the amendment went into effect, Stubbs stole a set of wrenches from Home Depot, which were valued at $139.86. <em>Stubbs, </em>406 Md. at 39, 956 A.2d 155. He was charged with theft of property valued at less than $500. <em>Id. </em>at 40, 956 A.2d 155. However, the only evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>presented at trial regarding value was that the stolen wrenches were worth $69.93. <em>Id. </em>at 40-41, 956 A.2d 155. Stubbs argued that the State should have charged him with theft of property valued at less than $100, and the State had not met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that he was guilty of theft of less than $500. <em>Id. </em>at 41-42, 956 A.2d 155. The trial court denied the motion, and upon conviction of theft under $500, sentenced him to 18 months imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 42, 956 A.2d 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The Court of Appeals affirmed Stubbs\u2019 conviction and sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 44, 956 A.2d 155. In reaching this conclusion, the Court looked to the legislative history and the language of the 2004 amendment to the theft statute. Specifically, the Court looked to the recommendations of an appointed ad hoc committee formed to analyze jury prayers from the district court. The committee concluded that more matters would be resolved at the district court level if the State had greater discretion in charging certain misdemeanors. <em>Id. </em>at 45, 956 A.2d 155. The Court additionally noted that, unless the offense of theft under $100 was specifically charged by the State, the offense was not be a lesser included offense of theft of property. <em>Id. </em>at 47, 956 A.2d 155; <em>see also </em>Crim. Law \u00a7 7-108(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\"><em>Stubbs </em>is distinguishable from appellant\u2019s case. The issue there concerned the charging of a crime and penalty imposed. Here, we are only concerned with the penalty imposed. Moreover, the purposes of the amended statutes differ. In <em>Stubbs, </em>the purpose of amending the penalty provision of the theft statute was jurisdictional \u2014 to give the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office the discretion to bring certain theft cases in district court rather than the circuit court. Here, the purpose of amending the penalty provision for possession of marijuana was to decriminalize and reduce the penalties for possession of small amounts of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">For the above reasons, we are persuaded that trial court erred in imposing a sentence of one year on appellant\u2019s possession of .5 grams of marijuana. Accordingly, we shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>vacate that sentence and remand for re-sentencing. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8 \u2014 604(d)(2) (\u201cIn a criminal case, if the appellate court reverses the judgment for error in the sentence or sentencing proceeding, the Court shall remand the case for resentencing\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Finally, appellant contends that his sentence for possession of a firearm in nexus to a drug trafficking crime, pursuant to Crim.

Law \u00a7 5-621.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-17\">At the time of sentencing in this case, P.S. \u00a7 5-206 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-18\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 A person may not possess a rifle or shotgun if the person was previously convicted of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-19\">(1) a crime of violence; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>(2) a violation of \u00a7 5-602, \u00a7 5-603, \u00a7 5-604, \u00a7 5-605, \u00a7 5-612, \u00a7 5-613, or \u00a7 5-614 of the Criminal Law Article; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">(3) an offense under the laws of another state or the United States that would constitute one of the crimes listed in item (1) or (2) of this subsection if committed in this State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">(b) <em>Penalty. </em>\u2014 A person who violates this section is guilty of a felony and on conviction is subject to imprisonment not exceeding 15 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">(c) <em>Violation is separate crime. </em>\u2014 Each violation of this subsection is a separate crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">P.S. \u00a7 5-206.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">Clearly, the offenses do not merge under the required evidence test. \u201cUnder federal double jeopardy principles and Maryland merger law, \u2018the principal test for determining the identity of offenses is the required evidence test.\u2019 The required evidence test prohibits separate sentences for each offense if only one offense requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u201d <em>Christian v. State, </em>405 Md. 306, 321, 951 A.2d 832 (2008) (quoting <em>Dixon v. State, </em>364 Md. 209, 236-37, 772 A.2d 283 (2001)). Each offense in this case includes different elements. For instance, Crim. Law \u00a7 5-621 requires the illegal possession of a firearm to be in connection with a drug trafficking offense. P.S. \u00a7 5-206 requires the illegal possession of a rifle or shotgun to be by a person previously convicted of a disqualifying offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">Recognizing this, appellant contends the sentences merge under the rule of lenity or the principle of fundamental fairness. This Court stated the rule of lenity as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeE\">\u201cEven though two offenses do not merge under the required evidence test, there are nevertheless times when the offenses will not be punished separately. Two crimes created by legislative enactment may not be punished separately if the legislature intended for the offenses to be punished by one sentence. It is when we are uncertain whether the legislature intended one or more than one sentence that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>make use of an aid to statutory interpretation known as the \u2018rule of lenity.\u2019 Under that rule, if we are unsure of the legislative intent in punishing offenses as a single merged crime or as distinct offenses, we, in effect, give the defendant the benefit of the doubt and hold that the crimes do merge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><em>Clark v. State, </em>188 Md.App. 185, 207-208, 981 A.2d 710 (2009) (quoting <em>Monoker v. State, </em>321 Md. 214, 222, 582 A.2d 525 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The prior version of Crim. Law \u00a7 5-621, Article 27 \u00a7 281A, a statute that did not prohibit the mere possession of a firearm in connection with a drug trafficking offense, was enacted in 1989 as part of the Drug Kingpin Act. As the Court of Appeals explained in considering that prior version:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">Its purpose was \u201cto reduce the supply of drugs in Maryland by establishing harsher penalties for drug dealers and by decreasing the profitability of participation in a drug trafficking crime.\u201d Floor Report for S.B. 400. That purpose is similar to that attending the passage, in 1971, of the Maryland Controlled Dangerous Substance Act: \u201cto turn the screw of the criminal machinery \u2014 detection, prosecution and punishment \u2014 tighter and tighter.\u201d <em>Cunningham v. State, </em>318 Md. 182, 189 [567 A.2d 126] (1989).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-7\"><em>Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 150-51, 626 A.2d 946 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">The Floor Report for the Senate Bill continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-9\">The firearms component of the bill is based on the recognition that firearms are readily available and that those involved in drug trafficking crimes are quite willing to use such weapons to resolve disputes with their rivals or their customers. Testimony indicated that there has over the years been a dramatic increase in the number of drug related homicides especially among innocent victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">Floor Report, Senate Bill 400, Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">P.S. \u00a7 5-206 was enacted in 2011 as part of the Restrictions Against Use and Possession of Firearms. 2011 Md. Laws chs. 164, 165. The bill was designed to close loopholes in the Public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Safety article to ensure that the penalties applicable to illegal use and possession of handguns also applied equally to those that used or possessed rifles or shotguns:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">This bill brings state law closer to federal law, under 18 U.S.C. Section 922, which prohibits the possession of any firearm or ammunition by a person convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Fiscal and Policy Note (Revised), Senate Bill 174, Department of Legislative Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Much of the Senate Bill concerned expanding the prohibition of the illegal use of handguns to rifles and shotguns. Testimony in support of companion House Bill 241 also acknowledged the need to expand prohibition of illegal possession to these sorts of weapons. For instance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">We believe this legislation is needed, as part of that broader strategy, to increase the probability that an arrest for illegal gun possession will result in convictions that will take criminals off the street and serve as a deterrent, which is missing today, against future violent crimes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">Testimony in Support of House Bill 241 by Presidents of Johns Hopkins University, University of Maryland, and Morgan State University, House Judiciary Committee (March 8, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">Further, the House Judiciary Committee heard the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-11\">Baltimore\u2019s efforts to reduce illegal gun possession could yield greater reductions in shootings if offenders convicted of illegal gun possession face stiffer penalties. Last year, 44% of Baltimore\u2019s homicide suspects had prior arrests for illegal gun possession. But too many of these offenders spent little time in jail following convictions. Research has shown that the number of prior gun offenses is one of the best predictors for which offenders subsequently murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-12\">Studies which have examined the effects of sentence enhancements for illegal gun possession on city crime rates have found that these policies tend to lead to reductions in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>gun violence. When cities combine stiffer sentences for gun crime with focused deterrence of illegal gun possession research has shown even more dramatic reductions in homicide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Testimony in Support of House Bill 241 by Daniel W. Webster, Professor and Co-Director, Center for Gun Policy and Research, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, House Judiciary Committee (March 8, 2011) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Additionally, there was the following testimony from the Baltimore City Police Commissioner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">[T]he bill expands the current prohibition against the possession of regulated firearms to include long guns and shotguns by those persons who have previously been convicted of a crime of violence and CDS felony crimes and strengthens the current penalty provision associated with this crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">* <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">While the bill would have statewide applicability, it will have a significant impact in Baltimore City. In 2010, the Baltimore Police Department seized 647 long guns which accounted for over 27% of the total firearms recovered. Since 2008, the Department has seized over 2000 long guns and 98 assault weapons. Each year there are incidents, including the crimes of aggravated assault and robbery, which are perpetrated with long guns, shotguns, or assault weapons ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-10\">... Maryland law (PS 5 \u2014 133(c)) currently penalizes only the possession of a regulated firearm (handguns and assault weapons) when possessed by prohibited offenders and there is no similar provision in Maryland law if a prohibited person possesses a shotgun or long gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-11\">The expansion of the prohibitions proposed in HB 241 to include all firearms and the revisions to the sentencing structure would also support Baltimore\u2019s efforts to crack down on illegal guns and gun violence. Maryland has the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>responsibility to keep all firearms from convicted felons and to impose strong penalties that take into consideration the prior criminal history of these offenders for these violations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7M\">Testimony of Frederick H. Bealefeld, III, Baltimore City Police Commissioner, in Support of House Bill 241, House Judiciary Committee (March 8, 2011) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">We have found nothing in the legislative history suggesting that the General Assembly meant for these two offenses, Crim. Law \u00a7 5-621, and P.S. \u00a7 5-206, to merge under the rule of lenity. Both laws were enacted to expand criminal culpability for the illegal possession of firearms under their respective circumstances. As the Court of Appeals has stated, \u201cit is most unlikely that the General Assembly would promulgate, on the one hand, a statutory scheme designed, in part, to increase sentences, while, on the other hand, and at the same time, intending that the doctrine of merger would apply and, thereby, reduce the total sentences.\u201d <em>Pye v. State, </em>397 Md. 626, 637, 919 A.2d 632 (2007). Indeed, the sentencing structure of both offenses are distinct, as Crim. Law \u00a7 5-621 calls for mandatory minimum sentences while P.S. \u00a7 5-206 provides for up to 15 years and specifically mandates that each violation of that subsection is a separate crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Moreover, as argued by the State, <em>Johnson v. State, </em>154 Md.App. 286, 839 A.2d 769 (2003), is instructive. There, this Court declined to merge sentences for use of a firearm in relation to drug trafficking and the unlawful wearing, carrying, or transporting of a handgun, under either the required evidence test or as a result of legislative intent. <em>Johnson, </em>154 Md.App. at 311, 839 A.2d 769. Indeed, what this Court stated in regards to the handgun offense at issue in <em>Johnson </em>applies equally here to the illegal possession of a rifle offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">The rule of lenity, however, applies only when criminal statutes are ambiguous. There is no ambiguity in these statutes. The Legislature\u2019s concern about the use and possession of handguns, and its additional concern about the aggravating circumstance of weapons being used by persons transacting in drugs, is apparent. Because we are persuad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>ed that the Legislature intended to authorize the imposition of a separate punishment for each of the offenses at issue, Judge Hennegan did not err or abuse his discretion when he refused to merge appellant\u2019s \u201cunlawful wearing\u201d and \u201cuse\u201d convictions for purposes of sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 312, 839 A.2d 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Nor are we persuaded that the sentences merge under principles of fundamental fairness. Indeed, we question whether this argument was properly presented to us considering that, other than a brief citation to the doctrine, appellant has not adequately briefed the issue. <em>See Bert v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>215 Md.App. 244, 269 n. 15, 81 A.3d 460 (2013) (\u201cAppellant\u2019s \u2018argument\u2019 could also be rejected out of hand because it is inadequately briefed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">In any event, were we to consider the doctrine, the Court of Appeals has explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-8\">[i]n deciding whether fundamental fairness requires merger, we have looked to whether the two crimes are \u201cpart and parcel\u201d of one another, such that one crime is \u201can integral component\u201d of the other. <em>Monoker, </em>321 Md. at 22 [223, 582 A.2d 525]. This inquiry is \u201cfact-driven\u201d because it depends on considering the circumstances surrounding a defendant\u2019s convictions, not solely the mere elements of the crimes. <em>Pair v. State, </em>202 Md.App. 617, 645 [33 A.3d 1024] (2011).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-9\"><em>Carroll v. State, </em>428 Md. 679, 694-95, 53 A.3d 1159 (2012) (internal parallel citations omitted). Illegal possession of a rifle by a person previously convicted of a disqualifying offense is not \u201cpart and parcel\u201d of a case of illegal possession of a firearm under sufficient circumstances to constitute a nexus to a drug trafficking crime. One could be convicted under either statute standing alone. And, under the circumstances of this case, including, but not limited to the presence of appellant\u2019s two-year-old child in an apartment containing drugs and a loaded rifle, we are not persuaded that it was fundamentally unfair to separately sentence appellant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>THE CONVICTION ON COUNT 5, POSSESSION OF BZP, REVERSED.
