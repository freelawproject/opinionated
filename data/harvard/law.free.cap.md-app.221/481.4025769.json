Ms. Tung, then an employee of the Firm, served as lead counsel in those matters and Mr. Robinson as back-up counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The subject matter of the suit ends up not being important for our purposes, though \u2014 between failures of service and failure to state a claim, and notwithstanding the volume of paper filed in the case, the suit never got past the initial pleading stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>The circuit court dismissed the Firm\u2019s claims against both appellees with prejudice after finding that the Firm\u2019s initial (and later amended) complaint failed to state a claim against the BIO Defendants and that the Firm failed to effect service of process on Ms. Tung. On appeal, the Firm challenges these findings and raises for the first time issues concerning the appearance of impropriety in the circuit court. We find that the Firm failed to preserve its impropriety argument, reject the Firm\u2019s other arguments, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The Firm filed its initial complaint against Ms. Tung, Mr. Robinson, and BIO on December 16, 2011.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It filed two versions of the complaint \u2014 one titled \u201cCOMPLAINT (NOW-CONFIDENTIAL)\u201d (the \u201cNon-Confidential Complaint\u201d) and the other titled \u201cCOMPLAINT (CONFIDENTIAL)\u201d (the \u201cConfidential Complaint\u201d) \u2014 and explained in each version that only the Non-Confidential Complaint, which contained only a brief description of the parties and the claims, would be served on Ms. Tung and BIO. The Firm declined to serve the Confidential Complaint, which it claimed to have filed under seal, because it contained \u201cextensive attorney-client and other extremely confidential information\u201d regarding Technical Fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>niture.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">On December 21, 2011, the circuit court issued original process directed to each defendant, which would expire 120 days after issuance (on April 19, 2012). The Firm, however, made no effort to serve the defendants in that time frame or for two months after the 120-day period expired. On May 24, 2012, as a result of the Firm\u2019s failure to effect service, the court issued a Notification of Contemplated Dismissal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-507, this [proceeding] will be \u201cDISMISSED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION OR PROSECUTION WITHOUT PREJUDICE,\u201d 30 days after service of this notice unless, prior to that time, a written motion showing good cause to defer the entry of an order of dismissal is filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">On June 18, 2012, the Firm requested that the court reissue summonses, which it did that day. Then, on June 22, the Firm filed a Notice of Service, explaining that each defendant had been served with summons and the <em>Non-Confidential </em>Complaint. That same day, the Firm also filed its Response to Rule 2-507 Notification and Motion to Defer Dismissal, in which it explained that it intentionally delayed the filing of its complaint to protect the interests of its client, Technical Furniture, and that it only filed the complaint when it did \u201cbecause [filing] was necessitated by the statute of limitations.\u201d It continued that the Firm \u201cwas delayed in proceeding [with service] ... for the same reason as the delays in the initial filing, that it was protecting client interests and advocating on their behalf, all on related matters that effected [sic ] and impacted the causes of action in the instant lawsuit.\u201d On this basis, the Firm requested that the court defer dismiss<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>al, recognize that the Non-Confidential Complaint had been served, and stay the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">On July 16, 2012, Ms. Tung filed a Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Rule 2-322(a), alleging insufficiency of process and service. She contended that the Firm, on June 19, 2012, delivered to her an incomplete copy of its complaint (the Non-Confidential Complaint), and that she had yet to be served with a complete copy of the complaint (the Confidential Complaint). She argued that as a party to the litigation, she was \u201centitled to access under Maryland Rule 16 \u2014 1002(f)\u201d to a full and complete copy of the complaint. The Firm never responded to this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">On July 24, 2012, the Firm filed a Motion to Stay, asking the court to stay the case until a similar case, involving <em>\u201cjoint clients of both </em>[the Firm] and Defendants,\u201d was resolved. (Emphasis in original.) The Firm contended that the court in the related case \u201cissued an Order sealing all confidential client-related documents,\u201d and that \u201c[fjactual and legal issues, including the amount of damages, are likely to be decided in [the related case], that affect the issues to be resolved in the instant lawsuit.\u201d Ms. Tung\u2019s response to the Firm\u2019s Motion to Stay, filed on July 30, 2012, incorporated her previously-filed Motion to Dismiss, noted that she <em>still </em>had not been served a complete copy of the complaint, and asked the court to rule on her Motion to Dismiss instead of staying the case. The court denied the Motion to Stay on August 6, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">On August 20, 2012, Ms. Tung filed an opposition to the Firm\u2019s Motion to Defer Dismissal. She reiterated there much of what she had already argued: <em>first, </em>that the Firm had made no effort to serve the defendants with process for six months after filing its complaint; <em>second, </em>that the Firm only attempted to serve the defendants at all after the court issued the Notice of Contemplated Dismissal; <em>third, </em>that the Firm still had not served a complete copy of the complaint on the defendants; <em>fourth, </em>that the Firm had not demonstrated good cause for its delay; and <em>finally, </em>that she had been prejudiced by the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>On August 28, 2012, the circuit court entered an order denying Ms. Tung\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, but found the Firm\u2019s initial service attempt (of the Non-Confidential Complaint) insufficient. Instead of dismissing the case, the court gave the Firm another opportunity to serve Ms. Tung:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">ORDERED, that [the Firm] shall re-serve a copy of the Complaint and all accompanying papers upon [Ms. Tung] and submit a new affidavit of service to the Court within ten (10) days from the date this Order is docketed. <em>If [the Firm] fails to comply with this Order, this action will be dismissed.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">(Emphasis added.) The BIO Defendants had also moved to dismiss on the same grounds raised by Ms. Tung on August 22, 2012, and on September 5, 2012, the court entered an identical order with respect to them. But despite these orders, the Firm never served Ms. Tung or the BIO Defendants directly. Instead, on September 6 and 7, the Firm served summons and the Confidential Complaint on <em>counsel </em>for each party.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">On September 28, 2012, the court entered an order noting the Firm\u2019s failure to comply with its September 5, 2012 Order concerning the BIO Defendants and dismissing the case without prejudice as to them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">Upon review of the file, the Court finds that an Order was entered on September 5, 2012, requiring [the Firm] to file a new affidavit of service on [the BIO Defendants]. [The Firm] has failed to comply as directed. Therefore, this 26th day of September, 2012, by the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, hereby ORDERED, that [the Firm\u2019s] Complaint is dismissed without prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">The court did not mention whether the case was being dismissed with respect to Ms. Tung.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">On October 11, 2012, the Firm filed a Motion for Reconsideration requesting that the court revisit its dismissal of claims against the BIO Defendants entered on September 26, 2012. The Firm argued that its service on the BIO Defendants\u2019 <em>counsel </em>was sufficient and that dismissal was inappropriate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>The Firm reasoned that service on counsel was appropriate because the BIO Defendants \u201caccepted and acknowledged service, and that ... Defendants had responded to the Complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">On October 24, 2012, Ms. Tung\u2019s counsel wrote a letter to Judge Davis-Loomis, the County Administrative Judge, asking that the case be specially assigned to a single judge to hear all open motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">On October 31, 2012, before the court specially assigned the case, Ms. Tung filed a Motion to Dismiss for Failure to Comply with Terms of the Court\u2019s August 28, 2012 Order. The August 28, 2012 Order had directed the Firm to re-serve Ms. Tung with the <em>Confidential </em>Complaint within ten days of entry, but, as we explained, the Firm served <em>counsel </em>for Ms. Tung, not Ms. Tung herself. Ms. Tung argued that the Firm failed to comply with the August 28, 2012 Order because she never agreed to allow her counsel to accept service on her behalf, and that dismissal was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">The circuit court, through Judge Goetzke, entered an order on November 19, 2012, addressing both the Firm\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration of the September 26, 2012 Order (filed on October 11, 2012) and Ms. Tung\u2019s Motion to Dismiss for Failure to Comply with the August 28, 2012 Order. Judge Goetzke explained that the court \u201cdetermined that, as of the date of this Order, it has no <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over any defendant in [the] matter\u201d and gave the Firm another chance to effect service:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">ORDERED, that this case is dismissed without prejudice as to all [defendants]; and it is,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-9\">ORDERED, that [the Firm] may request one additional summons pursuant to Rule 2-122(a) for each Defendant, provided the request is not made later than 7 days from the date on which this Order is docketed[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] (\u201cFinal Summons\u201d); and it is,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>ORDERED, that this dismissal shall be stricken as to any Defendant over whom the court acquires <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction as a result of service pursuant to Rule 2-121 of the Final Summons for that Defendant; and it is,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABK\">ORDERED, that on request of a Defendant, an order of dismissal <em>with prejudice </em>shall be filed as to any Defendant over whom the court has not acquired <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction as set forth in the preceding paragraph.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">(Underlining supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Shortly thereafter, on December 5, 2012, Judge DavisLoomis entered an Assignment Order assigning the case to Judge Caroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">On January 28, 2013, the Firm filed an Affidavit of Service stating that \u201cthe Defendants were previously served the Confidential Complaint on September 6th and 7th, 2012,\u201d and providing documentation of subsequent service on counsel between January 22 and 24, 2013. The Firm concluded that \u201c[a]ll <em>counsel </em>have been served.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">That same day, Judge Caroom, now specially assigned to the case, held a hearing on the open motions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The parties discussed the November 19, 2012 Order issued by Judge Goetzke that dismissed the case without prejudice and provided the Firm one additional chance to serve the defendants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_k\">[COUNSEL FOR MS. TUNG]: ... I would point out ... that Judge Goetzke\u2019s order from November 21 said that Judge Goetzke had considered the motion for reconsideration and that as of that date the Court determined that, as of November 21, it had no in personam jurisdiction over any defendant after having considered the motion for reconsideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>And then went [on to] order [the Firm], with regard to all Defendants, to have summonses reissued within seven days. And then indicated that, upon request of the Defendant, an order for dismissal with prejudice would be filed as to any defendant as to whom service had not been acquired under, as Judge Goetzke termed it, in a defined term, the final summons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">THE COURT: And set a deadline of January ... 28, meaning it needed to be done before today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">[COUNSEL FOR MS. TUNG]: Right. Well, they needed to be issued by [November 28] and ... that has not occurred. The same thing occurred with the motion for reconsideration. There were exhibits from [the Firm] saying we mailed them to counsel for Ms. Tung. <em>Mailing to counsel of the summons is not service.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">Judge Goetzke ordered that they be served pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-121. And Maryland Rule 2-121 expressly delineates the means of service, as I am sure you are aware, and mailing them to counsel is not service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">(Emphasis added.) In response, the Firm argued that its service of the Confidential Complaint and Final Summons shortly before the hearing satisfied Judge Goetzke\u2019s Order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeU\">[COUNSEL FOR THE FIRM]:[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] I served personally last week via certified mail all the Defendants. I have green cards right here with their signatures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">Last week, I did file an affidavit of service with the Court for both cases, Conwell Law and Technical Furniture Group. I have a copy of the Technical Furniture Group case with the date stamped right here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-10\">I would also like to point out, first of all, it was the confidential complaint that was served in January to all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Defendants. I would also like to mention that this was not\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-4\">THE COURT: Meaning for which you have the green cards?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">[COUNSEL FOR THE FIRM]: Yes. Yes, that is what this is from.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">THE COURT: Okay, so let me invite you to show \u2014 I am not sure if they have seen it any more than I have, the green cards and the return of service that you are preparing to file today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">[COUNSEL FOR MS. TUNG]:[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] Your Honor, I think the misunderstanding here is that these green cards show that \u2014 well, read it. I don\u2019t know if it is a misunderstanding or not. I thought I made all positions clear. <em>The green cards reflect certified mail, me and my partner.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-8\">THE COURT: <em>Not to the parties individually?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-9\">[COUNSEL FOR MS. TUNG]: <em>Not to the party. </em>And mailing or delivery by a process server or by certified mail, the counsel is not serviced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-10\">THE COURT: Okay. So let me go back to [Counsel for the Firm]. I thought you just said that it was \u2014 that these were green cards signed by each of the Defendants individually.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6iE\">[COUNSEL FOR THE FIRM]: I am sorry. <em>It was not by the Defendants, by defense counsel, </em>given that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-11\">THE COURT: By counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-12\">[COUNSEL FOR THE FIRM]: \u2014 % <em>counsel. That is correct.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">(Emphasis added.) The parties then discussed whether service upon counsel satisfied Rule 2-121(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-14\">[COUNSEL FOR THE FIRM]: Given that all counsel had entered appearances with regard to each of those cases. It seemed, under the rule, that counsel could be served direct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>ly. Counsel of record, you know, in the system, and had to represent their clients with regard to these cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABz\">[COUNSEL FOR MS. TUNG]: Well, let me just point out, Your Honor, that only, as Maryland Rule 2-321(a) states, \u201cOnly documents other than original pleadings in process can be served on counsel, after counsel has entered an appearance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">And Maryland Rule 2-121 (a) specifically sets forth the three types of in personam service. Delivery to the person to be served, or leaving it at the person\u2019s dwelling, house, or usual place of abode with a person, the resident of a suitable age or discretion, or mailing to the person to be served a copy of the summons, complaint, et cetera, et cetera, by a certified mail return receipt requested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The Firm\u2019s counsel argued in response that service on counsel was appropriate because he had received letters from counsel for the Defendants \u201c[t]hat specifically stated that they would agree to accept [service],\u201d and that counsel had been representing and acting as agents for their clients in this case. But when asked by the court to produce the letters, counsel could not do so, and Ms. Tung\u2019s counsel pointed out that \u201cthere is no correspondence from [them] agreeing to accept service.\u201d At the same time, however, counsel for the BIO Defendants <em>did </em>acknowledge such an agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">[COUNSEL FOR BIO DEFENDANTS]: We will accept service of the [Firm] complaint, because we prefer to have it decided on the merits. We are just going to move to dismiss, but at the appropriate time. So that is fine. We will accept service and move to dismiss at the appropriate time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">Ms. Tung then asked the court to dismiss the Firm\u2019s claim with prejudice because the Firm failed to comply with Judge Goetzke\u2019s November 19, 2012 Order, which provided that a defendant could request dismissal with prejudice if the Firm failed to complete service upon that defendant. The court agreed to do so:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-9\">THE COURT: Okay. Obviously [the Firm\u2019s counsel], your position was that Ms. Tung\u2019s counsel agreed to accept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>service also, but since today is the motion hearing, we don\u2019t have the document confirming that. I am inclined to grant their motion to make it as to this timely dismissal with prejudice and to direct the Court to put in the hearing sheet that the [BIO Defendants] ... have agreed to accept service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">The court also noted that it would consider altering the order if the Firm\u2019s counsel produced the letter in which Ms. Tung\u2019s counsel agreed to accept service on her behalf:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-5\">THE COURT: If [the Firm\u2019s counsel] go back to the office and they find the missing letters in which counsel for Mary Tung say we agree to accept service of the full complaint, then there could be a motion to reconsider on the motion to reconsider, but I am not going to, at this point, hold my breath on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-6\">We will assume that the ruling that I just made is what is going to be going on with this case going forward.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">On January 30, 2013, Judge Caroom entered an order noting the court\u2019s denial of the Firm\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration and the BIO Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss (reasoning that counsel for each had \u201cagreed to accept service on behalf of the defendants\u201d), and its decision to grant Ms. Tung\u2019s Motion to Dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">On February 20, 2013, the BIO Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss, alleging that the Firm failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, or in the alternative, that, as a result of Ms. Tung\u2019s dismissal, the Firm had failed to properly join a necessary party. That same day, the Firm filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the January 30, 2013 Order, arguing that dismissal of its suit against Ms. Tung was inappropriate. Ms. Tung filed an Opposition to the Firm\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration on March 8, 2013.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>The circuit court held a hearing on these motions on March 18, 2013. During the hearing, the trial judge walked through the timeline of this case, found no justification for the delay in service, presumed prejudice from the delay, and ultimately denied the Firm\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration and dismissed its suit against Ms. Tung <em>with </em>prejudice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-5\">[THE COURT]: ... In this case, the [Firm] case, the Court thinks that it is very comparable to the situation in <em>Reed v. Cagan, </em>128 Md.App. 641 [739 A.2d 932 (1999) ], where there was no real explanation for the initial delay [in service], as filed in late 2011.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">Summonses are issued. Nothing happens for six months. The Court issues the notice of contemplated dismissal. The Defense moves to dismiss for lack of service. There are two motions to dismiss, which are considered by the Court in August and September for different Defendants, each giving additional time for service. That additional time for service is not used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-7\">There are two dismissals, September 28th, ... November 21st. Those dismissals were [without] prejudice. But again, potentially with the opportunity to seek to reopen and reserve.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-8\">So in effect the Court has given many, many warnings in this case that the case could be dismissed, the [Firm] versus Tung, for lack of adequate service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-9\">And in terms of whether there is some justification for the delay, the Court really doesn\u2019t find any justification for the delay, <em>because all of the problems were problems basically of Plaintiffs\u2019 own making.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-10\"><em>The delay was your own making. </em>The private [versus] public version of the complaint, or confidential or non-confidential version of the complaint, however you want to call it, <em>the issue was of your own making.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-11\">The, I think, misconstrue [sic] of the communications with counsel as to whether they would accept service or serve themselves and just take notice of what was in the Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>file instead of actually receiving it as required by the rules, <em>was a problem of your oum making.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-4\">The Court asked if you had written documentation that counsel had agreed to accept some other arrangement and that has not been provided to the Court\u2019s satisfaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\"><em>So I think really there is no justification for the delay. The prejudice is presumed </em>\u2014 the Court could infer actual prejudice in terms of all of the legal services that the Defense has had to pay for, just litigating on this one issue, <em>all of Plaintiffs\u2019 making.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">So the Court is going to deny the motion to reconsider in the Firm [versus] Tung case.... And recognize that that dismissal has become one which is <em>with prejudice </em>after the passage of more than 30 days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">(Emphasis added.) On March 22, 2013, Judge Caroom entered an order denying the Firm\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration, dismissing the Firm\u2019s case against Ms. Tung, and dismissing the Firm\u2019s case against the BIO Defendants for failure to state a claim and based on the dismissal of Ms. Tung, all dismissals with prejudice. The Firm appealed from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">The Firm raises the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-10\">1. Whether the Appellees had been served and jurisdiction had been conferred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-11\">2. Whether the trial judge erred in his two orders dismissing the case against all Appellees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-12\">3. Whether the combined actions of two judges gave the appearance of impropriety, partiality, and prejudicial influence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-13\">We affirm the circuit court\u2019s decision to dismiss the Firm\u2019s complaint against both Ms. Tung and the BIO Defendants. The Firm did not effect proper service upon Ms. Tung, and despite multiple opportunities, the Firm failed to cure this jurisdictional defect, so dismissal was proper under both Rules 2-121(a) and 2-507(b). And although the Firm effected ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>vice upon the BIO Defendants, the court appropriately dismissed its complaint for failure to state a claim because the complaint failed to address a necessary predicate of its legal malpractice claim \u2014 the existence of an attorney-client relationship between the Firm and the BIO Defendants.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Finally, the Firm failed to preserve the issue of judicial impropriety for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">A. The Circuit Court Properly Dismissed The Firm\u2019s Claims Against Ms. Tung For Insufficient Service Of Process.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">\u201c \u2018It is fundamental that before a court may impose upon a defendant a personal liability or obligation in favor of the plaintiff or may extinguish a personal right of the defendant it must have first obtained jurisdiction over the person of the defendant.\u2019\u201d <em>Flanagan v. Dep\u2019t of Human Res., </em>412 Md. 616, 623-24, 989 A.2d 1139 (2010) (quoting <em>Lohman v. Lohman, </em>331 Md. 113, 125, 626 A.2d 384 (1993)).

The Firm did not effectively serve process on Ms. Tung.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The Firm contends that no jurisdictional defect existed, and that dismissal was improper, because Ms. Tung and her counsel had been personally served with summons. The Firm made three attempts to serve Ms. Tung: <em>first, </em>on June 19, 2012, by delivery of the Non-Confidential Complaint to Ms. Tung; <em>second, </em>on September 6 and 7, 2012, by delivery of the Confidential Complaint to Ms. Tung\u2019s counsel; and <em>third, </em>on January 18, 2013, again by delivery of the Confidential Complaint to Ms. Tung\u2019s counsel. But for the circuit court to obtain personal jurisdiction over Ms. Tung, the Firm was required to effect service of process in accordance with Rule 2-121(a). <em>See Lohman, </em>331 Md. at 130, 626 A.2d 384:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">Service of process may be made ... (1) by delivering to the person to be served a copy of the summons, complaint, and all other papers filed with it; (2) if the person to be served is an individual, by leaving a copy of the summons, complaint, and all other papers filed with it at the individual\u2019s dwelling house or usual place of abode with a resident of suitable age and discretion; or (3) by mailing to the person to be served a copy of the summon, complaint, and all other papers filed with it by certified mail requesting: \u201cRestricted Delivery \u2014 show to whom, date, address of delivery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Md. Rule 2-121(a). None of the Firm\u2019s attempts to serve Ms. Tung complied with this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The Firm\u2019s first attempt to serve Ms. Tung \u2014 delivery of the summons and Non-Confidential Complaint to her \u2014 did not amount to effective service. Effective service under Rule 2-121(a) requires delivery of \u201ca copy of the summons, <em>complaint, </em>and all other papers filed with it.\u201d Md. Rule 2-121(a) (emphasis added). Delivery of the Non-Confidential Complaint did not satisfy this rule because that version of the complaint was not the complete version of the complaint filed with the court. Service of the complaint filed with the court is necessary because \u201c \u2018[t]he purpose of service of process is to give the defendant fair notice of the action against him and the resulting fair opportunity to be heard.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mooring v. Kaufman, </em>297 Md. 342, 350, 466 A.2d 872 (1983) (quoting 1964 Md. Laws, Chap. 95); <em>see also West Coast Theater Corp. v. City of Portland, </em>897 F.2d 1519, 1529 (9th Cir.1990) (\u201c[Sjervice of an incomplete draft complaint which was seven pages shorter than the complaint filed cannot be deemed to constitute compliance with [Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m) <footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] because that Rule requires service of the filed complaint.\u201d). The Non-Confidential Complaint, although also filed with the court, contained only \u201ca description of the parties and the claims for notice purposes,\u201d and could not provide Ms. Tung with fair notice of the action against her. Only the Confidential Complaint could provide such notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The Firm\u2019s second and third attempts to serve Ms. Tung\u2014 delivery of the summons and Confidential Complaint to her counsel \u2014 also did not amount to effective service. Although a plaintiff, in certain circumstances, can serve an individual by service upon an agent, that agent must be <em>\u201cauthorized </em>by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>appointment or by law to receive service of process for that individual,\u201d Md. Rule 2-124(b) (emphasis added), and no such authorization existed here. Although, at the January 28, 2013 hearing, the Firm claimed to have received a letter from Ms. Tung\u2019s counsel agreeing to accept service on her behalf, the Firm could not produce evidence of Ms. Tung\u2019s authorization when the court asked for it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">THE COURT: Let me ask you to go \u2014 and if you are saying that there is correspondence from counsel by which they agree to accept service, go ahead and pull that out and we can make that an exhibit for today. Show it to opposing counsel and see if they agree or have anything else that the Court should consider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">(Pause.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">[COUNSEL FOR THE FIRM]: Your Honor, obviously we have a lot of paperwork to go through.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">[COUNSEL FOR THE FIRM]: It appears we don\u2019t have the letter with us in Court right now, Your Honor. However, we would be happy to go back to our office with the more complete record and provide that to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-9\">[COUNSEL FOR MS. TUNG]: On behalf of my firm, Your Honor. This represents Ms. Tung. You know, there is no correspondence from us agreeing to accept service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">And without authorization from Ms. Tung that her counsel could be served on her behalf, the Firm\u2019s attempts to serve her counsel were ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">The Firm also argues that service of the Confidential Complaint on Ms. Tung\u2019s counsel was proper because counsel had entered a general appearance. This argument flows from an incorrect legal premise. An attorney\u2019s appearance on behalf of a client affects only filing of pleadings <em>other than </em>original pleadings. Service of an <em>original pleading, </em>\u201cthe first pleading filed in an action against a defendant,\u201d Md. Rule l-202(s), is governed by Rule 2-121(a), the rule applicable to service of process. <em>See Francz v. Francz, </em>157 Md.App. 676, 688, 853 A.2d 839 (2004). Service of pleadings and papers <em>other than original pleadings, </em>on the other hand, is governed by Rule 1-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>321, which does, in fact, permit service upon an attorney who has entered an appearance. <em>See </em>Rule l-321(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Here, the Firm argues that its service of the Confidential Complaint, its <em>original </em>pleading, was properly made on counsel because counsel had entered an appearance. But, as we explained, the rules governing service of process (applicable to service of original pleadings, <em>see Francz, </em>157 Md.App. at 688, 853 A.2d 839) do not permit service of an individual by service upon counsel without prior authorization. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-124(b). So even if Ms. Tung\u2019s counsel had entered an appearance, and we make no findings in that regard, the Firm still needed to serve the Confidential Complaint on Ms. Tung herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The Firm\u2019s failure to effect service on Ms. Tung left the circuit court without personal jurisdiction over her. The only other possible avenue through which the court could obtain personal jurisdiction was through a waiver of service and consent by Ms. Tung. <em>See Flanagan, </em>412 Md. at 624, 989 A.2d 1139 (\u201c[Tjhere can be no judgment nor decree <em>in personam </em>unless the defendant has been notified of the proceedings by proper summons, for the court has no jurisdiction over him until such service is properly accomplished, or is waived by a voluntary appearance by the defendant, either personally or through a duly authorized attorney.\u201d (quoting <em>Lohman, </em>331 Md. at 130, 626 A.2d 384)). As we explain next, no such waiver or consent occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">2. Ms. Tung did not consent to jurisdiction or waive her right to service of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The Firm argues next that \u201c[j]urisdiction is conferred [and objections to service issues are waived] when a party makes a voluntary appearance,\u201d and that Ms. Tung entered a voluntary appearance through two avenues: <em>first, </em>by failing to comply with Rule 2-322(a), which, according to the Firm, \u201crequires that no motion or pleading ... be filed before any motion to dismiss is filed\u201d; and <em>second, </em>by filing \u201ca pleading addressing in any way any subject other than jurisdiction.\u201d The Firm\u2019s arguments are premised upon both an incorrect timeline of this case and a misunderstanding of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Assuming for the moment that the Firm was correct (which, as detailed below, is not the case), the Firm would have to establish that Ms. Tung filed a pleading or motion<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> before she filed her Rule 2-322(a) Motion to Dismiss. In support of this argument, the Firm contends that \u201cthe first pleading filed by [Ms.] Tung was an Opposition to Motion to Defer Dismissal. Thus, as of August [20], 2012 when that motion was filed and served, [Ms.] Tung had waived Rule 2-322(a) defenses and had voluntarily consented to the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d The docket tells a different story: Ms. Tung filed her Motion to Dismiss, raising Rule 2-322(a) defenses, on July 16, 2012, more than a month before she filed her Opposition to the Firm\u2019s Motion to Defer Dismissal on August 20, 2012.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> So on this basis alone, the Firm\u2019s argument that Ms. Tung consented to jurisdiction by failing to raise Rule 2-322(a) defenses in a motion to dismiss filed before any other <em>pleading or motion </em>fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">But we don\u2019t even get to that hypothetical because the Firm is wrong about the law. The Firm argues that a defendant waives Rule 2-322(a) defenses by filing any <em>motion, or pleading </em>before a motion to dismiss raising those defenses. The Firm is incorrect. Instead, a party waives the defenses listed in Rule 2-322(a) only when that party files an <em>answer </em>before raising those defenses. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-322(a) (\u201cThe following defenses shall be made by motion to dismiss filed before the <em>answer </em>...: (1) lack of jurisdiction over the person, ... (3) insufficiency of process, and (4) insufficiency of service of process. <em>If not so made and the answer is filed, these defenses are waived.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>We recognized this principle in <em>Smith v. Cylus, </em>147 Md.App. 78, 807 A.2d 777 (2002), and rejected the same argument the Firm raises now. In <em>Smith, </em>the appellant argued that the appellee had \u201cwaived the defense of improper venue when [the appellee] served [appellant] with a request for admissions\u201d because \u201c[p]ursuant to Rule 2-322, the issue of venue is a mandatory defense which must be plead before <em>any initial filing by the defendant\u201d Id. </em>at 80, 807 A.2d 777 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted). We rejected this argument because only an <em>answer </em>waives the mandatory defenses listed in Rule 2-322(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-4\">While appellant is correct that Rule 2-322 governs mandatory defenses, she misunderstands the rule. Rule 2-322(a) reads: \u201cThe following defenses shall be made by motion to dismiss filed before the <em>answer, </em>if an answer is required: (1) lack of jurisdiction over the person, (2) improper venue[, (3) insufficiency of process, and (4) insufficiency of service of process].\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>In the case sub judice, appellee never filed an answer. Therefore, she has not waived the defense of improper venue.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 81, 807 A.2d 777 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> So even if Ms. Tung had filed her Motion to Dismiss <em>after </em>the Opposition Motion, which she didn\u2019t, she <em>still </em>would not have waived her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>right to assert jurisdictional defenses because she had yet to file an answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">3. The Firm\u2019s failure to serve Ms. Tung warranted dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The Firm contends <em>next </em>that dismissal of its case against Ms. Tung was improper even if its attempts to serve her were insufficient. It raises three arguments: <em>first, </em>that dismissal was an inappropriate remedy; <em>second, </em>that the circuit court improperly considered Rule 2-507 in denying its Motion for Reconsideration; and <em>third, </em>that Ms. Tung failed to demonstrate sufficient prejudice to support dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">i. Dismissal is an appropriate remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">The Firm\u2019s <em>first </em>contention, that dismissal was improper even if its service on Ms. Tung was insufficient, fails as a matter of law.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Quoting <em>Flanagan v. Department of Human Resources, </em>412 Md. 616, 989 A.2d 1139 (2010), the Firm argues that \u201c[dismissal is not an automatic remedy for delayed service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 631, 989 A.2d 1139. The Firm reads <em>Flanagan </em>selectively and ignores the context of the language it quotes. In <em>Flanagan, </em>the Court of Appeals was not reviewing a circuit court\u2019s decision to dismiss a suit for service defects, as we are here \u2014 it was responding to a request for dismissal for insufficient service raised for the first time on appeal. The Court recognized that although the appellant was not served in a timely manner under Rule 2-507(b), an <em>appellate court </em>is not empowered to dismiss a case for untimely service because \u201c[djismissal is not an automatic remedy for delayed service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court explained instead that the decision whether to dismiss for delayed service \u201crests in the sound discretion of a trial judge in the first instance, based on his or her weighing of the balance of the rights, interests, and reasons of the parties for the delay and the public demand for prompt resolution of litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Langrall, Muir &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number><em>Noppinger v. Gladding, </em>282 Md. 397, 400-01, 384 A.2d 737 (1978)); <em>see also Reed v. Cagan, </em>128 Md.App. 641, 650, 739 A.2d 932 (1999) (\u201cAppellee was not served with process for approximately two years from the time the complaint was filed and the original process was issued against him. Thus, there is no question that the case was subject to dismissal, <em>in the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)). The circuit court, finding that the Firm had not served Ms. Tung, was empowered in its discretion to dismiss the case, and we see no abuse of that discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">ii. Dismissal under either Rule 2-121(a) or Rule 2-507(b) was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The parties disagree over the rule upon which the circuit court relied in dismissing the case. The Firm claims that dismissal pursuant to Rule 2-322(a) (for insufficiency of service) was all that was at issue in its Motion for Reconsideration and that the court erred by denying its motion after the March 18, 2013 hearing on the basis of Rule 2-507(b) (for lack of jurisdiction). Ms. Tung counters that the Firm re-raised issues relating to Rule 2-507(b) in its Motion for Reconsideration. Although the court could perhaps have stated more clearly the rule on which it relied, we need not resolve the question because the Firm loses both ways: at no point did the Firm effect service upon Ms. Tung in compliance with Rule 2-121(a), which supports dismissal under Rule 2-322(a), and the Firm\u2019s service failure created a jurisdictional defect, which supports dismissal under Rule 2-507(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Dismissal pursuant to Rule 2-322(a) was proper because, as we established above, the Firm never properly served Ms. Tung in accordance with Rule 2-121(a). The Firm\u2019s first service failure (delivery of the Non-Confidential Complaint to Ms. Tung) was the basis for Ms. Tung\u2019s first Rule 2-322(a) Motion to Dismiss, filed on July 16, 2012. Although it is undisputed that this service attempt did not comply with Rule 2-121(a), the court had the authority to \u201cdismiss the action or grant such lesser or different relief as may be appropriate,\u201d Md. Rule 2-322(c), and, in the August 28, 2012 Order, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>court elected to grant different relief. Specifically, the court denied Ms. Tung\u2019s Motion but ordered, <em>first, </em>that the Firm was to \u201cre-serve a copy of the Complaint and all accompanying papers upon [Ms.] Tung, and submit a new affidavit of service to the Court within ten (10) days from the date this Order is docketed,\u201d and <em>second, </em>that if the Firm again failed to serve Ms. Tung, the action would be dismissed. The Firm conceded at oral argument that it never personally served Ms. Tung after this point, but it argues that its delivery of the summons and Confidential Complaint to Ms. Tung\u2019s counsel shortly thereafter in September 2012 satisfied the August 28, 2012 Order. It did not, and the circuit court properly made this finding in its November 21, 2012 order. Even so, the court gave the Firm <em>one more chance:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">[T]he Court having determined that, as of the date of this Order, it has no <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over any defendant in this matter, it is this 19th day of November 2012, by the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">ORDERED, that this case is dismissed without prejudice as to all persons named as a defendant to this action as of the date of this order (individually, \u201cDefendant\u201d); and it is,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjA\">ORDERED, that Plaintiff may request one additional summons pursuant to Rule 2-112(a) for each Defendant, provided the request is made not later than 7 days from the date on which this Order is docketed (\u201cFinal Summons\u201d); and it is,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">ORDERED, that this dismissal shall be stricken as to any Defendant over whom the court acquires <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction as a result of service pursuant to Rule 2-121 of the Final Summons for that Defendant; and it is,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoU\">ORDERED, that on request of a Defendant, an order of dismissal <em>with prejudice </em>shall be filed as to any Defendant over whom the court has not acquired <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction as set forth in the preceding paragraph....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">But the Firm again delivered the summons and Confidential Complaint to Ms. Tung\u2019s counsel on January 18, 2013, and the court, after the January 28, 2013 hearing, reached the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>conclusion. Following up on its November 21, 2012 Order, the court entered an order on January 30, 2013, dismissing the Firm\u2019s case <em>with prejudice, </em>an appropriate remedy under Rule 2-322(a).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">The court would also have been justified in dismissing the Firm\u2019s case pursuant to Rule 2-507(b), which governs dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> On appeal, however, the Firm argues that the court\u2019s consideration of Rule 2-507(b) during the March 18, 2013 hearing on its Motion for Reconsideration was inappropriate for two reasons: <em>first, </em>because the court considered the issues despite finding them to be moot in its January 30, 2013 Order, and <em>second, </em>because dismissal pursuant to Rule 2 \u2014 507(b) cannot be pursued by a party, as it is only a procedural tool to be used by the clerk of the court. Each argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">It was <em>the Firm </em>that re-raised arguments relating to Rule 2 \u2014 507(b) in its Motion for Reconsideration of the January 30, 2013 Order, despite the court\u2019s finding in that order that Rule 2 \u2014 507(b) issues were moot. In its motion, the Firm argued that the court \u201cshould not require dismissal in the instant case, regardless of whether the multiple personal and representative services made were proper, because Defendant Tung has not been prejudiced pursuant to Rule 2-507.\u201d Presumably in response to this argument, the court, at the hearing on the Motion for Reconsideration, addressed several issues relevant to a Rule 2 \u2014 507(b) analysis \u2014 specifically the Firm\u2019s justification for delay and prejudice to Ms. Tung as a result of the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>The Firm also argues that the court wrongly mingled consideration of the Rule 2-507 and Rule 2-322(a) motions to dismiss. Specifically, the Firm relies on <em>Thomas v. Ramsburg, </em>99 Md.App. 395, 399, 637 A.2d 863 (1994), and contends that the court erred by considering Rule 2-507(b) as \u201can offensive weapon for the defendants, instead of an administrative procedure for the clerk.\u201d It reasons, again relying on <em>Thomas, </em>that the language of Rule 2-507 does not contemplate motions filed by parties directly with the court. The Firm\u2019s contention fails for two reasons: <em>first, </em>Rule 2-507 did not arise here from a motion Ms. Tung filed with the court, and <em>second, </em>even if it had, the court\u2019s consideration of Rule 2-507(b) in the scope of a Rule 2-322(a) motion to dismiss would have been appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">With respect to the first basis, the Firm overlooks that fact that Ms. Tung never used Rule 2-507 as an \u201coffensive weapon,\u201d as she never filed a motion to dismiss raising issues concerning Rule 2-507(b). Rule 2-507(b) was only considered by the court through its own initiative and through arguments raised by the Firm. That rule arose initially in the Notification of Contemplated Dismissal that the court issued administratively. Ms. Tung\u2019s first Motion to Dismiss, filed on July 16, 2012, was filed pursuant to Rule 2-322(a) and concerned insufficiency of service under Rule 2-121(a), <em>not </em>jurisdictional defects, and her second Motion to Dismiss, filed on October 31, 2012, relied exclusively on the Firm\u2019s failure to comply with the court\u2019s order entered on August 28, 2012. Only after the court entered the January 30, 2013 Order dismissing the case with prejudice <em>pursuant to Rule 2-322(a) </em>did the court look to Rule 2-507. And it only did so because the Firm raised the issue in its Motion for Reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Also, even if Ms. Tung had raised Rule 2-507(b) arguments in a Rule 2-322(a) motion to dismiss, the court could have properly considered such a motion. The Firm reads <em>Thomas </em>too broadly to the contrary. <em>Thomas </em>provides that \u201c[t]he plain language of Rule 2-507 does not directly anticipate parties to an action filing motions to dismiss for lack of prosecution,\u201d and that \u201conly ... the clerk of the court should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>initiate such dismissal proceedings.\u201d 99 Md.App. at 399, 637 A.2d 863. But <em>Thomas </em>refers to subsection (c) of Rule 2-507, governing lack of <em>prosecution, </em>whereas, here, the court\u2019s consideration of Rule 2-507 was focused upon subsection (b), governing lack of <em>jurisdiction. </em>A nearly identical argument arose in <em>Reed v. Cagan, </em>128 Md.App. 641, 739 A.2d 932 (1999), and the Court\u2019s reasoning in rejecting the Firm\u2019s argument applies equally here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">Appellant argues that appellee had no right to file a motion to dismiss [pursuant to Rule 2-322(a)] directly with the court based on Rule 2-507(b), and that for the Rule to have any application to appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss, the clerk must have initiated the dismissal, either on its own, or after a request by appellee. Appellant relies on <em>Thomas v. Ramsburg, </em>99 Md.App. 395, 637 A.2d 863 (1994), for this proposition. We find <em>Thomas </em>to be inapposite and disagree with appellant\u2019s conclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">In <em>Thomas, </em>this Court addressed the appropriate procedure when a defendant moved to dismiss a case for lack of prosecution under Rule 2-507(c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\">In <em>Thomas, </em>the plaintiff filed his complaint, defendant answered, and discovery ensued. <em>See Thomas, </em>99 Md.App. at 397, 637 A.2d 863. When more than a year had passed without any docket entries in the case, the defendant moved to have the case dismissed pursuant to Rule 2-507(c). <em>See id. </em>The trial court granted the motion and the plaintiff appealed. <em>See id. </em>We held that a defendant seeking to have a case dismissed for lack of prosecution under subsection (c) had no right to file a motion directly with the court, and that the dismissal had to be initiated by the clerk\u2019s filing a notice of contemplated dismissal pursuant to Rule 2-507(d). <em>See id. </em>at 410-11, 637 A.2d 863.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-9\">The distinction between the present case and <em>Thomas </em>lies in ... the difference between a dismissal under subsection (c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>for lack of prosecution, and one under subsection (b) for lack of jurisdiction.... <em>Thomas </em>involved a dismissal under subsection (c) of Rule 2-507, for the plaintiffs failure to prosecute the case. A dismissal under subsection (b) of Rule 2-507 for lack of jurisdiction arising from a failure to serve the defendant raises different concerns, and should be governed by different standards than a dismissal for lack of prosecution under subsection (c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 649-52, 739 A.2d 932. A Rule 2 \u2014 507(b) defense for lack of jurisdiction <em>could, </em>therefore, have been raised through a motion filed pursuant to Rule 2-322(a), <em>see id. </em>at 655, 739 A.2d 932, but that never happened here. Ms. Tung\u2019s motions to dismiss relied exclusively on the Firm\u2019s failure to comply with the service requirements of Rule 2-121(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The court nevertheless considered Rule 2 \u2014 507(b) during the March 18, 2013 hearing, and the Firm argues that the court failed to require a showing of prejudice by Ms. Tung. As before, we addressed a similar set of circumstances in <em>Cagan, </em>128 Md.App. 641, 739 A.2d 932. In that case, like here, the appellant argued \u201cthat the trial court erred in dismissing his suit on the ground of a delay in service pursuant to Rule 2-507(b) because appellee failed to prove prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 647, 739 A.2d 932. Although the trial court in that case \u201cdid not identify the specifics of how the prejudice to appellee from the two-year delay in service manifested itself,\u201d the Court \u201c[did] not consider a specific demonstration of prejudice to be required.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 648, 739 A.2d 932. We explained that a \u201cmore specific delineation and thereby a stronger showing of prejudice might be appropriate had appellant identified <em>any justification </em>for his failure to serve appellant for two years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 649, 739 A.2d 932 (emphasis added). We found that \u201cappellant did not proffer any justification for his two-year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>delay in service\u201d or any \u201creason why he would have had any difficulty serving appellee,\u201d despite the fact \u201cthat he was aware of appellee\u2019s status as a practicing attorney in Baltimore with offices within a few blocks of the circuit court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 648, 739 A.2d 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The same circumstances are present here. The Firm was well aware of Ms. Tung\u2019s status as a practicing attorney and knew her address, but it still did not provide a valid justification for failing to serve her. And like <em>Cagan, </em>the trial court did not explain its finding of prejudice, but presumed prejudice from the circumstances. (The court stated that it \u201ccould infer actual prejudice in terms of all the legal services that the Defense has had to pay for, just litigating on this one issue, all of Plaintiffs\u2019 making.\u201d) Moreover, like <em>Cagan, </em>the Firm brought suit shortly before the expiration of the statute of limitations, but unlike <em>Cagan, </em>where the appellee was served two years from filing of the complaint, <em>id. </em>at 649, 739 A.2d 932, service <em>never </em>occurred here. We do not require a more specific delineation of prejudice: as we held in <em>Cagan, </em>\u201c[i]n the absence of any justification for [the Firm\u2019s] lengthy delay, ... the trial court acted within its discretion in drawing an inference of prejudice from the delay itself.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>B.

Our standard of review on this posture is well-understood:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">\u201cIn considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Maryland Rule 2-322(b)(2), a court must assume the truth of all well-pleaded material facts and all inferences that can be drawn from them.\u201d <em>Rossaki v.

So for this claim to survive, the Firm would need to plead an attorney-client relationship between the Firm and the BIO Defendants. But at most, the BIO Defendants\u2019 professional duties flowed to Technical Furniture, the <em>joint </em>client of the BIO Defendants and the Firm. We agree, therefore, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Firm cannot state a claim for legal malpractice claim against the BIO Defendants.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">C. The Firm Did Not Preserve Its Arguments Relating To Judicial Bias And The Appearance Of Impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\"><em>Finally, </em>the Firm argues for the first time on appeal that the special assignment of the case to a single judge gave the appearance of \u201cimpropriety, partiality, and prejudicial influence.\u201d It contends that impropriety arose from two sources: <em>first, </em>the letter Ms. Tung\u2019s counsel sent to Judge Davis-Loomis asking that the pending motions be specially assigned to one judge and the court\u2019s agreement to make such an assignment; and <em>second, </em>the mutual involvement of Judge Caroom (the judge to whom the case was specially assigned) and Ms. Tung\u2019s counsel in an event called Chambers Chat, a bench-bar event held monthly by the Anne Arundel County Bar Association. But the Firm did not challenge the special assignment or seek recusal of Judge Caroom below, and by failing to do so failed to preserve these issues for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">To initiate recusal procedures and preserve the recusal issue for appeal, \u201ca party must file a timely motion\u201d with the trial judge that the party seeks to recuse. <em>Miller v. Kirkpatrick, </em>377 Md. 335, 358, 833 A.2d 536 (2003); <em>see also Surratt v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>320 Md. 439, 468, 578 A.2d 745 (1990) (\u201c[I]n order to trigger the recusal procedure we here prescribe, a motion must be timely filed.\u201d). A timely motion is one that is \u201cfiled \u2018as soon as the basis for it becomes known and relevant,\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller, </em>377 Md. at 358, 833 A.2d 536 (quoting <em>Surratt, </em>320 Md. at 469, 578 A.2d 745), and \u201cis not one that represents \u2018the possible withholding of a recusal motion as a weapon to use only in the event of some unfavorable ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, \u201ca litigant who fails to make a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>motion to recuse before a presiding judge in circuit court ... waiv[es] the objection on appeal.\u201d <em>Halici v. City of Gaithersburg, </em>180 Md.App. 238, 255 n. 6, 949 A.2d 85 (2008) (citing <em>Miller, </em>377 Md. at 358, 833 A.2d 536); <em>see also </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a) (\u201cOrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any ... issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\u201d); <em>compare Traverso v. State, </em>83 Md.App. 389, 394, 574 A.2d 923 (1990) (finding that \u201cno issue concerning the recusal [of the trial judge] has been preserved for [appellate review]\u201d because the appellant \u201cnever asked the trial judge to recuse himself\u2019), <em>with Miles v. State, </em>88 Md.App. 360, 368, 594 A.2d 1208 (1991) (finding the filing of an affidavit to the circuit court asserting bias and prejudice of a trial judge to be \u201csufficient to preserve the recusal issue\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">At the January 18, 2013 hearing, after the case was specially assigned to Judge Caroom, the Firm had an opportunity to challenge the assignment and to have Judge Caroom recused. The Firm declined to do so:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">[THE COURT:] Let me add one other thing, which is that normally the Court would expect a reconsideration to be considered by the same judge who issued the order; however, subsequent to those orders being passed the case was specially assigned to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">I then contacted the administrative judge and Judge Goetzke to discuss that question of who should rule on a motion to reconsider after the special assignment to a different judge. And the consensus that the Court got was that I should rule on them and that Judge Goetzke had no objection by ruling on them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">So I am prepared to do that unless counsel wish to argue that we should sort of unassign the case in terms of the special assignment. <em>Does anyone want to make that request, which would have to be directed to the administrative judge, or are we ready to go forward with that motion today if need be.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">(Emphasis added.) We decline the Firm\u2019s invitation that we remand the case and \u201crequire that the case be set with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>different circuit court judge chosen randomly in accordance with the court\u2019s standard procedure\u201d when the circuit court never had the opportunity to consider and decide this fact-specific and discretionary question in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY AFFIRMED.

That action was (1) filed by the appellant on May 3, 1996, (2) not served on the appellee until April 6, 1998, and (3) dismissed \"with prejudice\u201d on July 6, 1998. <em>Because the applicable statute of limita</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number><em>tions had expired at the end of the day on May 5, 1996, it was of no consequence whether the dismissal was \u201cwith prejudice\u201d or \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 685-86, 826 A.2d 433 (emphasis added) (citing <em>Cagan, </em>128 Md.App. 641, 739 A.2d 932). So even if the court had dismissed without prejudice, the Firm would have been barred by limitations from trying again in any event.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b536-5\">. There are few differences between the legal malpractice claims raised in the original and amended complaint, so we refer to them together as the \"complaint,\u201d and will only make distinctions between the two versions when necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b536-6\">. The amended complaint was filed over a year after the original complaint, but filing was proper despite the delay. Under Rule 2-341(a), \"[a] party may file an amendment to a pleading without leave of court by the date set forth in a scheduling order or, if there is no scheduling order, no later than 30 days before a scheduled trial date.\u201d Md. Rule 2-341. Here, the circuit court neither issued a scheduling order nor set a trial date, so the filing of the Amended Complaint complied with Rule 2-3 41(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b536-7\">. In <em>Blondell, </em>we rejected a party's claim for legal malpractice based in a co-counsel relationship because that relationship did not satisfy the strict privity requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFK\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Blondell does not style his suit as an attorney malpractice action, <em>and indeed he could not because he was not a client of Littlepage. </em>Rather, Blondell bases his claims on the co-counsel relationship.... Nonetheless, the policy considerations underlying the strict privity requirement apply with equal force here. <em>Blondell\u2019s theory elevates co-counsel relationship to a special status, allowing associated attorneys to sue one another, seeking an affirmative recovery, as distinguished from contribution or indemnification when sued as alleged joint tortfeasors, on the basis of allegedly erroneous or improper legal advice given to the client.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">185 Md.App. at 140-41, 968 A.2d 678 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b537-7\">.

In promulgating 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.10, the USPTO explained the role of back-up counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-9\">The [USPTO] expects that lead counsel will, and back-up counsel may, participate in all hearings and conference calls with the [USPTO Board of Appeals] and will sign all papers submitted in the proceeding. In addition, the role of back-up counsel is to conduct business with the [USPTO] on behalf of lead counsel when lead counsel is not available.
