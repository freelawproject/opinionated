Md.Code Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(l)(i), (3)(i) (1974, 2013 Repl.Vol.) (\u201cCJP\u201d). Philip Powell, in his capacity as the personal representative of the Estate of Beatrice Powell, appellant, filed, in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, a medical malpractice action against Alex Wurm, M.D., appellee. With that action he also filed, as directed by the foregoing section of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>the Maryland Code, both a certificate of qualified expert and the report of the Estate\u2019s medical expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The principal question before us<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is whether the report of the Estate\u2019s expert satisfied Maryland law. The circuit court believed that it did not and dismissed the Estate\u2019s action. We disagree and shall reverse and remand this case for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">On August 5, 2009, Dr. Wurm, a radiologist,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> performed an \u201cinferior [vena] cava filter placement\u201d procedure on the now-deceased Mrs. Beatrice Powell to treat her chronic pulmonary emboli.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This surgical procedure involves the insertion of a \u201cfilter\u201d into the \u201cinferior vena cava,\u201d a \u201cvein formed by the union of the two common iliac veins\u201d and which \u201cempties into the right atrium of the heart.\u201d <em>Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary </em>(2001) 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">During Dr. Wurm\u2019s performance of that procedure, the filter \u201cperforated the wall\u201d of Mrs. Powell\u2019s inferior vena cava and, as a result of that perforation, the filter was deposited, not in the inferior vena cava as intended, but in \u201can extravascular location.\u201d Consequently, Mrs. Powell had to subsequently undergo additional surgery to remove the filter and repair the damage to her inferior vena cava.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Powell died a year later, it is not alleged that her death was a consequence of the procedure performed by Dr. Wurm.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">On August 2, 2012, three years after the filter placement procedure in question and two years after Mrs. Powell\u2019s death, the Estate filed a medical malpractice claim, with the Health Care Alternative Dispute Resolution Office, against Dr. Wurm, alleging that the doctor had failed to \u201cexercise appropriate care and technique\u201d during the filter placement procedure. That failure led, claimed the Powell Estate, to a piercing of the wall of the inferior vena cava and to the subsequent misplacement of the filter. In accordance with section 3-2A-04(b) of the Health Care Malpractice Claims Act, the Estate filed with its malpractice claim a \u201ccertificate of qualified expert,\u201d signed by Robert Vogelzang, M.D., a radiologist, together with Dr. Vogelzang\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Then, after waiving arbitration of its claim, the Estate filed a medical malpractice complaint against Dr. Wurm in the Prince George\u2019s County circuit court. With its complaint, the Estate filed the certificate of qualified expert and the report from Dr. Vogelzang. The certificate stated that it was Dr. Vogelzang\u2019s opinion, \u201cto a reasonable degree of medical probability,\u201d that Dr. Wurm, in performing the inferior vena cava filter placement, departed \u201cfrom the standards of care in connection with such medical procedure\u201d and that that \u201cdeparture from the standards of care [was] the proximate cause of [Mrs. Powell\u2019s] injuries.\u201d The \u201cspecific departures from the standard of care are set forth,\u201d indicated the certificate, \u201cin the attached report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">In that report, Dr. Vogelzang stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">In my opinion, Dr. Wurm violated the applicable standards of care in the placement of an inferior vena cava filter in that he failed to exercise appropriate care and technique and thereby perforated the wall of the inferior vena cava and deposited the filter in an extravascular location, thus necessitating the subsequent surgery to remove the filter and repair the caval laceration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">Dr. Wurm moved to dismiss the Estate\u2019s malpractice action on the grounds that the Estate\u2019s medical expert report was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>legally insufficient. In support of that claim, Dr. Wurm cited the following language from <em>Walzer v. Osborne: </em>\u201c[T]he attesting expert report must explain how or why the physician failed ... to meet the standard of care and include some details supporting the certificate of qualified expert.\u201d 395 Md. 563, 583, 911 A.2d 427 (2006). Since Dr. Vogelzang\u2019s report, purportedly, \u201cmerely restate[d]\u201d the allegations in his certificate and provided no additional details, the Estate\u2019s expert report, insisted Dr. Wurm, was inadequate and the Estate\u2019s malpractice claim must therefore be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">In its opposition to that motion, the Estate asserted that there was \u201cno dispute that Dr. Wurm perforated\u201d Mrs. Powell\u2019s inferior vena cava and that discovery would be necessary to determine precisely which of Dr. Wurm\u2019s actions or inactions had led to that perforation. To that opposition, it attached a \u201crevised opinion letter\u201d from Dr. Vogelzang, in which Dr. Vogelzang opined that Dr. Wurm had \u201cfailed to meet the standard of care\u201d for placing an inferior vena cava filter by neglecting to use a \u201cguidewire,\u201d or using an \u201cimproper guidewire,\u201d or by not injecting \u201ccontrast\u201d to confirm the position of the filter.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">This revised opinion letter, however, was submitted to the court after the statutory period for filing a certificate of qualified expert with the attesting expert report attached had expired. <em>See </em>CJP \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(l)(i)-(ii) (requiring a plaintiff to file a certificate of qualified expert within 180 days from the date the complaint is filed in the Health Care Alternative Dispute Resolution Office). Acknowledging the lateness of this submission, the Estate requested that the circuit court grant it \u201can extension of time,\u201d for \u201cgood cause shown,\u201d to file its \u201ccertificate of a qualified expert,\u201d under section 3-2A-04(b)(5) of the Act, so that it could supplement Dr. Vogelzang\u2019s original report.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>With no mention of that revised opinion letter or its contents in its written opinion, the circuit court dismissed the action, concluding that, because Dr. Vogelzang\u2019s report did not state \u201chow\u201d or \u201cwhy\u201d Dr. Wurm failed to meet the standard of care and did not contain any \u201csupplemental information\u201d or \u201cdetails to support the certificate,\u201d it had \u201cfail[ed] to comply with the substantive requirements of <em>Walzer\u201d </em>and was therefore \u201clegally insufficient.\u201d The insufficiency of the report, in turn, rendered the certificate of qualified expert \u201cincomplete.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The Estate contends that its certificate of qualified expert and the attached report complied with the requirements set forth in the Health Care Malpractice Claims Act. It points out that the Act does not mandate the contents of the report, but requires only that the report of the attesting expert be attached to the certificate of qualified expert. It further asserts that decisions of the Court of Appeals \u2014 notably, <em>Walzer v. Osborne, </em>395 Md. 563, 911 A.2d 427 (2006); <em>Carroll v. Konits, </em>400 Md. 167, 929 A.2d 19 (2007); and <em>Kearney v. Berger, </em>416 Md. 628, 7 A.3d 593 (2010) \u2014 have consistently suggested that the attesting expert\u2019s report need only contain \u201cat least some additional information\u201d that \u201csupplement[s]\u201d the certificate to satisfy statutory requirements. <em>Walzer, </em>395 Md. at 583, 911 A.2d 427. Finally, it states that Dr. Vogelzang\u2019s report, which opined that Dr. Wurm had perforated Mrs. Powell\u2019s inferior vena cava by failing to exercise appropriate care and technique, had done exactly that.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Because our determination of whether the Estate\u2019s certificate of its qualified expert and report of its attesting expert complied with Maryland law is a question of legal sufficiency, we conduct a de novo review, keeping in mind that the dismissal of a medical malpractice claim \u201cis only appropriate if, after assuming the truth of the assertions in the [certificate and report, and all permissible inferences emanating therefrom, the requirements set forth in the [Act] are not satisfied.\u201d <em>Carroll, </em>400 Md. at 180 n. 11, 929 A.2d 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Our review begins with the text of section 3-2A-04(b) of the Act, and if the words of that section, when \u201cconstrued according to their common and everyday meaning, are clear and unambiguous and express a plain meaning, we will give effect to the statute as it is written.\u201d <em>Walzer, </em>395 Md. at 572, 911 A.2d 427 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In requiring that a medical malpractice claimant file a \u201ccertificate of qualified expert\u201d with his or her claim, the Act states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_v\">(b) Filing and service of certificate of qualified expert\u2014 Unless the sole issue in the claim is lack of informed consent:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">(l)(i) 1 ... a claim or action filed after July 1, 1986, shall be dismissed, without prejudice, if the claimant or plaintiff fails to file a certificate of a qualified expert ... attesting to departure from standards of care, and that the departure from standards of care is the proximate cause of the alleged injury, within 90 days from the date of the complaint; ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">(3)(i) The attorney representing each party, or the party proceeding pro se, shall file the appropriate certificate with a report of the attesting expert attached.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The Act clearly specifies what the \u201ccertificate of a qualified expert\u201d must attest to. It must state that there was a \u201cdeparture from standards of care, and that the departure from standards of care [was] the proximate cause of the [plaintiffs] alleged injury.\u201d CJP \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(l)(i). And it must \u201cmention explicitly the name of the licensed professional who allegedly breached the standard of care.\u201d <em>Carroll, </em>400 Md. at 196, 929 A.2d 19 (internal citations omitted). But, as for the \u201creport of the attesting expert,\u201d the Act only mandates that such a report be \u201cattached\u201d to the certificate. CJP \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(3)(l). No mention is made by the Act as to what it should contain.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">There is no dispute that Dr. Vogelzang\u2019s certificate opined that \u201cthere was a departure from the standards of care,\u201d that it stated that such a departure was the proximate cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Mrs. Powell\u2019s injuries, and that it identified Dr. Wurm as the negligent physician. Moreover, the doctor\u2019s report was attached to his certificate. Thus the only question before us is whether Dr. Vogelzang\u2019s report satisfied the requirements of the Act, in other words, whether the circuit court was correct in dismissing this case on the grounds that the report was legally deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">As noted, the language of the Act itself states only that the report must be \u201cattached\u201d to the certificate of the plaintiffs qualified expert. It does not provide any indication of what the \u201creport of the attesting expert\u201d must contain. But the imprecision of the report requirement of the Act has fortunately been, in large measure, remedied by the Court of Appeals in a series of opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">First, in <em>Walzer v. Osborne, </em>395 Md. 563, 583, 911 A.2d 427 (2006), the Court of Appeals avowed that \u201cthe certificate required of the plaintiff is merely an assertion that the physician failed to meet the standard of care and that such failure was the proximate cause of the patient-plaintiffs complaints,\u201d and that the attesting expert report \u201cshould contain at least some additional information and should supplement\u201d the certificate. Specifically, the \u201cexpert report must explain,\u201d said the Court, \u201chow or why the physician failed or did not fail to meet the standard of care and include some details supporting the certificate of qualified expert.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Then, in <em>Carroll v. Konits, </em>400 Md. 167, 929 A.2d 19 (2007), and <em>Kearney v. Berger, </em>416 Md. 628, 7 A.3d 593 (2010), the Court of Appeals, in addressing the legal sufficiency of a plaintiffs \u201ccertificate\u201d in each of those cases, reiterated that the report of the attesting expert should state what the applicable standard of care is and how the defendant physician had departed from it. <em>Carroll, </em>400 Md. at 197, 929 A.2d 19; <em>Kearney, </em>416 Md. at 649-50, 7 A.3d 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Thus it is clear from the foregoing decisions that the report of an attesting expert must state what the applicable standard of care is and provide some information as to how or why the defendant physician had not met that standard. Therefore, Dr. Vogelzang\u2019s report, which was attached to the doctor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>\u201ccertificate\u201d and filed by the Estate with its malpractice claim, must be deemed compliant with the requirements of the Act if it contained \u201cat least some additional information\u201d and provided details \u201cexplaining how or why the defendant doctor allegedly departed from the standards of care.\u201d <em>Walzer, </em>395 Md. at 583, 911 A.2d 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">In our view, Dr. Vogelzang\u2019s report did just that. First, it specified that the \u201capplicable standards of care\u201d that Dr. Wurm allegedly violated were the \u201cstandards of care in the placement of an inferior vena cava filter\u201d and then asserted that that standard of care was violated by the doctor\u2019s failure to \u201cexercise appropriate care and technique.\u201d Next, it stated that, as a consequence of his failure to \u201cexercise appropriate care and technique,\u201d Dr. Wurm perforated the wall of Mrs. Powell\u2019s inferior vena cava and deposited the filter in an \u201cextravascular location, thus necessitating ... subsequent surgery to remove the filter and repair the caval laceration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">In light of this additional information, which was not contained in Dr. Vogelzang\u2019s certificate, we do not find that the doctor\u2019s report merely \u201cduplicates\u201d his certificate, as Dr. Wurm suggests. Indeed, the report stated the precise nature of the medical procedure that Dr. Wurm was performing when he purportedly breached the standard of care; the specific error that was committed, that is, the misplacement of the inferior vena cava filter; the injury that resulted, that is, the perforation of the inferior vena cava; and the future medical procedure that was necessary to address that injury. In so stating, Dr. Vogelzang\u2019s report supplemented his certificate by providing additional information regarding both the applicable standard of care and how Dr. Wurm allegedly departed from it in his treatment of Mrs. Powell. Hence we conclude that the report was legally sufficient and that the circuit court erred in dismissing the Estate\u2019s claim on the basis of an insufficient certificate of qualified expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">But, even if we were to find that Dr. Vogelzang\u2019s report, by itself, was not legally sufficient, we could still consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>doctor\u2019s certificate and report together to determine whether both documents, collectively, satisfied the requirements of the Act. Indeed, the Court of Appeals has suggested on several occasions that the certificate and the report should be viewed together. First, and most clearly, Maryland\u2019s highest court observed in <em>Walzer </em>that the certificate of qualified expert and the report of the attesting expert were not \u201cintended ... to constitute two separate and distinct documents.\u201d 395 Md. at 580, 911 A.2d 427. Rather, it was the intention of the General Assembly \u201cfor the certificate of qualified expert to consist of both the certificate and the attesting expert report.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 579, 911 A.2d 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Next, in <em>Carroll, </em>the Court of Appeals was asked to consider whether the single document filed with the plaintiffs complaint in that case complied with the requirements of the Act. 400 Md. at 171-73, 929 A.2d 19. The \u201cdocument\u201d at issue, there, was a letter from the plaintiffs medical expert summarizing the medical treatment the plaintiff had received and offering several opinions regarding medical errors that might have been made. <em>Id. </em>at 173-74, 929 A.2d 19. Ultimately, the Court found the letter or, as it described it, the \u201cCertificate,\u201d to be insufficient for two reasons: First, the \u201cCertificate\u201d failed to identify the defendant physicians, state that the defendants departed from the standards of care, and assert that such a departure was the proximate cause of the plaintiffs injury. <em>Id. </em>at 201, 929 A.2d 19. Second, and \u201c[ejqually egregious,\u201d it neglected to state what the standard of care was or how the defendant physicians had departed from it. <em>Id. </em>at 197, 929 A.2d 19. In short, the \u201cCertificate\u201d did not provide the kind of information that the certificate of qualified expert and the expert\u2019s report were, together, expected to furnish. <em>See, e.g., Walzer, </em>395 Md. at 583, 911 A.2d 427 (stating that the certificate of qualified expert should assert \u201cthat the physician failed to meet the standard of care and that such failure was the proximate cause of the patient-plaintiffs complaints\u201d and that the expert\u2019s report \u201cmust explain how or why the physician failed or did not fail to meet the standard of care and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>include some details supporting the certificate of qualified expert\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">Finally, in <em>Kearney, </em>the Court of Appeals once again addressed the sufficiency of a single document filed by the plaintiff, which it referred to as a \u201ccertificate of qualified expert\u201d or more simply as the \u201ccertificate,\u201d and it concluded that the \u201ccertificate\u201d was insufficient, under <em>Walzer, </em>because no report of an attesting expert was attached and the certificate failed to fill in the gap by explaining how or why the defendant failed to meet the applicable standard of care. 416 Md. at 647, 650, 7 A.3d 593. The Court pointed out that its prior decisions in <em>Carroll </em>and <em>Walzer </em>\u201cshow that a claimant or plaintiff whose certificate fails to state the applicable standard of care and how the defendant allegedly departed from that standard of care is equivalent to a failure to satisfy the report requirement and, accordingly, renders the certificate insufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 649-50, 7 A.3d 593. This suggests, to us, that the plaintiff in <em>Kearney </em>could have satisfied the requirements of the Act (but did not) by filing a certificate of qualified expert that contained all of the information that would otherwise have been contained in the combination of the expert certificate and report.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">In sum, the Court of Appeals has made clear that the certificate and report of the plaintiffs expert, together, make up the \u201ccertificate of qualified expert\u201d required by the Health Care Malpractice Claims Act. <em>Walzer, </em>395 Md. at 580, 911 A.2d 427. Moreover, in <em>Carroll, </em>400 Md. at 196-97, 929 A.2d 19, and <em>Kearney, </em>416 Md. at 649-50, 7 A.3d 593, the Court examined single documents filed by the plaintiffs, in those cases, to determine whether they fulfilled the requirements of both the expert certificate and the expert report. Thus we conclude, from those foregoing decisions, that we are permitted to view the certificate of the Powell Estate\u2019s qualified expert and the report of the Estate\u2019s attesting expert together and determine whether those documents do the following: identify the defendant physician; state that the defendant breached the applicable standard of care; opine that such a departure from the standard of care was the proximate cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>of the plaintiffs injuries; and provide some details as to what the standard of care was and how the defendant physician failed to meet it. Because we may consider those documents together, it would not have doomed the Estate\u2019s complaint if the report of its attesting expert, by itself, was lacking, so long as that informational insufficiency was cured by the certificate of qualified expert. Likewise, it would not prove fatal to the Estate\u2019s complaint if Dr. Vogelzang\u2019s report simply \u201cduplicated\u201d his certificate, as Dr. Wurm suggests, so long as the certificate itself contained all the required information. The important determination to be made would be whether the Estate\u2019s expert certificate and report, when viewed as a whole, satisfied all of the Act\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">We conclude that the Estate\u2019s report of its attesting expert, Dr. Vogelzang, satisfied the requirements of the Act by supplementing the doctor\u2019s certificate of qualified expert and providing details explaining how Dr. Wurm allegedly departed from the applicable standard of care in his performance of an inferior vena cava filter placement procedure on Mrs. Powell. Moreover, even if we were to determine that the expert report alone was informationally insufficient, the report and the certificate together do contain sufficient information to satisfy the requirements of the Maryland Health Care Malpractice Claims Act. In sum, either approach leads us to the same result, that is, that the Estate filed, with its medical malpractice claim, a legally sufficient expert certificate and report.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY REVERSED.
