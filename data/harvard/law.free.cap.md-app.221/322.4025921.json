EYLER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) awarded temporary total disability benefits to claimant Xiong Yao. Yao had two employers. The Injured Workers\u2019 Insurance Fund (\u201cIWIF\u201d), the appellant, insured one of the employers. Ultimately, it paid the entire award. Yao\u2019s other employer was uninsured.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In two orders, the Commission ruled that because one of Yao\u2019s employers was uninsured, the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund (\u201cthe Fund\u201d), the appellee, was jointly and severally liable with IWIF for the award. It ordered the Fund to reimburse IWIF for one-half of the benefits paid. On judicial review of that decision, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County overturned the Commission orders, ruling that the Fund could not be ordered to reimburse IWIF.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">IWIF appeals, presenting two questions for review, which we have combined and rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">Did the Commission have authority to order the Fund to reimburse IWIF for benefits IWIF paid to Yao?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">We answer this question in the negative and shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">On June 24, 2005, Yao was working as a construction subcontractor at the Miyako Japanese Steakhouse in Ocean City when a propane gas explosion caused him to sustain burns to his entire body. Bo Hao Zhu and Qihua Chen were the owners of the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">Zhu had a workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy issued by IWIF. IWIF is an independent, but statutorily created, insurance company that is required to provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance to any employer in the state that is unable to obtain a policy in the private sector. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1991, 1999 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>RepLVol., 2007 Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 10-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Labor and Employment Article (\u201cLE\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Chen was uninsured.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">On August 29, 2007, Yao filed a claim with the Commission for workers\u2019 compensation benefits arising out of the propane explosion accident. He identified Zhu and Chen as his employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">On April 23, 2009, the Commission held a hearing on nine issues, including the identity of Yao\u2019s employer(s) at the time of the accident. On May 13, 2009, the Commission issued an award of compensation to Yao (\u201cMay 2009 Award\u201d). As relevant here, the Commission found that Yao had been temporarily totally disabled from June 24, 2005, until October 13, 2006, as a result of the accident; that Zhu was <em>not </em>Yao\u2019s employer; that Chen <em>was </em>Yao\u2019s employer; and that Chen was uninsured. It ordered Chen to pay Yao\u2019s causally related medical expenses and temporary total disability benefits (\u201cTTD benefits\u201d) in the amount of $417 per week for the period of disability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">On May 29, 2009, the Fund intervened. The Fund is a statutory fund of last resort created by LE sections 9-1001, <em>et seq., </em>to pay a workers\u2019 compensation award to a covered employee whose employer is uninsured and defaults on an obligation to pay. The Fund requested a rehearing on the issue whether Zhu also was Yao\u2019s employer at the time of the accident. Three days later, the request for rehearing was denied. On June 10, 2009, in the Circuit Court for Worcester <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>County, the Fund filed a petition for judicial review of the May 2009 Award, and prayed a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Meanwhile, on June 4, 2009, Yao made a written demand on Chen for payment of the May 2009 Award. Chen failed to respond or make payment. Thereafter, by letter dated July 7, 2009, Yao applied to the Fund for payment of the award. The Fund did not respond or pay the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">On September 28, 2010, the Fund\u2019s judicial review challenge to the May 2009 Award was tried to a jury on the sole issue of whether Zhu (as well as Chen) was Yao\u2019s employer. The jury found that Zhu <em>and </em>Chen were Yao\u2019s employers at the time of the accident. Based on that finding, on October 18, 2010, the circuit court entered an order overturning the May 2009 Award and remanding the matter to the Commission to enter an amended compensation award.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">On January 5, 2011, the Commission issued a new award (\u201cJanuary 2011 Award\u201d). In the January 2011 Award, it modified the May 2009 Award to delete the language stating that Zhu was not Yao\u2019s employer; to add language stating that Zhu was Yao\u2019s employer and that Zhu was insured by IWIF; to state that Chen, Zhu, and IWIF should \u201cjointly and severally, pay\u201d the award of compensation; and to otherwise \u201caffirm[ ]\u201d the May 2009 Award.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">In the meantime, Yao filed a request for additional TTD benefits. On November 8, 2011, the Commission held a hearing on that request.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The next day, it issued an award of compensation for TTD benefits for the period from October 14, 2006 though October 26, 2011, at a rate of $417 per week (\u201cNovember 2011 Award\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The caption of the order named IWIF and the Fund as \u201cCO INSURER^].\u201d In the body of the order, the Commission found that the \u201c[Fund] and [IWIF] [were] jointly and severally liable for payment of all [TTD <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>benefits] awarded.\u201d It directed Zhu and Chen and the \u201cabove-named insurers\u201d to \u201cjointly and severally pay\u201d the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">On November 17, 2011, the Fund requested a rehearing. It asserted that the November 2011 Award erroneously named it as Chen\u2019s \u201cinsurer\u201d and erroneously found it to be jointly and severally liable with IWIF for the award, when, by law, only Chen could be jointly and severally liable with Zhu for the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">A rehearing was held on September 20, 2012. By then, IWIF had paid Yao the entire benefits awarded, totaling more than $147,000.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the hearing, counsel for the Fund and IWIF seemed to be in agreement that the Commission lacked authority to order the Fund to reimburse IWIF for half the benefits IWIF had paid. Counsel for IWIF suggested that the Commission could order that IWIF be credited in that amount; find that Yao had made a legally sufficient demand upon the Fund in 2009, triggering the Fund\u2019s liability; and order the Fund to pay Yao one-half of the benefits, <em>i.e., </em>the amount credited to IWIF.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Counsel for Yao disagreed with this suggestion, arguing that, because the employers \u2014 Chen and Zhu \u2014 were jointly and severally liable, it did not make any difference who paid, so long as one of them did. As Yao already had been paid in full by IWIF, Zhu\u2019s insurer, any \u201ccredit\u201d necessarily would mean that Yao would be obligated to return part of his award to IWIF. Yao\u2019s attorney took the position that that was not allowed by law. The Fund agreed that a credit to IWIF was not permissible and argued that it had no liability to Yao or to IWIF because any obligation it may once have had to pay Yao was extinguished when Zhu, who had insurance, was found to be an employer of Yao.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>On October 1, 2012, the Commission issued a new order affirming and clarifying its November 2011 Award (\u201cOctober 2012 Order\u201d). That order states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\">The Commission finds that Commissioner Adams [previously] found that Mr. Chen and Mr. Zhu were co-employers of [Yao] and Ordered temporary total disability benefits to be paid. [Yao] made a legally sufficient application of Mr. Chen to pay the benefits Ordered under [the May 2009 Award] and [January 2011 Award].[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] When Mr. Chen failed to pay pursuant to [those] Orders, the [Fund] became liable. Therefore, the [Commission] does have the authority to Order the [Fund] to reimburse the [IWIF] for one-half of the benefits paid to [Yao].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The Fund and Yao each filed petitions for judicial review of that order in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The cases were consolidated and the Fund and IWIF each moved for summary judgment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The circuit court held a hearing and, on August 13, 2013, granted summary judgment in favor of the Fund, overturning the Commission\u2019s October 2012 Order and overturning, in part, its November 2011 Award. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">IWIF contends the Commission correctly found that the Fund\u2019s liability for payment of the TTD benefits was triggered in 2009 when Yao made demand upon it after Chen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>defaulted on his obligation to pay the May 2009 Award; that the Fund\u2019s payment obligation was not stayed by its 2009 petition for judicial review; and therefore IWIF has a right to reimbursement for the amount of the May 2009 Award that it subsequently paid to Yao following the January 2011 Award establishing that Zhu and Chen were jointly and severally liable for payment of that award.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">The Fund responds that the statutory scheme is clear and requires that it pay only when there is no other responsible <em>party </em>\u2014 i.e., an employer or insurer \u2014 available to pay. Because IWIF is a responsible party and already has paid all of the TTD benefits awarded, \u201cthere is no role for the [Fund] to play.\u201d The Fund argues, moreover, that it is protected from a claim for contribution by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Our standard of review is well settled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">The Commission is an adjudicatory administrative agency. <em>See W.M. Schlosser Co. v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>414 Md. 195, 204, 994 A.2d 956, 961 (2010). Thus, in our review we look through the decision! ] of the circuit court! ] . \u2022 \u2022, and evaluate the agency decision directly. <em>See Frey v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>422 Md. 111, 136-37, 29 A.3d 475, 489-90 (2011). As we explained in <em>Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>\u201c[a] court\u2019s role in reviewing an administrative agency adjudicatory decision is narrow!;] it \u2018is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u2019 \u201d 354 Md. 59, 67-68, 729 A.2d 376, 380 (1999) (quoting <em>United Parcel Service, Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel of Baltimore Cnty., </em>336 Md. 569, 576-77, 650 A.2d 226, 230 (1994)). Additionally, \u201can administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.\u201d <em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 69, 729 A.2d at 381 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number><em>W.R.

The Fund receives most of its money from assessments on employers and insurers and from interest and investment income derived therefrom. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7\u00a7 9-1005-9-1009 (assessments); \u00a7 10-314 (interest and investment income).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The Fund\u2019s \u201cobligation to pay workers arises not from an award of compensation by the Commission, but from [LE] \u00a7 9-1002.\u201d <em>Danner, </em>388 Md. at 661, 882 A.2d 271. That statute establishes the prerequisites for \u201c[a]n award ... payable out of the Fund.\u201d LE \u00a7 9-1002(a). Two are relevant here. First, an employer must be in default on payment of a Commission award. LE \u00a7 9-1002(b). Default occurs when an uninsured employer fails to pay an award within 30 days after the award is made. <em>Id. </em>However, if \u201can application for (judicial] review has been timely filed under subsection (g) of this section or a [petition for judicial review] timely served,\u201d an employer is not in \u201cdefault\u201d within the meaning of section 9-1002. <em>Id. </em>After a default occurs, the Commission is supposed to give notice to the employer that the employer\u2019s license or permit to do business in Maryland may be suspended if the award is not paid. LE \u00a7 9-1002(c).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> An employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>in default has 30 days thereafter to pay or to notify the Commission of the reasons the employer objects to the award. LE \u00a7 9-1002(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">Second, the employee or his dependents must apply to the Fund for payment. LE \u00a7 9-1002(e). Once the Fund receives an application for payment, it may \u201cpay the award\u201d or \u201capply for review under [LE section 9-1002(g) ].\u201d LE \u00a7 9-1002(f). Pursuant to subsection (g), the Fund may \u201crais[e] issues,\u201d request discovery, and request a hearing before the Commission before paying an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">If the Fund pays an award to a covered employee, it is subrogated to the employee\u2019s rights against the uninsured employer and to the rights of the uninsured employer against a third party. LE \u00a7\u00a7 9-1003(a) &amp; 9-1004. Also, it may bring a civil action against the uninsured employer, refer the matter for criminal prosecution, or both. LE \u00a7 9-1003(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">In <em>Danner, </em>the Court discussed the role of the Fund and interpreted LE section 9-1002 in addressing the question whether a default can occur while the Fund is litigating an issue collateral to the award itself. There, the injured worker (Danner) made a claim for compensation with the Commission. The Commission held a hearing at which the Fund was present. The Commission found that one Timothy Stivers was Danner\u2019s employer and that Stivers was uninsured, and awarded Danner compensation. At the Fund\u2019s request, the Commission reserved on the issue whether Danner also had a statutory employer.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Neither Stivers nor the Fund filed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>action for judicial review. Stivers defaulted and Danner made an application for payment with the Fund. The Fund refused to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Thereafter, the Commission held a hearing on the deferred issue of the existence of a statutory employer and found that there was no statutory employer. The Fund petitioned for judicial review from that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Danner then filed a petition with the Commission seeking relief from the Fund\u2019s failure to pay. The Commission ordered the Fund to pay the award, a 40% penalty on all monies due and unpaid as of that date, and $500 in attorneys\u2019 fees. The Fund petitioned for judicial review of that order, arguing that there could be no default until the issue of the existence of a statutory employer finally was resolved and, in any event, the Commission had no authority to order it to pay a penalty or attorneys\u2019 fees. The circuit court affirmed. On appeal to this Court, we affirmed the Commission\u2019s ruling that the Fund\u2019s obligation to pay was not deferred pending resolution of the statutory employer issue, but reversed the Commission\u2019s assessment of a penalty and award of attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund v. Danner, </em>158 Md.App. 502, 857 A.2d 615 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The Court of Appeals granted a writ of <em>certiorari. </em>It held that the Fund\u2019s obligation to pay was triggered when Stivers defaulted and Danner applied to the Fund for payment. The Court opined that the administrative resolution of the issue whether a statutory employer existed did not operate to stay the Fund\u2019s obligation to pay. It reasoned that, although the Fund \u201cultimately\u201d might be relieved of its obligation to pay by a finding in its favor on that issue,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFm\">the potentiality for [another entity] to be found to be Danner\u2019s statutory employer should not provide the basis for the Fund to avoid, delay, or defer its obligation to pay because the Fund is entitled to full subrogation rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>should it pay benefits to a claimant and later gain the right to recover the payment of those benefits from a statutory employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">388 Md. at 665, 882 A.2d 271 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The Court in <em>Danner </em>emphasized that the Fund is better able to \u201cbear the cost of deferred adjudication of collateral issues than the injured worker who has been found to be entitled to relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 666, 882 A.2d 271. It found that the legislative history of LE section 9-1002 supported its conclusion that \u201cthe pendency of a reserved issue collateral to the award of compensation\u201d does not defer the Fund\u2019s obligation to pay and that \u201conly the raising of issues directly related to the validity of the Commission order establishing the award of compensation\u201d would have that effect. <em>Id. </em>at 667, 882 A.2d 271. In a footnote, the Court opined that even if the Fund had timely petitioned for judicial review of the award of compensation, that likely would not have deferred its obligation to pay, because staying an award of weekly compensation benefits during the pendency of an action for judicial review would \u201c \u2018seriously hamper!!\u2019 \u201d the \u201c \u2018humanitarian policy\u2019 \u201d underlying the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, which is to provide \u201cspeedy relief\u2019 to injured workers. <em>Id. </em>at 668 n. 17, 882 A.2d 271 (quoting <em>Gleneagles, Inc. v. Hanks, </em>385 Md. 492, 500, 869 A.2d 852 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">On the issue of the penalty imposed upon the Fund, however, the Court held that the Commission erred because the statutory authority for penalties for late payment \u2014 LE section 9-728(b) \u2014 only permits the Commission to sanction an \u201cemployer or its insurer.\u201d The Fund is neither and therefore cannot be penalized. <em>See also Danner, </em>158 Md.App. at 515, 857 A.2d 615 (Because the Fund is a creature of statute, the fact \u201c[t]hat the Fund failed to do what it should have done does not, <em>ipso facto </em>confer on the Commission the authority to impose penalties on the Fund\u201d absent statutory authority for the same.).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Finally, the Court held that the award of attorneys\u2019 fees against the Fund was permissible. It reasoned that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Commission has broad statutory authority to award fees if it finds that a party to a proceeding has acted \u201cunreasonably\u201d in bringing or opposing it. 388 Md. at 671, 882 A.2d 271. Given that the Fund was a party and the Commission found that it had been unreasonable in its refusal to pay the award of compensation, the Court concluded that the Commission had not erred or abused its discretion in awarding fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">We return to the case at bar. After the Commission issued the May 2009 Award, Chen defaulted and Yao applied to the Fund for payment. The Commission found that this was a legally sufficient demand for payment. We perceive no error in that finding. <em>Danner </em>makes plain that the Fund\u2019s petition for judicial review of the May 2009 Award did not operate to stay its obligation to pay, because it was raising a collateral issue \u2014 whether Zhu also was Yao\u2019s employer \u2014 and was not challenging the amount of the compensation awarded or the underlying basis for the award. Thus, as of July 7, 2009, the Fund\u2019s obligation to pay was triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">If, at that time, Yao had sought relief from the Commission arising from the Fund\u2019s failure to pay, as Danner did, the Commission would have been within its power to order the Fund to pay the May 2009 Award and to pay the cost of the proceeding and attorneys\u2019 fees. That did not happen, however. Instead, after the circuit court resolved the Fund\u2019s petition for judicial review in the Fund\u2019s favor and \u201coverturned\u201d the May 2009 Award, the Commission, on remand, entered the January 2011 Award. That award amended the May 2009 Award to find that Yao had two employers \u2014 Zhu and Chen\u2014 and that they were jointly and severally liable for the award. The finding of joint and several liability meant that each employer was liable for the entire award and that Yao could collect the full amount of the award against either one. Yao collected against Zhu, through IWIF. Not surprisingly, Yao did not apply to the Fund for payment of the January 2011 Award.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Likewise, in the November 2011 Award, the Commission found that Yao was temporarily totally disabled (for the five-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>year period between October 2006 and October 2011) and Zhu and Chen, as his employers, were jointly and severally liable for that award. Yao collected the entire award against Zhu, through IWIF, and, again not surprisingly, did not apply to the Fund for payment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">IWIF nevertheless takes the position that once the Fund\u2019s obligation to pay was triggered by Yao\u2019s application in July of 2009, the Fund stepped into the shoes of the defaulting employer, <em>i.e., </em>Chen. Thus, its obligation to pay was not altered by the later overturning of the May 2009 Award and the entry of the January 2011 Award. IWIF maintains that this interpretation is consistent with the overarching purpose of the Act. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Once Yao recovered the award against Zhu, through IWIF, the Fund had no further role to play. Under LE section 9-1002, a predicate to the Fund\u2019s obligation to pay an award is that there not be another source of compensation. This is so because the injured employee (or his or her dependents) must apply to the Fund for payment before the Fund may be called upon to pay. The injured employee only would need to apply if he or she is unable to be compensated from another source, whether that be directly from the uninsured employer or from the insurer of another direct employer or a statutory employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">In this case, had the Commission initially found that Chen and Zhu both were Yao\u2019s employers, and had it therefore issued an award of compensation against both of them, the Fund never would have been obligated to make any payment. Yao could have and would have collected against Zhu, the insured employer, not against Chen, the uninsured employer. We agree with the Fund that the fact that this determination was made belatedly is a \u201cprocedural wrinkle\u201d that does not alter the result in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>LE section 9-1002 gives an \u201cemployee or his dependents\u201d the right to make an application for payment by the Fund. It does not contemplate a claim for contribution against the Fund by a co-employer or its insurer. The Fund\u2019s role is not that of a co-insurer or co-employer. <em>Danner, </em>388 Md. at 668-69, 882 A.2d 271. It is a back-up source of compensation for an injured worker whose employer fails to secure insurance. A finding that an injured worker has an insured employer\u2014 whether a co-employer or a statutory employer \u2014 eliminates the need for the Fund to act as a back-up source of compensation. <em>Id. </em>at 665 &amp; n. 16, 882 A.2d 271 (explaining that, if the Fund pays benefits and, at a subsequent point in time, a statutory employer is found to exist, the Fund would be entitled to pursue a claim to recover the benefits paid from the statutory employer). Because the statute only requires the Fund to pay an award to an employee or his or her dependents, it does not require the Fund to reimburse an insurer for an award the insurer\u2019s insured was jointly and severally liable to pay. The Commission exceeded its authority when it ordered the Fund to reimburse IWIF for money paid to Yao.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Finally, we address IWIF\u2019s argument that, if we conclude that the Commission exceeded its authority in ordering reimbursement, we should remand the matter to the Commission for it to \u201cpass an amended Order that the [Fund] pay [Yao] directly what [it] owed.\u201d Thereafter, IWIF and Yao can \u201cresolve any potential credits so that [Yao] is not unjustly awarded double benefits.\u201d For the reasons already explained, the Fund\u2019s obligation to pay the May 2009 Award, although enforceable prior to the circuit court reversal of the Commission\u2019s finding that there was but one employer, became unenforceable when that award was overturned and replaced by the January 2011 Award. That award granted Yao benefits for which his two employers, Zhu and Chen, were jointly and severally liable. Zhu was insured and, consistent with joint and several liability, Yao obtained full payment of the award from IWIF, as Zhu\u2019s insurer. Yao did not subsequently apply for payment from the Fund, nor was there any reason to do so. The Fund did not have any obligation to pay the award, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>as there was no failure of insurance that left Yao without the compensation he was awarded.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED.

IWIF is now being phased out and replaced by the Chesapeake Employers' Insurance Company. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1991, 2008 RepLVol., 2014 Supp.) LE \u00a7 10-102(c). As of October 1, 2013, it may not issue any new policies, although it remains liable on policies issued prior to that date. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7\u00a7 10-101(e) &amp; 10-102(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b347-8\">.

Cui also was uninsured. This issue has never been decided by the Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b347-9\">. This amounts to $28,356 in weekly TTD benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b348-8\">.

A petition for judicial review may be filed in the circuit court for the county where the covered employee resides, where the employer has his or her principal place of business, or where the accidental injury occurred.

It is unclear whether such notice ever was given in the case at bar. In any event, the Fund does not argue that Yao\u2019s application for payment was improper for this reason. Moreover, as the <em>Danner </em>Court explained, the lack of notice to an insured employer ordinarily would not prejudice the Fund. 388 Md. at 664 n. 15, 882 A.2d 271.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b353-7\">. A statutory employer is anyone other than the direct employer of the covered employee who nevertheless may be liable for an award of compensation, pursuant to LE \u00a7 9-508. A principal contractor who is not the direct employer of the covered employee may be liable if the principal contractor contracted to perform work; contracted with a subcontractor for performance of all or a portion of that work; and the covered employee was injured during the performance of that work while directly employed by a subcontractor. LE \u00a7 9-508(a). Under those circumstances, the covered employee may collect a compensation award either from the subcontractor or from the principal contractor. LE \u00a7 9-508(e). If the covered employee names the statutory employer in his or her claim, the statutory employer may join the direct employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>and has a right of indemnification against the direct employer.

In oral argument, IWIF agreed, quite reasonably, that there was no triggering event relative to the November 2011 Award. The award was paid and Yao did not apply to the Fund for payment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b359-5\">.
