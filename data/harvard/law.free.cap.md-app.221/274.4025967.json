Appellee John Zorzit (\u201cZorzit\u201d) \u2014 the taxpayer in this case \u2014 was the president of Nick\u2019s Amusements, Inc. (\u201cNick\u2019s\u201d), a company charged in federal court with money laundering and operating an illegal gambling operation. Appellant, Comptroller of Maryland, assessed deficiency taxes and penalties against Zorzit and Nick\u2019s for under-reported gross income in Nick\u2019s\u2019 tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Zorzit and Nick\u2019s protested the amount of the assessment and the fraud penalties before the Comptroller\u2019s Hearings and Appeals Section. Following a hearing on the matter, the hearing officer reduced the amount of taxes owed, but Zorzit and Nick\u2019s continued to protest the assessment by appealing to the Maryland Tax Court. While this appeal was pending, the Comptroller filed a notice of lien against Zorzit, who then filed a petition for declaratory and injunctive relief in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. Zorzit asked the court to vacate the lien, contending that the Comptroller was not authorized to file the lien under Title 13 of the Tax-General Article prior to the Tax Court\u2019s disposition of his appeal, and that by filing the lien, the Comptroller deprived him of his property without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The circuit court found that although it was not necessary to conduct a hearing prior to imposition of the lien, Zorzit\u2019s due process rights under the United States Constitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights were violated because the Tax-General Article of the Maryland Code fails to specify an exact deadline by which the Tax Court must hold a post-deprivation hearing following imposition of a tax lien under \u00a7 13-807. The court granted Zorzit\u2019s motion for summary judgment, declared the statute unconstitutional, and vacated the lien until the Tax Court rendered a decision in Zorzit\u2019s appeal. The Tax Court has since rendered a decision affirming, with some alterations, the Comptroller\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>The Comptroller appealed and presents two questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-4\">I. \u201cDid the circuit court lack statutory authority to enter an order voiding the tax lien because (a) the taxpayer! ] failed to exhaust administrative remedies and (b) \u00a7 13-[5]05 of the Tax-General Article prohibits courts from enjoining or preventing the assessment or collection of a tax?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">II. \u201cDid the circuit court err in declaring that due process is denied by the tax lien provision of Maryland\u2019s statutory scheme, which affords taxpayers both an opportunity to be heard prior to final assessment and a prompt post-assessment de novo appeal to the Tax Court that is subject to judicial review?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Although the issues raised in this appeal are moot, similar cases may recur, and it is a matter of significant public concern that similar challenges would obstruct the Comptroller\u2019s statutory duty to collect monies due under the tax laws of Maryland. For the reasons set forth herein, we hold that the circuit court did not have the authority to vacate the tax lien because Maryland Code (1988, 2010 RepLVol.), Tax-General Article (\u201cTax-Gen.\u201d), \u00a7 13-505 expressly prohibits courts from issuing an injunction or any other process enjoining or preventing the Comptroller\u2019s collection of a tax. Only in exceptional and narrow circumstances may a taxpayer obtain collateral recourse from the judiciary to prevent the assessment or collection of a tax. Because the underlying action was barred under Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-505, we do not reach the constitutional issue presented in the Comptroller\u2019s second question. Accordingly, we vacate the circuit court\u2019s judgment and remand the matter to that court with instructions to dismiss Zorzit\u2019s petition for declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">THE STATUTORY PROCESS</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">A. Disputing Taxes</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">The Comptroller is charged with the duty to collect and account for certain enumerated taxes, <em>see </em>Tax-Gen. \u00a7 2-102, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>and the General Assembly has assigned the Comptroller broad authority and special powers to carry out these duties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The tax assessed in the instant case was an admissions and amusement tax.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A taxpayer is required to submit an admissions and amusement tax return \u201con or before the 10th day of the month that follows the month in which the person has gross receipts subject to the admissions and amusement tax.\u201d Tax-Gen. \u00a7 4-201(1).

Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-508(a). If the taxpayer fails to pursue either remedy, the assessment becomes final. Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-508(b).

The Tax Court\u2019s final order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>is enforceable \u201cunless the reviewing court grants a stay upon such condition, security or bond as it deems proper.\u201d Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13 \u2014 532(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">B. The Tax Lien</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The Tax-General Article provides that \u201c[u]npaid tax, interest, and penalties constitute a lien, in favor of the State, extending to all property and rights to property belonging to: (1) the person required to pay the tax[.]\u201d Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-805(a)(1). \u201c[A] lien arises on the date of notice that the tax is due and continues to the date on which the lien is (1) satisfied; or (2) released by the tax collector because the lien is: (i) unenforceable by reason of lapse of time; or (ii) uncollectible.\u201d Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-806(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The Comptroller must file a notice of tax lien in order for it to have \u201cthe full force and effect of a judgment lien.\u201d Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-808. The notice of lien is filed in the circuit court for the county where the property that is subject to the lien is located. Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-807(a). A tax lien takes priority over the proceeds of any sale of the taxpayer\u2019s property, except that it is \u201cnot valid against any purchaser, holder of a security interest, mechanic\u2019s lienor, or judgment lien creditor until notice of the tax lien has been filed[.]\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-809(a), (b)(1). Even upon the filing of the notice of lien, \u201cthe lien is not valid against any claim described in \u00a7 6323(b), (c), or (d) of the Internal Revenue Code[,]\u201d which includes, for example, claims by purchasers of certain kinds of property who did not, at the time of purchase and possession, have actual notice of the filed lien.

Upon the filing of such an action, \u201c[t]he court, acting without a jury, shall: (1) adjudicate all matters involved in the proceedings; and (2) determine the merits of all claims or liens.\u201d Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13 \u2014 810(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">C.

The unambiguous language of Tax Gen. \u00a7 13-505 reflects the General Assembly\u2019s intent to preclude courts from interfering with the detailed administrative process available to taxpayers outlined above. <em>Bancroft Info. Grp., Inc. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>91 Md.App. 100, 115, 603 A.2d 1289 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">A. Initial Tax Assessment and the Hearing before the Comptroller</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">A federal money-laundering investigation into Nick\u2019s in connection with the operation of illegal video-poker machines prompted the Comptroller to conduct a review of Nick\u2019s\u2019 past tax returns.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After completing this audit, the Comptroller issued a \u201cNotice of Assessment for Admissions &amp; Amusement Taxes,\u201d dated April 23, 2010, against Nick\u2019s for the tax period of January 1, 2000 through January 31, 2009. The assessment totaled $8,184,360.87, comprising the tax assessed ($2,963,-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>844.74), interest ($2,256,671.39), and penalties for purported fraud ($2,963,844.74). The Comptroller issued an identical Notice to Zorzit personally as an officer of Nick\u2019s.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Upon receipt of these notices, Nick\u2019s and Zorzit requested an informal hearing before the Comptroller\u2019s Hearings and Appeals Section pursuant to \u00a7 13-508.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">At the hearing held on October 6, 2010, witnesses testifying on behalf of the Comptroller\u2019s office explained that the Baltimore County Police Department and Internal Revenue Service\u2019s (\u201cIRS\u201d) investigation revealed that approximately 60% of Nick\u2019s\u2019 gross receipts were paid out to winning customers. Nick\u2019s\u2019 reported gross receipts on its admissions and amusement tax returns were based on Nick\u2019s\u2019 <em>net </em>profits <em>after </em>paying winning customers. To calculate Nick\u2019s\u2019 actual gross receipts, the Comptroller\u2019s office added the 59.13% payout to customers, as calculated in the police department\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Zorzit did not dispute his personal liability or that taxes were owed. Zorzit and Nick\u2019s did dispute, however, the penalty for fraud as well as the overall amount of taxes owed. Specifically, they argued that the fraud assessment was based solely on Nick\u2019s\u2019 purported underpayment of the admissions and amusement tax, and that the mere understatement of income is not sufficient under Maryland law to prove fraud.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> They argued that the Comptroller\u2019s office did not demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that Nick\u2019s and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Zorzit filed a false return with the intent to evade the payment of taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Nick\u2019s and Zorzit argued that the Comptroller\u2019s assessment of the amount of taxes owed was incorrect because the auditor\u2019s calculations for the underpayment of the admissions and amusement tax was based on erroneous assumptions. They claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Comptroller indiscriminately applied the payout percentage to receipts generated from all amusement devices, not just the illegal video-poker machines. Therefore, the Comptroller\u2019s assessment wrongly included gross receipts from non-gambling machines.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">On February 13, 2012, the presiding hearing officer issued two Notices of Final Determination for Nick\u2019s and Zorzit, respectively, containing detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law. According to the hearing officer, the record demonstrated that Nick\u2019s \u201coperated an illegal gambling operation in the State of Maryland and [was] significantly underreporting taxable gross receipts to the Comptroller\u2019s office.\u201d He found that the Comptroller demonstrated fraud by clear and convincing evidence, outlining three \u201cbadges\u201d of fraud present, including the consistent and substantial underpayment of income tax; the failure to maintain adequate records by reporting only net profits instead of gross profits; and the awareness by Nick\u2019s\u2019 officers of their duty to file tax returns. The hearing officer found, however, that it was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that the gross receipts attributable to machines in certain counties were not derived from illegal video-poker machines and adjusted the assessment accordingly. He adjusted the original payout percentage reflected in the assessment from 59.13% to 55.09%. With this adjustment, the hearing officer affirmed the Comptroller, revising the assessment to $6,453,690.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">With respect to Mr. Zorzit, the hearing officer observed that Zorzit did not dispute his personal liability for the underlying taxes and cited Tax-Gen. \u00a7 4r-301(b) for the precept that the admissions and amusement tax owed by a corporation \u201cextends to any officer of the corporation who exercises direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>control over its fiscal management.\u201d He declared that Zorzit, as the 100% shareholder and president of Nick\u2019s, was personally liable for the taxes owed by Nick\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">B. Appeal to the Tax Court</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">On March 13, 2012, within thirty days of the notice of final determination, Zorzit and Nick\u2019s filed petitions of appeal in the Tax Court of Maryland pursuant to Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-510.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Zorzit challenged, for the first time, the hearing officer\u2019s decision that he was personally liable for the admissions and amusement tax, interest and penalties due under the final notice of determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">C. The Lien and Declaratory Judgment Action in the Circuit Court</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">On June 7, 2012, and before the Tax Court held a hearing on Zorzit\u2019s appeal, the Comptroller filed a Notice of Judgment for Unpaid Tax against Zorzit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County in the amount of $6,453,690.16.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The lien was recorded on July 12, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Zorzit then filed a petition for declaratory relief, as well as a motion for summary judgment, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County on July 23, 2012. In his Petition for Declaratory Relief, Zorzit framed the issue as a question of statutory interpretation: \u201cwhen is a tax \u2018due\u2019 under the Tax General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Article ... such that the Comptroller is permitted to file a tax lien against a taxpayer, which by statute has the effect of a judgment lien[?]\u201d Zorzit sought a declaration from the court \u201cestablishing that the Tax Lien recorded by the Comptroller\u2014 before the Tax Court has determined the propriety of the assessment \u2014 is premature, not authorized by the plain meaning of any section of Title 13 of the Tax Code and violative of Mr. Zorzit\u2019s fundamental right to due process.\u201d Zorzit further claimed that he would be substantially and irreparably harmed by the imposition of the tax lien, because he would be considered in default on his other loans and lines of credit. Because the lien would effectively foreclose him from accessing future lines of credit, it would have a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d impact on him and his businesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">After two hearings,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the circuit court entered an order on April 17, 2013 granting Zorzit\u2019s motion for summary judgment and entering a declaratory judgment vacating the lien until the \u201cMaryland Tax Court has made a decision on the appeal by Mr. Zorzit that probable cause exists for the imposition of the tax lien.\u201d The court rejected Zorzit\u2019s claim that the Comptroller lacked the statutory authority to file the lien, and that taxpayers are entitled to a pre-deprivation hearing in the Tax Court. Rather, the circuit court vacated the lien based on its conclusion that Maryland\u2019s tax code fails to provide a sufficiently prompt post-deprivation hearing after the Comptroller files a notice of tax lien under Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-806.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Court surveyed several Supreme Court cases, including <em>Commissioner v. Shapiro, </em>424 U.S. 614, 96 S.Ct. 1062, 47 L.Ed.2d 278 (1976), <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976), and <em>Fuentes v. Shevin, </em>407 U.S. 67, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972), and determined that Maryland\u2019s statutory scheme was insufficient:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>The question then becomes whether there was a right to a later judicial determination of the legal right for the imposition of a lien against Zorzit\u2019s property. There is no dispute but that the Maryland Tax Court acting in a quasi-judicial capacity has the ability to make the probable cause determination. Is Maryland\u2019s statute sufficient to satisfy due process considerations by stating that the tax court hearing is to be promptly held? I think not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The court noted that \u201cin this case we are approaching 1 year from the time of the Notice of the Lien,\u201d and concluded \u201c[fjrom the case law cited through <em>Phillips, Fuentes, Shapiro </em>and state law cases, a set period of time appears to be a necessary requirement so that a more than less bright line can be drawn to afford due process constitutional post deprivations rights following a Notice of Tax Lien.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">On April 26, 2013, the Comptroller filed a motion to stay enforcement of judgment and a motion to alter or amend judgment, arguing that the court violated Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-505, which prohibits courts from taking action to prevent tax collection. The court denied both motions in a ruling entered on June 17, 2013. On July 2, 2013, the Comptroller filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">D. Tax Court Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">A few weeks later, on July 19, 2013, the Tax Court affirmed the Comptroller\u2019s tax assessments and the interest against Nick\u2019s and Zorzit, but reduced the fraud penalty from $2,159,794.97 to $1,079,862.45. The time between the institution of the tax lien (June 7, 2012) and the Tax Court\u2019s ruling (July 19, 2013) spanned just over one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AlG\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">The \u201c \u2018standard of review of the declaratory judgment entered as the result of the grant of a motion for summary judgment is whether that declaration was correct as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Md. Agric. Land Preservation Found. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number><em>Claggett, </em>412 Md. 45, 61, 985 A.2d 565 (2009) (quoting <em>S. Easton Neighborhood Ass\u2019n v. Town of Easton, </em>387 Md. 468, 487, 876 A.2d 58 (2005)). Because our inquiry into whether the circuit court\u2019s order vacating the Comptroller\u2019s lien violates the anti-injunction statute, Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-505, is a question of statutory interpretation, we conduct a de novo review. <em>See Reier v.

Because there is no longer an actual controversy between the parties for which we can provide a remedy, the instant appeal is moot.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cThe test for mootness is \u2018whether, when it is before the court, a case presents a controversy between the parties for which, by way of resolution, the court can fashion an effective remedy[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Harriot v.

Indeed, Zorzit has not participated in this appeal, as the timeframe for which he sought a remedy has passed, leaving him no incentive to challenge the Comptroller\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Notwithstanding that it is moot, this case demands consideration. \u201cUnlike the Article III constitutional constraints on the federal courts, ... our mootness doctrine is based entirely on prudential considerations\u201d that do not constitutionally bar us from reaching the merits of a moot action. <em>Carroll Cnty.

In <em>Lloyd v.

In Exhibit 9 to Zorzit\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the Comptroller advised Zorzit in a letter that \u201c[ajlthough the Comptroller is legally authorized to file a ... tax lien upon the issuance of any fraud assessment, this practice is generally limited to cases where the taxpayer is penalized for fraud.\u201d The Comptroller echoed this policy at oral argument. Assuming this assertion is true, the issues raised in this appeal will likely arise again if a taxpayer assessed with a fraud penalty challenges the imposition of a lien while his or her appeal in the Tax Court is pending. We believe that an action to challenge a lien during the <em>pendency of an appeal before the Tax Court </em>is of sufficiently short length to evade review by this Court before the issue ceases, or, in other words, the Tax Court renders its decision on the appeal. Indeed, the Tax Court is required to <em>promptly </em>hear and determine an appeal. Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-519. Thus, delinquent taxpayers may obtain similar injunctions, and even if these proceedings would not ultimately evade judicial review, the delay would stymie the Comptroller\u2019s duty to secure significant amounts of money due to be collected under the tax laws of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">A taxpayer\u2019s challenge to the Comptroller\u2019s imposition of a tax lien while the taxpayer\u2019s appeal is pending in the Tax Court is clearly an issue that impacts the relationship between the government and its citizens, and the Comptroller will likely appeal a taxpayer\u2019s future successful challenge to the imposition of a tax lien in these circumstances. Given the extensive and comprehensive administrative remedies available to taxpayers under the Tax-General Article, we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>persuaded that it is important to clarify and reinforce the necessity of exhausting those remedies before seeking relief in the circuit court and to emphasize the circuit court\u2019s lack of authority to enter orders, like the order entered here, vacating tax liens before the Tax Court\u2019s final determination of the merits of the tax assessment. Therefore, we will not dismiss this instant appeal as moot, and turn to the first issue presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\n<em>Exhaustion and Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-505</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The Comptroller contends that the circuit court lacked the authority to entertain Zorzit\u2019s declaratory judgment action for two reasons: (1) Zorzit failed to exhaust his administrative remedies; and (2) Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-505 prohibited the circuit court from entering an order enjoining the collection of a tax.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Zorzit has not participated in this appeal by way of briefing or argument. Before the circuit court, however, Zorzit argued there was no administrative remedy available to exhaust that would permit a challenge to the propriety of a lien filed prior to the Tax Court\u2019s resolution of his appeal. Zorzit challenged the Comptroller\u2019s <em>interpretation </em>of when a tax becomes \u201cdue\u201d under Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-806(a), claiming that the Comptroller\u2019s reading \u2014 that an imposition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>the lien before the Tax Court\u2019s resolution of an appeal is proper \u2014 violated his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">A. Zorzit Failed to Exhaust His Administrative Remedies</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The Maryland Declaratory Judgment Act, Maryland Code (1974, 2013 Rep. Vol.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d), \u00a7 3-409(b), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">If a statute provides a special form of remedy for a specific type of case, that statutory remedy shall be followed in lieu of a proceeding under this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">In light of this statute, the Court of Appeals has reiterated \u201cthat where there exists a special statutory remedy for a specific type of case, and the Legislature intends that remedy to be exclusive or primary, a party may not bypass the special statutory remedy by bringing an action for a declaratory judgment or for equitable relief.\u201d <em>Furnitureland S., Inc. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>364 Md. 126, 133, 771 A.2d 1061 (2001) (citations omitted). The rationale underlying the exhaustion requirement stems from the \u201cexpertise which the agency can bring to bear in sifting the information presented to it\u201d and the notion that permitting \u201cinterruption for purposes of judicial intervention at various stages of the administrative process might well undermine the very efficiency which the Legislature intended to achieve in the first instance.\u201d <em>Soley v. Comm\u2019n on Human Relations, </em>277 Md. 521, 526, 356 A.2d 254 (1976). Moreover, \u201c \u2018administrative agencies [such as the Tax Court] are fully competent to resolve issues of constitutionality and the validity of statutes or ordinances in adjudicatory administrative proceedings which are subject to judicial review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Furnitureland S., Inc., </em>364 Md. at 138, 771 A.2d 1061 (quoting <em>Montgomery Cnty. v. Broad. Equities, </em>360 Md. 438, 451 n. 8, 758 A.2d 995 (2000)). \u201cThis includes the constitutionality of an enactment as applied, as well as the constitutionality of an enactment as a whole.\u201d <em>Prince George\u2019s Cnty. v.

Thompson, </em>368 Md. 53, 65-66, 792 A.2d 277 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Specifically with regard to the tax scheme at issue here, the Court of Appeals \u201chas consistently treated the special statutory administrative remedies for the determination of tax questions to be exclusive or primary.\u201d <em>Furnitureland S., Inc., </em>364 Md. at 134, 771 A.2d 1061 (cataloguing prior holdings); <em>accord White v.

That remedies are exclusive or primary means that they cannot be bypassed by the pursuit of other remedies and that the remedies must be invoked and exhausted before judicial intervention. <em>Furnitureland S., Inc., </em>364 Md. at 133, 771 A.2d 1061 (citations omitted); <em>accord White, </em>282 Md. at 649, 387 A.2d 260; <em>State Dep\u2019t of Assessments &amp; Taxation v.

Moreover, it is important to note \u201cthe settled principle that laws enacted for the collection of general taxes must be interpreted with very great liberality; consequently, construction should not be undertaken with an eye to defeating the legislation, but with both eyes focused on giving it force, if reasonably possible.\u201d <em>Surratts Assocs. v.

Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-505 Barred Zorzit\u2019s Collateral Action</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The General Assembly has unambiguously expressed its intent to preclude judicial intervention in tax cases. Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>13-505 establishes that \u201c[a] court may not issue an injunction, writ of mandamus, or other process against the State or any officer or employee of the State to enjoin or prevent the assessment or collection of a tax[.]\u201d Indeed, taxpayers typically must pay the tax and later seek a refund if that tax is determined to be \u201cerroneously, illegally, or wrongfully assessed or <em>collected </em>in any manner.\u201d Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-901(a)(2) (emphasis added). We have interpreted \u00a7 13-505, when read in conjunction with Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-514 (requiring exhaustion before an appeal to the Tax Court) and CJP \u00a7 3-409(b) (requiring pursuit of the statutory remedy instead of a declaratory judgment action) to \u201cdemonstrate[ ] the Legislature\u2019s intent that tax disputes be resolved through the procedures established in Md. Tax-Gen. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 13-510 through 13-529.\u201d <em>Bancroft Info. Grp., Inc., supra, </em>91 Md.App. at 115, 603 A.2d 1289; <em>see also Kuypers v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>173 F.Supp.2d 393, 396 (D.Md.2001) (recognizing that, pursuant to \u00a7 13-505, the General Assembly \u201chas by statute expressed its intention that no suit may be brought to interfere with the statutory process for the assessment or collection of a state tax\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">In the realm of general tax law, anti-injunction statutes serve to ensure efficient collection of unpaid taxes owed to the government. These statutes contemplate that taxpayers may strive to dispute their tax liability, either armed with valid challenges or equipped with unfounded ones, beyond the avenues provided by the legislature. As the Supreme Court stated in 1880, taxes \u201cmay be vital to the existence of a govemment[,j\u201d and \u201c[t]he idea that every tax-payer is entitled to the delays of litigation is unreason.\u201d <em>Springer v. United States, </em>102 U.S. 586, 594, 26 L.Ed. 253 (1880).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The General Assembly has provided the Comptroller with a wide array of tax collection expedients, including the right to sell estate property, to demand security payments, and to file liens, actions to collect taxes, and jeopardy assessments.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Tax-Gen. subtitle 8 of Title 18. The tax lien in particular secures the State\u2019s interest in the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid taxes until the taxpayer satisfies his or her tax debts or until the tax collector seeks to enforce that lien and collect money from the taxpayer. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1063 (10th ed. 2009) (defining a \u201clien\u201d as \u201c[a] legal right or interest that a creditor has in another\u2019s property, lasting usually until a debt or duty that it secures is satisfied\u201d). Because a tax lien does not take priority until it is filed, and even upon the filing, is not valid against a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser, Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13 \u2014 809(b)(2), the General Assembly has authorized the Comptroller to file a notice of lien any time after the taxpayer receives notice of the amount of tax that is due. Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-806(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">If Maryland taxpayers were permitted to seek relief collateral to the detailed administrative procedures governing tax assessment and collection at their will, tax litigation would be rampant, thereby vitiating the intent of the legislature in crafting the Maryland tax framework as a primary, exclusive method to dispute taxes. Judge Hollander explained this precept in <em>Abington Center Associates Ltd. Partnership v. Baltimore County:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">In <em>Brown v. Montgomery County, </em>30 Md.App. 107, 112 [351 A.2d 156] (1976), we recognized a county\u2019s duty to sell the property of delinquent taxpayers. We therefore declined to stay the obligation to pay property taxes, based on a final assessment, pending an appeal. Although the property owners filed suit, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief, and argued that they were entitled to exhaust their rights in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>court, we disagreed, stating: \u201c[I]f the law were as appellants would have it, the capability of the taxing authority to perform its public functions could be brought to a standstill by mass appeals.

The Maryland General Assembly, like Congress and other state legislatures, has enacted an anti-injunction statute in the form of Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-505 to protect \u201cthe Government\u2019s need to assess and collect taxes as expeditiously as possible[.]\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Bob Jones Univ. v.

Exceptions to the Exhaustion Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"AFc\">There are, however, \u201c[ljimited exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine [that] permit a party, in tax matters and other kinds of cases, to pursue alternative forms of relief in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>court.\u201d <em>Abington, </em>115 Md.App. at 592-93, 694 A.2d 165. \u201cThese exceptions include (1) when the party attacks the statutory scheme as facially unconstitutional; (2) when there is no administrative remedy; and (3) when the administrative remedy provided by the statutory scheme is inadequate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 593, 694 A.2d 165 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">To determine whether this litigation falls within one of the exceptions, it is appropriate, first, to re-examine the relief sought by Zorzit in the circuit court. As summarized in his supplemental brief in support of his motion for summary judgment filed below, Zorzit asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">Mr. Zorzit seeks to vacate a Notice of Lien Judgment for Unpaid Tax (\u201cTax Lien\u201d) in excess of $6,450,00 because filing the Tax Lien in advance of any hearing before the Maryland Tax Court is <em>both </em>inconsistent with the provisions of Title 13, Subtitle 8 of the Tax-General Article of the Maryland Code (the \u201cTax Code\u201d) <em>and </em>violative of Mr. Zorzit\u2019s fundamental rights to due process.[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ado\">(Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\n<em>i The Maryland Tax Code Constitutes an Adequate Administrative Remedy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">The Maryland tax code provides a full range of administrative procedures to taxpayers.

Blumberg, </em>288 Md. 275, 292, 418 A.2d 1155 (1980) (quoting <em>Bennett v. Sch. Dist. of Royal Oak, </em>10 Mich.App. 265, 159 N.W.2d 245, 247 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Here, Zorzit availed himself of the procedures for disputing the taxes assessed against him. Upon receiving the notice of assessment for admissions and amusement taxes, Zorzit requested an informal hearing before the Comptroller\u2019s Hearings <em>&amp; </em>Appeals Section pursuant to Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-508(c), where he had the opportunity to challenge his assessment. The hearing officer examined Zorzit\u2019s challenges and, heeding some of his arguments, reduced the amount of the assessment. It is important to underscore that the General Assembly has conferred broad and immediate powers on the Comptroller to collect and secure taxes upon assessment. By operation of statute, \u201c[u]npaid tax, interest, and penalties constitute a lien, in favor of the State, extending to all property and rights to property belonging to ... the person required to pay the tax[,]\u201d Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-805 (emphasis added). Pursuant to Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-806(a), \u201cthe lien arises on the date of the notice that the tax is due and continues to the date on which the lien is: (1) satisfied; or (2) released by the tax collector because the lien is: (i) unenforceable by reason of lapse of time; or (ii) uncollectible.\u201d (Emphasis added). The Comptroller \u201cperfects\u201d the lien by filing a notice of tax lien in the circuit court.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-807(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>After receiving his notice of final determination, Zorzit chose to further appeal his assessment to the Tax Court pursuant to Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-510(a)(2). Thereafter, faced with concerns stemming from the millions of tax dollars owed in this case, Zorzit\u2019s fraud penalty, and his guilty plea for federal money-laundering, the Comptroller exercised its statutory authority to file a lien \u2014 something the Comptroller contends is an infrequently used tool at this stage along the tax-dispute continuum \u2014 to safeguard the public\u2019s interest in the monies owed by Zorzit to the State of Maryland. Importantly, it was only <em>after </em>Zorzit had notice of his assessment and the opportunity to challenge the amount of his assessment at the informal hearing that the Comptroller filed the lien, <em>in the reduced amount, </em>against Zorzit\u2019s assets. Stated differently, the Comptroller, in exercising its broad powers bestowed by the General Assembly, confronted the possibility that Zorzit\u2019s assets might be depleted during the pendency of the appeal, that other creditors might initiate claims, or that more fraudulent acts might occur in choosing to file the lien before the Tax Court\u2019s final determination. Indeed, the Comptroller must file the lien in order for it to have \u201cthe full force and effect of a judgment lien.\u201d Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-808. If filed later, the lien may have become subordinate to a prior perfected security interest. <em>See, e.g., Farmers &amp; Merchs. Nat\u2019l Bank of Hagerstown v. Schlossberg, </em>306 Md. 48, 66, 507 A.2d 172 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Had Zorzit not appealed to the Tax Court, the alternative scenario likely would have been enforcement of the notice of lien. The tax code provides that if a taxpayer fails to satisfy the properly filed lien within fifteen days after the notice of lien is issued, or the Comptroller does not otherwise release the lien, the Comptroller \u201cmay bring an action in a court of the State to enforce the lien.\u201d Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-810(a). Upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>the filing of such an action, \u201c[t]he court, acting without a jury, shall: (1) adjudicate all matters involved in the proceedings; and (2) determine the merits of all claims or liens.\u201d Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-810(c). Here, the Comptroller did not seek to enforce the lien, presumably because Zorzit pursued his right to appeal before the Tax Court. In any case, the Comptroller could not have enforced the lien against Zorzit without a full adjudicatory hearing in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">In sum, the exceptions to the exhaustion requirement for \u201cwhen there is no administrative remedy\u201d and \u201cwhen the administrative remedy provided by the statutory scheme is inadequate\u201d do not apply here. The Tax-General Article provides Zorzit with adequate administrative remedies for his challenge to the propriety of the lien and the underlying assessment through several alternative methods of review: (1) an informal hearing before the Comptroller\u2019s Hearings and Appeals Section; (2) an appeal to and hearing before the Tax Court; or (3) upon enforcement of the lien, an adjudication of the merits of the lien before the circuit court. By virtue of his informal hearing, Zorzit already challenged the assessment and, therefore, the amount of the lien ultimately filed pending his appeal to the Tax Court. It was error for the circuit court to review the merits of the case before Zorzit fully exhausted the mechanisms available to him for disputing his assessment. As noted by the Supreme Court, \u201c[t]he doctrine [of exhaustion of administrative remedies], wherever applicable, does not require merely the initiation of prescribed administrative procedures. It is one of exhausting them, that is, of pursuing them to their appropriate conclusion and, correlatively, of awaiting their final outcome before seeking judicial intervention.\u201d <em>Aircraft &amp; Diesel Equip.

After receiving its admissions and amusement tax assessment, the plaintiffs filed a declaratory judgment action in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>a judicial declaration that a statute containing various exemptions and one of the Comptroller\u2019s regulations were unconstitutional as violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. <em>Id. </em>at 586, 483 A.2d 1276.

The Court held that the plaintiffs were not attacking the legislature\u2019s power to enact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>the statutory exemptions; the company \u201cmerely attacked certain exemptions granted to businesses similar to its own.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, the Court concluded that plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the regulation related only to how the exemption was applied to their company, not how the exemption applied to all companies. <em>Id. </em>at 591, 483 A.2d 1276. Therefore, the Court held that the plaintiffs were required to exhaust their administrative remedies before seeking a judicial determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Here, in his petition for declaratory relief and motion for summary judgment, Zorzit challenged the Comptroller\u2019s interpretation of when a tax becomes \u201cdue\u201d under Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-806(a), claiming that the Comptroller\u2019s reading \u2014 that of the filing of a notice of lien under that statute before the Tax Court\u2019s resolution of an appeal is proper \u2014 violated his due process rights. Zorzit expressly <em>invokes the validity </em>of the statute by arguing that the Comptroller\u2019s action <em>violated </em>it. In our view, the crux of Zorzit\u2019s argument is that the statute was unconstitutional as <em>applied </em>in his case because the Comptroller filed the notice of lien before the Tax Court rendered a decision on his appeal. In other words, Zorzit does not contend that any tax lien filed under the statute would be unconstitutional in any taxpayer\u2019s case; therefore, he does not attack the constitutionality of the statute as a whole. Indeed, to fall within the constitutional exception, the attack must be made as to \u201call of [the statute\u2019s] parts and all of its applications.\u201d <em>Ray\u2019s Used Cars, </em>398 Md. at 652, 922 A.2d 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Unlike the plaintiffs in <em>Goldstein, </em>here, Zorzit sought to vacate the lien in addition to a declaration that the statute was unconstitutional. Therefore, because this case invokes the anti-injunction statute, Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-505, even if Zorzit had articulated a constitutional challenge to the whole statute, under <em>Holiday Point Marina Partners v. Anne Arundel County, </em>349 Md. 190, 707 A.2d 829 (1998), the constitutional exception does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The Court of Appeals has established that \u201cwhere the legislature has expressly provided or intended that the administrative and judicial review remedy be the \u2018exclusive\u2019 remedy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>the [constitutional] exception is inapplicable, and <em>a </em>declaratory judgment or equitable action challenging the validity of an enactment \u2018as a whole\u2019 will not lie.\u201d <em>Broad. Equities, Inc., </em>360 Md. at 457, 758 A.2d 995 (citations omitted). In <em>Holiday, </em>the plaintiff-marina applied for a zoning variance that was necessary pursuant to county law to obtain a permit to construct additional boat slips on its pier. 349 Md. at 194-95, 707 A.2d 829. The Zoning Hearing Officer denied the application, and the plaintiff filed a timely appeal to the Anne Arundel County Board of Appeals. <em>Id. </em>at 195, 707 A.2d 829. Before the disposition of its administrative appeal, however, the plaintiff filed a declaratory judgment action in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County challenging the county ordinance requiring the zoning variance as unconstitutional by virtue of being preempted by state and federal law. <em>Id. </em>The circuit court entertained the action based on its conclusion that the plaintiff attacked the county\u2019s authority to adopt the disputed law, citing <em>Harbor Island Marina, supra, </em>and issued a declaratory judgment that the county was authorized to adopt the law and that the ordinance was not otherwise unconstitutional under the doctrine of preemption. <em>Id. </em>at 197, 707 A.2d 829. This Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals issued a mandate vacating our affirmance and remanding to this Court with directions to vacate the circuit court\u2019s judgment. After reviewing the General Assembly\u2019s \u201cexpress\u201d statement that the administrative and judicial review remedy applicable in that case was exclusive, the Court concluded that \u201c[t]he effect of such [express] language is to abrogate any alternative legal or equitable remedies that might otherwise have existed\u201d and that \u201cwhere the administrative and judicial review procedures are exclusive, neither a declaratory judgment action nor a common law or equitable action will lie.\u201d Id. at 202-03, 707 A.2d 829 (citations omitted). The Court established that \u201c[t]he so-called \u2018constitutional\u2019 or \u2018validity\u2019 exception to the requirement that a primary administrative remedy be first invoked and exhausted ordinarily has no application when the administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>tive and judicial review remedy is exclusive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203, 707 A.2d 829 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">Here, the Court of Appeals has determined that the Tax-General Article provides the exclusive, primary remedies for tax-related disputes, and the General Assembly enacted Tax-Gen. \u00a7 13-505 to establish an explicit prohibition against judicial interference with the tax assessment and collection process. Therefore, even if Zorzit articulated a challenge to the legislature\u2019s authority to enact the statute or to the validity of the statute as a whole, he could not obtain relief from the judiciary pursuant to the constitutional exception without first exhausting his administrative remedies. Indeed, the Court of Appeals has quoted the Supreme Court as stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">It is true that the presence of constitutional questions, coupled with a sufficient showing of inadequacy of prescribed administrative relief and of threatened or impending irreparable injury flowing from delay incident to following the prescribed procedure, has been held sufficient to dispense with exhausting the administrative process before instituting judicial intervention. But ... this rule is not one of mere convenience or ready application. Where the intent of [the legislature] ... is clear to require administrative determination, either to the exclusion of judicial action or in advance of it, a strong showing is required, both of inadequacy of the prescribed procedure and of impending harm, to permit short-circuiting the administrative process.... commands for judicial restraint in this respect are not lightly to be disregarded.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-6\"><em>Poe v.

In comparison to the separate federal provisions for a notice of deficiency and a notice of assessment, we have recognized that Maryland's statute providing for a \"notice of assessment\u201d is a \u201chybrid of the federal provisions, <em>i.e., </em>the Maryland statute combines the notice of deficiency with the notice of assessment so that the taxpayer effectively receives both at once.\u201d <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. v.
