(\u201cRoss\u201d), for the replacement of the Bidle Road Bridge. Among other things, the Contract required Ross to remove the bridge\u2019s existing supporting abutments and excavate for new supports. In the course of excavating one of the abutments, Ross encountered subsurface conditions that differed from those it expected, so it filed a request for an equitable adjustment in the contract price to reflect the differences. The County denied Ross\u2019s request. An arbitrator appointed pursuant to the Contract<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> affirmed that denial in part, reversed it in part, and awarded Ross a smaller equitable adjustment than it had requested. The Circuit Court for Frederick County upheld the arbitration decision, finding substantial evidence in the record to support the arbitrator\u2019s decision that Ross did not encounter a materially different site condition. Ross seeks our review, but we dismiss because Ross had no right of appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">A. The Contract And Its Performance</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">In October 2008, the County issued an Invitation to Bid (the \u201cInvitation\u201d) for a contract to construct the \u201cReplacement of Bidle Road Bridge No. F03-10 over Catoctin Creek.\u201d The Invitation called for the removal of the existing one-lane bridge structure and supporting abutments, excavation for new supports, and construction of a new two-lane bridge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>structure and roadway (the \u201cProject\u201d). Prospective bidders were also provided, among other things, with the Maryland State Highway Administration\u2019s Standard Specifications for Construction and Materials (the \u201cSpecifications\u201d) and four soil boring logs<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the excavation area, designated B-l through B-4, that indicated to bidders the types of subsurface materials at the excavation site.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Soil boring logs B-l and B-2 were from the area where Abutment A was to be constructed, and B-3 and B-4 were from the area where Abutment B was to be constructed. The soil boring logs for Abutment B indicated that the winning contractor should anticipate disintegrated rock down to a depth of 360 feet above sea level (\u201cASL\u201d) at B-3 and 366.40 feet ASL at B-4. As such, the contract provided that the contractor would excavate to a depth of 382 feet ASL, where it would place the bottom of the footer for Abutment B.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Ross, a construction company based in Mount Airy, reviewed the Invitation and, as part of the bid process, examined the Project site on four separate occasions. Ross was the successful low bidder and entered into a contract with the County on February 3, 2009 (the \u201cContract\u201d). The Contract incorporated, among other things, the Invitation, the Specifications, and the soil boring logs. The Specifications included specific provisions covering situations where site conditions during performance varied from the conditions set forth in the Contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">GP-4.05 Differing Site Conditions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">(a) The Contractor shall promptly, and before such conditions are disturbed, notify the procurement officer in writing of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>(1) Subsurface or latent physical conditions at the site differing materially from those indicated in this Contract; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-4\">(2) Unknown physical conditions at the site of an unusual nature, differing materially from those ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inherent in work of the character provided for in this contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">The procurement officer shall promptly investigate the conditions, and if he finds that such conditions do materially so differ and cause an increase or decrease in the Contractor\u2019s cost of, or the time required for, performance of any part of the work under this Contract, whether or not changed as a result of such conditions, an equitable adjustment shall be made and the Contract modified in writing accordingly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">(b) No claim of the Contractor under this clause shall be allowed unless the Contractor has given the notice required in (a) above; provided however, the time prescribed therefore may be extended by the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">GP-4.06 Changes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">(d) ... [I]f any change under this clause causes an increase or decrease in the Contractor\u2019s cost of, or the time required for, the performance of any part of the work under this Contract, whether or not changed by any order, an equitable adjustment shall be made and the Contract modified in writing accordingly. Provided, however, that except for claims based on defective specifications, no claim for any change under [4.06](b) above shall be allowed for any costs incurred more than 20 days before the Contractor gives written notice as therein required; and provided further, that in the case of defective Specifications for which the [County] is responsible, the equitable adjustment shall include any increased cost reasonably incurred by the Contractor in attempting to comply with such defective Specifications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>(e) If the Contractor intends to assert a claim for an equitable adjustment under this clause, he shall, within 30 days after receipt of a written change order under [4.061(a) above or the furnishing of written notice under [4.061(b) above, submit to the procurement officer a written statement setting forth the general nature and monetary extent of such claim, unless this period is extended by the State[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQI\">Overall, and before any adjustments, the County agreed to pay Ross in \u201can amount not to exceed the contract bid price of [$1,293,797.50].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Ross first completed demolition and excavation work on Abutment A, then began excavation activities for Abutment B on April 22, 2009. Excavation continued until April 29, when Ross encountered hard rock material above the elevations indicated on the boring logs provided by the County. The following day, Ross notified the County of what it believed to be a differing site condition, as described in GP-4.05. The County suspended excavation activities on May 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The County directed Ross to engage a third-party quality control/inspector subcontractor, ECS, Ltd. (\u201cECS\u201d), to perform three additional borings in the area of Abutment B. ECS conducted the boring operations on May 11 and 12, 2009, and on May 18, it gave Ross a report of its findings (the \u201cECS Report\u201d). The ECS Report indicated that hard rock materials existed at a depth of 389 feet ASL and that these materials differed from the conditions represented on the boring logs provided by the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The County reviewed the ECS Report and, on May 26, 2009, informed Ross that it would issue a revised design of Abutment B. Two days later, Ross notified the County that it anticipated filing a claim for an equitable adjustment due to the differing site conditions and changed design. On June 2, the County issued a \u201cred-lined version of the Project designed for Abutment B,\u201d which \u201craised\u201d the bottom of the Abutment B footer by three feet \u2014 from 382 feet ASL to 385 feet ASL. The County noted that the newfound hard rock material made it unnecessary to excavate the additional three feet as original<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>ly planned because those depths would ultimately have been filled with concrete.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">Ross completed construction of the revised design on June 24, 2009 and, pursuant to GP-4.06(e), submitted a Proposed Change Order (the \u201cPCO\u201d) requesting an equitable adjustment of the Contract price in the amount of $89,971.55. Ross sought additional compensation for the added costs and time necessitated by the revised design, as well as the cost of ECS\u2019s geotechnical exploration per the County\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">In a letter dated July 27, 2009, the County rejected Ross\u2019s PCO, stating that Ross was \u201conly due a reasonable amount for the Geotechnical Services provided by ECS ... and that the credit due as a result of the raising of the bottom footing elevation ... may offset the additional inconvenience caused by the time it took to excavate the harder rock.\u201d On November 17, 2009, Ross submitted a revised claim for $124,902.64, which the County also denied. In response, Ross invoked the Contract\u2019s Arbitration provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-6\">Pursuant to [Art. 25 \u00a7 lA(g)], in the event of a dispute between the parties to this contract involving $10,000.00 or more regarding the terms of the contract or performance under the contract, the question involved in the dispute shall be subject to a determination of questions of fact by one of the following County Directors: Director of Public Works, Director of Utilities and Solid Waste Management, Finance Director or Director of Management Services. The County Manager, in his sole discretion, shall select one of these Directors to make this determination. The decision of the Director or other official is subject to review on the record by the Circuit Court for Frederick County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">On February 2, 2012, pursuant to this provision, the County appointed Kevin Demosky, the Director of the Frederick County Division of Utilities and Solid Waste Management, to serve as the hearing officer in this dispute (the \u201cHearing Officer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>B. The Hearing Officer\u2019s Review</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">The Hearing Officer heard opening arguments and visited the Project Site on February 10, 2012, held evidentiary hearings on March 2 and 13, and accepted written briefs on April 5. On May 1, he issued a written decision granting in part and denying in part Ross\u2019s claim for an equitable adjustment of the Contract price. The summary of the Hearing Officer\u2019s findings, as provided by the circuit court, is helpful here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdW\"><em>The Agency[</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em>] concluded, in its Final Decision, that the rock encountered by Ross during the excavation did not amount to a materially different site condition pursuant to CPA-05 of the Contract. </em>The Agency reasoned that Ross should have been on notice prior to the excavation that it would encounter rock at the site of the excavation, but did not conduct a proper site inspection prior to its bid. The Agency explained that it found GP-2.04 of the Contract relevant, which waives liability of the State for the Contractor\u2019s interpretations of information in the Contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\"><em>The Agency decided that Ross was on notice of the rock, which was visible at the site of the project. </em>The Agency explained that the testimony demonstrated that Ross\u2019[s] agents made at least four pre-bid site inspections, and that \u201c[t]he possibility of hard rock was clearly visible during a pre-bid site inspection.\u201d The Agency recognized that the soil borings provided as part of the contract did constitute a softer soil than Ross eventually encountered, but explained that \u201cpre-construction photos in evidence suggest a sharply plunging rock stratum that would have been apparent to Ross, but which could have easily been not encountered [by the company that performed the pre-bid soil boring].\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\"><em>The Agency also explained that Ross was on notice that other contractors were anticipating encountering rock during the project. </em>Specifically, the Agency referenced what has been designated as Question 19 for pre-bid hearing where the County fielded questions from bidding contrac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>tors about the project; the Transcript of this hearing is attached to the Contract as Addendum 1. The Agency explained, \u201cAddendum 1 clearly indicates that other bidders were aware they would encounter rock in excavating Class 3 excavation work on the site. Addendum 1 also put all bidders, like Ross that did not attend the pre-bid meeting, on notice that they would likely encounter rock.\u201d The Agency explained further, \u201c... there is no way that I can disregard the notice of potential rock provided by Addendum 1 that is part of the Contract nor can I disregard the obvious and visible rock ledge that should have been addressed during a pre-bid site inspection.\u201d The Agency explained that Ross\u2019[s] lack of addressing the \u201cobvious and visible rock ledge\u201d resulted in its eventual low bid price:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-4\">\u201cFurther, I find the Class 3 excavation bid comparison introduced by the County to be relevant to the issue of what a reasonable contractor bidding this Bridge project should have expected. The comparison of Class 3 excavation reflects that while Ross bid $16.00 per cubic yard (\u201cCY\u201d) for Class 3 excavation, the second and third lowest overall bidders bid 67.00 and 35.00 per CY respectively for Class 3 excavation (4.2 times and 2.2 times Ross\u2019[s] bid respectively).\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">The Agency reasoned that \u201cit would be inequitable to allow Ross \u2014 which should have expected to encounter hard rock \u2014 to low bid the Class 3 excavation as Ross did ... only to receive additional compensation through a differing site condition claim.\u201d The Agency concluded that Ross misread the information at the site and in the contract, and that the State should and could not be liable for Ross\u2019fs] error pursuant to GP-2.04 of the Contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">(Emphases added.) In granting part of Ross\u2019s equitable adjustment claim, the Hearing Officer found that Ross was entitled to additional compensation in the amount of $31,946.41 for the pause in the project to investigate the subsurface conditions. But the Hearing Officer denied Ross any additional compensation for the excavation of the hard rock material.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>C. The Circuit Court\u2019s Review</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">On May 16, 2012, Ross filed a \u201cPetition for Judicial Review of Agency Decision\u201d in the Circuit Court for Frederick County.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The circuit court heard arguments on April 15, 2013 and entered an Opinion and Order on June 5, 2013. The court concluded that although \u201csoil boring logs B-3 and B-4 ... demonstrate a soft subsurface material,\u201d it agreed with the Hearing Officer\u2019s finding \u201cthat evidence in the record supports the conclusion that Ross was aware of the possible existence of subsurface rock at the site of Abutment B.\u201d Consequently, the court affirmed the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision that Ross did not encounter a materially different site condition. Ross filed a notice of appeal on June 26, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Ross raises one question for our review: did the Hearing Officer err in finding that Ross was not entitled to the full amount of its equitable adjustment claim? The County moved to dismiss, arguing that this Court lacked jurisdiction to hear Ross\u2019s appeal. As we explain, the County is correct \u2014 Ross had no right of appeal from the circuit court judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>A. Ross\u2019s Appeal To This Court Requires Statutory Authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">\u201c \u2018It is an often stated principle of Maryland law that appellate jurisdiction, except as constitutionally authorized, is determined entirely by statute, and that, therefore, a right of appeal must be legislatively granted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Prince George\u2019s Cnty. v.

As a result, Ross\u2019s ability to appeal to this Court depends on whether that right exists under the Maryland Code. <em>See Beretta, </em>358 Md. at 173-74, 747 A.2d 647; <em>Gisriel, </em>345 Md. at 485, 693 A.2d 757; <em>Madison Park, </em>211 Md.App. at 690, 66 A.3d 93.

Vol.), \u00a7 12-301 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJ\u201d), permits this Court to hear appeals from final judgments of the circuit courts in the exercise of original, special, limited, or statutory jurisdiction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\"><em>Except as provided in [CJ] \u00a7 12-302 of this subtitle, </em>a party may appeal from a final judgment entered in a civil or criminal case by a circuit court. The right of appeal exists from a final judgment entered by a court in the exercise of original, special, limited, statutory jurisdiction, unless in a particular case the right of appeal is expressly denied by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">CJ \u00a7 12-301 (emphasis added). However, a right to appeal under CJ \u00a7 12-301 does not exist if CJ \u00a7 12-302(a) applies instead.

A circuit court exercises \u201cappellate jurisdiction\u201d when it reviews an administrative agency\u2019s decision pursuant to statutory authorization. <em>Gisriel, </em>345 Md. at 492, 693 A.2d 757; <em>see also Rogers v.

And when a circuit court reviews a decision of an administrative agency pursuant to CJ \u00a7 12-302(a), any right of appeal to this Court must arise under a statute <em>other than CJ \u00a7 12-301; </em>if no other statutory right to an appeal exists, we must dismiss the appeal. <em>Madison Park, </em>211 Md.App. at 690, 66 A.3d 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">In <em>Gisriel, </em>345 Md. 477, 693 A.2d 757, the Court of Appeals examined an appellate path closely mirroring the path taken here: an appeal to this Court from a circuit court\u2019s review of an administrative agency\u2019s decision. In that case, Mr. Gisriel filed a petition with the Ocean City Board of Supervisors to bring a zoning ordinance to referendum, and the Board rejected his petition. <em>Id. </em>at 480-81, 693 A.2d 757. Mr. Gisriel sought review of the Board\u2019s decision before the City Council of Ocean City, and the City Council affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 482, 693 A.2d 757. Pursuant to the Ocean City Charter,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mr. Gisriel appealed to the Circuit Court for Worcester County, which ruled in his favor, and the City Council appealed to this Court. <em>Id. </em>at 484, 693 A.2d 757. We decided that we had jurisdiction to hear the City Council\u2019s appeal and reversed the circuit court\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>at 484-85, 693 A.2d 757. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Court of Appeals upheld our reversal, but found that our basis for finding jurisdiction was incorrect (the Court ultimately found jurisdiction on another ground). <em>Id. </em>at 496, 508, 693 A.2d 757. Specifically, the Court held that we erroneously concluded that CJ \u00a7 12-302(a) was inapplicable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-4\">The Court of Special Appeals, construing this language in its most literal sense, held that [CJ] \u00a7 12-302(a) is applicable only when the court below is exercising \u201cappellate\u201d jurisdiction rather than \u201coriginal\u201d jurisdiction. The Court of Special Appeals thus explained <em>([Ocean City Bd. of Supervisors of Elections v. Gisriel </em>] 102 Md.App. [136] at 147 [648 A.2d 1091]):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">\u201cThe issue, therefore, is whether the circuit court, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>exercised original or appellate jurisdiction when it reviewed the City Council\u2019s decision to affirm the Board\u2019s denial of appellee\u2019s petition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">Next, the Court of Special Appeals, citing and quoting from <em>Shell Oil Co. v. Supervisor, </em>276 Md. 36, 43 [343 A.2d 521] (1975), reiterated the principle of Maryland constitutional law that circuit court review of decisions by administrative agencies or local government bodies constitutes an exercise of original jurisdiction and not appellate jurisdiction. 102 Md.App. at 147-49 [648 A.2d 1091]. Since, under the Court of Special Appeals\u2019[s] interpretation, [CJ] \u00a7 12-302(a)\u2019s limitation on the right to appeal from circuit court judgments is applicable only when a circuit court is technically exercising <em>appellate </em>jurisdiction, and since the circuit court\u2019s review of the City Council\u2019s decision in the present case was an exercise of <em>original </em>jurisdiction, [CJ] \u00a7 12-302(a)\u2019s limitation on the right to appeal was held to be inapplicable in the present case. For this reason, the Court of Special Appeals held that it had jurisdiction under [CJ] \u00a7 12-301 to entertain the appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-7\"><em>Gisriel, </em>345 Md. at 490-91, 693 A.2d 757. The Court rejected this interpretation of CJ \u00a7 12-302(a), <em>id. </em>at 491, 693 A.2d 757, and called for a \u201cbroader construction of the phrase \u2018appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>jurisdiction\u2019 in [CJ] \u00a7 12-302(a), that included ordinary <em>statutory judicial review of adjudicatory decisions by administrative agencies </em>and local legislative bodies\u201d within the meaning of that phrase. <em>Id. </em>at 492, 693 A.2d 757 (emphasis added). Put another way, the Court stated that CJ \u00a7 12-302(a) \u201cis applicable to <em>statutory judicial review actions </em>even though such actions technically do not represent exercises of a circuit court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 493, 693 A.2d 757 (emphasis added). In turn, the Court held that circuit court review of an agency ruling ordinarily precludes review in this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-4\">[W]hen a circuit court proceeding in substance constitutes ordinary judicial review of an adjudicatory decision by an administrative agency ... pursuant to a statute, ordinance, or charter provision, and the circuit court renders a final judgment within its jurisdiction, [CJ] \u00a7 12-302(a) is applicable, and an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals is not authorized by [CJ] \u00a7 12-301.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 496, 693 A.2d 757 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Because the Ocean City Charter authorized the circuit court\u2019s review of the City Council\u2019s decision, the Court found that the circuit court was exercising \u201cappellate jurisdiction\u201d under CJ \u00a7 12-302(a). Consequently, the Court required additional statutory authority permitting a subsequent appeal to this Court. Finding none, the Court held that we lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 485-86, 693 A.2d 757.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>The appellate path taken in <em>Beretta, </em>358 Md. 166, 747 A.2d 647, also mirrors both this case and <em>Gisriel. </em>In <em>Beretta, </em>an employer aggrieved by a decision of the Prince George\u2019s County Human Relations Commission brought an action for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. <em>Id. </em>at 170, 747 A.2d 647. Beretta\u2019s appeal to the circuit court was permitted by a provision in the Prince George\u2019s County Code, which provided that \u201c[a]ny party aggrieved by a final decision by the Commission is entitled to file an appeal pursuant to Subtitle B of the Maryland Rules of Procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 169, 747 A.2d 647. Subtitle B (which was replaced by Rule 7-201 through 7-209) permitted the review of Commission decisions in the circuit court. <em>Id. </em>at 169, 747 A.2d 647. The circuit court affirmed, the employer appealed to this Court, and we reversed. <em>Id. </em>at 171, 747 A.2d 647. However, the Court of Appeals found that CJ \u00a7 12-302(a) applied to the circuit court\u2019s review of the Commission\u2019s decision, so it looked to see if a right to a subsequent appeal was granted elsewhere in the law. <em>Id. </em>Finding no such authorization, the Court held that we lacked jurisdiction to hear the employer\u2019s appeal of the judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 174, 747 A.2d 647.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>B. No Statutory Authority Permits This Court To Hear Ross\u2019s Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Our jurisdiction to hear Ross\u2019s appeal depends on two things: <em>first, </em>whether CJ \u00a7 12-302(a) applies to Ross\u2019s appeal, and, if so, <em>second, </em>whether any statutory authority, other than CJ \u00a7 12-301, authorizes us to hear Ross\u2019s appeal from the circuit court\u2019s affirmance of the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Here, the circuit court reviewed and affirmed the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision pursuant to a statutory right of review provided by Art. 25 \u00a7 lA(g):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">(g) <em>Resolution of dispute in construction contract </em>\u2014 Deter<em>mination by county officer subject to court review. </em>\u2014 Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (e) and (f) of this section, a county governed by county commissioners may provide or require, with regard to a construction contract to which it is a party, that a dispute between the parties involving $10,000 or more regarding the terms of the contract or performance under the contract, be subject to a determination of questions of fact by an officer or official body of a county governed by county commissioners, <em>provided that the decision of the officer or official body of a county governed by county commissioners is subject to review on the record by a court of competent jurisdiction.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Art. 25 \u00a7 lA(g) (emphasis added). As such, CJ \u00a7 12-302(a) applies and CJ \u00a7 12-301 cannot support jurisdiction in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">We turn then to the second question: whether any statutory authority, other than CJ \u00a7 12-301, supplies this Court with such jurisdiction. Ross argues that statutory authorization can be found in the Administrative Procedure Act (the \u201cAPA\u201d), SG \u00a7 10-101 <em>et seq. </em>Although Ross conceded at oral argument that its dispute with the County isn\u2019t covered directly by the APA,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it contends that the parties invoked the APA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>by adopting GP-5.15 into the Contract. Subsection (a) of GP-5.15 provides that the \u201cContract is subject to the provisions of Title 15, Subtitle 2, State Finance and Procurement Article (Dispute Resolution) of the Annotated Code of Maryland,\u201d which in turn permits \u201cjudicial review in accordance with Title 10, Subtitle 2 of the State Government Article[ \u2014 the APA].\u201d Md. Code (1985, 2009 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 15-223 of the State Finance and Procurement Article (\u201cSFP\u201d). In other words, Ross argues that if GP-5.15(a) applies here, disputes arising from the Contract should be adjudicated in accordance with the APA. Looking to the APA, Ross relies on SG \u00a7 10-223(b)(1), which provides that \u201c[a] party who is aggrieved by a final judgment of a circuit court under this subtitle may appeal to the Court of Special Appeals in the manner that law provides for appeal of civil cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>From this provision, Ross concludes that this Court is statutorily authorized to hear its appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">We disagree. Ross overlooks subsection (b) of GP-5.15, which provides that <em>\u201c[e]xcept as otherwise may be provided by law, </em>all disputes arising under ... this Contract that are not disposed of by mutual agreement shall be resolved in accordance with this clause.\u201d GP-5.15(b) (emphasis added). Unfortunately for Ross, how we treat disputes arising from a construction contract between a county and a contractor <em>is </em>\u201cotherwise ... provided by law.\u201d Art. 25 \u00a7 lA(g) provides the dispute resolution procedures that Ross and the County were required to follow in connection with the Contract.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Under GP-5.15(b), their dispute was not subject to GP-5.15(a) or, in turn, the APA, which leaves no statutory basis for appellate jurisdiction in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED.

In that case, we examined whether the <em>circuit court </em>was statutorily authorized to review a decision of the Commissioner of the Baltimore City Department of Housing and Community Development. <em>Id. </em>at 680, 66 A.3d 93. As here, we reviewed the principles governing appellate review of administrative agency decisions (primarily CJ \u00a7\u00a7 12-301 and -302), and we recognized that statutory authorization was necessary to establish <em>any </em>judicial review power. In turn, we looked to see whether such authorization could be found in either the Baltimore City Code or the Administrative Procedure Act. SG \u00a7 10-101 <em>et seq. </em>Finding no statute authorizing <em>any </em>review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision within either source, <em>Madison Park, </em>211 Md.App. at 692, 66 A.3d 93, we held that a party aggrieved by the Commissioner\u2019s decision had no right to seek judicial review. Moreover, in <em>dicta, </em>we recognized that even \u201cif the [Baltimore City Code] provide[d] for an appeal of the Commissioner\u2019s decision to the circuit court, [the Court of Special Appeals] is without jurisdiction to entertain further review, <em>unless authorization is found elsewhere.\u201d Id. </em>at 691, 66 A.3d 93 (emphasis added).

Ross likely also has waived any argument that its dispute with the County is subject to the dispute resolution procedures contained in the State Government or State Finance and Procurement Articles. Ross has repeatedly invoked Art. 25 \u00a7 lA(g) (pursuant to the Contract\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Arbitration provision) throughout the dispute resolution process leading to this appeal, so it cannot now claim that this dispute should have been subject to the APA (by way of GP-5.15(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Examples of Ross\u2019s reliance on Art. 25 \u00a7 1A appear throughout the record. <em>First, </em>Ross did not challenge the Hearing Officer's adjudication of the parties\u2019 equitable adjustment dispute, and after the Hearing Officer heard arguments, Ross submitted a Closing Memorandum explaining that it had brought its equitable adjustment claim pursuant to Art. 25 \u00a7 1A. If GP-5.15(a) had applied, the initial dispute would have been subject to the jurisdiction of the Maryland State Board of Contract Appeals. See SFP \u00a7 15 \u2014 211 (a)(2)(iii) (\"The Appeals Board shall have jurisdiction to hear and decide all appeals arising from the final action of a unit ... on a contract claim by a contractor or a unit concerning ... performance [or] modification.\u201d). <em>Second, </em>Ross, in its Petition for Judicial Review of the Hearing Officer's decision, explained that it was petitioning pursuant to Art. 25 \u00a7 1A. Again, if GP-5.15(a) had applied, Ross's appeal to the circuit court would have instead been authorized by both SFP \u00a7 15-223(a)(l)-(2) and SG \u00a7 10-222. Yet throughout the proceedings leading to this appeal, Ross did not invoke any provision of the State Government or State Finance and Procurement Articles. Even if it had, in light of GP-5.15(b), its attempts would have been unsuccessful.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
