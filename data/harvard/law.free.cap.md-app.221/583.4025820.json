She appeals the order of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, which affirmed the decision of the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d), also an appellee, denying her request for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">On appeal, Ms. Brunson raises three questions for our review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which we have rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">1. Did the Commission err in declining to enforce an award of attorney\u2019s fees when the decisions granting the award subsequently were rescinded and annulled?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-9\">2. Did the Commission err in declining to award penalties and fees for failure to pay the attorney\u2019s fees upon conclusion of the appeal to circuit court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>3. Did the Commission err when it failed to award counsel fees, reimbursement for incurred expenses, and reimbursement for a doctor fee pursuant to the award of compensation for permanent partial disability?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">On September 9, 2010, Ms. Brunson sustained a \u201clifting injury\u201d to her back while working as a patient care technician for UMMSC. Ms. Brunson filed a claim with the Commission, and on April 8, 2011, the Commission held a hearing on the issues of temporary total disability, authorization for medication treatment, and payment of medical expenses. The Commission found that, as a result of Ms. Brunson\u2019s accidental injury, she was temporarily totally disabled from December 30, 2010, to the time of the hearing and continuing. It authorized physical therapy that had been performed, as well as a new course of physical therapy, as recommended by Ms. Brunson\u2019s doctor. It also authorized an EMG and an MRI to Ms. Brunson\u2019s back, and it authorized payment of outstanding medical bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">On May 3, 2011, the Commission ordered that UMMSC, a self-insured employer, pay Ms. Brunson temporary total disability at the rate of $432 per week, \u201cbeginning December 30, 2010 to present and continuing, so long as [she] remained temporarily totally disabled as a result of [the] claim.\u201d It further ordered that, \u201cfrom the compensation herein awarded, James A. Lanier, attorney for claimant, is allowed a lump sum counsel fee in the amount of $756.00.\u201d Pursuant to the order, temporary total disability benefits were paid through July 13, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">On November 9, 2011, the Commission held another hearing on Ms. Brunson\u2019s claim regarding temporary total disability, authorization for medical treatment, payment of outstanding medical expenses, and attorney\u2019s fees and penalties. On November 28, 2011, the Commission ordered, <em>inter alia, </em>that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>UMMSC pay additional compensation for temporary total disability at the rate of $432 per week, from \u201cJuly 14, 2011 to present and continuing, so long as [she] remained temporarily totally disabled as a result of [the] claim.\u201d It further ordered that, \u201cfrom the compensation herein awarded, James A. Lanier, attorney for claimant, is allowed a lump sum counsel fee in the amount of $842.40.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">Pending appeal of the Commission\u2019s orders, UMMSC paid Ms. Brunson weekly temporary total disability benefits at the rate of $432 per week, for a total of $30,554.74, for the period of December 30, 2010, through June 2, 2012. The payment of the attorney\u2019s fees awards was stayed during the pendency of the appeals, and the total awarded amount of $1,598.40 was held in escrow pending a final determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">On December 12 and 13, 2012, the appeals brought by UMMSC were tried together before a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. The jury partially reversed the Commission\u2019s May 3, 2011, and November 28, 2011, decisions. It found that Ms. Brunson \u201cwas not temporarily and totally disabled from December 20, 2010 forward,\u201d and Ms. Brunson\u2019s \u201cEMG, MRI of the back and pain management were not reasonable, necessary and causally related to the accidental injury of September 9, 2010.\u201d The jury affirmed the Commission\u2019s decision of May 3, 2011, that physical therapy was \u201creasonable, necessary and causally related to the accidental injury.\u201d On December 14, 2012, based on the jury\u2019s verdict, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County ordered that the Commission\u2019s decisions of May 3, 2011, and November 28, 2011, \u201cbe rescinded and annulled,\u201d and that the case be remanded to the Commission \u201cfor the entry of new Orders consistent with the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">On March 5, 2013, in accordance with the circuit court\u2019s order, the Commission ordered that the May 3, 2011, and November 28, 2011, Commission orders \u201care hereby RESCINDED and ANNULLED.\u201d It ordered that the matter would be reset for hearing only upon request.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>On May 15, 2013, the Commission held another hearing to address Ms. Brunson\u2019s claim of permanent partial disability as a result of the accidental injury, as well as attorney\u2019s fees. Counsel for UMMSC asserted that it was seeking a $30,554.74 credit against any future benefits awarded, based on the temporary total disability benefits that had been paid pursuant to an award that subsequently was rescinded and annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">With respect to attorney\u2019s fees, counsel for Ms. Brunson argued that he was entitled to the $1,598.40 attorney\u2019s fees awarded in the prior two awards, asserting that the \u201clien of the attorney\u2019s fees still survives,\u201d even though the prior orders were rescinded. He argued that, once attorney\u2019s fees are \u201cdetermined by the Commission, it is a lien. That lien is not exhausted at all, ever, until paid to the attorney. The lien attaches when awarded and it is not abated by appeal.\u201d He also asserted that, because UMMSC had not paid him the attorney\u2019s fees it owed him, the Commission could, in its discretion, award \u201cfees and penalties on the nonpayment of the attorney fees.\u201d Counsel further argued that, if the court found permanent partial disability and awarded attorney\u2019s fees, that would be a lien that would attach \u201cbefore any credit that would be paid or taken by the employer.\u201d Mr. Lanier did not argue that the Commission should award doctor\u2019s fees and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">On May 21, 2013, the Commission issued the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">1. <em>TEMPORARY TOTAL DISABILITY: </em>The employer and insurer are entitled to a credit for overpayment of temporary total disability in the amount of $30,554.74....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">2. <em>PERMANENT PARTIAL DISABILITY: </em>Under \u201cOther Cases\u201d amounting to .15% industrial loss of use of the body, 10% is reasonably attributable to the accidental injury to the back and 5% is due to preexisting conditions to the back; at the rate of $142.00, payable weekly, beginning at the end of compensation previously paid, for a period of 50 weeks, subject to a credit for overpay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>ment of temporary total disability in the amount of $30,554.74 (permanency total is $7,100.00, leaving a credit balance of $23,454.74).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-4\">3. <em>ATTORNEY FEES: </em>The Orders of this Commission dated May 3, 2011 and November 28, 2011 were rescinded and annulled per the Order dated March 5, 2013; therefore, the payment of attorney fees previously awarded totaling $1,598.00 is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The Commission did not award any penalties, and it stated that \u201c[n]o attorney fees or reimbursement of expenses are allowed under this Order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">On June 3, 2013, Ms. Brunson, by counsel, petitioned for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. On December 10, 2013, the court held a hearing. Counsel for Ms. Brunson asked the court to remand the case to the Commission to enforce the payment of the previously awarded $1,598.40 in attorney\u2019s fees and to determine whether attorney\u2019s fees should be awarded on the $7,100 award for permanent partial disability compensation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He also indicated that he had raised a third issue in his petition relating to penalties, but he acknowledged that, \u201cobviously, if there\u2019s no fee to be paid, there\u2019s no penalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Counsel for UMMSC and the Commission argued that the court should affirm the Commission\u2019s decision with respect to the $1,598.40 initial award because the initial orders were rescinded and annulled, and therefore, the attorney\u2019s fees award was \u201ccompletely vacated.\u201d With respect to any fee for the permanency award, counsel argued that the statutory scheme permitted a percentage of the \u201camount due,\u201d and because the credit resulted in no \u201camount due\u201d to the claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>ant, the Commission was legally correct in finding that no fee applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">On December 16, 2013, the court issued an order affirming the Commission\u2019s decision regarding attorney\u2019s fees, finding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\">FOUND that the decisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission ... dated May 3, 2011, and November 28, 2011, were voided by the Remand Order of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County dated December 14, 2012; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">FOUND that on May 21, 2013, the [Commission] correctly decided that the lien created pursuant to [Md. Code (2008 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7 9-731 of the Labor &amp; Employment Article (\u201cLE\u201d)] for attorney\u2019s fees of $1,598.00 was extinguished by the Remand Order of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County dated December 14, 2012; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-7\">FOUND that on May 21, 2013, the [Commission] ordered an award of $7,100 for permanent partial disability to the Petitioner and such award was completely offset by a credit for prior overpayment of an award for temporary total disability; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">FOUND that on May 21, 2013, the [Commission] correctly disapproved attorney\u2019s fees in conjunction with the award for permanent partial disability since such award was completely offset by the aforementioned credit, leaving no fund from which to satisfy any claim for fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">(Footnotes omitted). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">On appeal, counsel for Ms. Brunson continues with his assertion that the Commission erred in failing to order payment of attorney\u2019s fees. In support, he makes three contentions. First, he asserts that the Commission erred in \u201cfailing to enforce the initial attorney\u2019s fees ordered pursuant to the initial orders,\u201d even though these orders subsequently were rescinded and annulled. Second, he contends that the Commission erred in declining to award penalties and fees for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>failure to pay the attorney\u2019s fees upon conclusion of the appeal to the circuit court. Third, he argues that the Commission erred when it failed to award counsel fees, reimbursement for incurred expenses, and reimbursement for a doctor fee pursuant to the award of compensation for permanent partial disability. As explained below, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">In workers\u2019 compensation cases, attorneys \u201cmay not charge or collect a fee for ... legal services in connection with a claim\u201d unless the fee is approved by the Commission. LE \u00a7 9-731(a)(l)(i). <em>See also Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore v. Bowen, </em>54 Md.App. 375, 383, 458 A.2d 1242 (1983) (\u201c[T]he setting of attorneys\u2019 fees [is] within the control of the ... Commission.\u201d). Because \u201cthe Commission is vested with the authority to set counsel fees, \u2018it is not the province of the courts to constrain the legitimate exercise of the [C]ommission\u2019s discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rogers v. Welsh, </em>113 Md.App. 142, 144, 686 A.2d 1107 (1996) (quoting <em>Edmond v. Ten Trex Enters., Inc., </em>83 Md.App. 573, 577-78, 575 A.2d 1267 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Here, however, the issue is not the amount of the fee awarded, but rather, whether any fee was warranted under the circumstances of the case. Thus, we must determine, as a matter of law, whether the Commission properly determined that Ms. Brunson\u2019s attorney was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. In this regard, however, we note that \u201cReviewing courts should give special deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations because the agency is best able to discern its intent in promulgating those regulations.\u201d <em>Kim v. Md. State Bd. of Physicians, </em>196 Md.App. 362, 372, 9 A.3d 534 (2010), <em>aff'd, </em>423 Md. 523, 32 A.3d 30 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">Attorney\u2019s Fees in Worker\u2019s Compensation Cases</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">In <em>Engel &amp; Engel, P.A. v. Ingerman, </em>353 Md. 43, 724 A.2d 645 (1999), the Court of Appeals explained that the worker\u2019s compensation statutory scheme was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>\u201cdesigned to protect workers and their families from hardships inflicted by work-related injuries. More particularly, it is designed to provide workers with compensation for loss of earning capacity resulting from accidental injury, disease or death arising out of and in the course of employment, to provide vocational rehabilitation, and to provide adequate medical services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 51, 724 A.2d 645 (quoting <em>Queen v. Agger, </em>287 Md. 342, 343, 412 A.2d 733 (1980)). In light of that goal, the legislature sought to regulate attorney\u2019s fees, noting that the party seeking compensation \u2014 the claimant \u2014 is responsible for his or her own attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. </em>Because worker\u2019s compensation law is designed to provide financial assistance to the injured worker in lieu of lost wages, \u201cthe legislature recognized that the purpose of the law would be subverted if a worker\u2019s recovery,\u201d which did not include \u201c \u2018any padding to take care of legal and other expenses incurred in obtaining the award,\u2019 \u201d were dissipated as a result of excessive fees incurred in recovering the compensation. <em>Id. at </em>51-52, 724 A.2d 645 (quoting 3 Arthur Larson, Larson\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7 83.11, at 15-1271 (1989)). Consequently, the legislature authorized the Commission to adopt appropriate safeguards, thereby giving the Commission the power to regulate \u201c \u2018when and how much remuneration an attorney who represents a claimant ... is to receive from the employee for legal services rendered to him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 724 A.2d 645 (quoting <em>Chanticleer Skyline Rm. v. Greer, </em>271 Md. 693, 699-700, 319 A.2d 802 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The Court also recognized that, although \u201cclaimants must be protected from exorbitant legal fees, there also exists a need to ensure that workers are able to obtain competent counsel to pursue their claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53, 724 A.2d 645. Therefore, although fees \u201cshould not be so large as to be excessive ... they also should not be so low as to make representing claimants undesirable to the legal practitioner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To balance the need to protect claimants from excessive legal fees against the need of workers to retain competent counsel, the legislature delegated to the Commission, an ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>ministrative agency with special expertise in worker\u2019s compensation law, the authority over attorney\u2019s fees in worker\u2019s compensation cases, including the power to promulgate rules governing such fees. <em>Id. </em>at 53-54, 724 A.2d 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">The issue of attorney\u2019s fees is addressed in LE \u00a7 9-731, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">(a)(1) Unless approved by the Commission, a person may not charge or collect a fee for: (i) legal services in connection with a claim under this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">(2) When the Commission approves a fee, the fee is a lien on the compensation awarded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2) of this subsection, a fee shall be paid from an award of compensation only in the manner set by the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">The Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) 14.09.04.03 sets forth a schedule of fees, establishing maximum amounts for attorney\u2019s fees based on the extent of the disability and the amount of the award. For example, an attorney\u2019s fee for a final award of temporary total disability may not exceed \u201c10 percent of the compensation that has accrued as of the date of the award.\u201d COMAR 14.09.04.03(B)(5). With respect to a final award of compensation for permanent partial disability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_C\">[T]he Commission may approve an attorney\u2019s fee in a total amount not exceeding 20 times the State average weekly wage and computed as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">(i) Up to 20 percent of the amount due for the first 75 weeks of an award of compensation awarded;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-10\">(ii) Up to 15 percent of the amount due for the next 120 weeks of an award of compensation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-11\">(iii) Up to 10 percent of the amount due for an award of compensation in excess of 195 weeks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">COMAR 14.09.04.03(B)(3)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">Relevant to this case, we note that attorney\u2019s fees are available only for a \u201cfinal award.\u201d The regulations define a \u201cfinal award\u201d as the \u201caward of compensation determined by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>the Commission after exhaustion of all applicable appeals, regardless of whether the award is increased or decreased as a result of any appeal.\u201d COMAR 14.09.04.03(B)(l)(b)(i).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We further note that this Court has made clear that the fee schedule in COMAR \u201cdoes not represent an <em>entitlement </em>to a specific amount of attorney\u2019s fees, but merely establishes the <em>maximum </em>fee that will be permitted.\u201d <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n v. May, </em>88 Md.App. 408, 417, 594 A.2d 1232 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Attorney\u2019s Fees Pursuant to a Rescinded and Annulled Award</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Counsel for Ms. Brunson first contends that the Commission committed reversible error by not enforcing his charging lien for the attorney\u2019s fees initially awarded by the Commission. He asserts that the statutory scheme governing attorney\u2019s fees is designed \u201cto protect attorneys\u201d who represent claimants before the Commission. He recognizes that the lien \u201crepresents a portion of the <em>claimant\u2019s award </em>to which the attorney is entitled for his services and skills,\u201d as opposed to being \u201cadditional to the award of compensation.\u201d He asserts, however, that \u201c[o]nce a charging lien is established, release of the fees to the attorney is the only way to extinguish the lien,\u201d regardless of the outcome of a claimant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">UMMSC contends that the \u201cCommission properly exercised its discretion in declining to enforce the payment of previously awarded attorney\u2019s fees under the May 3, 2011 and November 28, 2011 Commission decisions where the decisions had been previously rescinded and annulled.\u201d It asserts that, contrary to Ms. Brunson\u2019s counsel\u2019s contention that the purpose of the attorney\u2019s fees provision of LE \u00a7 9-731 is to protect attorneys, the \u201c \u2018primary objective behind the attorney\u2019s fee provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>sion is to afford workers some degree of protection that their compensation will not be unduly diminished by excessive costs associated with obtaining recovery.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Engel, </em>353 Md. at 53, 724 A.2d 645). Thus, it asserts, the statutory scheme permits an attorney\u2019s fee to be awarded only where the Commission grants indemnity benefits to an injured worker. Here, where the orders granting Ms. Brunson indemnity compensation were rescinded and annulled, UMMSC argues that the attorney\u2019s fee liens created by these orders also were extinguished.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">The Commission agrees with this analysis. It contends that, although the attorney\u2019s fee lien \u201cproperly attached when the Commission orders approving the lien were issued, once those orders were rescinded by the circuit court and there was no compensation to the claimant, the lien was effectively abated [and reduced to zero] by rendering the award a nullity.\u201d Because the initial Commission orders were rescinded and annulled, \u201cthere [was] no compensation award from which to pay attorney\u2019s fees consistent with the Commission\u2019s now-void order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">We begin with Ms. Brunson\u2019s attorney\u2019s argument that the initial orders, awarding $756 and $842.50 in attorney\u2019s fees, constituted a charging lien. We agree with that proposition. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7 9-731 (a)(2) (\u201cWhen the Commission approves a fee, the fee is a lien on the compensation awarded.\u201d); <em>Rhoads v. Sommer, </em>401 Md. 131, 148-49, 931 A.2d 508 (2007) (A common law charging lien bound a judgment recovered through the attorney\u2019s efforts.); <em>Ashman v. Shecter, </em>196 Md. 168, 174, 76 A.2d 139 (1950) (A charging lien is based upon the principle that \u201can attorney, as a recognized officer of the court, should be paid his fees and expenses out of any judgment obtained as the result of his labor and skill.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">We disagree, however, with Ms. Brunson\u2019s counsel\u2019s argument that, \u201c[o]nce a charging lien is established, release of the fees to the attorney is the only way to extinguish the lien.\u201d In making that assertion, counsel cites <em>Staley v. Board of Education, </em>308 Md. 42, 48, 517 A.2d 349 (1986), for the proposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>that the \u201cescrow account and the lien on the funds therein remain in existence until the attorney receives his due compensation.\u201d The question in this case, however, is what constitutes counsel\u2019s \u201cdue compensation,\u201d given that the orders that were the basis for the lien were rescinded and annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">As a general matter, \u201ccharging liens were created for the purpose of securing an attorney\u2019s interest in final <em>judgments and awards.\u201d Consol. Const. Servs., Inc. v. Simpson, </em>372 Md. 434, 462, 813 A.2d 260 (2002). <em>Accord Rochlin v. Cunningham, </em>739 So.2d 1215, 1217 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1999) (a charging lien for an attorney\u2019s services attaches only \u201c \u2018to the tangible fruits of the [attorney\u2019s] services\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Litman v. Fine, Jacobson, Schwartz, Nash, Block &amp; England, PA, </em>517 So.2d 88 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1987), <em>review denied, </em>770 So.2d 160 (Fla.2000); <em>Cole, Schotz, Bernstein, Meisel &amp; Forman, P.A. v. Owens, </em>292 N.J.Super. 453, 679 A.2d 155, 158 (Ct.App.Div.1996)) (\u201cWhere there is no recovery, there is nothing to which the attorney\u2019s lien can attach.\u201d); <em>Chadbourne &amp; Parke, LLP v. AB Recur Finans, </em>18 A.D.3d 222, 794 N.Y.S.2d 349, 350 (2005) (\u201cA charging lien is a security interest in the favorable result of litigation.\u201d); <em>Howell v. Howell, </em>89 N.C.App. 115, 365 S.E.2d 181, 183 (1988) (\u201cA charging lien is not available until there is a final judgment or decree to which the lien can attach.\u201d). Accordingly, if a favorable judgment is reversed, any lien attached to the judgment necessarily would be extinguished.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Although no case has specifically reached this conclusion in a worker\u2019s compensation case in Maryland, language in another case suggests this result. In <em>Feissner v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>282 Md. 413, 418-19, 384 A.2d 742 (1978), the Court of Appeals observed that the statutory lien upon a compensation award \u201cdoes not represent a statutory right in the attorney to remuneration for legal services, but merely places a charge upon the compensation award as security for the legal fee owed by the claimant and approved by the Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">In that case, the claimant\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation award was extinguished due to superior benefits paid from a govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>mental pension fund. <em>Id. </em>at 414, 384 A.2d 742. The Court concluded that the effect of the offset was to prevent an award of compensation altogether. <em>Id. </em>at 421, 384 A.2d 742. Accordingly, the Court held that, \u201cbecause the offset provision operates to satisfy and discharge in full the [workers\u2019] compensation liability of the employer, there comes into existence no fund on which the attorney\u2019s lien ... can attach or from which payment of legal fees can be compelled.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">Although the issue here, at least with respect to temporary total benefits, is different, the reasoning is analogous. Attorney\u2019s fees are permitted only upon an award payable pursuant to the worker\u2019s compensation statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Here, because the initial award of temporary total disability was rescinded and annulled, there was no final award of compensation in that regard. Accordingly, there was no award on which the attorney\u2019s lien could attach.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\"><em>Hoffman v. Liberty Mutual, </em>232 Md. 51, 191 A.2d 575 (1963) and <em>Staley, </em>308 Md. at 49, 517 A.2d 349, upon which counsel for Ms. Brunson relies, are distinguishable. In those cases, the compensation award was reduced on appeal. Although the Court of Appeals stated that the amount of the fee award may be reduced in light of the modified compensation award, <em>Staley, </em>308 Md. at 48 n. 6, 517 A.2d 349, it held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>insurers could not withhold the attorney\u2019s fee retained in escrow to satisfy an overpayment to the claimant. <em>Staley, </em>308 Md. at 49, 517 A.2d 349; <em>Hoffman, </em>232 Md. at 56-57, 191 A.2d 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">These cases are inapposite to this case, where the compensation award was not reduced on appeal, but rather, it was rescinded and annulled. Given the circumstances here, where the award of temporary total disability benefits was rescinded and annulled, the Commission properly declined to enforce the $1,598.40 award for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Penalties</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Ms. Brunson\u2019s attorney next contends that the Commission committed reversible error in failing to assess penalties against UMMSC for its failure to pay the attorney\u2019s fees it owed to him. He notes that LE \u00a7 9-728 permits the Commission to impose penalties against an employer for failing to pay an award of compensation within a set time frame, and he contends, as asserted in the previous argument, that the \u201c$1,598.50 total compensation that was escrowed has never been paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">UMMSC responds that the Commission will award a penalty only where it finds that the employer or its insurer failed to make payment on the award \u201cwithout good cause.\u201d It contends that \u201cthe Commission properly exercised its discretion in declining to award penalties and fees for non-payment of attorney\u2019s fees where there was no legally enforceable, final Commission order for attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">The Commission argues that Ms. Brunson failed to preserve the issue of penalties for appellate review because she did not raise this issue before the Commission. In any event, it argues that, \u201c[i]n the absence of a legally enforceable Commission order to award attorney\u2019s fees, there can be no claim for an award of penalties for failing to pay the fees timely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">Initially, it appears the issue is preserved. Contrary to the Commission\u2019s argument on appeal, counsel for Ms. Brunson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>did argue to the Commission that, because UMMSC had not paid him the attorney\u2019s fees it owed him, the Commission could, in its discretion, award \u201cfees and penalties on the nonpayment of the attorney fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">The argument regarding penalties, however, is without merit. LE \u00a7 9-728 addresses penalties for non-payment of an attorney\u2019s fees award. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-5\">(a) If the Commission finds that an employer or its insurer has failed, without good cause, to begin paying an award within 15 days after the later of the date that the award is issued or the date that payment of the award is due, the Commission shall assess against the employer or its insurer a fine not exceeding 20% of the amount of the payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">(b) If the Commission finds that an employer or its insurer has failed, without good cause, to begin paying an award within 30 days after the later of the date that the award is issued or the date that payment of the award is due, the Commission shall assess against the employer or its insurer a find not exceeding 40% of the amount of the payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">(c) The Commission shall order the employer or insurer to pay a fine assessed under this section to the covered employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Here, Ms. Brunson\u2019s counsel acknowledged in the circuit court that, if no attorney\u2019s fees were payable, \u201cthere\u2019s no penalty.\u201d We agree. Because, the Commission properly determined that the lack of a final compensation award for temporary total disability resulted in no viable attorney\u2019s fees claim, the Commission also properly declined to award penalties for the failure to pay attorney\u2019s fees. There was no error in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">Permanent Partial Disability Award</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">Ms. Brunson\u2019s last contention is that the Commission erred in \u201cfailing to consider an award of counsel fees, reim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>bursement of expenses and a doctor\u2019s fees as part of the compensation awarded for [her] permanent partial disability.\u201d She asserts that, at \u201cthe time of the hearing, claimant and claimant\u2019s counsel properly filed a consent form to pay counsel fees, to reimburse incurred expenses, and to pay the outstanding doctor fee, along with supporting documentation,\u201d but despite the Commission\u2019s finding that she was entitled to additional compensation, it failed to consider her request for those fees. In her view, the credit she received for the $7,100 award of permanent partial disability, based on the overpayment of temporary total disability, should \u201cnot alleviate the requirement to pay [a]ppellant\u2019s counsel or her physician.\u201d Ms. Brunson, by her attorney, asserts that the overpayment based on the initial award \u201cshould not penalize those who provided their skill and expertise to the benefit of the claimant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">UMMSC responds that the Commission properly declined to award attorney\u2019s fees where there was no compensation payable to Ms. Brunson because the May 21 award \u201cwas subject to the credit of the Self-Insuring Employer for overpaid temporary total disability benefits.\u201d It argues that, similar to the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Feissner, </em>282 Md. at 421, 384 A.2d 742, where there was no \u201cin-pocket monetary compensation to be paid to the Claimant,\u201d there was no fund \u201cfrom which the Commission could approve a fee for the Claimant\u2019s attorney.\u201d The Commission similarly argues that it had no legal authority to approve any fee to Ms. Brunson\u2019s attorney where no benefits were paid to Ms. Brunson for permanent partial disability.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>As indicated, when a final award of compensation is made for permanent partial disability, the Commission <em>may </em>approve an attorney\u2019s fee, up to the specified amounts, for the \u201camount due\u201d under an \u201caward of compensation.\u201d COMAR 14.09.04.03. Here, there was no actual amount due to Ms. Brunson, given the offset for the overpayment made pursuant to the initial award of total temporary disability. Accordingly, similar to <em>Feissner, </em>282 Md. at 421, 384 A.2d 742, where there was no actual amount due, given an offset due to another payment, there was no fund to which the attorney\u2019s fee could attach. Accordingly, the Commission properly declined to award attorney\u2019s fees for permanent partial disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
