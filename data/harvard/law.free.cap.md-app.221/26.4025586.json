At the time of the commission of the crime, as well as at the time of sentencing, appellant was not required to register as a sex offender under the Maryland sex offender registration act (\u201cMSORA\u201d). As a result of the 2001 amendment to MSORA, however, appellant was required to register for the rest of his life. The 2010 amendment to MSORA placed additional registration requirements on homeless registrants, which appellant failed to comply with when he became homeless in 2011. Appellant was charged in the Circuit Court for Frederick County with failing to register as a homeless sex offender. At a hearing on January 17, 2012, appellant admitted to failing to register as required by the 2010 amendment to MSORA, but argued to the court that he could not be convicted because he could not be required constitutionally to register in the first place. The circuit court rejected appellant\u2019s argument, convicted him of failing to register, and sentenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>him to five years\u2019 incarceration, with all but eighteen months suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">On appeal, appellant presents two questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\">1. Was the evidence insufficient to sustain the conviction for failing to register and must [a'Jppellant no longer have to register?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">2. Must [ajppellant\u2019s conviction for failing to register be vacated because the plea agreement for the predicate conviction did not contemplate a registration requirement?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">We answer both questions in the negative and, accordingly, shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AMg\">\n<em>Predicate Offense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">In August 1996, appellant, who was then twenty-six years old, had sexual intercourse with a fifteen-year-old coworker. Approximately one year later, the victim\u2019s parents complained, and on September 29, 1998, appellant pled guilty to committing a third degree sexual offense in violation of Article 27, \u00a7 464B.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On January 4, 1999, the circuit court sentenced appellant to eighteen months\u2019 incarceration, all of which was suspended in favor of two years\u2019 supervised probation, starting on the day of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">In November of 1999, the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (the \u201cDepartment\u201d) charged appellant with violating his probation by failing to (1) pay his monthly supervising fee, and (2) inform his supervising agent of his current address and place of employment. Appellant stipulated to a violation of probation, and on March 31, 2000, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>circuit court sentenced appellant to eighteen months incarceration, suspending all but six days to be served on three consecutive weekends. The court also increased the period of probation from two years to three years, commencing on January 4,1999 and terminating on January 4, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\n<em>Sex Offender Registration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">At the time that appellant committed the third degree sexual offense in 1996, the version of MSORA in effect was the original one enacted in 1995. Md. Code (1957,1992 Repl. Vol., 1995 Cum. Supp.), Article 27, \u00a7 692B. Under Article 27, \u00a7 692B, only child sex offenders, as defined by the statute, were required to register. Under that definition, appellant was not a child sex offender. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 692B(a). At the time of appellant\u2019s conviction and sentencing, MSORA had been recodified as Article 27, \u00a7 792 and expanded by a 1997 amendment to require registration for \u201coffenders,\u201d \u201csexually violent offenders,\u201d and \u201csexually violent predators.\u201d Md. Code (1957, 1996 Repl. Vol., 1997 Cum. Supp.), Article 27, \u00a7 792(a)(7); <em>see also Graves v. State, </em>364 Md. 329, 336-39, 772 A.2d 1225 (2001) (discussing the early history of MSORA). A \u201csexually violent offender\u201d included a person who, like appellant, had been convicted of an offense under Article 27, \u00a7 464B and required registration for a period of ten years. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 792(a)(9)-(10), (h). The 1997 amendment to MSORA, however, applied only to offenses committed on or after July 1, 1997, and thus did not apply to appellant\u2019s 1996 offense. Editor\u2019s note, Article 27, \u00a7 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">In 1999, the General Assembly made significant revisions to MSORA. <em>Ochoa v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Servs., </em>430 Md. 315, 319-20, 61 A.3d 1 (2013). Relevant to the instant case, the 1999 amendment subjected a sexually violent offender who had committed an offense under Article 27, \u00a7 464B to lifetime registration. Md. Code (1957, 1996 Repl. Vol., 2000 Cum. Supp.), Article 27, \u00a7 792(d)(5)(ii). The retroactive application of the 1999 amendment, however, was limited to sexually violent offenders who had committed offenses after July 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>1997, again removing appellant\u2019s 1996 offense from the purview of MSORA.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">In 2001, the General Assembly made further changes to MSORA, this time adding a significant retroactivity provision (the \u201c2001 Retroactivity Provision\u201d). <em>See </em>Md. Code (2001), \u00a7 11-702.1 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCP 2001\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In relevant part, the 2001 Amendment required the retroactive registration of offenders \u201cconvicted of an offense committed before July 1, 1997,\u201d who were \u201cunder the custody or supervision of a supervising authority on October 1, 2001.\u201d CP 2001 \u00a7 ll-702.1(a). The 2001 Amendment defined supervising authority as including the Director of Parole and Probation. CP 2001 \u00a7 11 \u2014 701(i)(ll).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Appellant was on probation on October 1, 2001, and thus met the requirement for retroactive registration under the 2001 Retroactivity Provision. CP 2001 \u00a7 ll-702.1(a). As a sexually violent offender, who had violated Article 27, \u00a7 464B, appellant was required to register for the remainder of his life. CP 2001 \u00a7 ll-707(a)(4)(ii)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Although required to register in 2001 as a sexually violent offender, appellant was not notified by law enforcement of his registration obligation until March 13, 2007.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the hearing on the conviction challenged <em>sub judice, </em>appellant testified that he learned he had to register when \u201cin 2007 they came to my job, and [ ] I lost my job the next day.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>In 2010, the General Assembly again made major changes to MSORA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The 2010'amendment reclassified sex offenders into tiers: (1) Tier I offenders must register in person every six months for fifteen years, with the possibility of a reduction in the term to ten years; (2) Tier II offenders must register in person every six months for twenty-five years; and (3) Tier III offenders must register every three months for life. CP 2010 \u00a7 11-707. The 2010 amendment contained a retroactive provision that applied the amendment to any person who qualified as a Tier I, II, or III offender and who was subject to registration on September 30, 2010 (the \u201c2010 Retroactivity Provision\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> CP 2010 \u00a7 11-702.1. Because appellant was subject to registration on September 30, 2010 (as a result of the 2001 Retroactivity Provision) and his third degree sexual offense with a fifteen-year-old qualified him as a Tier II offender, appellant was required by the 2010 amendment to register for twenty-five years. Therefore, the retroactive application of the 2010 amendment to MSORA actually <em>reduced </em>appellant\u2019s registration period from lifetime to twenty-five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>\n<em>Failure to Register</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">After becoming a registrant by application of the 2001 Retroactivity Provision, appellant, like all sex offenders, faced penalties for failing to register. <em>See </em>CP 2001 \u00a7 11-721. Under the version of MSORA relevant to the matter <em>sub judice, </em>registration generally requires sex offenders to (1) <em>notify </em>law enforcement of their registrant status, and also of changes of circumstance like a new residence or job, and (2) to <em>disclose </em>various information to law enforcement at the time of registration, such as the offender\u2019s name, address and the nature of his predicate offense. <em>See </em>CP 2010 \u00a7\u00a7 11-705, -706. Registrants who fail to abide by the notification requirements of CP 2010 \u00a7 11-705, or the disclosure requirements CP 2010 \u00a7 11-706, are guilty of the criminal offense of failing to register pursuant to CP 2010 \u00a7 ll-721(a).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Prior to the 2010 amendment to MSORA, a registrant was required to send written notice to the state registry of a change in residence within five days after the change occurred. CP 2009 \u00a7 11 \u2014 705(d). The Court of Appeals, however, held that an earlier version of Section 11 \u2014 705(d) did not apply to homeless registrants. <em>Twine v. State, </em>395 Md. 539, 550, 910 A.2d 1132 (2006). Subsequently, the General Assembly enacted, as a part of the 2010 amendment to MSORA, additional registration requirements for a \u201chomeless registrant.\u201d CP 2010 \u00a7 11 \u2014 705(d). Section ll-705(d) then read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab\">(d) Homeless registrants</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">(1) A homeless registrant also shall register in person with the local law enforcement unit in each county where the registrant habitually lives:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">(i) -within 3 days after the earlier of the date of release or after registering with the supervising authority; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-9\">(ii) within 3 days after entering and remaining in a county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>(2) After initially registering with a local law enforcement unit under this subsection, a homeless registrant shall register once a week in person during the time the homeless registrant habitually lives in the county.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">On August 21, 2011, appellant moved out of his residence after an argument with his wife and began living out of his vehicle. On September 11, 2011, a law enforcement officer went to appellant\u2019s former residence in Frederick County and learned from appellant\u2019s son that appellant had not been living there for some time. The next day the officer contacted appellant by phone, and appellant admitted that he had been homeless since August 21, 2011. Appellant also admitted that, although he understood the nature of his registration requirements, he failed to notify local law enforcement of \u201cany changes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">On October 7, 2011 a grand jury in Frederick County indicted appellant for his \u201cknowing\u201d failure \u201cto register one time per week in person with the Frederick County Sheriffs Office as required of a homeless registrant.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In response to the indictment, at a hearing on January 17, 2012, on the failure to register charge, appellant waived his right to jury trial and pled not guilty on an agreed statement of facts. Appellant agreed that the State could prove that appellant knowingly failed to register each week in person while he was homeless from August 21, 2011 to September 11, 2011. Appellant argued, however, that the registration requirement was \u201cillegal\u201d under the federal and state constitutional prohibitions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>on <em>ex post facto </em>laws because he was not required to register at the time of his plea or sentencing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The circuit court found appellant guilty and sentenced him to five years\u2019 incarceration, with all but eighteen months suspended, and three years\u2019 supervised probation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On January 24, 2012, appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">When this Court reviews a conviction for the sufficiency of the evidence, our duty \u201cis to determine whether, after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, a rational trier of fact could have found each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Twine, </em>395 Md. at 554, 910 A.2d 1132. If, however, determining the sufficiency of the evidence \u201c \u2018involves an interpretation and application of Maryland statutory and case law, [this Court] must determine whether the lower court\u2019s conclusions are legally correct under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barnes v. State, </em>195 Md.App. 1, 6, 5 A.3d 1103 (2010) (quoting <em>Gray v. State, </em>388 Md. 366, 375, 879 A.2d 1064 (2005)), <em>vacated, </em>423 Md. 75, 31 A.3d 203 (2011). Whether the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws contained in Article 17 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights precludes the State from requiring appellant to register as a sex offender presents a preliminary question of law that we review <em>de novo. See Davis v. Slater, </em>383 Md. 599, 604, 861 A.2d 78 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">\n<em>I. Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Appellant argues that under <em>Doe v. Department of Public Safety &amp; Correctional Services (\u201cDoe I\u201d), </em>430 Md. 535, 62 A.3d 123 (2013), the State cannot legally require him to register as a sex offender, because MSORA was retroactively applied to him in violation of the <em>ex post facto </em>provisions of Article 17 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Appellant contends that, because the State cannot establish that he had a legal duty to register, there is insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction for failure to register under CP 2010 \u00a7\u00a7 11-705 and ll-721(a). Appellant asks this Court to both vacate his conviction for failure to register, and remand the instant case to the circuit court with the instruction to order (1) the removal of appellant\u2019s name and likeness from the registry, and (2) his exemption from future registration. The State responds that <em>Doe I </em>is \u201cfactually and legally inapposite and, thus, does not equate to relief for [appellant].\u201d Because the parties rely heavily on <em>Doe I, </em>we turn to the facts and holding of that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">\n<em>Doe I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">In June 2014, the Court of Appeals issued a second opinion in the <em>Doe </em>matter, in which it concisely summarized the facts of <em>Doe I </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-8\">In 2006, Doe pled guilty to and was convicted in the Circuit Court for Washington County of a single count of child sexual abuse arising out of an incident involving inappropriate contact with a thirteen-year-old student that occurred during the 1983-84 school year when Doe was a junior high school teacher. Doe was sentenced to ten years incarceration, with all but four and one half years suspended, and three years supervised probation upon his release. Although Doe\u2019s plea agreement did not address registration as a sex offender as one of the conditions of probation, Doe was ordered at sentencing to \u201cregister as a child sex offender.\u201d He was also ordered to pay a $500 fine. Following his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>sentencing, Doe filed a Motion to Correct an Illegal Sentence challenging both the fine and the requirement that he register as a child sex offender. The Circuit Court agreed with Doe and issued an order striking the fine and the registration requirement. Doe was released from prison in December 2008. On October 1, 2009, Doe\u2019s probation officer directed him to register as a child sex offender. Doe maintained that he did not agree with the requirement, but, against the advice of counsel, he registered as a child sex offender in early October 2009.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-5\"><em>Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Servs. v. Doe, </em>439 Md. 201, 208, 94 A.3d 791 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The Department ordered Doe to register as a sex offender in October 2009, because the 2009 amendment to MSORA required the registration of all sex offenders who had committed offenses before October 1, 1995, but who were convicted after that date (\u201c2009 Retroactivity Provision\u201d). <em>Doe I, </em>430 Md. at 540, 62 A.3d 123; <em>see </em>CP 2009 \u00a7 ll-702.1(c)(ii). In October 2009, after Doe complied with the registration order, he filed a civil complaint for declaratory judgment, which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayb\">advanced three arguments, including that to require him to register, when he was not informed of that requirement when he pled guilty, would improperly render his guilty plea involuntary. None of the arguments advanced in the Complaint, however, explicitly addressed the constitutionality of the registration requirement.... During the Circuit Court proceedings, the parties addressed the issues presented in [DoeJ\u2019s Complaint. In addition, counsel for the State argued to the court that requiring [Doe] to register did not violate the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws. At the end of the hearing, the trial judge denied [Doe]\u2019s request for declaratory relief and ordered that [Doe] \u201cshall not be removed from the sex offender registry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">[Doe] noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. In [Doe]\u2019s appeal, he once again contended that requiring him to register as a sex offender violated the terms of the plea agreement. In addition, [Doe] explicitly advanced challenges to the application of the statute on <em>ex post facto, </em>bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>of attainder, equal protection, and due process grounds.... In an unreported opinion, the intermediate appellate court rejected all of [Doej\u2019s arguments and affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment requiring [Doe] to remain on the Maryland Sex Offender Registry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-5\"><em>Doe I, </em>430 Md. at 541-42, 62 A.3d 123 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The Court of Appeals granted <em>certiorari, </em>and in a plurality opinion, held that \u201crequiring [Doe] to register as <em>a result of the 2009 and 2010 amendments </em>violates the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws contained in Article 17 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537, 62 A.3d 123 (emphasis added). The Court concluded that, \u201c[p]ursuant to our determination that [Doe] may not be compelled to register, his name and likeness shall be removed from the Maryland Sex Offender Registry.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\"><em>Application of </em>Doe I</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\"><em>The State\u2019s Argument Under </em>Sinclair v. State<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AR\">The State contends that <em>Doe I </em>does not apply in part, because \u201c[t]he procedural posture of the appeal in <em>Doe [I </em>] is legally inapposite to the posture of the present appeal.\u201d Specifically, the State asserts that Doe sought relief via a civil complaint for declaratory judgment, whereas appellant seeks a declaration exempting him from the sex offender registry in the context of his criminal case. <em>See Doe I, </em>430 Md. at 541, 62 A.3d 123. The State argues that this Court cannot grant declaratory relief in a criminal case, and in the absence of declaration removing appellant from the registry, he remains a registrant who must comply with MSORA until he is relieved of those obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">The State bases its argument on our decision in <em>Sinclair v. State, </em>199 Md.App. 130, 20 A.3d 192 (2011). In that case, Sinclair was ordered to register as a sex offender for the first time under the 2009 Retroactivity Provision. <em>Id. </em>at 133-34, 20 A.3d 192. In response, Sinclair filed a motion in his criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>case \u201cseeking a judicial determination that he was not required to register as a child sex offender.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 132, 20 A.3d 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The circuit court denied the motion, and we vacated that judgment without reaching the merits of Sinclair\u2019s claim. <em>Id. </em>at 134, 140, 20 A.3d 192. We observed that \u201c[t]he issue that Sinclair seeks to raise, and the relief that he seeks, presents a civil matter that is <em>not cognizable in his criminal </em>cause.... His statutory construction point is directed to a <em>collateral consequence of the </em>conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 135, 20 A.3d 192 (emphasis added). Accordingly, because registration was a collateral consequence of Sinclair\u2019s conviction, in order to challenge that requirement, Sinclair was required to file a declaratory judgment action separate and distinct from his criminal conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 135-37, 20 A.3d 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Appellant, like Sinclair, seeks a declaration removing him from the sex offender registry in the context of his criminal case. Under <em>Sinclair, </em>this Court cannot order the circuit court to \u201cissue a declaratory judgment in a criminal cause\u201d regarding appellant\u2019s status as sex offender, regardless of the decision in <em>Doe I. Id. </em>at 140, 20 A.3d 192. Although the Court in <em>Doe I </em>held that the 2009/2010 amendments had crossed the line from \u201ccivil regulation to <em>an element </em>of the punishment of offenders\u201d in the <em>ex post facto </em>context, that ruling did not transform the sex offender registration scheme into a sanction in the context of a criminal case. <em>See Doe I, </em>430 Md. at 578, 62 A.3d 123 (McDonald, J., concurring) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Accordingly, registration remains a collateral consequence of criminal punishment, and thus appellant can seek removal from the sex offender registry only through a civil action for declaratory judgment. <em>See Sinclair, </em>199 Md.App. at 137, 20 A.3d 192 (holding that a complaint seeking declaratory judgment remains \u201cthe procedure for obtaining, under appropriate circumstances, a ruling on the constitutionality of a statute, the violation of which carries criminal sanctions\u201d). Therefore, regardless of the merits of appellant\u2019s contentions, this Court has no authority in the instant case to instruct the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>court to order the Department to remove appellant from the sex offender registry.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Unlike Sinclair, however, appellant also asks this Court to vacate his conviction for failure to register. <em>See id. </em>at 135, 20 A.3d 192. Appellant clearly can challenge his criminal conviction on direct appeal, and thus <em>Sinclair </em>does not apply to a review of appellant\u2019s criminal conviction under <em>Doe I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The question of whether the State can constitutionally require appellant to register is central to the review of his conviction, because the existence of a legal duty to register is a necessary element of failing to register under CP 2010 \u00a7 11-721. Section 11-721 expressly states that sex offenders must provide accurate information and notice \u201cas required\u201d by \u201cthis subtitle\u201d and various sections therein. CP 2010 \u00a7 ll-721(a). Clearly then, if appellant is not \u201crequired\u201d to register under MSORA, he cannot be convicted of failing to register under CP 2010 \u00a7 11-721. Notably, when the Fourth Circuit reviewed the federal Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (\u201cSORNA\u201d), it also concluded that a registration requirement was an element of the failure-to-register offense. <em>See United States v. Gould, </em>568 F.3d 459, 470 (4th Cir.2009) (\u201cAs noted above, the elements of a SORNA failure to register offense ... are that the defendant (1) was required to register....\u201d), cer<em>t. denied, </em>559 U.S. 974, 130 S.Ct. 1686, 176 L.Ed.2d 186 (2010); <em>see also State v. Abshire, </em>363 N.C. 322, 677 S.E.2d 444, 449 (2009) (holding that one essential element of the crime of \u201cfailing to notify the appropriate sheriff of a sex offender\u2019s change of address\u201d is that \u201cthe defendant is a \u2018person required ... to register\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">We acknowledge that the basis for removing appellant from the registry and vacating his conviction under CP 2010 \u00a7 11-721 is the same, that is, a determination that appellant has no legal duty to register. The overlap exists as a result of the legislative decision to enforce the civil sexual offender registration scheme through criminal sanctions. The partnership of the civil and criminal systems, however, does not compromise independence and integrity of either one. Thus we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>cannot order a declaration removing appellant from the registry without a civil complaint under <em>Sinclair, </em>but must consider whether the State unconstitutionally prosecuted appellant for failure to register. <em>Accord Sanchez v. State, </em>215 Md.App. 42, 49-50, 79 A.3d 405 (2013). Accordingly, we turn now to the question of whether the State can legally require appellant to register under <em>Doe I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\"><em>Appellant\u2019s </em>Ex Post Facto <em>Claim Under </em>Doe I</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">As stated above, appellant contends that the Department cannot order him to register under <em>Doe I, </em>because the application of MSORA violates Article 17\u2019s prohibition on <em>ex post facto </em>laws. More specifically, appellant claims that the 2009/2010 amendments at issue in <em>Doe I </em>\u201capply equally\u201d to both Doe and him. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The 2009/2010 amendments did not apply retroactively to appellant as they did to Doe. The Department ordered Doe to register pursuant to the 2009 Retroactivity Provision. <em>Doe I, </em>430 Md. at 540-41, 62 A.3d 123. Because Doe was required thereby to register, the 2010 Retroactivity Provision then subjected Doe to the 2010 amendment to MSORA, which reclassified him as a Tier III sex offender and required him to register for life. <em>See </em>CP 2010 \u00a7 ll-702.1(a) (stating that \u201cthis subtitle shall be applied retroactively to include a person who ... was subject to registration under this subtitle on September 30, 2010\u201d). On the other hand, appellant was required to register under the 2001 Retroactivity Provision. Thus, unlike Doe, appellant was not placed on the sex offender registry by the 2009 amendment to MSORA. In <em>Doe I, </em>the Court of Appeals did not decide whether the retroactive application of MSORA as a result of the 2001 amendment violated Article 17\u2019s prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>advances no argument in the instant appeal regarding the constitutionality of the 2001 amendment as applied to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">As a sex offender registrant, however, appellant is subject to the 2010 Retroactivity Provision, <em>see </em>CP 2010 \u00a7 ll-702.1(a), and thus is required to comply with MSORA as amended in 2010. Unlike <em>Doe, </em>the 2010 amendment <em>reduces </em>appellant\u2019s registration period from lifetime to twenty-five years. Thus, with regard to the registration period, the retroactive application of MSORA by the 2010 amendment actually benefits appellant, rather than \u201cimposing an additional sanction for [appellant's crime.\u201d <em>Doe I, </em>430 Md. at 568, 62 A.3d 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">On the other hand, the retroactive application of MSORA by the 2010 amendment did impose on appellant many additional restrictions and conditions of registration. In his concurring opinion in <em>Doe I, </em>Judge Harrell set forth several of such additional requirements and conditions. He wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\">Since 2009, several amendments to the Maryland Sex Offender Registration Act have been adopted, including, but not limited to: (1) adding juvenile sex offenders to the list of those who must register; (2) requiring registration statements to include a list of aliases, electronic email addresses, computer screen names, or any name by which the registrant had been legally known; (3) requiring tier III offenders (such as Doe) to register in person every three months for life; (4) requiring that registrants provide three days notice after changing addresses; (5) ordering registrants to notify law enforcement, prior to the relocation, when the registrant obtains a temporary residence or changes the location where the registrant resides or \u201chabitually lives\u201d for more than 5 days; (6) requiring homeless registrants to register in person with the local law enforcement in each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>county where the registrant habitually lives; (7) publicize registration information on the Internet; and (8) granting the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services and law enforcement the discretion to provide notice of a registration statement or a registrant\u2019s change of address to whomever they deem necessary so as to protect the public from the registrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 569-70, 62 A.3d 123 (citing CP 2010 \u00a7\u00a7 11-701, -705, - 706, -717, -718).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Not listed above is the additional requirement that a homeless registrant register once a week. <em>Compare </em>CP 2010 \u00a7 11-705(d), <em>with </em>CP 2009 \u00a7 11-705. As stated earlier in this opinion, the requirement of in-person registration once a week was the sole basis of appellant\u2019s conviction for failing to register under CP 2010 \u00a7 11-721.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">In <em>Doe I, </em>the Court of Appeals did not decide the issue of whether the retroactive application of the requirements and conditions of registration added by the 2010 amendment to MSORA violate the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws when applied to persons, like appellant, <em>who were legally already on the registry. </em>We need not address that issue here, because, given the procedural posture of the instant case, only one additional requirement of the 2010 amendment was retroactively applied to appellant, namely, the obligation of registering in person once a week as a homeless registrant. All of the other additional requirements and conditions of registration apply to appellant, but none of them were the basis for the conviction that appellant seeks to overturn.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Clearly, the General Assembly had a legitimate regulatory purpose in enacting additional registration requirements for homeless registrants. <em>See </em>CP 2010 \u00a7 ll-705(d). By definition, a homeless individual does not have a place of residence, and usually does not have a place where he or she usually lives. Without frequent in-person registration, law enforcement would be unable to properly monitor these registrants. Therefore, we conclude that the additional registration requirement retroactively imposed on appellant as a homeless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>registrant by the 2010 amendment to MSORA does not constitute an \u201cadditional sanction\u201d for his crime in violation of the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws under Article 17 of the Declaration of Rights. Accordingly, the requirement that appellant register as a homeless registrant under CP 2010 \u00a7 11 \u2014 705(d) does not violate the Maryland constitutional prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws, and thus his conviction for failure to comply with that section will stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">II. <em>Enforcement of the Plea Agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Appellant also contends that this Court \u201cmust enforce the plea agreement,\u201d and that, because the \u201cplea agreement did not contemplate a registration requirement, he never had a legal duty to register.\u201d Therefore, according to appellant, his conviction for failing to register must be vacated. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Appellant did not request the enforcement of his plea agreement in circuit court below, and thus the issue has not been preserved for appellate review. Rule 8-131(a) (\u201cOrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\u201d). Accordingly, we decline to reach the merits of this argument, or consider whether appellant can request the enforcement of his plea agreement in this procedural context, <em>i.e., </em>where the plea agreement in question is associated with a predicate offense and not the criminal conviction that is the subject of the direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FREDERICK COUNTY AFFIRMED.
