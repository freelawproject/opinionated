CANNON, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Appellant, Nicole Hofeldt, appeals from the July 25, 2018 judgment entry of the Portage County Court of Common\n   Pleas, Juvenile Division, terminating her parental rights to her child, N.M.P. (D.O.B. 4/11/2007), and granting permanent custody to the Portage County Department of Job and Family Services (\"PCDJFS\"). The trial court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On May 24, 2017, N.M.P. was removed from appellant, who was unable to provide him with a stable environment. In case No. 2017 JCC 489, N.M.P. was adjudicated dependent and placed in the temporary custody of PCDJFS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On June 5, 2018, PCDJFS filed a motion for permanent custody of N.M.P., which was assigned case No. 2018 JCF 00506. The motion stated that \"[p]ursuant to R.C. 2151.414(B)(b) and 2151.414(B)(1)(d) N.M.P. has been in the custody of PCDJFS for twelve or more months of a consecutive twenty-two month period.\" The motion alleged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   The child, N.M.P. was removed from his mother on May 24, 2017 and placed in the interim pre-dispositional custody of PCDJFS by Court Order on May 25, 2017. Adjudication was held on June 14, 2017. N.M.P. has been in the custody of PCDJFS pursuant to a Dispositional Order since August 30, 2017. N.M.P. has remained in the temporary custody of PCDJFS from August 30, 2017 to present. * * * Prior to the current action, N.M.P. was in the temporary custody of PCDJFS from March 11, 2015 until March 10, 2017 under case No. 2015 JCC 183. On March 11, 2017 N.M.P. was returned to the legal custody of his mother, [appellant]. N.M.P. was then re-removed from the custody of his mother on May 24, 2017 and this current action began.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The motion further stated: \"Additionally, [p]ursuant to R.C. 2151.011(C) N.M.P. has been abandoned by his parents. Neither of N.M.P.'s parents have visited or had any contact whatsoever with N.M.P. since July 20, 2017.\" The motion also alleged facts indicating it was in N.M.P.'s best interest to be placed in the permanent custody of the agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} A guardian ad litem was appointed for N.M.P., and appellant was appointed counsel. A hearing was held on July 16, 2018, at which Kelly Davis, the PCDJFS caseworker, and Attorney Richard Lombardi, the guardian ad litem, testified. Neither appellant nor N.M.P.'s father appeared; however, appellant's attorney was present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} As a preliminary matter, certified copies of the record from 2017 JCC 489 were entered into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Ms. Davis testified that appellant and N.M.P.'s father failed to meet the objectives of their case plans, had minimal contact with N.M.P., and were unable to provide legally secure housing for N.M.P. Ms. Davis testified that appellant was on probation and struggled with drug use and mental health issues. Ms. Davis had been unable to locate or successfully contact appellant and last had contact with her on October 2, 2017. Both appellant and N.M.P.'s father were permitted visits with N.M.P. twice a month for two hours. Ms. Davis testified that appellant attended one out of 28 visits, and N.M.P.'s father did not attend any visits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Ms. Davis testified that N.M.P. was placed with a foster family with whom he has developed a bond. N.M.P. also has a biological half-sister with whom he has a bond, and N.M.P.'s foster parents are supportive of N.M.P. maintaining a relationship with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Ms. Davis investigated N.M.P.'s relatives as potential legal custodians, but the relatives expressed no interest in taking legal custody of N.M.P.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The trial court allowed Ms. Davis to provide testimony regarding N.M.P.'s wishes and his best interest over the objections of appellant's counsel. Ms. Davis stated that she discussed N.M.P.'s wishes with both N.M.P. and the guardian ad litem and indicated she believed granting permanent custody to the agency would be in N.M.P.'s best interest. Ms. Davis stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   N.M.P. states he wants normal parents. [H]e feels that he was cheated by having Nicole and John as his parents, and he wants the family that he sees with [his foster parents] and their two children. [T]hey give him security. He feels safe. He doesn't feel threatened. He knows tomorrow when he wakes up it's going to be the same old routine as two weeks ago when he woke up.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Ms. Davis testified that N.M.P. has been in the temporary custody of the agency for 12 of the preceding 22 months, inclusive of cases prior to 2017 JCC 489. Appellant's counsel objected to Ms. Davis' testimony about the previous cases because those records were not in evidence. Counsel for PCDJFS requested the trial court take judicial notice of 2015 JCC 183. Although appellant's counsel objected to the court's taking judicial notice, the trial judge indicated he would review 2015 JCC 183.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Attorney Lombardi testified\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   that N.M.P.'s foster family loves and is bonded with him. He further testified that N.M.P. has \"no desire, none, to be with [appellant]\" and explained he spoke with \"the child on more than one occasion, and [N.M.P.] made it very clear that he does - - absolutely does not want to have contact with [appellant] or her family.\" Attorney Lombardi further stated: \"[T]his child wants more than anything on earth to stay and live with [his foster family]. I believe it's in the child's best interest, and I've never felt stronger about a case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} After the hearing, on July 20, 2018, PCDJFS filed certified copies of journal entries from 2015 JCC 183 in the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The trial court entered judgment on July 25, 2018. The trial court determined that \"[p]ursuant to R.C. 2151.414(B) N.M.P. has been abandoned by his parents\"; \"[p]ursuant to R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a) * * * N.M.P., cannot nor should not [sic] be placed with his parents within a reasonable amount of time\"; and \"[p]ursuant to R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(d) * * * N.M.P., has been in the Temporary Custody of [PCDJFS] for at least twelve (12) months of a consecutive twenty-two (22) month period, inclusive of Case No. 2015 JCC 183.\" Further, the trial court made findings regarding N.M.P.'s best interest. The trial court ordered appellant's parental rights permanently terminated and that N.M.P. be placed in the permanent custody of PCDJFS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Appellant noticed a timely appeal. She asserts six assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Appellant's first assignment of error states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 16} \"The trial court committed reversible error when it allowed a children\n   services protective caseworker to testify as to the child's best interest and present inadmissible hearsay regarding the child's wishes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Appellant first argues the trial court erred when it allowed the caseworker to \"testify as to her opinion as to what is in the best interest of the child.\" In support, appellant directs us to consider\n   <em>\n    In re Ridenour\n   </em>\n   , 11th Dist.

Those cases provide that under R.C. 2151.414(D)(1)(b), a child's wishes must be expressed either directly by the child or through the guardian ad litem, and a caseworker's testimony cannot be considered as an expression of the child's wishes in lieu of a guardian ad litem's report.\n   <em>\n    Ridenour\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6 47 ;\n   <em>\n    A.K\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6 27 ;\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at *6. Appellant, however, has failed to direct us to any authority that stands for the proposition that a caseworker is precluded from testifying as to his or her opinion regarding the best interest of a child. Appellant's argument is not well taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Appellant next argues the caseworker's testimony regarding N.M.P.'s wishes was hearsay and should have been excluded at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 19} \" 'Hearsay' is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\" Evid.R. 801(C). The trial court does not have discretion to admit hearsay \"except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of the United States, by the Constitution of the State of Ohio, by statute enacted by the General Assembly not in conflict with a rule of the Supreme Court of Ohio, by these rules, or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court of Ohio.\" Evid.R. 802.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, R.C. 2151.414(D)(1)(b) authorizes the guardian ad litem in a permanent custody hearing to give hearsay testimony regarding a child's wishes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sypherd v.

The error, however, was harmless. The trial court determined that N.M.P. was capable of verbalizing\n   his own wishes. Further, the guardian ad litem was present at the hearing and testified regarding N.M.P.'s wishes. The guardian ad litem gave compelling testimony that N.M.P. wished to stay with his foster family and did not want to return to his parents and supported that testimony with the reasons underlying N.M.P.'s wishes. There is no testimony disputing that of the guardian ad litem. Further, the trial court did not state that it relied exclusively on the caseworker's testimony, and its judgment entry indicates it considered the guardian ad litem's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Appellant contends the guardian ad litem's \"testimony does not constitute evidence upon which the trial court may make any factual findings.\" Appellant essentially argues that the guardian ad litem's testimony about N.M.P.'s wishes must be excluded as hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Evid.R. 802 provides that \"[h]earsay is not admissible except as otherwise provided by * * * statute enacted by the General Assembly not in conflict with a rule of the Supreme Court of Ohio[.]\" As stated above, R.C. 2151.414(D)(1)(b) authorizes the guardian ad litem to give hearsay testimony regarding the child's wishes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sypherd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6 13. To the extent appellant argues the guardian ad litem's testimony was hearsay because N.M.P. was capable of expressing his own wishes, the Ohio Supreme Court has held that R.C. 2151.414(D)(1)(b) \"unambiguously gives the trial court the choice of considering the child's wishes directly from the child\n   <em>\n    or through the guardian ad litem\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    In re C.F.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5805729\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/113/73/\">\n    113 Ohio St.3d 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007-Ohio-1104\">\n    2007-Ohio-1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=862%20N.E.2d%20816\">\n    862 N.E.2d 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 55 (emphasis added).

In 2015 JCC 183, N.M.P. was placed in the interim predispositional custody of PCDJFS on March 12, 2015. The journal entry from the adjudicatory hearing was filed on April 24, 2015. Temporary custody was granted to PCDJFS on May 28, 2015. N.M.P. remained in the temporary custody of PCDJFS until March 14, 2017, when he was ordered returned to appellant. In 2017 JCC 489, on May 24, 2017, N.M.P. was again placed in the interim predispositional custody of the agency. He was adjudicated dependent on June 22, 2017, and temporary custody was granted to the agency on August 30, 2017. Inclusive of 2015 JCC 183, N.M.P. was in temporary agency custody for 12 or more months out of the 22 consecutive months preceding the filing of the motion for permanent custody.

However, \"[t]he statute requires only that the child must have been in the custody of a public agency for twelve or more months of a consecutive twenty-two month period. This might include a situation where a child had been in temporary custody for six months on one occasion, was briefly out of agency custody, and then returned to temporary custody for another six months-all within a consecutive twenty-two month period.\"\n   <em>\n    In re T.B.\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist.

However, it is clear the trial court was making a finding under R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(b), which provides that an agency may establish the second prong of the permanent custody test if \"[t]he child is abandoned.\" This finding was supported by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 64} Appellant next argues that granting permanent custody pursuant to R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(b) violated her due process rights because that ground was not asserted in PCDJFS's motion for permanent custody. However, the motion for permanent custody clearly states that \"[p]ursuant to R.C. 2151.011(C) N.M.P. has been abandoned by his parents.\" Although the motion does not specifically cite to R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(b), appellant had sufficient notice that abandonment was one of the grounds being pursued by PCDJFS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 65} Appellant further argues that the trial court's finding under R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a) that N.M.P. \"cannot nor should not [sic] be placed with his parents within a reasonable amount of time\" violated her due process rights because PCDJFS did not assert this ground in its motion for permanent custody. \" R.C. 2151.414(B) requires a trial court to find the existence of only one of the R.C. 2151.414(B) factors.\"\n   <em>\n    In re S.M.\n   </em>\n   , 4th Dist.
