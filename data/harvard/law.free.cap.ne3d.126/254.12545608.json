Essi, pursuant to R.C. 149.43 -the Ohio Public Records statute, commenced this public records mandamus action against the respondent, the city of Lakewood (\"Lakewood\"), to compel disclosure of records relating to the closure of Lakewood Hospital. The parties have engaged in discovery, including deposing the Law Director, who is the custodian of public records for Lakewood, and Lakewood's computer manager. They have submitted motions, briefs, evidence, and records for an in camera inspection. After reviewing all the material, the court concludes that the matter is ripe for resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b62} Essi made his first request via certified mail on March 15, 2016, in which he made 173 separate public records requests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Essi considered that Lakewood had fulfilled the first 22 requests. These included requests for the minutes of certain city council meetings; audited financial statements of the Lakewood Hospital Association (\"LHA\") for the years 1990 through 2007, 2014, 2015, and 2016; Subsidium Healthcare's Lakewood Hospital\n   DATA Book; all records, notes, and communications-electronic or otherwise-\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   relied upon by the Mayor in his October 2015 campaign flier that \"it will require an enormous tax on residents just to keep outdated Lakewood Hospital open\"; and all records relating to a February 27, 2016 meeting known as a \"retreat.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b63} Among the requests that Essi considered not satisfied were:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   - all records signed by the Mayor, the City Council President, and a certain at-large council member\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   regarding the LHA;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   - all records signed by the three previous individuals in which they agreed to keep any information or trade secrets of the LHA or the Cleveland Clinic private;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   - all records provided to the three trustees by LHA from May 4, 2015, to the present;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   -all correspondence\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   between the Mayor and any employee of the Cleveland Clinic from January 1, 2015, to the present;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   - all records relating to the resignation of Joseph Gibbons as a LHA trustee;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   - the patient day data for the fiscal years from December 31, 2010, through June 30, 2015;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   - all records relating to key performance metrics for Lakewood Hospital for the year-to-date period ending November 30, 2013, and the fiscal year ending December 31, 2014;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   - all records relating to any claim by the Cleveland Clinic that it does not have a general obligation to fund operating losses for the LHA or Lakewood Hospital;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   - all correspondence between or among the law firm Thompson Hine and the Huron Consulting Group, or their representatives, regarding Lakewood Hospital, including Thompson Hine's engagement as attorneys for the city of Lakewood;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   - all records relating to any interviews of representatives of the Cleveland Clinic conducted by Huron Consulting;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   - all records relating to any confidentiality agreement(s) signed by Huron Consulting, or its representatives, relating to proprietary or confidential documentation provided by the Cleveland Clinic regarding specific fees incurred and the allocation of those fees with respect to the LHA or Lakewood Hospital;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   - all records reviewed by Huron Consulting in preparing the Huron Report;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   - all records relating to clinical and administrative services fees, including direct costs, that are incurred by the Cleveland Clinic and allocated to Lakewood Hospital;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   - all records relating to legal bills, including payment, presented to the city of Lakewood by Thompson Hine from January 1, 2015, to the present;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   - all records relating to the engagement letter or contract, including bills and payment for services rendered, with Hennes Communications, or any other public relations\n   or consulting firm, from January 1, 2015 to present;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   - any draft, signed, or unsigned agreement or proposal concerning Lakewood Hospital that was, or may have been, discussed, approved, or agreed to by the LHA, or any committee of the LHA, and/or the Cleveland Clinic during the weeks of November 29, 2015 and December 6, 2015;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   - any draft, signed, or unsigned agreement or proposal concerning Lakewood Hospital that was, or may have been, the subject of the Lakewood City Council Meeting held on December 7, 2015;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   - all records reflecting valuation or appraisals of assets used in the operation of Lakewood Hospital belonging to LHA or the city of Lakewood;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   - all correspondence from and/or to the Mayor, the Law Director, the trustee-council member, and other persons from January 1, 2015, to the present (PRR120-122);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   - all correspondence by any Lakewood City employee or official regarding bidding, listing, requests for proposals, and/or marketing concerning Lakewood Hospital or any or all of the assets used in the conduct of Lakewood Hospital;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   - all records concerning the LHA filing for bankruptcy or the potential thereof (PRR 132);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   - all records relating to financial or performance results for the LHA from October 1, 2015, to the present. This request includes all records in the files of the Law Director, Thompson Hine, its attorneys, and Mr. Cahill who were all agents of the city;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   - all records that discuss or evaluate whether the city of Lakewood had an obligation to conduct a public bidding process with respect to Lakewood Hospital;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   - all records that discuss or evaluate any private bidding process with respect to Lakewood Hospital conducted by an entity other than the city of Lakewood;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   - all records regarding discussions, meetings or negotiations between any city of Lakewood employee or official with the LHA, its board members, the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and/or its board members or trustees, related to Lakewood Hospital or LHA;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   - all records in which any party to the Master Agreement discusses whether any of the parties are or are not required to file a Hart-Scott-Rodino pre-merger filing notice; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   - all records between and among the Law Director and two specifically named lawyers (PRR 171 and 172).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b64} On May 13, 2016, Essi, through certified mail, presented Lakewood with another 48 public records requests. He numbered them PRR 178 through PRR 225. Again, Essi complained that Lakewood had not fulfilled his requests or its duties under R.C. 149.43. These requests included:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   - all correspondence between any Lakewood city employee or official and any employee or official of the Cuyahoga County government regarding the Lakewood Hospital, its assets, or any proposal regarding Lakewood Hospital during 2014, 2015, and 2016. This request includes any communication\n   between any ex officio LHA official and any employee or official of the Cuyahoga County government (PRR 178);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   - all correspondence between any Lakewood city employee or official and any employee or official of the MetroHealth System with respect to any proposal or discussion regarding Lakewood Hospital or its assets during 2014, 2015 and 2016. This request includes any communication between any ex officio LHA official and any employee or official of the MetroHealth System;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   - the electronic calendar of the Lakewood Finance Director (PRR 201);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   - all correspondence between Thompson Hine or its attorneys and any LHA representative;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   - all correspondence between Thompson Hine or its attorneys, and any Cleveland Clinic Foundation representative concerning the city of Lakewood and/or Lakewood Hospital;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   - all correspondence between the Law Director and any LHA official;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   - all records of any statement presented at any LHA meeting regarding compliance with state or federal antitrust laws during the years 2013, 2014, and 2015; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   - all records documenting certain Lakewood employees' or officials' use of any city of Lakewood computer to access the websites LakewoodCitizen.com, Lakewood Citizen Facebook, Lakewoodbuzz.com and/or Lakewood observer.com/forum(PRR 221 and 223);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b65} Essi commenced this mandamus action on June 24, 2016. Between July 12 and August 3, 2016, Lakewood provided more records, but not in complete satisfaction of Essi's requests. In August and September, 2016, this court's mediation office was unable to effect a full settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b66} Then on September 20, 2016, Essi submitted another 97 public records requests via certified mail that he numbered PRR 226 through 323. These included the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   - all records from the Law Director to City Council members, or to any one City Council member, from March 1, 2015, through September 20, 2016, containing the term \"communication strategy\";\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   - all records from any City Council member to any other City Council member from March 1, 2015, through September 20, 2016, containing the term \"communications strategy,\" including those emails in response to or discussing the Law Director's emails to City Council dated June 22, 2015, at 12:22 PM, July 10, 2015 at 2:39 PM, and July 17, 2015, at 3:37 PM;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   - all records from the Law Director to City Council from January 14, 2015, through September 20, 2016 containing the subject \"Re: Hospital matters: a general update\";\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   - all records from any City Council member to any other City Council member from March 1, 2015, through September 20, 2016, which forwards an email containing the term \"communication strategy,\" including but not limited to those in response to, or discussing, the Law Director's emails to City Council dated June 22, 2015, at 12:22 PM, July 10, 2015, at 2:39 PM and July 17, 2015, at 3:37 PM;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   - all records from the Law Director to City Council members, or any one City Council member, from March 1, 2015, through September 20, 2016, containing the term \"master agreement,\" including but not limited to those similar to the Law Director's emails, dated June 22, 2015, at 12:22 PM, July 10, 2015, at 2:39 PM, and July 17, 2015 at 3:37 PM;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   - all records from any City Council member to any other City Council member from March 1, 2015, through December 7, 2015, containing the terms \"draft definitive agreement,\" or \"new definitive agreement\";\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   - all email responses or replies to the Law Director from any City Council member from March 1, 2015, through December 7, 2015, which are responses or replies to the Law Director's three specified emails above;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   - all drafts of the \" 'facts as we know them' piece\" which were \"circulated\" to City Council and referred to in the Law Director's 3:37 PM, July 17, 2015 email to City Council;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   - the electronic calendar of the Law Director from January 2010, through the date of the response to this request;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   - all records regarding the Mayor's and the council member-at-large's resignation or termination as a trustee of LHA;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   - all records regarding the Mayor's private meetings on October 22, 2015 at 4:15 and 5:30;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   - all records including spreadsheets or calculations created by or provided to any public relations firm, city employee, or elected city official that estimate or establish the economic and/or financial value of the Letter of Intent or the Master Agreement;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   - all records from any city employee or elected official to any Cuyahoga County employee or Cuyahoga County elected official regarding the Cleveland Clinic or the Lakewood Hospital Foundation from January 1, 2014, through September 16, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b67} Essi made a total of 323 separate public records requests. The court allowed him to amend his complaint so that the entire dispute could be resolved in one case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b68} By the end of March 2017, Lakewood had released approximately 9,000 pages of records responsive to Essi's requests. In its answer, Lakewood defended not responding to some of the requests or, at least, not to Essi's satisfaction, on various grounds: some records were protected by the client-counsel privilege or were trial preparation records; many of the requests were improper because they were vague, ambiguous, or overbroad; the requests were oppressive-required Lakewood to undertake a massive review or search of records in contravention of how they were organized; asked for information, rather than requesting an actual, identifiable record; and the records could not be disclosed because Lakewood does not keep such records or because they do not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b69} In March 2017, this court issued a scheduling order. Lakewood was to comply with Essi's requests by preparing and releasing an \"Index of Records Supplied, Supplied with redactions, or Withheld\" along with the appropriate records to Essi and filing a copy of the Index with the court. If necessary, Lakewood was to file copies of the disputed records - in original form and showing redactions or withholdings - for an in camera inspection. The parties were also instructed to file dispositive briefs and evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b610} Throughout this litigation, the parties have contested whether the requests were proper: whether the individual requests were overbroad, vague, ambiguous, unclear, or oppressive. R.C. 149.43 provides that if a public record holder does not understand a request, then it must say so and ask the requester to clarify the request. Because the issue of clarification had been raised, this court ordered Essi to certify what he had explained, clarified and/or narrowed about his public records requests. On June 30, 2017, Essi submitted a seven-page affidavit supported by several attachments, including a comprehensive table stating for each request, inter alia, what had been fulfilled, when the records were released, what was clarified and narrowed, and what had not been fulfilled. In this table, Essi withdrew approximately\n   half of his requests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Essi also swore that he had worked with the Law Director for many hours clarifying his requests, including suggesting computer searches that would reveal the requested records. In its filings, Lakewood has generally maintained that Essi did not clarify his requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b611} On August 21, 2017, Lakewood filed its \"Index of Records Supplied, Supplied with redactions, or Withheld.\" Attached to it was a dispositive brief supported by several affidavits. Lakewood also submitted the disputed records for an in camera inspection. Lakewood submitted an amended index in October.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Index shows that over 27,000 pages of records were disclosed to Essi. Lakewood released each record that could be responsive to each request. Because any given record might be responsive to more than one request, that record was released for each appropriate request. Therefore, among the 27,000 pages, there is duplication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b612} The affidavit of the Law Director describes the efforts taken to locate records responsive to each request that Essi had not withdrawn, as well as the results of those efforts. This affidavit endeavors to \"prove the negative\" that Lakewood searched its files and that to the best of the record custodian's (the Law Director's) knowledge, Lakewood has released to Essi or submitted under seal all the records that Lakewood could potentially find coming within the public records request. For many requests (e.g., PRR 137, 138, 143, 144, 152, 158, 161, 162, 212, 214, 227, 228-240, 252, 295, and 296), the Law Director certified that all records responsive to those requests that Lakewood would be in possession would be in the form of emails or attachments to those emails. The Law Director then described the search and then certified \"that, to the best of my knowledge, all records generated from the search described and that have been either released to Relator or submitted under seal are all the records that Lakewood could find potentially coming within Relator's [Public Records Request].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b613} For some requests, - e.g., PRR 219, 221, and 223 all records documenting the Mayor, the Finance Director, and Lakewood's Block Club coordinator use of a city computer to access certain websites - the Law Director stated that the information Essi seeks is not contained in a record and that the filter appliance to retrieve such information has been out of commission due to technical difficulties. Thus, Lakewood is not in possession of any record responsive to those requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b614} For other requests, (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , PRR 23, 25, 27, 34, 39, 210, 211, 214, 265, 266, 268, 269, 297-308, and 315-319), the Law Director asked the specified individuals in the request or who would have the record (e.g., the Mayor, the City Council President, the Finance Director, and the Councilperson who was a LHA Director) for the requested records. The Law Director then certified that he had received the requested records, that the individuals did not recall any such records, or that the individuals found no additional records. The Law Director then certified that if the records existed they had either been released to the relator or submitted for an in camera inspection. If the individuals could not recall ever having such records, the Law Director certified that to the best of his\n   knowledge Lakewood is not in possession of any records responsive to that request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b615} Thompson Hine served as outside counsel for Lakewood during the Hospital transaction. The Law Director asked the law firm for its entire file, and the law firm released it. Thus, the Law Director certified that those requests that sought Thompson Hine records were either released to Essi or submitted for an in camera inspection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b616} For certain requests, e.g., PRR 65-all records relating to any claim by the Cleveland Clinic that it does not have a general obligation to fund operating losses for the LHA or the hospital, the Law Director certified that Lakewood is not in possession of any records responsive to the request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b617} During the time when Lakewood was resolving what it should do with the hospital, it contracted with an independent consultant, Huron Consulting Group, d.b.a. Huron Business Advisory (Huron), to perform financial advisory and due-diligence services. Essi requested records relating to Huron's work for Lakewood, e.g., PRR 66, 67, 69, and 71-76. The Law Director certified it released to Essi any records it possessed relating to Huron's work, but that Huron declined to give to Lakewood any of its own records it used for Lakewood's work. The Law Director further certified that Huron did not meet the criteria for a public entity coming within the scope of R.C. 149.43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b618} Similarly, Essi asked for records relating to the Cleveland Clinic, e.g., PRR 77, 78, and 112. The Law Director certified that he asked the Cleveland Clinic to produce certain records coming within the requests. However, the Cleveland Clinic is not a public entity bound by R.C. 149.43, and it declined to release the records. The Law Director certified that either Lakewood was not in possession of the requested records or that it either released the records it had to Essi or submitted them for an in camera inspection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b619} In summary, the Law Director's affidavit stated that for each request Lakewood had duly searched where the records would be and either released them to Essi or submitted them for an in camera inspection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b620} In response, Essi disputed that Lakewood had complied in fulfilling the requests and R.C. 149.43. He maintained that the submissions were unreasonably late and incomplete. Moreover, Lakewood did not fulfill its duty to cooperate with the requester.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b621} For the three requests-PRR 219, 221, and 223-that sought records documenting whether the Mayor, the Finance Director, and the block club coordinator accessed certain websites with Lakewood computers, Essi argued that because the filter appliance to search for such records is free, Lakewood did not fulfill its duty to release public records, because it could have easily done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b622} Essi also complains that the Mayor in his deposition indicated that there were other records existent, e.g., binders with records from the LHA, binders that are with records that have been packed up for litigation, and spreadsheets and calculations for the transaction. However, the records released to Essi are too meager to fulfill what the Mayor described. Finally, Essi complains that while Lakewood may have searched its email records, there is no evidence that it searched its other network drivers and servers for potential records. In response, the Law Director and Lakewood's Information Technology Manager submitted affidavits that doing such searches on Lakewood's computers would be an oppressive burden that would cause the computers to crash. Moreover, Lakewood's\n   network drivers and servers are not a permanent storage facility with documents, records, files, etc. being deleted. Essi responded with an expert's affidavit that could not be true and suggested several ways in which the searches could be made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b623} Accordingly, Essi asks that this court issue a writ of mandamus to compel the disclosure of public records and rule that Lakewood did not fulfill its duties under R.C. 149.43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b624} The requisites for mandamus are well established: (1) the relator must have a clear legal right to the requested relief, (2) the respondent must have a clear legal duty to perform the requested relief, and (3) there must be no adequate remedy at law.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Harris v. Rhodes,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6710597\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-2d/54/41/\">\n    54 Ohio St.2d 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=374%20N.E.2d%20641\">\n    374 N.E.2d 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978).

Except for certain records submitted for an in camera inspection that this court orders released, this court declines to issue a writ of mandamus for Lakewood to continue its search for any more records that might come within the scope of the requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b633} Although it is understandable that Essi, a newspaper reporter for a small paper serving Lakewood, would wish to shed the full light on the sale of Lakewood Hospital, which is one of the most important transactions in the city's history and that many residents looked upon with suspicion and fear of a \"sell out,\" Essi's numerous requests are problematic. First, it is evident that Essi seeks a complete duplication of the voluminous file on the sale of Lakewood Hospital. To make sure that every record was ferreted out, Essi crafted his requests in the broadest language to include any kind of record and to include any topic related to the sale, such as whether key members of the city government were \"checking up\" on the opposition; whether alternatives were explored; whether rumors were true, e.g., did other groups offer or explore the possibility to buy or rent Lakewood Hospital; whether Lakewood obtained fair market value; whether Lakewood complied with relevant laws; and whether the Cleveland Clinic manipulated Lakewood into an unfavorable bargaining position (PRR 4-9, 15, 23, 25, 31, 32, 35, 56, 57, 61, 64, 71, 72, 73, 75, 78). Thus, his public records requests were more akin to discovery requests than requests for known, identifiable records, like the minutes of a given council meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b634} Many of the requests compel the records custodian to research voluminous files and identify a specific subset of records containing selected information, e.g., PRR 34-all records relating to the \"power point\" presentation or proposal by MetroHealth to the LHA in September 2014; PRR 161-all records in which any party to the Master Agreement discusses whether any of the parties are required to file a Hart-Scott-Rodino premerger filing notice; and PRR 215 and 216-all records regarding statements given by the Mayor, the Block Club coordinator, a specified Lakewood consultant, and any city council member on December 6 or 7, 2015. The courts held that these types of requests were improper in\n   <em>\n    Shaughnessy, Fant, Dillery,\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Carr.\n   </em>\n   It may seem counterintuitive to brand such requests as overbroad, vague, ambiguous, or unclear because the requests contain a great deal of specificity, but such labels may not be unwarranted when such requests are made without knowledge of whether such records exist or where to begin to look for them. \"To prove the negative\" that there are no other records out there responsive to the request would require a governmental entity to search all its files to ensure compliance with the request. Furthermore, although\n   the phrase \"related to\" is commonly used in litigation discovery requests and understood by attorneys, the city employees who would have to search files might not understand the full breadth of the language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   {\u00b635} Just as a governmental entity is under no duty to create a public record, it is under no duty to download a computer program so it can search for a given type of record. The statute does not command that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b636} This case illustrates the problems and difficulties of public records cases. The citizens have the need and the right to know what their government is doing, especially on matters that affect the mental and physical well-being of the residents and the financial well-being of the community. They have the right and need to know whether their civil servants are effecting their duties properly and with integrity. However, they do not know what records are kept and how they are kept. Thus, as in this case, to obtain the desired and necessary records, a records requester is compelled to make multiple, broad discovery-type requests, even if they are in the form of requesting a \"record.\" Trying to ask for a specific identifiable record, like the annual budget or the council minutes, runs the risk of losing a game of \"Name That Record\" and not getting what is wanted and needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b637} The governmental entity, on the other hand, when handed such a request is confronted with an oppressive task. First, these discovery type requests require the record custodian to search all the government's records and then comb through them to isolate the records with the desired information. The record custodian may realize that the requester's conceptualization of how records are stored are not the way they are actually stored. For example, a requester could reasonably think that records, like incident reports, are stored in a chronological way, day by day, so that a request for all the incident reports of the week of July 16 should be easy to fulfill. However, the governmental entity might store them in a completely different way, alphabetically or geographically, that would complicate the search. The record custodian may not have actual knowledge of all of the records that an employee makes and keeps. To ensure that all of the records are produced, the custodian may have to contact all the individuals who might have records related to the request and ask them to search their own files. In the present case, the court filings, including the records submitted for an in camera inspection, indicate that at least four dozen people with connections to Lakewood were involved in the sale of the hospital. There may also be issues about what any given computer does and does not do and what it can and cannot do. For example, will a computer delete files, like history of use, or put the file in a very hard to access place. Alternatively, special programming may be required to do certain searches. Finally, the governmental entity must convince the requester, who may harbor suspicion and animosity toward the governmental entity, and the court that all records coming within the request have been produced. In other words, it has to \"prove the negative,\" an oppressive and daunting task.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b638} In summary, after considering the purposes of the public records law, the importance of the requests, the nature of the requests, the 27,000 pages of records released, and the evidence and certifications of the parties, this court is convinced that Lakewood has fulfilled its duty to release public records and, except for the records submitted for an in camera inspection, declines to issue a writ of mandamus to compel Lakewood to continue its search\n   for more records coming within the requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   IN CAMERA INSPECTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b639} Thompson Hine Legal Bills-The court finds that the redactions of the narrative portions of the itemized attorney billing statements were proper under the client-counsel privilege.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

The initial redacted copy of the Finance Director's calendar had all dates, date ranges, times and appointment headings removed. The court ordered Lakewood to resubmit a redacted copy and an unredacted copy of the Finance Director's calendar for an in camera inspection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-443\">\n   These records were at least comprehensible, but there were still many anomalies. There were approximately 290 unredacted notations that were on the redacted calendar that were not on the unredacted calendar. These notations were generally for lunchtime lift, team lean meeting, and Finance Department monthly lunch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-444\">\n   {\u00b642} There were approximately 500 notations of redacted material that were not on the unredacted copy of the calendar. In her affidavit, the Finance Director explained that many of the redactions were made to shield the private information of people's birthdays. \"During the course of the past year, however, I have removed some birthdays from my Outlook calendar. As a result, I no longer have an original copy of the unredacted version of the electronic calendar that I sent to Lakewood's Law Director in response to Relator's request. Additionally, any redactions on my electronic calendar previously to Relator [sic] that were not birthdays involved personal and family appointments.\" (Paragraph 5 of the Finance Director's affidavit.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-445\">\n   {\u00b643} The court accepts the explanation for the deletion of the private birthday notations. These notations appear on the same day over the course of 2013-2016, and in the same format. To the extent that notations of a private appointment appear on the redacted calendar, but not on the unredacted calendar and they do not appear to be birthday notations, the court has no doubt that they are authentic redactions of private appointments. The repeated additions of family and personal appointments on the calendar and the location of many of them on weekends, relieves this court of any doubt as to their nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-446\">\n   {\u00b644} Finance Director's calendar-pgs. 2-23-The court upholds the redactions, including the \"private appointment locks\" as private matters/unrelated to governmental functions.
