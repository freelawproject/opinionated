Appellee filed a complaint for divorce. The trial court issued an agreed judgment entry of divorce on August 27, 2015, approving the parties' separation agreement and incorporating the separation agreement into the judgment entry and decree of divorce. The separation agreement addresses appellant's pension plan with Ohio Police &amp; Fire (\"OPF\") and provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Husband was the owner of a Police &amp; Fire Retirement Account. Wife shall be awarded fifty percent (50%) of the marital portion of this service retirement account as of June 21, 2013. For purposes of valuation and division, the June 21, 2013 date shall be the date by which said service retirement account is evaluated and divided. The prevailing percentages of entitlement that were extant as of that date shall apply to the division herein. Division of this account shall take place by the creation, signing and filing of a qualified Division of Property Order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On May 19, 2016, OPF rejected the first Division of Property Order (\"DOPO\") submitted by the parties and approved by the trial court. The parties submitted a second DOPO that the trial court entered on June 9, 2016. In August of 2016, OPF accepted the DOPO that was filed on June 9, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On September 15, 2016, the trial court issued a judgment entry terminating appellant's spousal support obligation since the DOPO had been approved and was effective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Appellant filed a motion to amend the DOPO on September 8, 2017. Appellant argued the benefit calculation of the OPF retirement was not made as of June 21, 2013, and OPF failed to properly calculate\n   the benefit as of the date of divorce and instead calculated the amount as of appellant's retirement date. Appellant contended the trial court should approve an Amended DOPO that utilizes the \"dollar amount\" method of payment to appellee, the alternate payee, in accordance with the separation agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The trial court scheduled appellant's motion for hearing on November 17, 2017. Upon agreement of the parties, the hearing was continued. Upon further agreement of the parties, the motion was set for non-oral hearing on March 15, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Appellant filed a brief in support of his motion to amend on February 16, 2018. Appellant argued the language in the separation agreement unambiguously calls for the use of a frozen coverture and the DOPO uses the traditional coverture method to determine the payments to appellee. Attached as an exhibit to appellant's brief is a fax from Becki Gates (\"Gates\") of OPF to counsel for appellant, including an estimate of the benefit appellant would have qualified for on June 21, 2013 and also a breakdown of how OPF calculated the amount currently paid to appellee based on the June 2016 DOPO. Appellee filed a memorandum in opposition on February 28, 2018. Appellant filed a reply brief on March 9, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The trial court issued a judgment entry denying appellant's motion on May 17, 2018. The trial court stated that any service credit appellant earned while on disability or after the de facto date of divorce in June of 2013 would be applied to the denominator of the fraction and would not have an impact on the numerator of the fraction, in conformity with the requirements of the DOPO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Appellant appeals the May 17, 2018 judgment entry of the Licking County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division, and assigns the following as error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} \"I. THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN FAILING TO PROPERLY APPLY THE PARTIES' DE FACTO DATE OF DIVORCE TO THE DIVISION OF DEFENDANT-APPELLANT'S POLICE &amp; FIRE RETIREMENT ACCOUNT AND ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY ERRONEOUSLY CONCLUDING THAT THE CORRECT CALCULATION WAS APPLIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} \"II.

Accordingly, the trial court must enforce the decree as written. However, the parties disagree as to whether the DOPO enforces the decree and separation agreement. Appellee asserts the DOPO does award appellee 50% of the pension as of June 21, 2013 and does take into consideration the June 21, 2013 date of divorce. Appellant argues the DOPO awards appellee 50% of appellant's pension as of the date of his retirement, not the date of divorce, and that the DOPO impermissibly modifies the separation agreement that requires the use of a frozen coverture and instead utilizes the traditional coverture fraction method.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 17} In order to effectuate and enforce the divorce decree's division of pension benefits, the trial court enters an order such as a DOPO.

In the \"dollar amount\" method of payment, the monthly amount that the alternate payee is to receive from the participant's benefit is entered in Paragraph (II)(B)(1)(a). In the \"percentage\" method of payment, the percentage the alternate payee is to receive is entered in Paragraph (II)(B)(2)(a), and this percentage is applied to the fraction as set forth in (c). The fraction in (c) consists of a numerator, which is the number of years during which\n   the participant was contributing to the pension fund and married to the alternate payee, and a denominator being the participant's total years of service credit as determined by the public retirement system at the time of the participant elects to take the benefit. Further, in the percentage calculation method, the monthly benefit used to determine the amount paid to the alternate payee is as follows: if the participant is already receiving a monthly benefit at the time the divorce is final, the monthly benefit is the gross monthly benefit as of the date of the divorce; if the participant has applied for but is not yet receiving a monthly benefit, the monthly benefit is the benefit for which the participant is eligible; or if the participant has not yet applied for a benefit, the monthly benefit shall be the benefit calculated at the time the participant elects to take the benefit.

Ford\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. Franklin No. 14AP-954,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-3571\">\n    2015-Ohio-3571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205120973\">\n    2015 WL 5120973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 25} In this case, whereas the separation agreement unambiguously employs a frozen coverture fraction, the DOPO employs a traditional coverture fraction, as the denominator of the fraction as set forth in Paragraph (II)(B)(2)(c) includes the total years of appellant's service credit with OPF and is not limited to the years of service credit as of June 21, 2013. Additionally, the DOPO form utilizes the traditional coverture method because the monthly benefit calculation amount in Paragraph (C)(3) is the amount as of appellant's date of retirement, not as of June 21, 2013. The terms of the DOPO are inconsistent with the separation agreement and thus the DOPO improperly modifies the separation agreement and divorce decree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Based on the foregoing, appellant's assignments of error are sustained. The May 17, 2018 judgment entry of the Licking County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division, is reversed and remanded with instructions to the trial court to determine appellee's monthly benefit under the frozen coverture method as of June 21, 2013, and enter a DOPO that reflects that monthly amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Hoffman, J., and Baldwin, J., concur\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
