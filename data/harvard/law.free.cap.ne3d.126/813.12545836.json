The trial court ruled that the City's claims are barred by a 2015 amendment (\"the Amendment\") to Indiana Code Section 34-12-3-3 (\"the Immunity Statute\"), which made the statute retroactive to four days before the City filed its original complaint in 1999. The court also ruled that the Manufacturers are not entitled to attorney's fees and costs under Indiana Code Section 34-12-3-4. The court further ruled that, contrary to an earlier opinion from this Court in this case, the City's claims are also barred by the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (\"the PLCAA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [2] On appeal, the City argues that the Amendment is unconstitutional and that its claims are not barred by either the Immunity Statute or the PLCAA. The State of Indiana has intervened to defend the Amendment's constitutionality. The Manufacturers argue that the City's lawsuit is an unlawful attempt to regulate firearms and that the trial court erred in denying them attorney's fees and costs under Indiana Code Section 34-12-3-4. We conclude as follows: (1) the City's lawsuit is not an unlawful attempt to regulate firearms; (2) the City has failed to establish that the Amendment is unconstitutional; (3) the Immunity Statute does not bar all of the City's claims; (4) the Manufacturers are not entitled to attorney's fees and costs; and (5) pursuant to the law of the case doctrine, we reaffirm our prior holding that the PLCAA does not bar the City's claims. Accordingly, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [3] In August 1999, the City lodged a complaint for damages and injunctive relief against the Manufacturers and various handgun distributors and retail dealers. The complaint was dated August 27 and was file-stamped by the trial court clerk on August 30. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Indiana Trial Rule 12(B)(6), which the trial court granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [4] In January 2001, the City filed an amended complaint. In the first appeal in this case, the Indiana Supreme Court described the amended complaint as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The complaint alleges that manufacturers of handguns typically sell to \"distributors\" who resell at wholesale to \"dealers\" who in turn sell at retail to the general public. Some categories of persons are prohibited by law from purchasing guns, and all dealer-defendants are alleged to have knowingly sold to illegal buyers through intermediaries in \"straw purchases\"....\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   Some other practices of dealers are also alleged to generate illegal purchases. These include failure by some dealers to obtain\n   the required information for background checks required by federal law, sales of a number of guns to the same person, and intentional \"diversion\" of guns by some dealers to illegal purchasers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The City alleges that the manufacturers know of these illegal retail sales of handguns, and know that a small percentage of dealers, including the dealer-defendants here, account for a large portion of illegally obtained handguns. The City alleges the manufacturers and distributors have the ability to change the distribution system to prevent these unlawful sales but have intentionally failed to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The City alleges that these and other practices generate substantial additional cost to the public in general and the City in particular. Possession of unlawfully purchased guns is claimed to contribute to crime that requires expenditure of public resources in addition to the obvious harm to the victims. The complaint alleges that seventy murders with handguns took place in Gary in 1997, and another fifty-four in 1998. From 1997 through 2000, 2,136 handguns used in crimes were recovered. Of these, 764 were sold through dealers who are defendants in this suit. The City also asserts that harm is suffered by the City at the time of the sale of an illegal handgun because these unlawful sales generate additional requirements to investigate and prosecute the violations of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   In addition to challenging the distribution practice of the defendants, the City also alleges negligent design of the handguns by the manufacturers that contributes to these injuries. Finally, the City alleges that the manufacturers engage in deceptive advertising of their product by asserting that a gun in the home offers additional safety for the occupants when in fact the contrary is the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Count I of the complaint alleges that these facts support a claim for public nuisance.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   Count II asserts a claim for negligence in distribution of guns and Count III presents a claim for their negligent design. All Counts request compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    City of Gary v.

The court did not address the City's constitutional challenges to the Amendment but concluded that the Manufacturers are entitled to immunity under the Immunity Statute because there was no allegation that their \"sales practices violated any specific statute, regulation or ordinance related directly to the sale of firearms.\" Appealed Order at 4. Likewise, the court did not address the City's constitutional challenges to the PLCAA but concluded that the Manufacturers are entitled to immunity under that statute because the City had \"alleged no violations of any Indiana or federal statutes specifically applicable to the sale or marketing of firearms.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-12-3-0\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-12-3-0\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
