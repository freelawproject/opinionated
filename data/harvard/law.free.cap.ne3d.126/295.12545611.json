Specifically, appellant argues that the trial court erred by failing to explain to him certain sex offender classification reporting requirements prior to accepting his guilty plea and, thus, did not fully comply with Crim.R. 11(C). After a thorough review of the record and law, this court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant was indicted on December 9, 2016, on the following charges: Count 1, rape, in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), a first-degree felony, with a sexually violent predator specification in violation of R.C. 2941.148(A) ; and Count 2, kidnapping, in violation of R.C. 2905.11(A)(1), a first-degree felony, with a sexually violent predator specification in violation of R.C. 2941.148(A) and a sexual motivation specification in violation of R.C. 2941.147(A). Appellant was arraigned on December 14, 2016, and pled not guilty to the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Thereafter, on March 15, 2017, appellant pled guilty to the indictment as charged. On March 27, 2017, the trial court held a sentencing hearing and sentenced appellant to a prison term of ten years to life, with a possibility of parole after ten years. The state elected to have appellant sentenced under Count 1 (rape).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On September 29, 2017, appellant filed a notice of appeal. On October 2, 2017, in the trial court, appellant filed a pro se motion to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to Crim.R. 32.1. On November 6,\n   2017, the trial court denied appellant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On July 3, 2018, this court issued a sua sponte order remanding this matter to the trial court for a correction of the record pursuant to App.R. 9(E). Although the trial court's April 6, 2017 sentencing journal entry indicated that Counts 1 and 2 merged for sentencing purposes, the entry did not indicate whether appellant was sentenced on Count 1 or Count 2. On July 12, 2018, the trial court issued a nunc pro tunc journal entry correcting this error and, thus, the July 12, 2018 sentencing entry satisfies the elements of a final, appealable order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

If you move in the middle of that 90 days, you have to let them know you've moved, because there is a separate felony for failing to register. You can face more problems down the road if you didn't do that. That can include telephone number, if you change your cell phone number or internet address.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   In case of doubt you want to let the sheriff know. If you were to get an opportunity to work in Akron in Summit County, you got to tell the sheriff in Summit County, I'm coming. You'd have to tell the sheriff in Cuyahoga County I'm leaving, and the same thing when you come back, if you work there for several months and move back. So it's a lot of responsibility, but you will have that responsibility, as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Tr. 8-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Appellant argues that the trial court was required to discuss the \"community notification requirements\" with him prior to accepting his guilty plea. Appellant's brief at 4. Appellant further argues that \"[b]ecause [he] was subject to community notification as a Tier III sex offender, the trial court was required to discuss the community notification sanctions with him prior to accepting his guilty plea.\" Appellant's brief at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 17} In support of his argument, appellant cites to R.C. 2950.11. However, we note that R.C. 2950.11 simply establishes what the community at large will be notified of with regards to a sex offender's registration. R.C. 2950.11 has no \"community notification requirements,\" to which appellant himself would be bound. In sum, reading R.C. 2950.11 in its totality, we note that this statute is more or less the\n   <em>\n    outcome\n   </em>\n   that stems from appellant's sexual offender classification reporting duties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Not even the most broad reading of this statute would mandate any \"requirements\" that the appellant himself would have to the community at large. Indeed, appellant has the\n   <em>\n    duty\n   </em>\n   to register in accordance with the Tier III sex offender classification duties. Thereafter, the sheriff\n   <em>\n    notifies\n   </em>\n   the community, and the other various individuals as enumerated in R.C. 2950.11(A)(1) through (10), of appellant's sex offender classification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Therefore, to the extent that appellant argues that he was not aware that the community would be notified by his registration duties, we find no merit to this argument. Community notification is undeniably the global purpose of sex offender classification. Appellant's argument would then follow that he thought registering as a sex offender was only for the purpose of the sheriff's office records. Nowhere within R.C. 2950.11, nor any other statute, does it state that the trial court is required to discuss any of the community notifications that stem from a defendant's sex offender registration duties prior to accepting a guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Appellant also argues that the trial court failed to notify him of his residential restrictions pursuant to R.C. 2950.034(A) which provide that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   No person who has been convicted of, is convicted of, has pleaded guilty to, or pleads guilty to a sexually oriented offense or a child-victim oriented offense shall establish a residence or occupy residential\n   premises within one thousand feet of any school premises or preschool or child day-care center premises.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In our review of the change of plea hearing transcript, we note that the trial court makes no mention of the residential restrictions pursuant to R.C. 2950.034(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Notwithstanding the fact that the trial court failed to notify appellant of the residential restrictions, we nevertheless find that the trial court substantially complied with Crim.R. 11. The record reflects that appellant was informed, prior to entering a plea of guilty, that he would be classified a Tier III sex offender.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Moreover, the trial court notified appellant that as a Tier III sex offender, he would be subject to various reporting requirements for life. This advisement substantially complies with Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Creed\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.

Further, we find, as this court did in\n   <em>\n    Creed\n   </em>\n   , that \"[t]he totality of circumstances indicate that appellant subjectively understood that by pleading guilty to a sexually oriented offense, he would be subjected to certain restrictions as a Tier III sex offender.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Appellant also argues that because the trial court wholly failed to comply with Crim.R. 11, appellant need not show that he was prejudiced by the trial court's error in failing to notify him of the community notification and residential restrictions. However, having found that the trial court did substantially comply, appellant must therefore demonstrate actual prejudice. \"A defendant must show prejudice before a plea will be vacated for a trial court's error involving Crim.R. 11(C) procedure when nonconstitutional aspects of the colloquy are at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Veney\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695059\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/120/176/\">\n    120 Ohio St.3d 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008-Ohio-5200\">\n    2008-Ohio-5200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=897%20N.E.2d%20621\">\n    897 N.E.2d 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 17. We find that appellant has failed to argue, much less present any evidence, that he was prejudiced by the trial court's omission or that his plea would have otherwise not been made.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1427556\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/56/106/#p108\">\n    56 Ohio St.3d at 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=564%20N.E.2d%20474\">\n    564 N.E.2d 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Lastly, we note that the trial court provided appellant with a sex offender classification form. This form provided appellant with information relative to his duties and responsibilities as a Tier III sex offender and was presented for appellant to sign at the sentencing hearing. Further, as we can discern from the sentencing hearing transcript, appellant signed this form. We can also presume that appellant's counsel reviewed this form with him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 23} In our review of the record, we find that the trial court substantially complied with Crim.R. 11 because it sufficiently articulated to appellant his duties as a Tier III sex offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Accordingly, appellant's sole assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   MARY EILEEN KILBANE, P.J., and MARY J.
