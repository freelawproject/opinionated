Since then, Vinnie has filed numerous postconviction motions, both in the trial court and in this court. See, e.g.,\n  <em>\n   Vinnie\n  </em>\n  v.\n  <em>\n   Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Inst., Norfolk\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12549248\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/92/1224/#p1008\">\n   479 Mass. 1007\n  </extracted-citation>\n  , 1008,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12549248\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/92/1224/#p1008\">\n   92 N.E.3d 1224\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (2018) (affirming single justice's judgment denying motion to reinstate petition for writ of habeas corpus);\n  <em>\n   Vinnie\n  </em>\n  v.\n  <em>\n   Commonwealth\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=475%20Mass.%201011\">\n   475 Mass. 1011\n  </extracted-citation>\n  , 1012,\n  <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=58%20N.E.3d%20290\">\n   58 N.E.3d 290\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (2016) (affirming single justice's judgment denying mandamus relief). In his most recent effort to obtain relief, Vinnie filed a \"Verified Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\" in the county court, which a single justice denied without a hearing.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-9\">\n  Vinnie has now filed a memorandum and appendix pursuant to S.J.C. Rule 2:21, as amended,\n  <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=434%20Mass.%201301\">\n   434 Mass. 1301\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (2001). Even though rule 2:21 does not apply here, because he is not challenging any interlocutory rulings of the trial court, it is clear that he is not entitled to relief. Regardless of how Vinnie styles his filing, his request for declaratory and injunctive relief is merely a recasting of the same types of claims that he has raised in his previous postconviction filings. Even if his claims were new, his avenue for seeking relief is in the Superior Court in the first instance. Should his efforts in that court be denied, he can then seek leave to obtain review in this court pursuant to the gatekeeper provision of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. What he cannot do, as we have recently reminded him, is \"circumvent the gatekeeper provision\" by filing petitions or complaints such as this in the county court in the first instance.\n  <em>\n   Vinnie\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12549248\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/92/1224/#p1008\">\n   479 Mass. at 1007-1008\n  </extracted-citation>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12549248\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/92/1224/#p1008\">\n   92 N.E.3d 1224\n  </extracted-citation>\n  , quoting\n  <em>\n   Tyree\n  </em>\n  v.\n  <em>\n   Commonwealth\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3817894\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/449/1034/#p1034\">\n   449 Mass. 1034\n  </extracted-citation>\n  , 1034,\n  <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=873%20N.E.2d%20741\">\n   873 N.E.2d 741\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (2007).\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-10\">\n   The single justice did not err in denying relief.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
