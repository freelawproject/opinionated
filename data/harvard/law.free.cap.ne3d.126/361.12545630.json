Once a defendant has been found guilty and been sentenced, in other words convicted, the criminal proceeding is no longer pending. The judgment is final. While the trial court retains jurisdiction in misdemeanor cases after sentencing, R.C. 2929.25(B) and (C) and 2929.24(H), this does not mean that the criminal proceeding is still pending. If a court imposes a jail term for a misdemeanor, the court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail term, and may substitute a community-control sanction for any remaining portion of the nonmandatory jail term. But this jurisdiction is invoked only upon motion of the defendant, the state or the court. R.C. 2929.24(H). Similarly, if a court imposes a community-control sanction, it may modify community-control sanctions or conditions of release previously imposed, but only upon motion of the defendant, the state or the court. R.C. 2929.25(B). And any alleged violation of a community-control sanction results in the commencement of a new \"proceeding\" resulting in a final judgment subject to appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The possibility of the exercise of this limited jurisdiction following conviction does not render the proceeding still \"pending.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b69} Our conclusion that defendant's misdemeanor case does not remain pending even though the court retains jurisdiction is supported by other analogous scenarios where courts retain jurisdiction. For example, in domestic-relations cases, the court retains jurisdiction over certain statutorily identified matters after a final decree of divorce is journalized and subject to appeal, but the case is no longer \"pending.\" And in civil cases, the court retains jurisdiction to enforce its judgment, even though the matter is no longer \"pending.\" And because the case is no longer pending in these instances, the court's jurisdiction can only be invoked by motion resulting in a new proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b610} Finally, we note that the legislature has made a distinction between a \"pending\" criminal proceeding and a \"final discharge\" in the statutes dealing with sealing of records.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2953.52 and 2953.32. The legislature has determined that the sealing of records after a finding of not guilty or a dismissal should be treated differently than the sealing of records after a conviction. As to the former, an application to seal may be filed at any time after the finding of not guilty or the dismissal. R.C. 2953.52. As to the latter\n   (conviction), an application may be filed one year after the offender's \"final discharge\" if the conviction is a misdemeanor. R.C. 2953.32.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   While not defined, final discharge means completion of the sentence. And for misdemeanors, this would be at the conclusion of the jail term or the community-control period. For both convictions and dismissals, however, the court must determine whether \"criminal proceedings are pending.\" Had the legislature intended a \"pending\" criminal matter to include the time post-conviction when the defendant was serving her sentence, it would not have used different language in the same statute for \"final discharge.\" Rather, it would have simply stated that a request to seal a misdemeanor conviction could be made one year after defendant's criminal proceeding was no longer pending. We find that once a sentence is imposed and the conviction is final, the criminal proceeding is no longer \"pending.\" Rather, defendant is serving a sentence, which, when completed, is a \"final discharge.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b611} Thus, while a defendant on community control has not been fully discharged, we hold that the criminal proceedings against her are no longer pending and she may have her records sealed, if otherwise eligible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b612} Therefore, we sustain the assignment of error, reverse the judgments of the trial court, and remand this matter for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Judgments reversed and cause remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Cunningham, P.J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Miller, J., dissents.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    R.C. 2953.32 was amended effective October 29, 2018.

Blair\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b614} Appellant Elizabeth Floyd is currently subject to a misdemeanor community-control sanction and a suspended jail term. Misdemeanor community-control sanctions are governed by R.C. 2929.25, while misdemeanor jail terms are governed by R.C. 2929.24 -both of which were rewritten effective January 1, 2004. In relevant part, R.C. 2929.25 gives a trial court two options when sentencing a misdemeanor offender to community control: (1) directly impose a sentence that consists of a community-control sanction; or (2) impose a jail term under R.C. 2929.24, suspend some or all of that sentence, and place the offender on community control. R.C. 2929.25(A)(1)(a) and (b). If a trial court sentences an offender to any community-control sanction or combination of community-control sanctions authorized under R.C. 2929.26, 2929.27, or 2929.28, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender for the duration of the sanctions\n   imposed. R.C. 2929.25(C). Likewise, \"[i]f a court sentences an offender to a jail term under [ R.C. 2929.24 ], the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail term.\" R.C. 2929.24(H).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b615} The statute authorizing the sealing of dismissals, R.C. 2953.52(A), permits \"[a]ny person, who is found not guilty of an offense by a jury or a court * * * [to] apply to the court for an order to seal the person's official records in the case.\" Upon the filing of the application, the trial court must set a date for a hearing and notify the prosecutor. R.C. 2953.52(B)(1). The trial court is required to make several determinations before ruling on the application, including \"whether criminal proceedings are pending against the person.\" R.C. 2953.52(B)(2)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b616} The Ohio Revised Code does not define \"criminal proceedings\" or \"pending.\" In\n   <em>\n    Blair\n   </em>\n   , we did not attempt to define the terms, but held that because a community-control sanction can be revoked upon a community-control violation, and the resulting adversarial proceedings are within the sentencing court's criminal jurisdiction, a criminal proceeding is pending for the duration of the community-control sanction. Implicit in this holding is that community control is an ongoing part of the criminal action, and the sentencing court's retention of jurisdiction over the offender for the duration of the community-control sanction keeps it pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b617} Most courts have similarly relied on the plain meaning of the terms. For instance, courts that have defined the term \"criminal action or proceeding,\" a phrase used throughout the Ohio Revised Code, have used the dictionary-definition of the individual terms-e.g., a proceeding is the \"regular and orderly progress in form of law, including all possible steps in an action from its commencement to the execution of judgment.\" (Internal quotations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

In conclusory terms and without citation, the majority determines that a criminal proceeding is no longer pending where there is a final appealable order (a guilty-finding and sentence), even where a trial court retains jurisdiction after sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b621} The majority reasons that in Floyd's case the potential for a community-control violation sentencing hearing is not a pending criminal proceeding because, while the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over her case, a new conviction cannot result from a community-control violation. She would simply face a second sentencing hearing pursuant to R.C. 2929.25. This argument actually concedes defeat:\n   <em>\n    Because\n   </em>\n   Floyd faces a possible additional sentencing hearing on the original conviction in case C-16CRB-34204, the case remains pending. The judgment is still being executed and is thus pending within the definition. The majority's comparison to domestic-relations cases and civil cases, which it concludes are no longer pending even though the courts retain jurisdiction over certain matters, is not persuasive and simply begs the question. Are they pending? The majority states they are not, but offers neither reasoning nor citation in support of its conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b622} Here, the majority concedes that a municipal court could take action to modify the sentence sua sponte. It is difficult to conclude that a case is not pending when this is true. We are not faced with an original question, but are asked to revisit a recent holding of another panel of this court. While there are arguments both ways,\n   <em>\n    Blair\n   </em>\n   was not clearly wrongly decided.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Galatis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1190310\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/100/216/\">\n    100 Ohio St.3d 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003-Ohio-5849\">\n    2003-Ohio-5849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=797%20N.E.2d%201256\">\n    797 N.E.2d 1256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 58. It should not be overturned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b623} The majority also claims that the legislature made a distinction in terms in R.C. 2953.52 and 2953.32, between \"criminal proceedings are pending\" and \"final discharge.\" But these terms are not used in the same context. In both statutes, the court must determine whether criminal proceedings are pending.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2953.32(C)(1)(b) and 2953.52(B)(2)(b). The language pertaining to a final discharge of the case for which the applicant seeks to seal is not relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b624} Because the court retains jurisdiction over Floyd for the duration of her community-control sanction, pursuant to R.C. 2929.25(C), and over the suspended jail term on the original conviction, pursuant to R.C. 2929.24(H), the case numbered C-16CRB-34204 is a pending criminal proceeding. Therefore, I would find that the trial court did not err in applying\n   <em>\n    Blair\n   </em>\n   to deny Floyd's application to seal her records, and would overrule Floyd's sole assignment of error and affirm the trial court's judgments.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
