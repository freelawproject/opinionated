Watkins, appeals from judgment entries of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas denying his motion to withdraw guilty plea and imposing a 67-year aggregate prison sentence for multiple convictions. Because (1) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Watkins' presentence motion to withdraw his guilty plea, and (2) the sentence imposed by the trial court does not violate the Eighth Amendment prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment as articulated in\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   , we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On October 12, 2011, after Watkins was bound over from the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Division of Domestic Relations, Juvenile Branch, a Franklin County Grand Jury indicted him for six counts of aggravated robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.01, six counts of robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.02, six counts of kidnapping in violation of R.C. 2905.01, two counts of rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02, and two counts of gross sexual imposition in violation of R.C. 2907.05. These counts all contained a firearm specification pursuant to R.C. 2941.145. The counts arose out of four separate events that occurred in February 2011. The state alleged that Watkins and another unidentified person robbed multiple individuals at gunpoint on four occasions and that Watkins, in two instances, also sexually assaulted certain victims. Watkins was 16 years old at the time of the offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Watkins initially entered a not guilty plea to the offenses. However, on the morning of his scheduled trial, Watkins entered a guilty plea to five counts of aggravated robbery, and one count each of robbery, sexual battery, and gross sexual imposition, as well as three firearm specifications. The trial court told Watkins that as a result, he faced a maximum prison term of 73 and one-half years. Watkins replied that he understood. The trial court accepted Watkins' guilty plea, ordered the preparation of a presentence investigation, and scheduled a sentencing hearing. Watkins was 18 years old when he entered his guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Two days before his scheduled sentencing hearing, Watkins filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea. In the motion, he alleged that he entered his guilty plea as the result of pressure put on him by his family and that he did not accurately comprehend the consequences of his plea. Notwithstanding the motion, the trial court proceeded to sentence Watkins to a total prison term of 67 years. The trial court subsequently held a hearing on Watkins' motion. Watkins testified that although he was guilty of some of the counts, he was not guilty of them all. Therefore, he did not want to plead guilty. Watkins testified that he felt pressured into entering his guilty plea by family members who\n   thought it was the right thing to do. At the end of the hearing, the trial denied Watkins' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Watkins appealed the trial court's judgment asserting two assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [1.] The trial court committed reversible error by denying Defendant-Appellant's presentence motion to withdraw his guilty plea.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [2.] The trial court imposed a cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution by sentencing Appellant, who was sixteen years old at the time of the offense, to a prison term of sixty seven (67) years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} This court overruled both assignments of error and affirmed the trial court's judgment.\n   <em>\n    Watkins\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist.

After this court overruled his motion for reconsideration, Watkins filed a notice of appeal and a memorandum in support of jurisdiction with the Supreme Court of Ohio that set forth the following proposition of law:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   A court must separately consider the youth of a juvenile offender as a mitigating factor before imposing a sentence that is the functional equivalent of life without parole. Further, the record must reflect that the court specifically considered the juvenile offender's youth as a mitigating factor at sentencing when a prison term that is the functional equivalent of life without parole is imposed.

However, it held its review pending its decision in\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   , which involved an Eighth Amendment challenge to the imposition of an aggregate term-of-years prison sentence for a juvenile nonhomicide offender. The Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   on December 22, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 8} By judgment entry dated December 30, 2016, the Supreme Court reversed our judgment and remanded this case for application of\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   . On October 19, 2017, this court filed a journal entry vacating its previous judgment and reactivating the appeal. Thereafter, this court asked for and received supplemental briefing from the parties on the application of\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   to Watkins' sentence.

Rather, in juvenile sentencing, the spirit of the law as reflected in\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   recognizes that juveniles have lessened moral culpability and are potentially redeemable. Therefore, they must be given a chance to demonstrate the change they have undergone since committing their crimes so that they can potentially reenter society with enough time left for a meaningful life outside of prison.\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 84.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Watkins' Sentence and His Eligibility for Judicial Release\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 24} In the case at bar, Watkins was 18 years old at the time of his sentencing. Upon completion of his full 67-year sentence, Watkins would be 85 years old. Because Watkins' aggregate sentence exceeds his life expectancy, the constitutionality of his sentence under the Eighth Amendment turns on whether he has a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate maturity and rehabilitation prior to the completion of his sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Only nine years of Watkins' aggregate 67-year sentence (the three (three-year) firearm specifications) are mandatory. Thus, 58 years of the aggregate sentence are non-mandatory. Because the aggregate non-mandatory prison term is more than 10 years, Watkins will be eligible for judicial release the later of the following: (1) completion of one-half of the stated prison term, i.e., 33 and one-half years, or (2) completion of the 9-year mandatory sentence plus 5 years, i.e., 14 years. R.C. 2929.20(C)(5). Because 33 and one-half years is longer than 14 years, Watkins will be eligible for judicial release after serving 33 and one-half years of his sentence. Watkins was born November 23, 1994, and he was sentenced on January 11, 2013. Factoring in jail-time credit of 485 days, Watkins will be 50 years old when he is eligible for judicial release. Therefore, the precise question before us on remand is whether Watkins' opportunity for judicial release at age 50 complies with the Eighth Amendment as interpreted by\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   . Stated another way, does the potential for judicial release at age 50 give Watkins a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate maturity and rehabilitation so that he can reenter society with enough time left for a meaningful life outside of prison? We conclude that it does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 26}\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   implicitly recognized that judicial release is a sufficient procedural mechanism for giving a juvenile offender the opportunity to demonstrate sufficient maturity and rehabilitation to reenter society. Although\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   found that the juvenile sentence at issue therein unconstitutional because the defendant would not become eligible for judicial release until he was 92 years old,\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   assumed the efficacy of the judicial release mechanism as a means for demonstrating maturity and rehabilitation. In addition, Justice Lanzinger's concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   explicitly endorsed judicial release as a sufficient mechanism to comply with\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 141-44 (Lanzinger concurring). Likewise, the Sixth Circuit found that Ohio's judicial release procedures complied with\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Goins v. Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=556%20Fed.%20Appx.%20434\">\n    556 Fed.Appx. 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 439-40 (6th Cir.2014). Watkins does not argue otherwise. We further note that the criteria for granting judicial release includes factors that assess a defendant's maturity, rehabilitation, and ability to safely reenter society.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2929.20(J).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 27} The problem in\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   was not with the judicial release mechanism, but with the timing of the juvenile defendant's eligibility for judicial release. Because the juvenile defendant would be 92 years old before he was eligible for judicial release,\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   found the sentence violative of the Eighth Amendment. Based upon the principles articulated in\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   found the sentence unconstitutional essentially because the opportunity to demonstrate maturity and rehabilitation at age 92, long after the expiration of the defendant's normal life expectancy, was not a realistic opportunity to reenter society when it would be meaningful.\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63-64. Watkins argues that his sentence, which does not afford him the opportunity to demonstrate maturity and rehabilitation until age 50, is also violative of the Eighth Amendment. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Watkins will be eligible for judicial release long before the end of his life expectancy. Unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   who was afforded only the \"prospect of geriatric release,\" Watkins has the opportunity to demonstrate maturity and rehabilitation at an age when most people are still in good health and in their prime working years. We are well aware of the significant challenges that confront any defendant who reenters society after many years of incarceration. Nevertheless, the possibility for judicial release at age 50 grants Watkins the opportunity to reenter society with enough time left for a meaningful and productive life outside prison. To conclude otherwise would suggest there is not enough time left after a person reaches age 50 for life to be meaningful and productive. This is a proposition we cannot accept.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Neither Watkins nor the state have cited any Ohio authority that has directly addressed the age at which the state must provide a juvenile defendant facing a functional life sentence for nonhomicide offenses the opportunity to demonstrate maturity and rehabilitation. However, the Second District Court of Appeals has indicated that eligibility for parole at age 58 or 59 for a juvenile convicted of murder is not violative of the Eighth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Likewise, in\n   <em>\n    People v.

App. 2013), the court held that juvenile defendant's aggregate 84-year sentence for nonhomicide offenses did not violate the Eighth Amendment because the defendant has \"a meaningful opportunity for release\" at age 57.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12564759\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/410/467/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12564759\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/410/467/\">\n    at 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 31} In contrast, when juvenile offenders face long sentences for nonhomicide offenses without the opportunity for release until they are in their mid-sixties or beyond, courts have found such sentences in conflict with the principles set forth in\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    People v.

The length of the sentence that juveniles must serve before becoming parole eligible ranges between 15 and 40 years-depending on the state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Contreras\n   </em>\n   at 370,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514241\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/229/249/\">\n    229 Cal.Rptr.3d 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514241\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/229/249/\">\n    411 P.3d 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (listing various state legislation). Therefore, depending on the state, a juvenile offender would be anywhere between their early 30s to near 60 before they would have an opportunity to demonstrate maturity and rehabilitation. Precisely when a juvenile offender facing a long term-of-years prison sentence should be granted the opportunity for release is a legitimate policy issue subject to fair debate. However, our role is not to resolve a policy debate. The issue before us is the constitutionality of Watkins' sentence. The number of years a juvenile offender ultimately serves is not the primary concern in the Eighth Amendment analysis. What is paramount is that the juvenile offender must have an opportunity to seek release while it is still meaningful.\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47. Because Watkins will have the opportunity for judicial release at age 50, his sentence does not violate the Eighth Amendment as interpreted by\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, we overrule Watkins' second assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 33} In his first assignment of error, Watkins argues the trial court erred when it denied his presentence motion to withdraw his guilty plea.\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   did not address a presentence motion to withdraw a guilty plea. Therefore,\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   has no application to Watkins' first assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   For the reasons previously set forth in our first decision, we again overrule this assignment of error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Watkins\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. No. 13AP-133,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013-Ohio-5544\">\n    2013-Ohio-5544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 9-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Having overruled Watkins' two assignments of error, we affirm the judgments of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   TYACK and HORTON, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
