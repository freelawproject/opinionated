A Revere police officer testified with specificity about the victim's report of the December 2, 2017 incident, describing how the defendant \"demanded\" that the victim exit her friend's vehicle and opened her door and \"took her cellphone out of her hands\" when she refused. The officer further testified that the defendant attempted to \"physically remove\" the victim from her friend's vehicle after the victim took the defendant's phone to prevent him from leaving the scene. Finally, the officer testified that when the victim entered the defendant's vehicle to retrieve her phone, the defendant \"placed the vehicle into motion, partially dragging [the victim] who was still partially outside the vehicle.\" The victim also gave consistent accounts of this incident in her restraining order affidavit, and during her restraining order hearing, buttressing the judge's conclusion that the hearsay testimony was \"internally consistent.\" See\n   <em>\n    Patton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270285\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/458/119/#p133\">\n    458 Mass. at 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (hearsay trustworthy and reliable where victim \"repeated the detail[s] several times with consistency\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The record also substantiates the judge's finding that the hearsay testimony was provided under circumstances that support the veracity of the source.

The defendant's second probation violation notice specifies that the Revere Police Department charged the defendant with assault and battery, larceny over $250, and violating an abuse prevention order. The judge specified orally and in writing that the defendant violated his probation by committing the offenses alleged in the criminal complaint filed by the Revere Police Department. Consequently, the defendant had notice of the basis of his probation violation.

The Revere police officer who testified at the probation revocation hearing incorporated text messages between the victim and the defendant in the police report accompanying the defendant's criminal complaint for that incident. The defendant also conceded on cross-examination that he likely sent the victim several threatening messages, including one where he threatened to \"come to [the victim's] location and drag [her] out.\" The judge was entitled to consider this \"reliable evidence of misconduct not charged as a ground of probation violation\" to the extent that it supported the victim's account of the events of December 2, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Herrera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1011138\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/52/294/#p295\">\n    52 Mass.
