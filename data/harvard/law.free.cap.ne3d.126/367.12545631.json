Appellee did not file an appellee's brief. For the following reasons, we reverse in part and affirm in part the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The following are the pertinent facts and procedural history. Appellant and appellee were married on November 4, 2003 in New Delhi, India, and moved to the United States shortly thereafter. The parties have two minor children born as issue of the marriage. The parties separated on or about October 19, 2015, after a domestic disturbance which resulted in appellee being found guilty of violating R.C. 2919.25(A), domestic violence, and R.C. 2903.13(A), assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellant filed a complaint for divorce on November 9, 2015. Appellee filed his answer and counterclaim on December 18, 2015. On December 20, 2016, the parties entered into a stipulated agreement as to separate property that was read into the record at trial and admitted as a joint exhibit. (Joint Ex. 2.) Specifically, appellee stipulated that \"[appellee] hereby expressly agrees that the sum of $500,000.00, plus the passive income derived from the same, constitutes a gift to [appellant] and shall be awarded to [appellant] as her separate property pursuant to R.C. \u00a7 3105.171(A)(6)(a)(vii).\" (Joint Ex. 2 at \u00b6 4.) In addition, the parties agreed that separate non-marital funds from the gift totaling $16,976.34 would be transferred to appellant. Both parties concede that appellee transferred to appellant the cash sum of $500,000 days before appellant filed for divorce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} This matter was tried before the trial court on January 17, February 22, 23, 27, and March 2 and 3, 2017. The evidence showed that, at the time of the trial in the case, appellee was employed as a software engineer with JP Morgan Chase, where he had been employed for the past 10 years. Appellee has been employed in the same field for approximately 23 years and was earning $96,500 at the time of trial. Prior to the parties' marriage, he had obtained a bachelor of arts degree in commerce from a school in India.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Prior to the parties' marriage, appellant had obtained a degree of arts in psychology from a school in India. At the start of this trial, appellant was employed as a part-time assistant with two different employers: Dublin Latchkey (since November 2016) and The Barrington School (since January 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The trial court was troubled by appellant's handling of her separate property assets. Appellant testified that she earned a mere $675 in interest income in 2016 on accounts whose balances totaled in excess of $500,000. She also readily admits that Indian banks routinely pay 8 percent interest per year and that she presently earns 9.25 percent interest per year on her existing Axis Bank Fixed Deposit account. The trial court asked her \"[w]hy haven't you moved [her accounts] to something that is going to make more money?\" (Jan. 17, 2017 Tr. Vol. II at 222.) Appellant responded, \"I didn't want to move it while I was in trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Appellant did say that after the divorce she would discuss her finances with a professional. (Tr. Vol. II at 223.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On March 29, 2017, the trial court issued its \"Judgment Entry-Decree of Divorce\" (hereinafter \"Divorce Decree\"). As relevant to this appeal, in the Divorce Decree the trial court granted both parties an \"absolute divorce\" from each other.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In addition, the parties stipulated that appellant's earned income was $16,848. (Divorce Decree at 13.) The trial court also found\n   that appellant voluntarily elected to forego pursuing meaningful, full-time employment, and she has never worked full time during the course of the parties' marriage. As such, the trial court found that appellant is voluntarily underemployed and electing not to work on a full-time basis although she is entirely capable of doing so. Hence, her income would be imputed at a figure higher than her stipulated current annual earnings of $16,848. (Divorce Decree at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The trial court, in attempting to apply R.C. 1343.03 and 5703.47 found that \"the annual interest rate for tax year 2017 tax obligations will be 6% annually plus 3% = 9%.\" (Divorce Decree at 18.) As such, the trial court imputed interest income at 9 percent on appellant's accounts, which totaled $515,353, for an interest income total of $46,382.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Furthermore, the trial court found that no impediments existed to appellant working full-time. (Divorce Decree at 22.) Therefore, the trial court imputed full-time employment to appellant at the same rate of pay she was receiving as a part-time employee, which increased her yearly income from the stipulated amount of $16,848 to $22,880. (Divorce Decree at 18.) As such, appellant was deemed to an imputed income amount of $69,262. Again, the court found that appellee's income was $96,500 per annum.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The trial court utilized these income amounts in deciding that appellee was to pay child support in the amount of $954 per month, and that he would maintain primary health insurance coverage for the children. (Divorce Decree at 10-11.) In addition, pursuant to R.C. 3119.01, the parties would equally pay the first $100 of the reasonable and ordinary uninsured and unreimbursed medical expenses for the minor children, and any extraordinary medical expenses (defined as those exceeding the first $100) including co-payments and/or deductibles would be divided between the parties with appellant paying 42 percent and appellee paying 58 percent of such expenses. (Divorce Decree at 11.) The trial court also found that appellant was not entitled to spousal support. (Divorce Decree at 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In general, appellant argues that the trial court erred as to the parties' respective income/earning capacity in calculating appellee's child support obligation, and additionally in finding that spousal support was not warranted. As a result of the improper calculation of the parties' income, appellant submits that the trial court's calculation as to support was erroneous and an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A. ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR ONE-VOLUNTARILY UNDEREMPLOYED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In assignment of error one, appellant submits that the trial court committed error and an abuse of discretion in concluding that appellant was voluntarily underemployed because: (1) the parties stipulated to appellant's earning capacity, and (2) competent and credible evidence was not presented by appellee to support a finding that appellant was voluntarily underemployed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Pursuant to R.C. 3119.01(C), income for child support purposes is defined to include the sum of the parent's gross income and \"any potential income of the parent.\" R.C. 3119.01(C)(5)(b). Potential income includes imputed income that the court determines the parent would have earned if fully employed based upon the criteria articulated in R.C. 3119.01(C)(11)(a)(i) through (x). Even if defendant were \"totally unable to earn any real or potential income\" as found by the trial court, the statutory duty of support attaches to available assets pursuant to R.C. 3103.03 and 3113.215(A) and (B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

First, we note that the trial court asked appellee if he was stipulating to appellant's income\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   earning capacity. At this opening stage of the trial, the trial court did not clarify whether the stipulation was to income and/or earning capacity. However, the trial court interpreted the stipulation as applying to income only. Later in the trial, the trial court allowed appellee, over appellant's objection, to testify as to his estimation of appellant's actual income and earning capacity. (Tr. Vol. III at 459-61, 465.) The trial court specifically found that the parties did not stipulate as to earning ability. (Tr. Vol. III at 460.) Our review shows that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that appellee's stipulation applied only to income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Appellant further argues that competent and credible evidence was not presented by appellee to support a finding that appellant was voluntarily underemployed. Appellant claims that because that the trial court did not properly follow the requirements of R.C. 3119.01, it erred and abused its discretion in determining appellant's income for purposes of calculating support obligations. Appellant cites to our cases of\n   <em>\n    Chapman\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Apps\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 23} However,\n   <em>\n    Chapman\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Apps\n   </em>\n   are clearly distinguishable from the present action.

Specifically, the trial court addressed the factors and found that appellee failed to introduce any testimony or evidence that related to\n   R.C. 3119.01(C)(11)(a)(iv), (v) and (ix). (Divorce Decree at 14-15.) The trial court found R.C. 3119.01(C)(11)(a)(i), (iii), (vii), and (viii), inapplicable and/or irrelevant to the case at bar. (Divorce Decree at 15.) In addition, the trial court found R.C. 3119.01(C)(11)(a)(ii) -level of education, (vi)-special skills and training, and (x)-any other relevant factor, were applicable and/or relevant to this particular case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The trial court then proceeded to discuss appellant's education and training and her handling of her separate property assets.

Hence, her income would be imputed at a figure higher than her stipulated current annual earnings. Based on our review of the record, including the trial transcript and the evidence, as well as noting that the trial judge, as trier of fact, was in the best position to determine the credibility of the witnesses, as well as the weight to be afforded to the evidence, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that appellant was voluntarily underemployed.

ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR TWO-IMPUTED INCOME\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 26} In assignment of error two, appellant argues that the trial court's imputation of employment income to appellant in the amount of $22,880 constitutes an abuse of discretion, and that the imputation of 9 percent per annum to appellant's separate property assets was unreasonable and unsupported by the facts of this case and relevant statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 27} In the present case, at the time of the trial, appellant was employed for approximately 30 hours per week as a part-time assistant with two different employers. Appellant testified she would be able to obtain another position, but it would likely be a similar position. (Divorce Decree at 21.) The court then extrapolated her current pay rate in her part-time positions to full-time and found that \"Plaintiff's income from the $10 to 12 per hour part-time jobs she typically works annualize to roughly $22,880 per annum.\" (Divorce Decree at 18.) As such, although the trial court felt that appellant was qualified for higher paying jobs, the trial court imputed income at appellant's current rate of pay from the stipulated income amount of $16,848 to $22,880, i.e., the trial court imputed approximately $6,000 in additional income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Appellant argues that Ohio courts have previously held that it is improper to calculate imputed earnings by merely extrapolating an hourly wage over a full-time basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marek\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22, citing\n   <em>\n    Arnott v.

A review of these Ninth District Court of Appeals cases shows that they are distinguishable from the present case. In\n   <em>\n    Marek\n   </em>\n   , the court stated that \"[w]e find such an approach especially troublesome in this case, where the hourly wage is based on the defendant's rough guess, elicited by his own attorney and challenged by the opposing attorney; the same testimony explains that the work season is only seven months; and\n   the defendant expressly testifies that such a wage would not apply to him.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22. Likewise in\n   <em>\n    Arnott\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15, the court found that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   The record, however, does not support Wife's assertion that the trial court should have extrapolated Husband's fifty-five dollar hourly rate over a full time basis to calculate his annual income. Husband testified that fifty-five dollars was his hourly rate, but did not testify that he earned this rate on a full-time (i.e., forty hours per week) basis. Rather, Husband testified that the plumbing business was sometimes busy and sometimes slow, and generally was busier during the summer. Husband also testified that some jobs were billed on a flat fee, rather than an hourly, basis. Husband estimated that his net receipts from his plumbing employment in 2000 would be between $ 12,500 and $ 12,700. Husband also testified that his gross receipts from his plumbing business in 1999 were $ 28,466, and he anticipated that his gross receipts in 2000 would be approximately twenty-five percent higher. In addition, Husband had back surgery immediately before the trial, which he testified would incapacitate him for eight to ten weeks. In light of all the foregoing, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to impute a full time wage of fifty-five dollars per hour for purposes of calculating Husband's child support obligation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Our review of the trial court's imputation of income of approximately $6,000 does not raise the same issues of unreliability that are raised in\n   <em>\n    Marek\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Arnott\n   </em>\n   . We do not find that the trial court abused its discretion in imputing full-time employment at the same pay rate to appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Appellant argues that her separate property did not qualify as \"nonincome-producing assets,\" and therefore, it was an improper abuse of discretion for the trial court to impute additional interest income to them. Appellant claims that while R.C. 3119.01(C)(11) permits the imputation of employment income to a parent that is not fully employed and/or an imputation of income to nonincome-producing assets, it does not permit the imputation of income to income-producing assets.

In\n   <em>\n    Rapp\n   </em>\n   , the trial court did not predicate its child support order on either the interest income appellant gained from the IRA or on a contribution he made to the IRA. In fact, during the two-year period he has maintained the IRA, appellant did not contribute any additional money to the retirement account. Rather, the court focused exclusively on an IRA that was created two years before the motion to decrease child support was filed. As such, the actual holding in\n   <em>\n    Rapp\n   </em>\n   was that an \"IRA is an asset that produces income and thus does not come within the definition of\n   a 'nonincome-producing asset.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 89,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=623%20N.E.2d%20624\">\n    623 N.E.2d 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 32} In the present case, it is not disputed by the parties that the computation of the child support order is governed by R.C. 3119.01. The definition of \"income\" as set forth in R.C. 3119.01 is intended to be both broad and flexible.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

Such an expansive definition is necessary to ensure that the best interest of children, the intended beneficiaries of child support awards, are protected. For the purpose of calculating a child support obligation, \"income\" is defined by R.C. 3119.01(C)(5) in the following manner:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   \"Income\" means either of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   (a) For a parent who is employed to full capacity, the gross income of the parent;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   (b) For a parent who is unemployed or underemployed, the sum of the gross income of the parent and any potential income of the parent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   (7) \"Gross income\" means, except as excluded in division (C)(7) of this section, the total of all earned and unearned income from all sources during a calendar year, whether or not the income is taxable, and includes income from salaries, wages, overtime pay, and bonuses to the extent described in division (D) of section 3119.05 of the Revised Code ; commissions; royalties; tips; rents; dividends; severance pay; pensions;\n   <em>\n    interest\n   </em>\n   ; trust income; annuities; social security benefits, including retirement, disability, and survivor benefits that are not means-tested; workers' compensation benefits; unemployment insurance benefits; disability insurance benefits; benefits that are not means-tested and that are received by and in the possession of the veteran who is the beneficiary for any service-connected disability under a program or law administered by the United States department of veterans' affairs or veterans' administration; spousal support actually received; and all other sources of income. \"Gross income\" includes income of members of any branch of the United States armed services or national guard, including, amounts representing base pay, basic allowance for quarters, basic allowance for subsistence, supplemental subsistence allowance, cost of living adjustment, specialty pay, variable housing allowance, and pay for training or other types of required drills; self-generated income; and\n   <em>\n    potential cash flow\n   </em>\n   from any source.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 33} The trial court found that appellant was underemployed and imputed potential income from interest associated with her separate property accounts. R.C. 3119.01(17)(b), reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Potential income means both of the following for a parent who the court pursuant to a court support order, or a child support enforcement agency pursuant to an administrative child support order, determines is voluntarily unemployed or voluntarily underemployed:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   (b) imputed income from any non-income-producing assets of a parent, as determined from the local passbook savings rate or another appropriate rate as determined by the court or agency, not to exceed the rate of interest specified in division (A) of section 1343.03 of the Revised Code, if the income is significant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 34} In the present case, the record shows that, in 2016, appellant earned only $675 in interest on accounts with assets of $515,353. As such, we take judicial notice that appellant's rate of return on her separate\n   property interests was only 13/100 of one percent, or stated another way, her interest rate was .0013 percent. In one account with Wells Fargo, appellant only earned $43.46 in interest on a balance of $423,378.79. (Tr. Vol. II at 218.) The trial court commented that \"[t]o earn $43 in a year off of $423,000 is ridiculous.\" (Tr. Vol. II at 222.) Appellant stated that she did not want to transfer the money into higher interest bearing accounts while she was involved in the divorce proceeding.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=600%20N.E.2d%20739\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Based on the above, we do not find that the trial court abused its discretion in imputing income to appellant under R.C. 3119.01(17)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Even if it was error to conclude that appellant's separate property accounts were nonincome producing, such error would be harmless. Although the trial court used the word \"imputed\" when it attributed interest income to appellant's separate property accounts, the record indicates that the trial court was treating the interest income as \"potential cash flow\" under R.C. 3119.01(C)(7), and not as \"potential income\" due to voluntary underemployment; thus, it was not necessary to find that appellant was unemployed or underemployed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smart v.

The court utilized the \"potential cash flow\" provision in the statute in order to prevent the obligor from avoiding his current child support obligations by shifting potential present income to some future time, after the children were emancipated.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smart\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23.

The court then applies the 9 percent rate to appellant's separate property assets of $515,353, and imputes interest income in the amount of $46,382. The trial court adds this amount to the annual income of $22,880 and arrives at an income imputation of $69,262. We find the tax rate of 9 percent to be in error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Our review shows that the October 2016 federal short-term interest rate was .66 percent, i.e., 0.66 percent.

We agree. It is clear that the trial court erroneously imputed 9 percent (instead of 4 percent) of appellant's separate property assets as income. The calculations regarding child support and health insurance expenses lack a rational basis and are therefore in error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Appellant also argues that the trial court erred and abused its discretion when it calculated child support and health insurance expenses based only on appellee's base salary. For purposes of child support, a parent's gross income is defined as \"the total of all earned and unearned income from all sources during a calendar year, whether or not the income is taxable, and includes income from salaries, wages, overtime pay, and bonuses * * * royalties; tips; rents; dividends; * * * interest; * * * and all other sources of income.\" R.C. 3119.01(C)(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 45} We note that appellee was earning approximately $96,500 in base salary at the time of trial. (Tr. Vol. I at 34-35.) In the child support computation summary\n   worksheet, the parties' percentage of total income to total income, based solely on appellee's income of $96,500 and appellant's income of $69,262, was appellee at approximately 58 percent and appellant at approximately 42 percent. (Divorce Decree, Attachment B.) These percentages were used in the trial court's allocation of uncovered medical expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Appellee testified that he could earn bonuses at JP Morgan Chase and previously earned a bonus in the amount of $1,500. (Divorce Decree at 20.) Appellee also testified to receiving extensive benefits from his employer totaling $31,562 in comprehensive benefits, including a 401(k) match, employee sponsored life insurance, contributions to a pension, and stock options.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%204295707\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 47} The trial court indicated that \"the values of any such benefits, which have been quantified through testimony and evidence during the trial, are duly captured * * * and included in the Child Support Computation Summary Worksheet included as Attachment B.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%204295707\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, our review of the worksheet attached shows that the calculations only reference appellee's base salary of $96,500 and fail to address these benefits. (Divorce Decree, Attachment B.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Based on the above, we find that the trial court erred in imputing an erroneous amount of interest to appellant, and in failing to take into account appellee's gross income, including all earned and unearned income from all sources during a calendar year, whether or not the income is taxable, and including income from salaries, wages, overtime pay, bonuses, interest, and all other sources of income pursuant to R.C. 3119.01(C)(7). Therefore, appellant's third assignment of error is sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    D. ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR FOUR-SPOUSAL SUPPORT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 49} In assignment of error four, appellant argues that the trial court erred and abused its discretion when it determined that spousal support is not warranted or supported by the evidence. The appellant submits that it was error and an abuse of discretion for the trial court to impute income, i.e, the 9 percent interest income. Having found that the application of a 9 percent interest rate to appellant's separate private asset was error, we agree with appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 50} This court has previously found that the incorrect imputation of income to a party justifies remand on the issue of spousal support.\n   <em>\n    Chapman\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22. In\n   <em>\n    Meeks\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43, the trial court had used the same income figure that it had imputed to the obligor for child support when it calculated his spousal support obligation. This court concluded in\n   <em>\n    Meeks\n   </em>\n   that the amount of income imputed to the obligor was an abuse of discretion for purposes of calculating child support, this court also concluded that it was error to use that amount of income in calculating spousal support pursuant to R.C. 3105.18(C)(1)(a).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%204295707\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 51} Appellant also submits that the trial court failed to appropriately consider all of the statutory factors in R.C. 3105.18 when determining that spousal support was not warranted. \"In determining whether to award spousal support, a trial court must consider the factors enumerated in R.C. 3105.18(C). As with its property division, a trial court need not itemize and comment upon each factor; however, there must [be] a clear indication in the court's decision that the factors were considered.\"\n   <em>\n    Hightower v.

ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR FIVE-NON-MARITAL SEPARATE PROPERTY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   {\u00b6 54} Appellant alleges that the trial court erred and abused its discretion when it disregarded the parties' stipulation that $16,976.34 of funds held in the parties' bank accounts were appellant's non-marital separate property and would be transferred to her, and included the same funds in its division of marital assets. (Stipulated Agreement as to Separate Property at \u00b6 8.) The stipulated agreement as to separate property was read into the record and accepted into evidence as joint exhibit 2. This issue is not mentioned in the trial court's Divorce Decree, as such, appellant's fifth assignment of error is sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Having sustained appellant's second, third, fourth and fifth assignments of error, this action is remanded to the trial court with instructions to (1) impute interest income to appellant based on the correct interest rate, i.e., 4 percent, and then recalculate and reconsider the trial court's findings as to (2) child support and healthcare responsibilities pursuant to R.C. 3119.01, (3) spousal support pursuant to R.C. 3105.18, and (4) per assignment of error five, reconsider and implement paragraph 8 of the parties' stipulated agreement as to separate property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. DISPOSITION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   {\u00b6 56} For the foregoing reasons, appellant's first assignment of error is overruled.
