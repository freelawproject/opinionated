Oakes against Edward F. de Lancey to recover an amount alleged by plaintiff to have been overpaid by him to defendant on the purchase of a tract of land. The land was purchased as containing 22.57 acres at the price of $3,125 per acre. Plaintiff.alleged that it contained only 18.734, by reason of the fact that a portion of the premises were covered by the waters of Long Island sound. Plaintiff and defendant agreed that plaintiff should pay the whole purchase money, execute a warranty deed for the premises, describing the same according to defendant\u2019s contention, and that plaintiff should institute the suit to recover as for a deficiency in the amount of land contracted to be purchased. The deed so made described the boundary on the water front as follows: \u201cThence running along said division line north, 42 degrees and 47 minutes east, about'865 feet, to a point on the shore of Long Island sound; thence running along said shore and sound as the same bend and turn easterly; and thence southerly to their intersection with the center line of De Lancey avenue, aforesaid.\u201d From a judgment for defendant, plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b579-11\">Argued before Freedman, P.

If it be assumed that the property described in Exhibit 1, which is attached to the complaint, is that which the complaint states will be thereinafter described, it is \u201c property at De Lancey\u2019s Neck, in the town of Mamaroneck, Westchester county, N. Y., known as \u2018 Vergemere,\u2019 of about 22 57/100 acres.\u201d This assumption will, for present purposes, be made. The agreement which forms the basis of this action, and which is set forth in the complaint, provides that the plaintiff should recover the excess of the money paid over that which should have been paid for the actual contents in acres of the said premises at the rate of $3,125 per acre. Therefore, in order to be entitled to succeed in his action, the plaintiff must have shown that the actual contents of the property at De Lancey\u2019s Neck, etc., \u201cknown as \u2018 Vergemere,\u2019 of about 22 57/100 acres,\u201d was less than the stated number of acres. Of what this property consisted does not appear, except as it is to be gathered from the plaintiff\u2019s testimony that he \u201creceived a deed for certain premises known as \u2018Vergemere,\u2019 in Mamaroneck,\u201d etc. The premises described in the deed must, therefore, be taken as the premises which the plaintiff purchased; and whether these premises consist of less than 22.57 acres is thus the pivotal point in the case. No question of title is raised, nor is any question as to the character of the sale presented. The question is, how many acres does the deed convey? For the reasons assigned by the learned judge at special term we believe that the descriptive clause in the deed covered the premises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>to low,-water mark. <em>Storer </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>6 Mass. 435, does not seem to sustain the plaintiff\u2019s way of reasoning. The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"A9h\">All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
