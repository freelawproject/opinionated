Tiie law applicable to the facts presented by the evidence was correctly stated at the trial by the learned judge who presided. The charge was full and fair, and afforded all needed protection to the rights of the parties. The motion for a new trial was properly denied. Delendants\u2019 exceptions are overruled, and judgment is ordered for the plaintiff upon the verdict, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
