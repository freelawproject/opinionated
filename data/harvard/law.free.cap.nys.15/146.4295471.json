At the trial the defendant offered no proof, and the case was summed up and submitted to the jury upon the evidence adduced by the plaintiff. Upon the evidence the jury had a right to find that the injuries were sustained in consequence of a defect in the brake with which the plaintiff had to work, and that the defect might have been discovered by the exercise of ordinary care and diligence on the part of the defendant. This was sufficient to call for a determination by the jury of the question of defendant\u2019s negligence. Upon the question of plaintiff\u2019s alleged contributory negligence, the case, upon the facts presented, was also one for the jury. The various motions to dismiss the complaint were therefore properly denied, and the issues were properly submitted to the jury. Hone of the exceptions taken to the admission of evidence presents, under all the circumstances, ground for reversal; nor was there any error in the charge, or the refusals to charge otherwise. Upon the whole, substantial justice seems to have been done. The judgment and order should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
