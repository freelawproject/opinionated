The offer for judgment was not served 10 days before the trial, and the plaintiff was not, therefore, forced to an election, as he was entitled to 10 days within which to accept the offer. The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and \u25a0disbursements. All concur..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
