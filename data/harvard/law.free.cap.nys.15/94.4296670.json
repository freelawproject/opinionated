The action was brought December 16, 1887, to recover $5,000 damages by reason of defendant\u2019s alleged negligence in the.care and maintenance of a tenement-house owned by him. The original answer was a general denial. A supplemental answer by leave of court was served January 24, 1889, setting up as a defense an accord and satisfaction of the cause of action between the parties for $200 paid plaintiff. Reply denied the alleged accord and satisfaction, and alleged same was procured by defendant\u2019s fraud and deceit, and the plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s lien was also set up therein. The action was first tried before Mr. Justice Edward Browne, who submitted only the issues of negligence, and as to the existence of plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s lien,, .and notice thereof to defendant, and resulted in a verdict and judgment for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>plaintiff for $780.44. This judgment was reversed at general term, on the ground plaintiff\u2019s attorney had no lien for a percentage in action for negligence, even with notice. The action came on for a second trial on December \u20228, 1890. The justice presiding submitted the issues of negligence and of fraud in obtaining the release to jury, but refused to submit the issue as\u2019to the attorney\u2019s lien by reason of the former decision of the general term of this court. The jury, under court\u2019s charge, having rendered a verdict for defendant, the case comes before this court for review, upon plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the judgment, upon certain exceptions to court\u2019s rulings at trial excluding evidence, and exceptions to court\u2019s charge and refusal to charge plaintiff\u2019s requests, and also upon plaintiff\u2019s appeal from order denying motion to set .aside verdict and grant a new trial. The question in regard to the attorney\u2019s lien for services or interest has been passed upon by this court at general term, and was properly excluded. See <em>Oliwill </em>v. <em>Verdenhalven, </em>7 N. Y. Supp. 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The important question, however, to be determined, was whether the receipt, (defendant\u2019s Exhibit No. 1,) which reads as follows: \u201cBought of D. Verdenhalven, Grocer and Wine Dealer, Lenox Ave., cor. 124th Str. Received from D. Verdenhalven the'sum of two hundred dollars, in full of all demands to date, including the charges of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney in the suit of Mary Oliwill against D. Verdenhalven, which charges are to be paid by me. Hew York, Jan. 14, \u201989. Mart Oliwill,\u201d\u2014was obtained by fraud and deceit, and without the knowledge or assent of the plaintiff as to its contents; this particularly when the paper was prepared by the defendant\u2019s son, who was necessarily interested in securing his father from litigation, and perhaps heavy damages. This was the contention of the plaintiff. The testimony \u2022of the plaintiff is: <em>\u201cQuestion. The Court. </em>Did you read that paper before you signed it? <em>Answer. </em>Ho, sir; I could not read it. It was read to me, but I did not understand it, and I said to defendant that I didn\u2019t know what it meant. I went over to the desk, and wrote my name to a paper. The defendant did not read to me, nor did any one else for him read to me, that I was to pay my lawyer out of the $200. He said he would pay my lawyer. <em>Q. </em>Can you read or write? <em>A. </em>Ho, sir; but defendant read that paper to me that \u00cd did n\"ot understand it, and I could not read the handwriting.\u201d We think the trial judge erred in excluding the following questions: <em>\u201cQuestion. </em>In that conversation did you make any such agreement as in this receipt? (Defendant\u2019s counsel objects. Objection sustained. Plaintiff excepts.) <em>Q. </em>In that conversation was anything said by you that for $200 you would settle your claim against him, and pay your lawyer\u2019s fees and charges? (Defendant\u2019s counsel objects. Objection sustained. Plaintiff excepts.) <em>Q. </em>Did he read anything to you in connection with this instrument which stated that any part of that $200 to be paid by you should be paid by you to your counsel? (Defendant\u2019s counsel objects. Objection sustained. Plaintiff excepts.) <em>Q. </em>Then you never did agree to take $200 on settlement of this claim, and pay your counsel fees? (Defendant\u2019s counsel objects. Objection sustained. Plaintiff excepts.) <em>Q. </em>Did you have any conversation of that kind with defendant by which you agreed to take $200 in accord and satisfaction of your claim against the defendant, and pay your counsel fees? (Defendant\u2019s counsel objects. Objection sustained. Plaintiff excepts.) <em>Answer. </em>When the defendant told me that he would pay, in addition to the $200, a thousand dollars or more to my counsel, or whatever sum his fees might be, I believed him. <em>Q. </em>Did you send &gt;our husband to the defendant\u2019s next day with that $150? (Defendant\u2019s counsel objects. Sustained. Plaintiff excepts.)\u201d And also the following of Patrick Oliwill: <em>\u201cQuestion. </em>Was Mr. Mackellar present at the time of the talk was had between you, your wife, and the defendant, as to the $200 payment and the payment of the lawyer\u2019s fees? (Defendant\u2019s counsel objects. Objection sustained. Plaintiff excepts.) <em>Q. </em>Did Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Mackellar at any time read this receipt which you heard read here to-day to you, or to your wife? (Defendant\u2019s counsel objects. Objection sustained. Plaintiff excepts.)\u201d The plaintiff says that the understanding was that the defendant was to pay her lawyer his compensation, even if it amounted to $1,U00, and that she never signed a receipt agreeing to pay her lawyer\u2019s compensation. These questions, therefore, had reference to tile most important issue in the case; since, if there had been no fraud or mistake in the making and signing of defendant\u2019s Exhibit 1, the plaintiff would have no standing in court. A party who, upon the receipt of a sum of money, supposing he is simply receipting therefor, signs without reading it a receipt in full of all accounts, is not concluded thereby from recovering any other sum due him. <em>Boardman </em>v. <em>Gaillard, </em>60 N. Y. 615. If'defendant\u2019s Exhibit 1 is claimed to be an accord and satisfaction, then these questions, and the answers to them, were important for the jury to hear.' Andrews, J., in <em>Kromer </em>v. <em>Heim, </em>75 N. Y. 576, says: \u201c * Accord,\u2019 says Sir William Blackstone, \u2018 is a satisfaction agreed upon between the party injuring and the party injured, which, when performed, is a bar to all actions upon this account.\u2019\u201d 3 Bl. Comm. 15. An accord executory without performance accepted is no bar, and tender of performance is insufficient. Bac. Abr. tit. \u201cAccord and Satisfaction, \u201d C. So, also, accord, with part execution, cannot be pleaded in satisfaction. The accord must be completely executed, to sustain a plea of accord and satisfaction. Id. A; <em>Cock </em>v. <em>Honychurch, </em>T. Raym. 203; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>1 Ld. Raym. 122; <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Bruce, </em>2 H. Bl. 317. In <em>Peytoe's Case, </em>9 Coke, 79, it is said; \u201cAnd every accord ought to be full, perfect, and complete; for, if divers things are to be done and performed by the accord, the performance of part is not sufficient, but all ought to be performed.\u201d Fraud invalidates all instruments, both at law and equity. The plaintiff may avoid and overcome the effect of a receipt in full or release by evidence showing it to have been procured by fraud, and this may be by any evidence properly attended with that result. <em>Dambman </em>v. <em>Schulting, </em>4 Hun, 51; <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>McNair, </em>99 N. Y. 180, 1 N. E. Rep. 660. Without commenting on other errors at the trial, we think the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
