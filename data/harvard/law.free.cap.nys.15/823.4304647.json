The notice of trial was served on defendant on the 23d, the day of obtaining the order, noticing the case for trial for the 25th; and on the 24th, the day after service of such notice, the same was returned by defendant, who stated, as his reason for such return, that it was not served in accordance witli the fifth subdivision of section 31151 of the Code, which provides that a notice of trial in this court shall not be for less than five days. The defendant served an amended answer, setting up a new and additional defense, on the morning of the 25th, before the opening of the trial term, whicli he had an absolute right to do, as the service was within three days after the service of his original answer. After the opening of the court on the 25th, the cau.se was called for trial, and the plaintiff allowed to take an inquest, upon which the judgment was entered. The inquest and judgment were irregular, and should have been opened and vacated without imposing any conditions upon the defendant. The court had no authority to shorten the time of notice of trial to two days, in the face of the express provision of the Code that the notice must not be for less than five days, for the defendant was not seeking or receiving a favor. The plaintiff was asking for a preference, which the defendant was simply opposing. Chief Justice Daly, in <em>Leland </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>11 Abb. Pr. (N. S.) 231, held that a judgment entered upon the report of a referee, where a reference and the hearing on one day\u2019s notice liad been ordered, was irregular, as such hearing should have been on not less than two days\u2019 notice; and the general term of this court said in <em>Hunnewell </em>v. <em>Shaffer, </em>(City Ct. N. Y.) 9 N. Y. Supp. 540: \u201cThe court cannot dispense with the statutory notice of trial, except as a condition of granting a iavor.\u201d The notice of trial in this case, even though it liad been regular as to time and service, was defeated and rendered of no avail by the service of the amended answer, changing the issues, within three days after the service of the original answer, and before the cause was reached for trial. Judge Paige says in <em>Washburn </em>v. <em>Herrick, </em>4 How. Pr. 15: \u201cIf the plaintiff notices his cause for trial before the time allowed to the defendant to amend shall have expired, he does so at his peril.\u201d This is approved in <em>Plumb </em>v. <em>Whipples, </em>7 How. Pr. 413, and <em>Clifton </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>27 Hun, 231. Judge Bockhs, referring to these cases in <em>Ostrander </em>v. <em>Conkey, </em>20 Hun, 421, says: \u201c These decisions have controlled the practice'now for over a quarter of a century, * * * and we are of the opinion that these decisions are strictly correct.\u201d Every effort to hasten the trial of an action should be encouraged, but no cause should, against a defendant\u2019s objection, be forced to trial unless a notice of trial, of not less than five days, has been served subsequent to the joining of issue, irrespective of whether issue was joined by the original answer, or by an amended answer whicli changes the issues. So much of the order appealed from as requires defendant to pay $30 costs, and directs that the judgment stand as security, is reversed, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
