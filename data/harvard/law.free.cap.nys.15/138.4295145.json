A number of such investments were made, and on each occasion plaintiff received his share of the profits. On October 5, 1886, the plaintiff advised the defendant to buy 500 shares of the reorganized, trust receipts of the Texas Pacific Railroad Company, stating his reasons for such advice. The defendant agreed, and plaintiff ordered the purchase. He then returned, and informed the defendant of the purchase, and at the time asked him, \u201cWhat will my interest be,\u2014two hundred shares, as before?\u201d to which the defendant replied, \u201cAll right.\u201d The stock was subsequently sold at a considerable profit, but defendant refused to give plaintiff his share; whereupon the plaintiff brought this action, and recovered a judgment of $1,438.63. The defendant\u2019s contention is that there was no consideration for the agreement to give plaintiff the 200 shares, and that the agreement, if made at all, was made after the purchase of the stock. But reliable information as to facts upon which the future price of stock will depend is a sufficient consideration to uphold an agreement or contract in relation to such stock. See <em>White </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>56 How. Pr. 53. The plaintiff had what turned out to be reliable information, which he imparted to the defendant, who acted upon such information, with profitable results to himself. This forms a sufficient consideration. See <em>White </em>v. <em>Drew, supra; </em>3 Pars. Cont. 359. As to the promise to give the plaintiff the 200 shares being made after the purchase of the stock, we see no value in the defendant\u2019s contention; for a past consideration, beneficial to the defendant, to which he afterwards assents, is sufficient to support an action. See <em>Doty </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>14 Johns. 378. The evidence, although conflicting, was sufficient to warrant the submission of the question to the jury, who found in favor of the plaintiff. To the charge no exception was taken, and we find no exception to the admission or exclusion of testimony that raises a question of sufficient importance to require discussion here. The judgment and order appealed from are affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
