In an action by one lot-owner against another for damages for breach of such covenant, no evidence was introduced as to the damage caused by the erection of the tenement-house to the value of the occupation of plaintiff\u2019s property, nor was there any that she wished or had wished to sell same. <em>Held, </em>that it was error to charge that plaintiff was entitled to recover as damages the difference in value of her house as it was affected by the tenement-house, and the value it would have possessed if defendant\u2019s lot had remained vacant.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b345-10\">On motion for reargument.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-11\">Action by Mary Y.

That did not affect the substance of the decision, which intended to affirm that neither equity nor law would give as damages what in reality was not damages. Motion denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
