The execution was levied on a quantity of Indian corn meal, among other things. From a-judgment for plaintiff, entered on the verdict of a jury, and from an order denying a motion for a new trial, made on the minutes of the judgment, defendant appeals. Code Civil Proc. X Y. \u00a7 1390, subd. 4, provides that \u201call necessary meat, fish, flour, and vegetables actually provided for family use\u201d shall be exempt from levy under execution against a householder. 2 Key. St. X Y. (8th Ed.) p. 1423, pt. 1, c. 17, tit. 2, art. 1, \u00a7 3, referred to in the dissenting opinion of Merwin, J., provides that \u201call wheat flour, rye flour, Indian meal, or buckwheat meal, manufactured for exportation in this state, shall be packed in good strong casks, \u201d etc.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b508-16\">Argued before Hardin, P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASKq\">In the course of the trial the court held that the word \u201cflour\u201d did not cover meal, and refused to submit a question in that regard to the jury. Proper exceptions were taken to the rulings and to the refusal. I am inclined to the opinion that an error was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-19\">I think the amount of the verdict is dubious. I favor a reversal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>order and judgment. Judgment and order reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<author id=\"b509-5\">Martin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6u\">I think flour includes meal, and, under statute, meal for family use is exempt; hence I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b509-6\">Merwin, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AHb\">(dissenting.) In view of other provisions of the Revised Statutes, (part 1, c. 17, tit. 2, art. 1.) I think flour and meal are different articles; and the word \u201cflour\u201d in the exemption law was not designed to include meal; so on this I think the circuit was right; but the verdict is larger than the evidence warrants, so I assent to reversal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
