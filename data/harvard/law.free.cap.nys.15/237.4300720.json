Within ten days thereafter the sureties, or other sureties in a new undertaking to the same effect, must justify before a judge of the court below, or a county judge. At least five days' notice of the justification must be given. In every other respect the provisions of sections live hundred and seventy-eight, five hundred and seventy-nine, and five hundred and eighty of this act apply to the justification. If the judge finds the sureties sufficient, he must indorse his allowance of them upon the undertaking or a copy thereof, and a notice of the allowance must be served upon the attorney for the acceptant. The effect of a failure so to justify and procure an allowance is the same as if the undertaking had not been given.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Argued before Van Brunt, P.

The plaintiff excepted to the sureties. Notice of justification was then given, and such justification was adjourned from time to time, until finally it was set down for the 12th of May, 1890. Upon the 10th of May, 1890, the defendant in the actiqn died, and consequently the \u25a0sureties failed to justify on the 12th. Nothing further was done until the 23d of June, 1890, when the executrix of the deceased defendant was substituted as appellant, and this was followed in October of the same year by the \u25a0dismissal of the appeal for non-service of papers. We have said that nothing further was done after the defendant\u2019s death until the substitution of the \u2022executrix as appellant. An attempt, however, was made on the 6th of June to withdraw the exception to the sureties by the service of a notice of such withdrawal. This notice was signed by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney in the suit, which was as yet unrevived, addressed to the attorneys who had acted for the defendant in that suit in his life-time. These attorneys at once replied to the notice, stating that the sureties had refused and failed to justify. This notice of June 6th was a complete nullity. The waiver of justification \u2022or the withdrawal of the exception was a step in the action, and it is clear that no step could be taken in the action,' after the death of the defendant, until the appeal had been regularly continued, and the legal representative of the defendant brought in. But, even if the notice had been served over again -after the substitution of the executrix, it would not have availed the plaintiff, for the reason that the failure to justify on the 12th of May released the sureties upon the undertaking. <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>90 N. Y. 476. This case is \u25a0entirely in point. There one of the sureties appeared upon the day appointed for the justification, and then learning of the defendant\u2019s death refused to sign his examination, while the other surety, for the same reason, refused to \u2022appear. Here the sureties did not appear upon the 12th of May, and did not \u2022then express their refusal to proceed. But this distinction is immaterial. The material fact is that they did not and could not justify. The defendant was dead, and the justification, being a step in the action, could not proceed until the revival of the appeal in due course. There is no provision of the \u2022Code to meet such a case, and the sureties could not have justified under any new or authorized notice after the substitution of the executrix as appellant. The stay of proceedings fell with the death of the defendant and the failure \u25a0of the sureties to justify. And, further, the subsequent refusal of the sureties to justify was as effective\u2014if such an expression of refusal were needed\u2014 \u25a0as the refusal of the sureties in <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>for whether such refusal was expressed on the day appointed for the justification or on a subsequent \u25a0day is certainly unimportant, as the defendant was dead on the earlier day. 'The plaintiff was at liberty to proceed upon his judgment immediately after the refusal to justify on the 12th of May. Nothing stopped him thereafter \u2022except the provisions of the law forbidding the issuance of an execution against a decedent\u2019s estate without leave of the court.\" If a stay had been \u2022sought after the substitution of the executrix as appellant, such executrix would have been compelled to make a special application to the court, when \u25a0a stay could have been granted to her upon proper terms. A new undertaking might then have been required, but certainly the old undertaking could \u2022not have been revived and made to serve as such security. We have no doubt, therefore, that by the force of section 1335 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as interpreted in the case cited, the sureties, having been excepted to and having failed to justify, were discharged of all liability under the undertaking. 'The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur,.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
