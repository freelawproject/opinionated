However, these affidavits set forth that, \u201cimmediately after the said defendant was organized as a corporation, it rented a store and office at premises Ho. 116 Duane street, in the city of Hew York, as and for its principal place of business, and the said premises have continuously been occupied by the said defendant from 1885 until the present time, as its principal place of business,\u201d and that \u201cduring the said period the said company has manufactured boots and shoes at the city of Poughkeepsie, in the state of Hew York, .where its factory is situated.\u201d The principal business of this corporation would seem to have been the manufacturing of boots and shoes at Poughkeepsie, and that the business of selling was merely incidental, and, moreover, the corporation treated Dutchess as \u201cthe county in which the business of the company shall be carried on,\u201d as required by the act; for it filed its certificate of incorporation there, and, as required by section 2423 of the Code, it presented the petition for its voluntary dissolution at a term of the supreme court \u201cheld within the judicial district embracing the county wherein the principal office of the corporation is located.\u201d The act of 1848 and amendments, under which this defendant was incorporated, provide that the certificate of incorporation shall be filed \u201cin the office of the county in which the business of the company shall be carried on;\u201d that the certificate of payment of the capital stock shall be recorded \u201cin the office of the county clerk of the county wherein the business of said company is carried on;\u201d that the annual report shall be filed \u201cin the office of the clerk of the county where the business of the company shall be carried on;\u201d and that the written assent of stockholders to mortgage the company\u2019s goods and chattels and franchise \u201cshall first be filed in the office of the clerk of the county where the corporation has its principal place of bus.ness,\u201d For all of these purposes it has been invariably held that the original designation in the certificate of incorporation (unless changed by filing amendments) of the c\u00f3unty in which the operations of the company are to be carr.ed on is conclusive and controlling, and that the certificate of incorporation, the certificate of payment of capital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>stock, the annual report, and the written assent of stockholders to mortgage must be Hied in the office of the clerk of the county so designated as aforesaid in the certificate of incorporation. It lias also been held that the last certificate designating the place of the operation of the business of the company, and filed in accordance with the provisions of ihe act, is conclusive evidence of the legal residence of the corporation for the purpose of taxation. <em>Western Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>Scheu, </em>19 N. Y. 408; <em>Steam-Boat Co. </em>v. <em>City of Buffalo, </em>82 N. Y. 351; <em>Chesebrough Manuf'g Co. </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>44 Hun, 545. And no authority has been cited or found which allows such a domestic corporation to establish its principal place of business other than by making and filing an original or amended certificate of designation of the same as required by the statute, and it is well that it is so, as any other rule would certainly lead to confusion and inconvenience, and would be illogical. The principal place of business referred to in section 3169'of the Code means such place as is so designated by certificate made and filed as aforesaid, and the defendant\u2019s principal place of business is not within the city of Hew York, but at Poughkeepsie, by its own designation by certificate filed in Dutchess county clerk\u2019s office. The order denying motion to vacate the attachment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
