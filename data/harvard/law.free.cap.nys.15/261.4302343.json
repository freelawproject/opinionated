Van Allen against James H. Glass and another, commenced in May, 1890, by a personal service upon both defendants in Oneida county. The defendants answered separately, and the date of the issue is July 30, 1890. The venue of the action was laid in Schuyler county. The action was upon an undertaking executed by the defendants in November, 1883. , On the 8th day of November, 1890, the defendants\u2019 attorneys, pursuant to section 738 of the Code of Civil Procedure, served by mail an offer of judgment. On the 22d day of November, 1890, (which fell on Saturday,) the defendants\u2019 attorneys served on plaintiff\u2019s attorney a notice of trial for the Schuyler circuit, commencing on the 8th day of December, 1890, by mail, at the city of Utica, which was received by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney on the morning of November 24tli. On November 26th \"defendants\u2019 attorneys filed with the clerk of Schuyler county a note of issue for the then approaching circuit. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney served a notice of trial for the same term, by mail, on the 22d of November, by depositing the same in the post-office at Watkins on the evening of the 22d, which notice, by usual course of mail, would reach the defendants\u2019 attorneys probably the 24th or 25th of November. On the 26th of November the plaintiff\u2019s attorney and his client had an interview, and she determined to accept the offer made by the defendants, and thereupon the plaintiff\u2019s attorney gave notice of his acceptance, by mail, on the 26th day of November. The notice was served within the time fixed bystatute, the offer having been served by mail giving the plaintiff 20 days, which did not expire until November 28th. On the 11th of December judgment was entered* by the clerk, and plaintiff\u2019s bill of costs was taxed at $37.28, and included among the items, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-11\">\u201cCosts by statute before notice, - - - - $15 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-12\">Costs by statute, one additional defendant, - - 2 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-13\">Costs by statute after notice and before trial, 15 00\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-14\">A notice for retaxation for the22d of December was served by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, on which day the attorneys for the respective parties appeared before the clerk, and the costs were readjusted at the same amount, to-wit, $37.28. The counsel for the defendants asked to have the taxation held open until he could communicate with the defendants\u2019 attorneys. On the 22d of December counsel for defendants appeared before the clerk, and objected separately to each item of the plaintiff\u2019s bill of costs, and the objections were overruled, and the costs were relaxed at the sum of $37.28. Counsel for the defendants claimed \u201c that the plaintiff\u2019s acceptance of the offer related back to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>the time the offer was served,\u201d and also claimed that the clerk \u201cshould tax costs accruing after the service of their offer in their favor, and they claimed to be allowed the $15 after notice, and before trial, besides subsequent disbursements. \u201d Defendants\u2019 attorneys noticed the motion at the Broome special term, which was denied, the court holding that the plaintiff was entitled to-the item of $15 after notice and before trial; and from the order denying such, motion defendants appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b280-4\">Argued before Hardin, P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqh\">Section 738 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides for an. offer \u201cto allow judgment to be taken * * * for a sum therein specified, with cosis.\u201d It also provides, viz.: \u201cIf the plaintiff within ten days thereafter serves upon the defendant\u2019s attorney a written notice that he accepts-the offer, he mayfilethe summons, complaint, and offer, with proof of acceptance, and thereupon the clerk must enter judgment accordingly.\u201d As the offer of judgment was served by mail, the plaintiff had 20 days from the time-of service in which to determine upon the acceptance or non-acceptance, and. to serve upon defendants\u2019 attorneys \u201cwritten notice that he accepts the offer.\u201d <em>Pomeroy </em>v. <em>Hulin, </em>7 How. Pr. 161. He was then authorized to file the summons,, complaint, and offer with proof of acceptance; and it is further provided in that section that \u201cthereupon the clerk must enter judgmentaccordingly.\u201d In <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>8 How. Pr. 241, it was said, viz.: \u201cThis right of the plaintiff is inconsistent With the co-existing right in the defendant to take any steps in the action adverse to the .plaintiff, contrary to the offer. The offer amounts to a written stipulation on the part of the defendant, waiving all right'to proceed in the action for the term of ten days, or until plaintiff makes his election to reject the offer.\u201d In that case it was said: \u201cThe defendant\u2019s order to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, obtained by him within ten days after his offer, was therefore irregular, and must be set aside.\u201d The case of <em>Hawley </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>5 Hun, 642, does not reach the question made here. In that case the defendant served upon the plaintiff\u2019s attorney an offer of judgment on the 9th of June, and on the 15th of June plaintiff took an inquest and entered judgment for the amount claimed, with costs; and it was held in that case \u201cthat, as the ten days within which the Code required the plaintiff to accept or reject the offer had not elapsed when the action was tried, the plaintiff was entitled to the fee allowed for the trial of an issue of fact.\u201d In that case the offer never became efficient by an acceptance, nor by the expiration of the time within which it might have been accepted. In <em>Herman v. Lyons, </em>10 Hun, 111, an offer of judgment was served on the.7th of February, and on the 9th of February the cause was regularly called in its order on the calendar, and an inquest taken therein, and the costs accruing subsequent to the offer taxed in plaintiff\u2019s favor; and it was held \u201cthat, as ten days had not elapsed from the service of the offer of judgment to the time of trial, the plaintiff was entitled to disregard the offer, and to tax the costs thereafter accruing.\u201d In the course of the opinion it was said: \u201cThe plaintiff could treat the offer as a nullity, which he did do, and proceed with his action.\u201d In the case in hand, the plaintiff did not treat the offer as a nullity, and during the time allowed by statute for the acceptance of the offer made her election to accept, and did accept, and with the offer, with the acceptance and proof thereof and other proper papers, applied to the clerk, who entered judgment in accordance with the offer. The question here presented was considered in <em>Douglass </em>v. <em>Macdurmid, </em>2 How. Pr. (N. S.) 289, and it was there said that, where \u201cthe defendant serves an offer of judgment for a specific sum, with interest and costs, and after the offer is made both parties serve notice of trial, after which time the plaintiff accepts the offer, he is only entitled to costs before notice of trial,\u2014 fifteen dollars.\u201d In the course of the opinion in that case it was said: \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>notice of trial served by the defendant does not aid the plaintiff, because the offer prevented the defendant from moving the case for ten days after it was served, ( <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>8 How. Pr. 240;) and the notice served by the defendant became nugatory on the acceptance of the.offer.\u201d The rule stated in that case is satisfactory. Order of the special term reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, so far as it asks to strike out the item of $15 after notice, and in other respects denied, without costs to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
