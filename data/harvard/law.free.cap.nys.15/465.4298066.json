The order of the court of special sessions requiring the bond, and the bond itself, are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-14\">\u201cWhereas, complaint having been made before George A. Wyre, a justice of the peace of the county of Rockland and state of Hew York, that George H. Powles is a disorderly person; and whereas, said justice, on such complaint being made, did duly cause a peace-officer to bring said George H. Powles before him for examination; and whereas, on such examination, the said George H. Powles was adjudged a disorderly person, and required to give security in the sum of $250 to tile town of Orangetown to indemnify said town against his wife and children becoming in one year chargeable on the public: How, therefore, we, George H. Powles and Ella T. Powles, both of the village of Eyack, aforesaid, do hereby undertake, in the sum of $250, that the wile and children of said George H. Powles will not for one year become a charge on the public, or, in case of a failure of such undertaking, we, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>the said George H.

Such is the plain import of the language, which cannot be extended by the .court to meet any supposed requirement of the statute. A surety cannot be held to a larger responsibility than the language of the bond requires. The county judge was therefore right in requiring the plaintiff to stipulate to reduce the verdict to $28, as a condition upon which the verdict might stand. The plaintiff not stipulating, the verdict was properly set aside. But there is a more serious difficulty in appellant\u2019s way. This is an appeal from an order of a county court granting a motion \u201cmade upon the judge\u2019s minutes to set aside a verdict upon exceptions, and because the said verdict was excessive, and was contrary to law and the evidence.\u201d Under the authority of the case of <em>Hand </em>v. <em>Dorchester, </em>43 Hun, 33, this case cannot be reviewed by the general term of this court, and it should be dismissed, without costs, fat the reasons stated in that case by Mr. Justice Eollett. It is so ordered. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
