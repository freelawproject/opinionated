The prayer of the complaint was \u201cthat each and all of the defendants be perpetually restrained and enjoined from any and every act towards maintaining, constructing, or operating the above-described elevated railroad, or any :part or accessory thereof, along said Trinity place, or adjoining or in front of \u25a0the plaintiff\u2019s premises above described, and that the plaintiff recover against -the defendants said yearly loss of rent from July, 1883, or if the defendants \u2022be permitted such use of the said structure through said Trinity place as they heretofore have had, it shall only be on condition of their paying to the plain-tiff the sum of one hundred thousand dollars, or the value of the easements taken, and that the plaintiff havetlie costs of this action and such other and further relief as to the court may seem just and proper.\u201d The court gave judgment in favor of plaintiff for $8,060.39 damages and costs, and granted \u25a0the injunction. It was further ordered \u201cthat in case the defendants shall tender, for the purpose of execution by the plaintiff, a form of conveyance or grant by the plaintiff to the defendants of the property of the plaintiff found to have been taken herein by the defendants, and in case of the plaintiff having executed such conveyance or grant, and of the plaintiff having delivered \u25a0 or tendered for delivery thesame to the defendants, the defendants shall pay to the plaintiff the sum of twelve thousand dollars, ($12,000,) with interest from the date of this judgment, then this judgment of injunction and restraint .shall not in any way be operative.\u201d Defendants appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b240-14\">Argued before Van Brunt, P.

Upon the merits we think the money awards made at the special term were moderate, and we find no errors in the admission or rejection of evidence. Hovelty is claimed for the point that it was error to grant an injunction against the running of trains, but judgments in this form have been repeatedly granted and sustained. The operation of the road has been invariably \u2022 treated as an incident to the maintenance and use of the structure. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number><em>Lahr Case, </em>104 N. Y. 269, 10 N. E. Rep. 528, it was expressly held that the defendant was liable for the operation of its trains, and the consequences flowing therefrom are incidents to the permanent structure which necessarily increase and aggravate the plaintiff's injury. \u201cThe structure here, and its intended use,\u201d said Buger, O. J., \u201ccannot be separated and dissected, and it must be regarded in its entirety in considering the effect which it produces upon the property of the abutter.\u201d The learned counsel for the defendants have submitted an elaborate brief, in which they seek to distinguish this case from the <em>Lahr Case, </em>but we think unsuccessfully. They concede that as to past trespasses the law holds the defendants liable for all the incidents of such trespasses, but they insist that, in estimating the fee value, such incidents should be disregarded. What the court at special term did was to ascertain the value of the plaintiff\u2019s easements at the time of the trial. These were the easements of light, air, and access, and such were the.easements \u201ctaken\u201d by the defendants. It was found that the value of the plaintiff\u2019s interest in the premises was lessened by that \u201ctaking\u201d in the sum of $12,000. This was not, as the defendants contend, a commutation of future trespasses, nor was it an indirect way of requiring the defendants \u201cto pay for the incidental results of future imaginary trespasses.\u201d It was simply a finding as to the present value of the easements, upon payment of which the defendants might relieve themselves from the operation of the injunction. The <em>Lahr Case, </em>although an action at law, affords a complete justification for the finding. The plaintiff there, was permitted to recover all the damages occasioned to his property by the taking of the easements. That case was taken out of the operation of the <em>Uline Case, </em>101 N. Y. 98, 4 N. E. Rep. 536, by the consent of the parties, and the rule with regard to the abutter\u2019s entire damage was laid down with distinctness. That rule, even within the limitations suggested by Earl and Finch, JJ., covered the damages sustained by abutting owners by reason of the construction and operation of the railway, so far as such damages resulted from the taking or destruction of their street easements of light, air, and access. The defendant\u2019s argument on this head is refined and subtle, but its fallacy lies mainly in the postulate that the court has required the defendants, as the sole condition upon which they may legalize their structure, to pay for the right to run trains. The court has done nothing of the kind. It has given the defendants an opportunity, even at this late day, to pay for the easements taken, and the price of those easements is their lessened value to-day resulting from the unlawful maintenance of the structure and operation of the road thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">We do not think any of the other points deserving of special consideration, except the complaint that the court below awarded damages for acts of the defendants subsequently to the commencement of the action. There might be some difficulty with regard to this finding, in view of the decision of this court in <em>Cornell </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>13 N. Y. Supp. 511, (decided March 13, 1891.) But we think the defendants cannot avail themselves of the objection, because of their own request to the learned judge to find the damages down to the time of the trial. Their fifth conclusion of law specifically embraces this very proposition, and, although it is preceded by a statement that they do not consent to the finding, it is evident that thereby they simply intend to guard against any possibility of assent to the amount to be specified by the learned judge in the finding. We need not, therefore, consider the main question, nor the subsidiary one, as to whether the findings would justify a modification of the judgment by the deduction of what might otherwise be deemed in excess of what is authorized. Upon the whole, and without adverting to several other points taken by the appellants,\u2014which we deem unsubstantial,\u2014we think the judgments should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
