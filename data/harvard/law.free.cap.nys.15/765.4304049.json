J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANfD\">This is an appeal from a judgment on a verdict for the plaintiffs directed by the court. The only point which the appellant urges on this appeal is that he was entitled to go to the jury, and especially upon the question \u201cwhether this corn was ever actually purchased by the plaintiffs, as the plaintiff Rumsey is the only evidence on the subject.\u201d The action is for a balance alleged to be owing plaintiffs upon a purchase of corn, which the plaintiffs claim that they actually made for defendant\u2019s firm. It was admitted that in August, 1886, defendant\u2019s firm requested plaintiffs to buy a certain amount of October corn at 45 cents a bushel. An important question is whether the plaintiffs did make this purchase. It was admitted that in such cases it was the custom of brokers to purchase grain in their own names, without disclosing their principals, and that defendant\u2019s firm knew \u00f3f this custom. The plaintiff Rumsey testified: \u201cOn the l'4th of August, 1886, we purchased this amount of corn at 45 cents a bushel. We made this purchase for defendants under this custom.\u201d He further testifies that they bought this corn of certain persons, naming them; that it was delivered to them by receipts from elevators; that it was handled by receipts demanding that amount of corn, and in no other way; that it was never actually moved from one place to another. He produced certain slips,\u2014\u201ccontract slips,\u201d as they are called, \u2014which he stated were made at the time, representing the purchase. The first is signed by no one; the others purport to be signed by five different parties, and are as follows, (excepting signatures:)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-10\">\u201cChicago, 8, 14, 1886.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-11\">\u201cWe hereby confirm sales made by us to-day under the rules of the Chicago Board of Trade, as follows, to Rumsey and Buell:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-12\">Amount. Kind of property. Delivery. Price.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-13\">10 corn Oct. 45</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-14\">\u201cBensley Bros.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-15\">The plaintiffs advised defendant\u2019s firm on the same day of the purchase, and several letters of plaintiffs to defendant\u2019s firm are produced which refer to the purchase. Drafts were drawn by plaintiffs on the defendant\u2019s firm, and were paid. Finally the price of corn further declined, and plaintiff Rumsey testifies that on or about September 27th they sold the corn for considerably less than 45 cents per bushel. The difference, less what had been paid by defendant\u2019s firm, is the amount recovered. On October 1st\u2014the time when the \u25a0 corn is alleged to have been sold\u2014the plaintiffs wrote defendant\u2019s firm, saying: \u201cThe corn upon your purchase was delivered this morning to us, and delivered out again upon your sale. \u201d The defendant urges that this shows that there was no real purchase made on the 6th of August, as claimed by plain- \u25a0 tiffs. The learned justice, in his charge, stated in two places that the plaintiffs did buy the corn, and paid the money for it; so that he must have as-sumed that the testimony of plaintiff Rumsey established an actual purchase. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>There is no testimony showing the meaning of \u201cOctober corn.\u201d It may be that the order given by defendant\u2019s firm implies that no immediate delivery was intended. There was no witness for the plaintiffs other than plaintiff Bumsey. At the close of the case the court directed a verdict for plaintiffs. The defendant excepted to this, and also asked to go to the jury on the question whether the corn was ever actually purchased by plaintiffs, as plaintiff Bumsey was the only witness on that subject. This was refused, and defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Although the general rule is that, where the testimony of a witness to a fact is not contradicted, it must not be disregarded by the jury, yet it has been repeatedly held by the highest courts it this state that the rule does not apply where the witness is a party, or is interested. In such cases it is decided that the question of the credibility of the witness, although he is not contradicted, is for the jury, and that the court cannot legally take this \u2022question from them. <em>Elwood </em>v. <em>Telegraph Co., </em>45 N. Y. 549; <em>Gildersleeve </em>v. <em>Landon, </em>73 N. Y. 609; <em>Kavanagh </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>70 N. Y. 177; <em>Wohlfahrt </em>v. <em>Beckert, </em>92 N. Y. 490. We do not see why this principle does not apply here. The question in the pleadings was whether plaintiffs purchased this corn for defendant\u2019s firm. The defendant\u2019s answer denied this. The proof was the testimony of one of the plaintiffs only. The jury might have disbelieved his testimony. Therefore the court could not take the question from them. It is said that there are letters of defendant\u2019s firm; but these are only in response to plaintiffs\u2019 letters and information. The defendant\u2019s firm knew nothing of the fact, and their letters are no admission. It is also urged that the printed slips introduced in evidence so confirmed Bumsey\u2019s testimony that the principle does not apply; but the admission of these slips was objected to by defendant. Their genuineness depends only on the testimony of Bumsey, who says that they were made at the time of the purchase. Therefore the same principle applies to his testimony as to these slips as to any other part of his testimony, viz., that the jury are not bound to believe it; so that we come back to the same condition,\u2014that the plaintiffs\u2019 case rested solely on Bumsey\u2019s testimony. In this last respect the case is similar to that of <em>Hodge </em>v. <em>Buffalo, </em>1 Abb. N. C. 356. The plaintiff, by her own testimony, proved her own age, and she corroborated this by an entry in a Bible, which by her own testimony she proved to be her father\u2019s family Bible. She also testified that the entry was in her father\u2019s handwriting. This evidence was not contradicted. The defendant asked to go to the jury, and this was refused. The general term held that this was error. The Bible and the entry rested on plaintiff\u2019s testimony only, so that they are not independent evidence, and the case should have gone to the jury. That case is closely analogous to the present. It is certainly doubtful, even if those slips had been proved to be genuine by other testimony, whether they would have proved that the plaintiffs bought for the defendant\u2019s firm the corn ordered by their telegram. Nothing in those slips shows that the purchase, if made at all, was made for the defendant\u2019s firm, or that defendant\u2019s firm had any right therein. Even admitting that such purchase was according to custom, still it could not be shown by the slips themselves that the purchase was made for defendant\u2019s firm. If such was the fact, it was shown only by the testimony of plaintiff Bumsey. Let us suppose, in order to test this matter, that the jury had disbelieved all which plaintiff Bumsey said on the stand, as, under the decisions, they could lawfully do. Is there anything remaining on which a verdict in plaintiffs\u2019 favor could be sustained? Certainly not. If the testimony of Bumsey was not true, it was difficult, if not impossible, for defendant to contradict it. Admitting that the plaintiffs made the contracts indicated by the slips, where could the defendant obtain evidence to contradict the testimony of Bumsey that these identical contracts were made for defendant\u2019s firm ? This consideration shows the justice of the principle above examined, that in such case s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>as this the question must be determined by the jury, and that the court cannot decide, as a matter of law, that the plaintiff\u2019s testimony must be believed. But there is still another consideration. The plaintiffs\u2019cause of action depends not solely upon the purchases alleged to have been made for defendant\u2019s linn, but upon the subsequent sales of the corn by plaintiffs. Such sales are denied by the answer. The fact of such sales is shown only by the testimony of Bumsey, the plaintiff. There is no corroboration of any kind. Here, then, is a fact resting only on the testimony of a party, yet the court refuses to allow the case to go to the jury. This is the only point argued before us, and. therefore we discuss no other, and only follow the decisions above cited as binding upon us. Judgment reversed, new trial granted, costs to abide event. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">Mayham, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b786-5\">Landon, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ak6B\">I dissent. The defendant gave his \"order August 13, 1886, to the plaintiff, a broker, buying and selling corn at the Chicago Board of Trade,- to buy for him 100,000 bushels of October corn at 45 cents. What did defendant expect to get August 13th? Certainly no delivery of October corn at that early date. All he wanted was the broker\u2019s contracts of the Chicago Board of Trade for 100,000 bushels of corn, deliverable in October, such as plaintiff could there purchase. The plaintiff testilied that be bought the corn on the date of the order pursuant to the order. He also produced in evidence the broker's contract slips, which he then obtained, showing the purchase as ordered. He testified to their genuineness. These slips were equivalent to tlie'orders, or entitled the holder to the orders of their makers for the corn specilied in them, deliverable in October. The correspondence between the parties and defendant\u2019s payments showed defendant\u2019s admission of the plaintiff\u2019s case, or, if less than a full admission, were in corroboration of plaintiff\u2019s testimony. -The rule that the jury must pass upon the credibility of the testimony of a party, when uncorroborated, lias no application. That rule, like many other so-called \u201cgeneral\u201d rules, applies to cases on all-fours with those in which it has been announced. Where a party\u2019s testimony is so new or strange as to cause surprise, or is not susceptible of contradiction if false, there is much greater reason for the application of the rule than in a case like this, where it is plain that the defendant has no doubt of the truth of plaintiff\u2019s testimony, but lias some hope that a jury may be willing to extricate him from the consequences of his foolish speculation.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
