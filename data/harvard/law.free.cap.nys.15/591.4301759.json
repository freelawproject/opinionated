There was evidence that testator had declared that he was going to sell the property and pay off claimant\u2019s mortgage, and that when he gave the check to claimant he told her to take care of it, and, if anything should happen to him, Mr. W., the executor, would attend to it. Claimant testified that after testator\u2019s death she gave to W. the check in question, saying that it was the check given her by testator, and that testator had told her to give it to W., who would attend to it for her. The executor, when called on to produce the check at the hearing, simply said, \u201cWe do not produce it,\u201d but did not say that it was not in his possession. <em>Meld, </em>that the evidence was sufficient to establish the claim.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b609-17\">Appeal from judgment on report of referee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-18\">Proceeding by Mary L.

Dodge died in the city of Brooklyn on the 3d day of June, 1886, leaving a last will and testament, and alter his death Mary L. Van Slooten, formerly Mary L. Miner, presented two claims against his estate to the executor of his will. One was a specific claim for a diamond ring, and the other was a claim fat $20,000 and interest thereon from May 15, 1886. Both claims were rejected by the executor, and were thereafter refeired to a referee for determination under the statute. The referee reported adversely to the claimant, and she has appealed from the judgment entered upon his report. The claimant based her claim to the ring upon a gift -of the same to her by the deceased, and she gave evidence before the referee sufficient to establish a gift of the ring either <em>inter vivas </em>or <em>causa mortis. </em>The ring was delivered by the deceased to the claimant, and she retained the possession of it until after his death, without any revocation of the gift, and that was sufficient to vest the title to the same in her. He expressed his intention to make a gift of 'the ring to the claimant, and accompanied that expression by delivery, and that was sufficient to constitute a valid transfer of .the property. <em>Bedell </em>v. <em>Carll, </em>33 N. Y. 581; <em>Beaver </em>v. <em>Beaver, </em>117 N. Y. 428, 22 N. E. Rep. 940. One of the witnesses, who was a mutual friend of the parties and a relative of the claimant, testified as follows, in respect to the presentation of the ring: \u201cMy cousin came into the room wearing the ring, and she showed it to me, and when Mr. Dodge came back she handed the ring to him, and he said, \u2018Look at me and smile;\u2019 and says, \u2018This ring is for May; it matches one of her ear-rings exactly. After a while I.am going to get a ring, and have this made into an ear-ring; it matches hers.\u2019 He says, \u2018I am not going to live long; and, little old woman, it is for you; it is for you, whether it is made into an ear-ring or not.\u2019\u201d Subsequently the same witness stated: \u201cI heard him say that the ring was hers; that he had given it to her, and that it was his intention to have it made into-an ear-ring for her; and, if anything should happen to him, the ring was for May. The day we went to Coney Island, my cousin wore it that day.\u201d Another witness testified on the same subject: \u201cThe way I knew about the ring was that when I was there to.ask about the money he put his hand up to his head. I said, \u2018Mr. Dodge, I would not mind having a ring like that,\u2019 or \u2018that ring,\u2019 and then he said it did not belong to him; \u2018it is May\u2019s.\u2019\u201d Another witness, Mrs. Halstead, testified she had often seen the claimant wearing the ring before Mr. Dodge\u2019s death, and she was then wearing it. Two other witnesses testified to the same effect. Another witness testified as follows: \u201c While she [the claimant] was fixing his head, she put her hand out, [illustrating,]\u2014 her left hand,\u2014to put her left hand on his head; and she said, \u2018See what a beautiful present I have had given me;\u2019 and he looked up and smiled. This was before the first attack of paralysis.\u201d The claimant testified, in her own behalf, that from the date of the ride to Coney Island, which was April 21, 1886, she kept the ring in her possession until after the testator\u2019s death. Another witness testified that she had seen the claimant, wearing the ring for the first time, in Mr. Dodge\u2019s presence, about two months before his death. She last saw it on claimant\u2019s hand about a week before his death. After the death of the testator the claimant delivered the ring to the executor, and her version of the conversation which then occurred is as follows: \u201cHe then asked to \u2018see the ring I had on,\u2019 as he expressed it. I said, \u2018What ring?\u2019 He said, \u2018That;\u2019 pointing to this ring. I held up my hand, and he says, \u2018Take it off.\u2019 I took it off, and handed it to him, and then he called Mr. Wilcox, and left the house.\u201d She also testified that on several occasions she asked Mr. Wheeler if he would give her the ring. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>and he said he would. It appeared that she had through her attorney made a request of the executor for permission to purchase the ring, but that letter, and the circumstances under which it was written, was fully explained by the person who wrote it.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The foregoing testimony with respect to the gift of the ring was not contradicted, and the only contradictory evidence offered by the executor was his own version of the transaction, and the conversation at the time of the delivery of the ring to him. In his testimony he says that, while calling at the house of the claimant, he took her into an adjoining room, and said to her: \u201cMay, there is a good deal of feeling existing in relation to your having possession of this ring. Mrs. Morgan and Ned Dodge are very much incensed that you should be wearing it at the time of Mr. Dodge\u2019s death. It seems to me it is the proper thing for you to do to put it into the estate, where it belongs;\u201d and then he said \u201cshe voluntarily took it off her finger, and handed it to me, and I put, it in my pocket, and we quietly bade her good evening, and left, and I put, it into the inventory, as a part of the assets of the estate.\u201d It is to be observed that the executor, according to his own version of the conversation, did not deny the right of the claimant to the ring, and he did not inform her that her right and title to the ring was questioned or denied by any one. He simply stated to her that'the two persons whom he named were incensed because she wore it at the time of the death of Mr. Dodge. Her ownership was not denied or challenged in any way at that interview, and she delivered the ring to the executor, with the understanding on her part that it was to be returned to her again. She did not indicate any intention to yield up her right to the ring or surrender her property therein. She gave it to him voluntarily upon his demand, but that simple act, unaccompanied by any declaration of an intention to part with the same permanently, or to yield up her right to it, cannot be construed as a waiver of her claim or a surrender of any of her rights. The uncontradicted testimony on the part of the claimant makes a plain case of a consummated gift which was sufficient to vest the title to the article in the claimant, and our conclusion is that the report of the referee was erroneous upon that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">In relation to the claim of $20,000, it appeared that the claimant held a bond and mortgage of Mr. Dodge upon certain property of his in Brooklyn, for $20,000, payable on demand, which mortgage was satisfied of record on the 22d day of April, 1886; that the testator sold the premises after the same was so released from the mortgage on the 1st day of May, 1886; and it also appeared from the testimony, and was found by the referee, that between the 1st and the 12th days of May, 1886, the deceased, Harry E. Dodge, signed and delivered to the claimant his check for $20,000, payable to her order, under the name of Mary L. Miner. It nowhere appeared that this check was ever paid. Heither did it appear that the bond and mortgage was paid, unless this check, made at that time, for the same amount, was given in payment of the same, which seems to us to be a reasonable inference, especially in view of the fact that, if the check of $20,000 had been paid, evidence of such payment might have been produced by the executor, who was in possession of the papers of the deceased. In relation to this check, a significant fact occurred upon the trial before the referee, when the claimant\u2019s counsel called upon Mr. Wheeler to produce a certain check dated between the 1st and 12th of May, 1886, drawn to the order of Mary L. Miner, the claimant, and signed by Harry E. Dodge, called for in the notice to produce. Due service of the notice was admitted, but the counsel for the executor stated, \u201cWe do not produce it.\u201d He did not say, \u201cWe cannot produce it, because it is not in our possession;\u201d but his language is significant, and implied that he did not produce it because he would not, and not because he could not. This occurrence upon the trial is render\u00e9d\u2019 more significant when taken in connection with the testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>the claimant that she delivered the check to the executor, Mr. Wheeler, after the death of Mr. Dodge. The testimony upon this subject on the part of the claimant was this. The same mutual friend who gave evidence respecting the ring, a Miss Fitchett, stated that she visited the parties about the 1st of March, 1886, and that she had conversations - with Mr. Dodge, in which he remarked \u201cthat my cousin had a mortgage on his Henry-Street house, and that he had an opportunity of selling the house, and he thought he would sell it and pay her the mortgage; spoke of that to me on several occasions. \u201d Again she says, in the second conversation, he said \u201cthat Mrs. Miner had a mortgage on the Henry-Street house, and that lie had an opportunity to sell the house, and he thought he would do so, and pay her the mortgage; pay her the $20,000.\u201d Then she said the last conversation was: \u201cOne day he came home about one o\u2019clock. My cousin was out. We were in the sitting-room alone for a long time. He spoke of the mortgage that day. * * * He remarked that he was going to sell the house to pay her the $20,000 mortgage.\u201d Another witness, who was a servant, and went to live in the family about the 6th of May, testified that one day h.e came upstairs, and heard Mr; Dodge say to Mrs. Miner: \u201cI will give you the check, and, if anything should happen to me, you can giveit to Mr. Wheeler, and he will attend to it for me.\u201d He further testified that Mr. Dodge said: \u201c\u2018I will give you a check to the amount of $20,000 for some property on Henry street.\u2019 I don\u2019t remember just what it was. It was about a check for $20,000 for property on Henry street.\u201d The same witness testified, further, that Mr. Dodge delivered the check to the claimant, and that after Mr. Dodge's death he heard the following conversation between the claimant and Mr. Wheeler, the executor: \u201cI heard Mrs. Miner say, \u2018Here is \u2022the check which Mr. Dodge gave me on the mortgage, and wished me to give it to you, and also to get it cashed for me.\u2019 Mr. Wheeler took the check from Mrs. Miner.\u201d Another witness, Sarah Smith, also a servant in the family, testified as follows: \u201cThe first conversation about the mortgage was on Saturday night at dinner. He [the testator] came in, and was sitting down and talking over his business, and mentioned about the mortgage on tlie Henry-Street property, and he said that he had a chance to sell it. I heard this as I was coming out of the pantry.\u201d Again, the same witness said: \u201cHe [the testator] called her [the claimant] as she was in the middle of the room, and he asked her what did she do with the check for the Henry-Street mortgage; and she says, \u2018I think 1 have it with the other papers in my desk.\u2019 He said, \u2018Well, I want you to go and get it, and put it by itself, so that it will not get misplaced, so that, if anything should happen to me, you will know where to put your hand on it.\u2019 \u2018All right,\u2019 she said, T will go and get it now, and get an \u2022envelope to put it in; \u2019 and she got an envelope, and put it in that.\u201d Another witness, Mrs. Chertizza, testified to a conversation on the same subject, as follows: \u201cI asked him [the testator] if he could not loan me $5,000; that I was in trouble; the mortgage on my house was about to be foreclosed. Mr. Hoble needed money, and I had no one else to turn to but Mr. Dodge, as he was my best friend. He said he had just given Mrs. Van Slooten a twenty thousand dollar mortgage on the house, and he could not spare it just then. \u201d \u25a0On the redirect the witness said \u201che had to pay her the mortgage, and he had no money he could loan me at the present time;\u201d and again he said \u201che had \u2022to give her the mortgage what was on the house; I don\u2019t know when he .mortgaged the house.\u201d Another witness, William Mower, testified as follows: \u201cI had sold a house, and I made the remark to him [the deceased] that I had sold a house, and he said that I should try and get a customer for him. Told me that the house was not paying; that he had lost so much on it. I asked him how much of a mortgage was on it, and he told me twenty thousand dollars. * * * He told me that Mrs. Miner had the mortgage.\u201d Subsequently, after the house had been sold, the witness testified to a conversation in May, after Mr. Dodge had had the second attack of paralysis, as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>\u201cIt was shortly after he had sold his house, and I told him it was a quick transfer,\u2014quicker than the one that I had sold. * * * Then he told he had \u2022canceled the mortgage of $20,000 on Henry street, and he was very glad he had sold it. * * * He said that he had canceled that mortgage, -and given a check for it of $20,000 to Mrs. Miner, he told me.\u201d Another witness, Laura Halstead, testified that in May, 1886, not very long before the \"testator\u2019s death, she saw a check on the claimant\u2019s bureau, and that the check was written on one of the bank-notes of Clark, Dodge &amp; Co., and was some time in May, between the first and middle. It was payable to the \u201corder of Mary L. Miner, $20,000. Harry E. Dodge.\u201d The witness further testified \u25a0that the check was written on a blank like this contained in the testator\u2019s check-book on the banking-house of Clark, Dodge &amp; Co. She also stated that she knew Mr. Dodge\u2019s handwriting. The testimony of the claimant in respect to the conversation with Mr. Wheeler, the executor, when she delivered him the check after the death of Mr. Dodge, is as follows: \u201cI gave Mr. Wheeler an envelope, with the check in it, that Mr. Dodge gave to me. I told Mr. Wheeler there it was. I gave him the envelope, and I told him what the envelope contained.\" I told him there was the check that Mr. Dodge had given me, and that Mr. Dodge had told me to give it to Mr. Wheeler, and have Mr. Wheeler attend to it for me. He took the check and went away. \u201d She further stated that the check was for $20,000, and its date was between, the 7th and 12th of May, and it was in the handwriting of Mr. Dodge. \u201cMr. Wheeler asked me what was in the envelope, and I said, \u2018A check that Mr. Dodge gave me for the payment of a mortgage,\u2019 and the check was for $20,000.\u201d Another witness, Sadie Dye, referring to the same occasion when the claimant gave the check to the executor, testified as follows: \u201cAll I heard was, \u2018Mr. Wheeler, there are the papers that Harry gave me to give to you, and the check which you are to collect.\u2019 \u201d The foregoing is substantially the testimony in support of the claim of the plaintiff for $20,000, and, if it .stood uncontradicted, it would be sufficient to establish the debt. It is entirely natural, and harmonious with all the known and established facts. There was a bond and mortgage, and there was a check, and the claimant and the deceased were together where they would naturally speak of them, and the persons who gave the testimony were in a position to witness the transactions and conversations which they detail. There is no inherent improbability or impossibility in the testimony, and it is all consistent and free from contra-diction, and the cross-examination was endured without variation or contradiction or misstatement. Moreover, there is no intimation derogatory to the character of the witnesses, and they were free from interest in the litigation. Under such circumstances, there is no reason why the testimony is not entitled to respect and belief. It is true the executor contradicted the testimony so far as he could, but its weight was too much to be overcome by the \u25a0testimony of a single witness. Let us take another view: The claimant held \u2022a bond and mortgage against the deceased, which she satisfied about the time he sold the property. After the sale he gave her a check for $20,000, and the only consistent inference is that the check was given for the debt which had been evidenced and secured by the bond and mortgage. It was for the same amount, and given at the same time, and there is no trace of any other transaction or indebtedness between the parties. There is no claim that the check has ever been paid, or that the mortgage debt was paid in any \u25a0other manner. So we have an indebtedness of the deceased to the claimant of -$20,000, without dispute as to its validity. The case, upon the uncontradicted evidence, may be stated thus: The deceased was indebted to the claimant in the sum of $20,000, secured by a bond and mortgage. She satisfied the mortgage without payment of the debt. He then gave her his check for the indebtedness, and the check has never been paid. That leaves the original \u2022debt uncanceled, and due and owing, and a valid claim against the estate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>the deceased. In this view, the testimony of the executor denying the receipt of the check from the claimant is neither controlling nor material. The claimant and one of her witnesses says she delivered the check to him in accordance with the instructions of the deceased, arid it is to be assumed that she had parted with the paper in some manner; for it was not in her possession at the time of the trial, and the defendant did not deny its custody when called upon to produce it there, but his counsel made the evasive reply already quoted. If he did not receive it, it is lost or mislaid, and, as it was payable to the order of the claimant from an account standing in the name of the deceased at the bank, there is no danger of its payment now, and, as the present claim is based upon the original debt, the failure to produce the check does not affect the case. The only effect of the testimony of the executor is to discredit the evidence of the claimant and her witnesses, and, as we have already seen, the claim is established independently of evidence. In fact it is established independently of the check. With the bond and mortgage established and unpaid, the claim is made out. After a most careful examination, we think both of the claims were established, and should have been allowed. The judgment should be reversed, and a' new trial granted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
