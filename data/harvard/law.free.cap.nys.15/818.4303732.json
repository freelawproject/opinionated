On appeal by defendant, the state superintendent set aside the election of M. on the ground that the proceedings were unfair, and ordered a new election. Defendant, having been elected trustee at the new election, refused to permit plaintiff to continue under her contract. Held, that M. was trustee <em>de-facto, </em>and his contract with plaintiff was binding, and an action would lie for the services performed thereunder and for damages for the breach.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b836-7\">Appeal from special term, Washington county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b836-8\">Action by Minnie O\u2019Neil, by her father as guardian <em>ad litem, </em>against Fred. C. Battie, as trustee of school-district No. 2, town of Easton, Washington county, to recover for services performed under and for breach of the following contract:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b836-9\">\u201cMemorandum of Hiring Required by Chapter 335, Laws of 1887. \u201cThis is to certify that I have this day engaged Minnie O\u2019Neil (a duly-licensed teacher) to teach the public school of district No. 2, town of Easton, \u2022county of Washington, for the term of twenty-five weeks, commencing August 19, 1889, at a weekly compensation of eight dollars, payable monthly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b836-10\">\u201cMichael Moran, Trustee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b836-11\"><em>\u201cDated August </em>19, 1889.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b836-12\">The defense was that Moran was not a trustee of the district, and had no authority to hire plaintiff. It appeared from the minutes of the annual school meeting regularly called and held August 6, 1889. that the meeting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>was called to order by the clerk and the then trustee, and that Moran was duly made chairman, and a motion was made and seconded that Moran be trustee for the ensuing year, which was put by him, and announced by him as carried. It also appeared in evidence that Battle appealed to the state superintendent to set aside such election, and it was set aside for alleged unfairness in the rulings at the meeting, and a new election was held, and Bat-tie was duly elected trustee. He thereupon refused to allow plaintiff to continue to teach the school, whereupon she brought this action to recover for services rendered under the contract, and for damages for its breach by defendant. The court directed a verdict for plaintiff. Defendant appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b837-5\">Argued before Learned, P. J., and Landon and Mayham, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b837-6\"><em>Edgar Hull, </em>for appellant. <em>Gibson &amp; Van Kirk, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b837-7\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AJ-\">We are satisfied that Moran was trustee <em>defacto. </em>This is shown by the record of the meeting, by the appeal taken by the present defendant for the purpose of setting aside Moran\u2019s election, and by the decision of the superintendent ordering a new election. As such, his written contract with the plaintiff was binding. That writing, accepted by her, constituted the contract, whatever prior verbal agreement there may have been. It is hardly possible in any case that a written contract should be made, unless the parties have previously arranged the. matter verbally. The writing supersedes all the verbal arrangements. The plaintiff performed her part of the contract so far as she was permitted. She was therefore entitled to recover for what she had performed, and damages for what she lost by being prevented from performing. The complaint contained only one count, but no objection was taken to this form of pleading. The plaintiff\u2019s inability to obtain other work after she was discharged by the defendant was proved. We see no error in the trial. Judgment affirmed, with costs against defendant personally. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
