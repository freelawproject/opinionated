J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIj\">The defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree. He made an application for a new trial on the ground of newly-discovered evidence, and the same was denied. An appeal was taken to the general term, which is still pending. A stay during the appeal was denied, because no appeal was proper from the decision denying the new trial. The point is decided by the general term in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hovey, </em>80 Hun, 357. Appeals in criminal cases are provided for, but no provision is made for a service of an order denying a motion for a new trial made after judgment, unless the proceedings are embodied in the judgment roll. The order should therefore be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
