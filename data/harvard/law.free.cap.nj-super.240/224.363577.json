With one exception, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">In July 1987 the Legislature enacted the Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-1 <em>et seq. N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-25a directed DEP to adopt rules and regulations pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-1 <em>et seq. </em>DEP proposed 14 chapters of regulations. Following public hearings and written comments, DEP made changes and published the final regulations. Appellants challenge two of these regulations, asserting, that they were procedurally defective and substantively contrary to the Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants also claim on appeal that they are entitled to recover reasonable attorneys fees (not exceeding $10,000) pursuant to the Environmental Rights Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:35A-1 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">In order to evaluate these claims, it is necessary to examine the general format of the Act, its definitions, the permits required and the exemptions permitted. Under the Act \u201cfreshwater wetlands\u201d <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-3) were divided into three categories. Those of \u201cexceptional resource value\u201d were</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A55\">... freshwater wetlands which exhibit any of the following characteristics:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">(1) Those which discharge into FW-1 waters and FW-2 trout production (TP) waters and their tributaries; or <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-9\">(2) those which are present habitats for threatened or endangered species, \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-10\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-7a]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">Freshwater wetlands of \u201cordinary value\u201d were defined as those not of \u201cexceptional resource value\u201d and which were \u201ccertain isolated wetlands, man-made drainage ditches, swales, or detention facilities.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-7b. Freshwater wetlands of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>\u201cintermediate resource value\u201d were \u201call other freshwater wetlands.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-7c.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Under the statute (and the regulations), in addition to permits of varying strictness being required to develop \u201cwetlands,\u201d a DEP waiver was required for the development for \u201ctransition areas,\u201d defined as \u201cland adjacent to a freshwater wetland which minimizes adverse impacts on the wetland or serves as an integral component of the wetlands ecosystem.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-3. Under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-16(b), only wetlands of ordinary resource value required no transition areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The relevant primary effective date of the Act was July 1, 1988, but there were certain \u201cgrandfather\u201d permit exemptions, primarily for projects previously in the municipal approval process.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-4d.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Appellants\u2019 challenge to the regulations is narrow. They do not dispute that the regulations carefully tracked most statutory definitions. Appellants contend, however, that two regulations as adopted differed so from the versions proposed that DEP was required to hold new hearings with an opportunity for new public comment. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-4.9; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>1:30-4.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-4.9 provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-10\">Any rule proposed by a State agency which revises, rescinds or replaces either (1) any proposed ... rule ... shall be considered as a new rule----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-11\"><em>N.J.A.C. </em>1:30-4.3 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-12\">(a) Where, following the notice of a proposed rule, an agency determines to make changes in the proposed rule which are so substantial that the changes effectively destroy the value of the original notice, the agency shall give a new notice of proposed rule and public opportunity to be heard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-13\">(b) In determining whether the changes in the proposed rule are so substantial, consideration shall be given to the extent that the changes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-14\">1. Enlarge or curtail who and what will be affected by the proposed rule;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-15\">2. Change what is being prescribed, proscribed or otherwise mandated by the rule;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>3. Enlarge or curtail the scope of the proposed rule and its burden on those affected by it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Appellants urge that the changes in question were \u201csubstantial,\u201d relying upon <em>Insurance Brokers Assn. of N.J. v. Sheeran, </em>162 <em>N.J.Super. </em>34, 40, 392 A.2d 203 (App.Div.1978), certif. den. 78 <em>N.J. </em>408, 396 A.2d 594 (1978). DEP argues to the contrary. In <em>Insurance Brokers, </em>we quoted with approval that \u201c \u2018[t]he requirement of submission of a proposed rule for comment does not automatically generate a new opportunity for comment merely because the rule promulgated by the agency differs from the rule it proposed, partly at least in response to submissions---- If [the opposite] were the rule the proceedings might never be terminated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>International Harvester Co. v. Ruckelshaus, </em>478 <em>F.2d </em>615, 632 (D.C.Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">We have carefully reviewed the changes to which appellants refer and reject their challenge to the regulatory \u201cswale\u201d definition <em>(N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-1.4) as unfounded. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-23b; <em>N.J. Guild of Hearing Aid Dispensers v. Long, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>544, 561, 384 A.2d 795 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">We find appellants\u2019 challenge to DEP\u2019s regulation eliminating transition areas for projects which had received preliminary municipal approval before July 1, 1989, however, merited, not only because the promulgated regulation was a substantial change from the proposed regulation, but because it was unwarranted by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">As originally proposed, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-2.7(c) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-11\">Projects not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States Army Corps of Engineers and for which preliminary site or subdivision applications have been approved <em>prior to July 1, 1988 </em>shall not require transition areas. [Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">After the comment period, however, this regulation was renumbered <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-2.7(f) and the date was changed to \u201cJuly 1, <em>1989.\u201d </em>This change was based on comments which relied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>the last section of the Act, L.1987, <em>c. </em>156, \u00a7 34, providing that the <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-16, -17 and -18 provisions respecting transition areas were not to be implemented until July 1, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">In support of its regulation as promulgated, DEP contends there were <em>two </em>effective dates: July 1,1988 for wetland regulation and July 1, 1989 for transition area requirements <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-6 through 18). In this interpretation DEP relies on a statement attached to the Senate Committee substitute bill (which became the Act), saying \u201c[t]his bill ... would take effect one year after enactment____ The sections of the bill imposing the transition area requirements would not take effect until two years after enactment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">The law as enacted says,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-10\">This act shall <em>take effect </em>one year after enactment, except that section 25, section 26, section 27, section 30 and section 33 shall <em>take effect </em>immediately, and except that the department shall not <em>implement </em>the provisions of sections 16, 17 and 18 [the transition area requirements] until two years after enactment. The department shall take any administrative actions prior to the <em>effective </em>date of this act necessary to <em>implement </em>the provisions of this act on and after the <em>effective </em>date.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> [L.1987, <em>c. </em>156, \u00a7 34; emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">Appellants argue plain meaning, emphasizing the difference between the words \u201ctake effect\u201d and \u201cimplement.\u201d They assert that developers of projects with transition areas, while not subjected to DEP regulation before July 1, 1989, could not be exempt from such regulations unless they either applied for preliminary municipal approvals before June 8,1987 or obtained such approvals before July 1, 1988 <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-4d). They argue that the legislative purpose of providing for an additional year to \u201cimplement\u201d the statute was to give DEP time to finalize the regulations and to give developers time to finish projects which had been started, not to give developers an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>additional year in which to obtain a preliminary approval and permanent exemption from regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">DEP responds that the \u201ceffective\u201d and \u201cimplementation\u201d dates must be synonymous, because if the Act created transition areas as of July 1, 1988, but DEP could not \u201cimplement\u201d the statute until July 1,1989, the transition areas created would be without regulation during the intervening year. In this interpretation DEP cites <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-30, providing that on the <em>effective date </em>of the Act, the Act would supersede local regulation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, DEP urges that permit applicants in August of 1988 \u201cwould not know until sometime after July 1, 1989 whether they could build in the transition area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">While in our review of DEP\u2019s interpretation of legislative intent, we must be guided by DEP\u2019s expertise and the fact that the Legislature designated DEP to interpret the statute, we may not accept its regulation if it varies from the statute. <em>See In re Jamesburg High School Closing, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>540, 549, 416 A.2d 896 (1980); <em>N.J. Chamb. Commerce v. N.J. Elec. Law Enforce. Comm., </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>57, 82-83, 411 A.2d 168 (1980). If there is a anomaly in the statute, DEP cannot rewrite the statute through its regulations. If the regulation is plainly at odds with the statute, it is <em>ultra vires. See Last Chance Development v. Kean, </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>115, 128, 556 A.2d 796 (App.Div.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The law was precise in defining what projects were to be exempt from transition area requirements. These exemptions included</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">Projects for which (1) preliminary site plan or subdivision applications have received preliminary approvals from local authorities ... prior to the effective date [July X, X988] of this act, [or] (2) preliminary site plan or subdivision applications have been submitted prior to June 8, X987____ <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-4d]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">The third relevant exemption was that wetlands of ordinary resource value did not require transition areas. <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>13:9B-16a. Yet DEP\u2019s regulation provided that projects which had received preliminary municipal approval as late as July 1, 1989 required no transition areas. That interpretation extended the exemptions beyond the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Moreover, this result is not only contrary to legislative intent as expressed, which directed DEP to regulate post-July-1989 construction, it is against the legislative history.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the Governor\u2019s executive order, which was issued June 8, 1987, the Governor particularly spoke of the danger presented by the inappropriate development of these \u201cbuffer\u201d areas from \u201cincreased runoff, sedimentation and introduction of pollutants\u201d to the wetlands. Executive Order 175.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The statute described the transition area as a \u201csediment and stormwater control zone to reduce the impacts of development upon freshwater wetlands____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-16a(2). While a plan to manage development runoff may be required by the municipality at the time of preliminary subdivision approval, that plan may be less than precise, so long as the \u201cfundamental elements,\u201d are \u201cresolved at least as to [the] feasibility of specific proposals or solutions before preliminary approval is granted.\u201d <em>Field v. Franklin Tp., </em>190 <em>N.J.Super. </em>326, 332-333, 463 A.2d 391 (App. Div.1983), certif. den. 95 <em>N.J. </em>183, 470 A.2d 409 (1983). Such a plan may be declared feasible by the municipality without adequate consideration for adjoining wetlands.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>The transition area regulations as proposed contain DEP\u2019S informed reference to the impact of certain activities carried on in the land immediately bordering the wetlands, not only respecting \u201cexcavation\u201d, \u201cdumping\u201d, \u201cerection of structures\u201d, but also the \u201cplacement of pavements\u201d and \u201cdestruction of plant life\u201d. 21 <em>N.J.R. </em>598 (March 6, 1989), proposed <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-6.2(a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Particularly regulated is the construction of \u201cstormwater management facilities\u201d and \u201c[l]inear development\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 602, proposed <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-7.4(a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The proposed regulations also refer to a standard by which DEP would determine a project\u2019s required distance from a wetland (of exceptional resource value), using a matrix of \u201cdevelopment intensity\u201d, which is defined as \u201cthe percentage of the surface area ... which will be covered by impervious surfaces at the completion of the proposed project\u201d, including \u201cpavement, rooftops, sidewalks, driveways, tennis courts and swimming pools.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601, proposed <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-7.2(e)3. If <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-2.-7(f) remains in effect, the developer with 1988 municipal approval could never be required to comply with or to receive a waiver from any of these environmentally sensitive specifications regardless of the state of their actual construction or the lack of inconvenience to the developer, and regardless of how close the activity was to the wetlands or how sensitive the wetland was. The project would be free from further regulation as well.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>The legislation and its history are consistent. The intent was that there be no prohibition against construction in a future transition area based on a municipal approval until the \u201ctransition area requirements ... take effect.\u201d Senate Committee Statement. Upon the date of regulation implementation, July 1, 1989, the project would become subject to State regulation as well as municipal. The important statutory requirement was that the preliminary municipal approval would not \u201cimmunize the owner from valid subsequently adopted legislation, state or municipal.\u201d <em>Tremarco Corporation v. Garzio, </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>448, 457, 161 A.2d 241 (1960), quoting <em>Roselle v.

To that end the Legislature directed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ_\">Any person may maintain an action in a court of competent jurisdiction against any other person to enforce, or to restrain the violation of, any statute, regulation or ordinance which is designed to prevent or minimize pollution, impairment or destruction of the environment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOW\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:35A-4a]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-10\"><em>See Girandola v.

Consequently, the DEP was not required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>to give a new notice and opportunity for the public to be heard before adopting these regulations. I also agree with the majority that the definition of \u201cswale\u201d in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-1.4 is consistent with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-7b.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the Legislature intended DEP\u2019s transition area regulations to be applied retroactively to development projects which received site plan or subdivision approval prior to their adoption. Therefore, I dissent from the part of the majority\u2019s opinion which invalidates <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:7A-2.7(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act is highly significant new environmental legislation which provides for strict regulation of activities in freshwater wetlands areas. Because my disagreement with the majority is limited to the part of its opinion which invalidates DEP\u2019s regulation relating to the operation of the transition area requirements, I have limited my discussion to the sections of the Act dealing with this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">A \u201ctransition area\u201d is defined as \u201can area of land adjacent to a freshwater wetland which minimizes adverse impacts on the wetland or serves as an integral component of the wetlands ecosystem.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-3. All wetlands of \u201cexceptional\u201d or \u201cintermediate\u201d resource value must have adjacent transition areas. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-7. The purpose of a transition area is to provide \u201c(1) ... temporary refuge for freshwater wetlands fauna during high water episodes, critical habitat for animals dependent upon ... freshwater wetlands, ... slight variations of freshwater wetlands boundaries over time due to hydrologic or climatologic effects, and (2) sediment and storm water control zone to reduce the impact of development upon freshwater wetlands and freshwater wetlands species.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-16a. The Act does not define the parameters of transition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>areas but rather imposes that responsibility upon DEP, subject to statutory standards which include maximum and minimum widths. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-16b; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-17c. The erection of any structure, except a temporary structure of 150 square feet or less, the placement of pavement, the removal, excavation or disturbance of the soil, the dumping or filling of any material and the destruction of plant life are all prohibited in transition areas. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-17a. However, DEP may grant waivers from these prohibitions, if a property owner can satisfy the conditions set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">In order to place the issue on which I disagree with the majority in perspective, it is appropriate to outline the legislative history of the Act relating to transition areas. The Act was derived from Assembly Bills 2342 and 2499. Assembly Bill 2342 provided for regulation by DEP of both wetlands and adjoining areas, described as \u201cbuffer zones,\u201d which could extend up to 300 feet beyond the wetlands area. The bill also provided that it would take effect within 180 days of enactment. However, Assembly Bill 2499 provided for the regulation of wetlands only, not any adjoining areas, and delayed the effective date of the Act until the State secured authorization to take over the permit jurisdiction of the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1344. After conducting extensive public hearings, the Assembly Energy and Natural Resources Committee favorably reported a committee substitute for both bills. The committee substitute endorsed the provisions for wetlands buffer zones contained in A-2342, but renamed them \u201ctransition areas\u201d and reduced the width of these areas to a maximum of 150 feet if they adjoin a wetland of \u201cexceptional resource value\u201d and 50 feet if they adjoin a wetland of \u201cintermediate resource value.\u201d The committee substitute also endorsed the provision of A-2499 which provided that the Act would not take effect until the State received authorization to assume the wetlands permit jurisdiction of the Army Corps of Engineers.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Subsequently, the Senate Energy and Environment Committee drafted its own substitute for the Assembly committee substitute, which was passed by both houses of the Legislature and signed by the Governor. While retaining most of the provisions of the Assembly committee substitute relating to transition areas, the Senate committee substitute substantially changed the provisions of the Assembly bill relating to the effective date of the Act. The pertinent section reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">This act shall take effect one year after enactment, except that section 25, section 26, section 27, section 30 and section 33 shall take effect immediately, and except that the department shall not implement the provisions of sections 16, 17 and 18 [the transition area requirements] until two years after enactment. The department shall take any administrative actions prior to the effective date of this act necessary to implement the provisions of this act on and after the effective date. [L.1987, c. 156, \u00a7 34],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Significantly, the Senate Committee specifically described the intent of this section in a statement to its substitute bill:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A97\">The freshwater wetlands regulatory program established in this bill would be phased in over two years. This bill ... would take effect one year after enactment, with several important exceptions. <em>The sections of the bill imposing the transition area requirements would not take effect until two years after enactment. [Statement to Senate Energy and Environment Committee Substitute for Assembly Committee Substitute </em>for Assembly Bills Nos. 2342 and 2499, p. 5 (June 25, 1987); emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">One commentary has aptly stated that the Act, as it evolved through the legislative process, reflects a \u201cdelicate compromise\u201d between environmentalists and developers. <em>English &amp; Samo, The Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act: Give and \u201cTake\u201d in New Jersey, </em>12 <em>Seton Hall Leg.J. </em>249 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">Despite the explicit statement by the Senate committee which drafted the substitute bill enacted into law that \u201c[t]he sections of the bill imposing the transition area requirements would not take effect until two years after enactment\u201d and the well established principle that \u201c[statements appended to bills are useful aids in ascertaining legislative intent,\u201d <em>Howard Savings Institution v. Kielb, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>186, 195, 183 A.2d 401 (1962), the majority concludes that the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of section 34 requires that the transition area requirements be applied to all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>projects approved after July 1, 1988. Because the Legislature stated that other sections of the Act would \u201ctake effect\u201d one year after enactment but also stated in the same section that the DEP should not \u201cimplement\u201d the transition area requirements until two years after enactment, the majority reasons that the word \u201cimplement\u201d must have a different meaning than the term \u201ctake effect.\u201d However, as anyone familiar with the legislative process is aware, statutory language is not aiways precise and clear, especially when it is hammered out in the rough and tumble of committee deliberations, and it is not uncommon for the Legislature to use different language to express the same objective. Moreover, the difference in language within section 34 may simply reflect a legislative impression that the transition area requirements would necessarily remain completely dormant until DEP adopted implementing regulations while other sections of the Act could become operative without any action by DEP. And even if the majority\u2019s assumption that \u201cimplement\u201d and \u201ctake effect\u201d must have different meanings were indulged, the meaning of the word \u201cimplement\u201d as used in section 34 still would not be \u201cplain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Statutory interpretation should \u201cturn on the breadth of the objectives of the legislation and the common sense of the situation\u201d rather than \u201cliteralisms.\u201d <em>Jersey City Chapter of Property Owner\u2019s Ass\u2019n v. Jersey City, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>86, 100, 259 A.2d 698 (1969). In other words, \u201c[w]e should assume the Legislature intended a reasonable approach, and we should construe the statute to provide one if we can.\u201d <em>Roman v. Sharper, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>338, 341, 250 A.2d 745 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The majority fails to ascribe any reasonable purpose to the Legislature\u2019s making the transition area provisions of the Act \u201ceffective\u201d on July 1,1988, while prohibiting DEP from \u201cimplementing\u201d them until July 1, 1989. Because <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-16 confers the authority upon DEP to establish the parameters of transition areas, it cannot be determined from the Act itself whether particular property is located within a transition area. Consequently, the majority acknowledges that the transition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>area sections of the Act could not become operative until DEP adopted implementing regulations. (At 233). Therefore, the import of the majority\u2019s opinion is that the transition area requirements did not take effect until July 1, 1989, when DEP\u2019s implementing regulations became operative, but that those regulations now apply retroactively to any development project which received site plan or subdivision approval between July 1, 1988 and July 1, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">A regulation adopted by an administrative agency to implement legislation, such as DEP transition area regulations, is legislative in nature. <em>Metromedia, Inc. v. Director, Division of Taxation, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>313, 328-337, 478 A.2d 742 (1984). Consequently, administrative regulations are ordinarily construed to be solely prospective in operation. <em>Bowen v. Georgetown University Hospital, </em>488 <em>U.S. </em>204, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>468, 102 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>493 (1988); <em>see also 2 Davis, Administrative Law Treatise, </em>\u00a7 7.23 (2d ed. 1979). In fact, our Supreme Court has indicated that one hallmark of an administrative regulation is that it has \u201cprospective effect.\u201d <em>Metromedia, Inc. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 329, 478 A.2d 742. Regulations ordinarily do not apply retroactively because \u201c[pjersons subject to regulation are entitled to something more than a general declaration of statutory purpose to guide their conduct before they are restricted or penalized by an agency for what it then decides was wrong from its hindsight conception of what the public interest requires in the particular situation.\u201d <em>Boller Beverages, Inc. v. Davis, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>138, 152, 183 A.2d 64 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Since administrative regulations ordinarily operate only prospectively, it seems improbable that the Legislature intended the initial regulations of areas adjoining wetlands, adopted pursuant to enabling legislation reflecting a \u201cdelicate compromise\u201d between environmentalists and developers, to apply retroactively to projects which were approved before the regulations were adopted. These regulations are substantive in nature and have enormous potential impact upon pending development plans. Property owners who obtained site plan or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>subdivision approvals from July 1, 1988 to July 1, 1989 could not reasonably have anticipated what areas the DEP would designate as transition areas. Consequently, numerous approved plans undoubtedly include proposed development in areas which the DEP has now designated transition areas. If the property owners have already built in these areas, will they now be required to remove buildings or other structures unless DEP grants a transition area waiver pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-18? Or will property owners who have completed construction be exempted from the transition area requirements? If so, will property owners who commenced but did not complete construction in transition areas before July 1, 1989 be subject to these requirements? Will they now be required to halt construction in order either to litigate their right to complete their projects or to apply to DEP for transition area waivers? If the Legislature had actually intended the DEP\u2019s transition area regulations to apply retroactively, it undoubtedly would have addressed these questions rather than placing property owners with approved development plans in the uncertain state in which they will find themselves upon issuance of the majority\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The portion of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-4 quoted by the majority (at 230) and section 34 of the Act have different operative effects. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-4 establishes complete exemptions from all permit requirements of the Act. In contrast, section 34 establishes phased implementation of different provisions of the Act, including in particular transition area requirements. Thus, unless a property owner filed for site plan or subdivision approval prior to June 8, 1987 or received such approval prior to July 1, 1988, it would not be exempt under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-4d(l) and (2). Consequently, the property owner would be required to apply to DEP for a wetlands permit. However, this wetlands application would not be subject to transition area requirements if the development project received local land use approval prior to the effective date of those requirements. Therefore, there is no inconsistency between the subsections of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-4d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>quoted by the majority and the conclusion that the transition area requirements apply only prospectively. Furthermore, to construe the provisions of the Act in a harmonious manner consistent with the committee statement to the substitute Senate bill, the phrase \u201ceffective date of this act,\u201d as used in the final sentence of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-4, should be construed to refer to the date on which the transition area requirements became effective pursuant to section 34, <em>i.e., </em>July 1, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">If there were any doubt that the Legislature did not intend DEP\u2019s transition area regulations to apply retroactively, we should resolve that doubt in favor of the DEP\u2019s conclusion that its regulations apply only prospectively. It is firmly established that the courts \u201cgive substantial deference to the interpretation an agency gives to a statute that the agency is charged with enforcing.\u201d <em>Smith v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>19, 25, 527 A.2d 843 (1987). In light of the fact that the burden will now fall upon DEP to process applications for transition area waivers and other pleas for relief by property owners adversely affected by the retroactive application of the transition area regulations, this would be an especially appropriate case in which to apply this principle of judicial deference to the enforcing agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Finally, I note that this court has previously held that the provisions of the Wetlands Act of 1970 regulating tidal and coastal wetlands did not become operative until they were implemented by DEP. <em>Loveladies Property Owners Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Raab, </em>137 <em>N.J.Super. </em>179, 348 A.2d 540 (App.Div.1975). In that case, we stated that \u201c[t]he intricacy of the statutory definition of \u2018coastal wetlands,\u2019 coupled with the broad scope of \u2018regulated activities,\u2019 and the administrative burden of classifying wetlands on a case by case basis, are strong, practical reasons for the position that enforcement of the act by permits for regulated activities is dependent upon the prior mapping of wetlands and the promulgation of a wetlands order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 184, 348 A.2d 540. We should be equally responsive to such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>practical considerations in construing the Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-8\">I also have joined in the majority\u2019s disposition of the companion appeal of the New Jersey Builders Association, captioned <em>In the Matter of the Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act Rules, N.J.A.C. 7:7A-1.1 et seq., </em>A-132-88T5, which involves challenges to various sections of the DEP\u2019s freshwater wetlands regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
