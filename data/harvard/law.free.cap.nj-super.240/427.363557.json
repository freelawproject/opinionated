Her insurer, Allstate Insurance Company (Allstate), joined in the matter; then she and Allstate filed a third-party complaint against Agency for a declaratory judgment that Agency, not Allstate, was responsible to the extent of its coverage to indemnify Howard for the settlement and cost of defense of plaintiffs claim. The amount of the settlement, $20,000, is not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-14\">Judge David Follender granted a summary judgment to Allstate from which Agency appeals. The judge determined that Agency, a certified self-insurer under the New Jersey motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>vehicle security-responsibility law, must act as defendant Howard\u2019s primary insurer and reimburse Allstate for the first $15,000 Allstate paid in settlement of plaintiff\u2019s claim. Furthermore, he awarded legal fees to Allstate in the amount of $3,214.38 to cover the fees and expenses Allstate incurred in defending the underlying tort claim. He denied Allstate\u2019s application for fees relating to the third-party declaratory judgment action. Allstate has cross-appealed from the denial of the latter legal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The facts in this case are unusual only insofar as Agency\u2019s mode of doing business differ^ from the usual car rental format. Agency does not lease cars to all members of the public. It restricts its customers to owners of other vehicles whose cars are lost, stolen or, as here, under repair, and whose insurance contracts cover temporary substitute vehicles as additional insured vehicles. The rental contract signed by Howard required that she have her own liability insurance coverage covering her operation of Agency\u2019s vehicle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">THIS VEHICLE IS COVERED FOR PHYSICAL DAMAGE ONLY. INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR LIABILITY AND DAMAGE TO PROPERTY OF OTHERS IS TO BE PROVIDED BY CUSTOMER\u2019S EXISTING INSURANCE UNDER THE TEMPORARY SUBSTITUTE PROVISIONS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-8\">7. Customer represents and warrants that he has a valid policy of automobile liability insurance in force at the time of this rental and further represents and warrants that he shall maintain said policy of automobile liability insurance in force during the term of this rental. Lessor relying on said warranty and representation is not providing Liability-Property Damage automobile insurance or medical expense coverage to the Customer or any other person using or riding in said Vehicle.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Agency asserts that it had reduced its rental fee to reflect the fact that it does not supply its lessees with liability cover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>age, but rather looks to the lessee\u2019s own contract of insurance. Furthermore, Agency verified that the contract was in effect and that it covered the replacement vehicle. When Howard entered into the contract, her Allstate policy specifically provided coverage for an automobile \u201cused as a temporary substitute\u201d while the originally insured vehicle \u201cis out of normal use because of ... repair.\u201d The Allstate policy, however, contains an additional clause concerning which Agency made no inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aoh\">If there is other applicable liability insurance we will pay only our share of the loss. Our share is the proportion that our limit of liability bears to the total of all applicable limits. <em>However, any insurance we provide for a vehicle you do not own shall be excess over any other collectible insurance. </em>[Emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Therefore, allegedly unbeknown to Agency, the individual insurance possessed by Howard was by its terms excess rather than primary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Agency\u2019s principal defense to Allstate\u2019s claim of exclusion based on this policy language concerns Agency\u2019s status as a self-insured, rather than the holder of a traditional separate policy of insurance covering its fleet of rental cars. We, as did the judge, reject this defense. While we recognize that the claim here has not been made under the financial responsibility law, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>45:21-1 <em>et seq.; N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-3 and 39:6B-1, Agency\u2019s decision to act as a self-insurer and secure the applicable New Jersey certificate was the functional equivalent of its writing a separate insurance policy covering itself. <em>Cf. Ross v. Transport of New Jersey, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>132, 139-142, 553 <em>A.2d 12 </em>(1989); <em>Transport of New Jersey v. Watler, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>400, 401, 400 A.2d 61 (1979); <em>Mortimer v. Peterkin, </em>170 <em>N.J.Super. </em>598, 600, 407 A.2d 1235 (App.Div.1979); <em>Crocker v.

Belford Trucking Co., </em>121 <em>N.J.Super. </em>583, 584, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>298 A.2d 288 (App.Div.1972), certif. den. 63 <em>N.J. </em>502 (1973) (under the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 315, and applicable regulations); and <em>cf. Comorote v. Massey, </em>110 <em>N.J. Super. </em>124, 128, 264 A.2d 478 (Law Div.1970) (under an earlier statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6-46 (repealed)); <em>and see </em>8A <em>Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, </em>\u00a7 4912 (1981); Annotation, <em>Self-Insurance Against Liability As Other Insurance Within Meaning Of Liability Insurance Policy, </em>46 <em>A.L.R.4th </em>707 \u00a7\u00a7. 3[a] and [b] (1986). In fact, the Supreme Court in <em>Ross v. Transport of New Jersey, </em>albeit in the uninsured motorist context, stated that \u201ca private company\u2019s certificate of self-insurance is said to constitute an insurance \u2018policy\u2019 which subjects it to Title 17 UM requirements.\u201d 114 <em>N.J. </em>at 139, 553 A.2d 12. These cases, however, all relate to a member of the public opposing the self-insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">In <em>Am. Nurses Ass\u2019n. v. Passaic General Hosp., </em>192 <em>N.J. Super. </em>486, 471 A.2d 66 (App.Div.1984), modified 98 <em>N.J. </em>83, 484 A.2d 670 (1984), this court characterized as a type of self-insurance an insured\u2019s retained deductible on a liability policy. Judge Pressler explained that such \u201cself-insurance\u201d is a legal or contractual assumption of certain risks, and not really insurance at all. (192 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 491, 471 A.2d 66). However, in the context of compulsory liability insurance, this undertaking may be conveniently termed \u201cqualified self-insurance,\u201d and \u201chas been held to require the self-insurer to provide the public sought to be protected by the compulsory insurance with the same \u2018coverage\u2019 and incidents of \u2018coverage\u2019 as [the self-insured] would have had to have purchased but for the certificate of self-insurance.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 492, 471 A.2d 66). In that opinion Judge Pressler stated that this conclusion would not necessarily carry over to \u201cother insurance\u201d questions between insureds and insurers. Further, she noted that \u201cthe weight of authority rejects the premise that qualified self-insurance is other insurance on the theory that self-insurance and insurance are mutually exclusive concepts.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 493, 471 A.2d 66). Without expressing, a view, she recognized that <em>Carolina Cas. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number><em>Ins. Co. v. Belford Trucking Co., supra, </em>indicates that \u201cNew Jersey apparently follows the minority view\u201d which supports the principle \u201cthat qualified self-insurance constitutes other insurance.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Supreme Court in affirming <em>Am. Nurses Ass\u2019n. </em>(except for a modification on the liability ratio above the $100,000 which was subject to the \u201cself-insurance\u201d claim), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">Though a deductible is frequently referred to as self-insurance, its functional purpose is simply to alter the point at which an insurance company\u2019s obligation to pay will ripen. \u201c \u2018Other insurance\u2019 [in an excess provision] means a policy of insurance of like kind issued by an insurance company in exchange for a premium charged.\u201d [16 <em>G. Couch, Insurance </em>2d \u00a7 62.87 (rev. ed. 1983). While there is a split of authority on this question, the tendency has been not to regard self-insurance as \u201cinsurance.\u201d [98 <em>N.J. </em>at 88-89, 484 A.2d 670].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Both Judge Pressler\u2019s discussion of this issue and Justice Schreiber\u2019s confirming language on the point hold only that \u201cself-insurance\u201d to the extent that it represents an insured\u2019s deductible amount above which a policy will be effective, is not to be considered other insurance. We have before us a third type of self-insurance claim, one concerning the self-insured <em>qua </em>insurer and another insurer. We should not extrapolate from the <em>Am. Nurses Ass\u2019n </em>language to hold that an entity which has chosen to self-insure under the financial responsibility laws should <em>vis-a-vis </em>other insurers escape the collateral effects of such undertaking. While Agency may choose to save insurance premiums by self-insuring its vehicles, it should not be permitted to do so partially at the expense of other insurers who normally would look to each other under the \u201cother insurance\u201d provisions of their policies, and who have set their rates accordingly. Since only financially responsible owners of 25 or more vehicles may become certified self-insureds <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>39:6-52), those best able to pay would be permitted by this device to shift the costs of accidents to the non-fleet owners of other vehicles and their insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Agency contends, however, that its business was predicated upon such a shift in liability, and its lower rates were set upon this premise. Furthermore, it alleges that much of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>business is referred by insurance agents and the insurance companies have taken advantage of its lower rates set upon the express premise that the lessees\u2019 carriers would be primarily responsible. We do not disapprove of this method of doing business, except to note that in the case before us Agency accepted a policy that did not provide for primary responsibility. Had it examined the policy, it either could have rejected Ms. Howard as a lessee, or might have sought a waiver of the other-insurance clause from Allstate, since Allstate was paying for the rental and thereby was taking advantage of the lower rates. Not having done this, Agency should not be heard to complain when we give effect to the other-insurance clause in Allstate\u2019s policy and consider Agency\u2019s certificate of self-insurance as the equivalent of \u201cother collectible insurance\u201d within the meaning of the Allstate policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The second issue raised on the appeal and cross-appeal is the allowance of fees to Allstate for the defense of the underlying action and the denial of fees for the declaratory judgment portion of the case. We have no question that Allstate was entitled to be reimbursed for the defense of the primary claim, since both the trial judge and we determined that Allstate\u2019s responsibility was secondary only.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Allstate contends, however, that the denial of fees to prosecute its third-party claim appeared arbitrary and that the judge mistakenly exercised his discretion in denying a further award. An excess insurer may be entitled to recover its expenses in successfully prosecuting \u201ca coverage action against the primary carrier when the latter has wrongfully refused to defend its assured.\u201d <em>Tooker v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>136 <em>N.J.Super. </em>572, 576, 347 A.2d 371 (App.Div.1975), certif. den. 70 <em>N.J. </em>137, 358 A.2d 184 (1976). <em>R. </em>4:42-9(a)(6), permits the award of counsel fees \u201c[i]n an action upon a liability or indemnity policy of insurance, in favor of a successful claimant.\u201d The purpose of this rule \u201cwas to discourage groundless disclaimers by assessing against the insurers ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>penses incurred by their assureds in enforcing coverage.\u201d <em>Felicetta v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>117 <em>N.J.Super. </em>524, 528, 285 A.2d 242 (App.Div.1971), certif. den. 60 <em>N.J. </em>141, 286 A.2d 514 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The court\u2019s authority to grant such fees, however, does not require that fees be awarded in every case. A trial judge exercises judicial discretion, weighing \u201cconsiderations of an equitable character.\u201d <em>Felicetta v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>117 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 529, 285 A.2d 242. Included in such considerations are \u201cthe assureds\u2019 course of conduct,\u201d <em>ibid, </em>as well as \u201cthe debatability of the statutory construction issue ... [and] the comparatively small amount of the claim involved.\u201d <em>Helton v. Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>196, 201, 500 A.2d 717 (App.Div.1985), quoting from <em>Maros v. Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>572, 579, 388 A.2d 971 (1978). While no detailed reasons were given here for the denial of these attorney\u2019s fees, the issue certainly was not clear when the third-party complaint for declaratory judgment was filed. <em>Am. Nurses Ass\u2019n. v. Passaic General Hosp., supra, </em>noted the split in authority and \u201cthe tendency ... not to regard self-insurance as \u2018insurance.\u2019 \u201d 98 <em>N.J. </em>at 89, 484 A.2d 670. Agency\u2019s position therefore was not unreasonable. It does not appear to us, nor apparently to the trial judge, that Agency\u2019s refusal to pay the claim was made in bad faith or to avoid liability on its policy of insurance. In such circumstances between insurers, as opposed to a claim between insured and insurer, it does no violence to the general principles of <em>R. </em>4:42-9(a) to have each party bear its own legal fees to settle this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-10\">This provision is clearly ineffective if its purpose was to relieve the lessor from its responsibility to carry public liability insurance. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:21-1 <em>et seq.; Rao </em>v. <em>Universal Underwriters, Ins. Co., </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>396, 401-404, 549 A.2d 1259 (App.Div.1988). Here, however, the presumed intended, but ineffective, purpose was to shift responsibility to the lessee\u2019s insurer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b463-8\">We express no opinion as to whether by maintaining only excess insurance, Howard violated the terms of the rental agreement quoted earlier, and might be liable to Agency. The issue was not raised.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
