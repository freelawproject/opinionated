Following a lengthy jury trial, defendant was convicted of second degree robbery, a lesser-included offense of the first degree robbery charged in Count 1 and two counts of simple assault, the lesser-included offenses of the aggravated assault charged in Counts 2 and 3. Defendant\u2019s motions for a new trial or, alternatively, a judgment of acquittal notwithstanding the verdict were denied. The State\u2019s motion to sentence defendant to an extended term as a persistent offender pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3 was granted. The trial court thereupon committed defendant to the custody of the Commissioner of the Department of Corrections for a term of 15 years with a seven-and-one-half year period of parole ineligibility and assessed a Violent Crimes Compensation Board penalty of $30 for the second degree robbery. Additionally, the trial court committed defendant to two concurrent terms of six months each and assessed Violent Crimes Compensation Board penalties totaling $60 for the two simple assaults. Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">According to the State\u2019s proofs, on April 8, 1987, at approximately 6:00 p.m., two store detectives employed at Bradlees in Stratford, New Jersey, Joseph Berger (Berger) and Barbara Brosmer (Brosmer), were in the Loss Prevention Office monitoring the store\u2019s surveillance cameras. Berger and Brosmer observed an individual, later identified as defendant, enter the store and walk over to the \u201csight and sound\u201d section of the store. Berger and Brosmer were suspicious of defendant be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>cause he had been in the store previously and had acted in a manner which caught their attention, and because defendant was wearing a heavy field jacket when the day was very warm and the store air-conditioning was not working. Consequently, Berger and Brosmer continued to observe defendant\u2019s activity in the store by using the cameras. Berger and Brosmer saw defendant remove two stereo radios with cassette players (\u201cboom boxes\u201d) from the shelves and place them in a large, dark plastic bag which had been concealed under his jacket. Defendant then walked through one of the registers without paying for the radios and left the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Meanwhile, as defendant was walking towards the store exit, Berger telephoned Ken Polk (Polk), another store detective at the front of the store, and told him that a shoplifting was in progress and that the suspect would be attempting to leave the store. Polk waited outside. When defendant left the store, Polk showed defendant his identification and asked defendant if he had a receipt for the merchandise. Defendant looked in the bag he was carrying and then \u201cthrew a punch\u201d at Polk. When Polk avoided defendant\u2019s punch, defendant swung the bag containing the radios at Polk\u2019s head and ran past him. However, Robert Richards (Richards), another store employee, was standing in the parking lot and grabbed defendant. Defendant continued to struggle with Polk and Richards, and then with Berger who joined them outside. Eventually, however, defendant was subdued and brought inside the store. At that point, Richards went back outside and defendant was escorted in the direction of the office by Polk and Berger, who were then joined by Brosmer and Joseph Boccaleri (Boccaleri), a salesperson at Bradlees.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Approximately halfway through the store, defendant pushed Polk out of the way and \u201cbody-slammed\u201d Berger. When Brosmer stepped in his way and told him \u201cyou\u2019re not going nowhere,\u201d defendant turned around and punched her in the mouth. The employees then attempted to subdue defendant and put a pair of handcuffs on him. Defendant, however, \u201cfull <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>force punched\u201d Brosmer between the legs, which lifted her off the ground, and threw her into a display. As a result of defendant\u2019s punch, Brosmer sustained severe pelvic trauma. In addition, defendant punched Berger in the stomach. When Berger attempted to hit defendant in the jaw, defendant bent down. As a result, Berger hit defendant in the head, spraining his hand. Thereafter, defendant was subdued, handcuffed and taken to the security office, where the police were telephoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Defendant seeks a reversal of his convictions on the following grounds set forth in his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">I. THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN DENYING DEFENSE COUNSEL\u2019S REQUEST TO CHARGE THE JURY ON THE LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSE OF THEFT OR SHOPLIFTING.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">II. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN REFUSING TO GRANT THE JURY\u2019S REQUEST FOR A READ-BACK OF THE TESTIMONY OF TWO SIGNIFICANT WITNESSES (Not Raised Below).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">III. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN RULING THAT PENDING CHARGES COULD BE INTRODUCED TO DEMONSTRATE MOTIVE PURSUANT TO EVID. <em>R. </em>55 IF DEFENDANT ELECTED TO TESTIFY.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">Defendant first contends that the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury on theft or shoplifting because they were lesser-included offenses of second degree robbery. He argues that a factual issue was raised as to whether the alleged assaults upon Brosmer and Berger occurred during the course of the theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">The applicable standard for determining whether the trial court should charge a jury with respect to a lesser-included offense is set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-8e of the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-12\">The court shall not charge the jury with respect to an included offense unless there is a rational basis for a verdict convicting the defendant of the included offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-15\">Thus, where the evidence provides a rational basis upon which the defendant may be found guilty of an included offense and not guilty of the encompassing offense, it is reversible error for the court to refuse, upon request, to charge the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>with respect to the included offense. <em>See State v. Mauricio, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>402, 417-418, 568 A.2d 879 (1990); <em>State v. Crisantos (Arriagas), </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>265, 278, 508 A.2d 167 (1986); <em>State v. Choice, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>295, 298-299, 486 A.2d 833 (1985); <em>State v. Powell, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>305, 316 n. 12, 419 A.2d 406 (1980); <em>State v. Hollander, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>453, 473-474, 493 A.2d 563 (App. Div.), certif. den. 101 <em>N.J. </em>335, 501 A.2d 983 (1985); <em>State v. Vujosevic, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>435, 444-445, 487 A.2d 751 (App. Div.), certif. den. 101 <em>N.J. </em>247, 501 A.2d 920 (1985), <em>habeas corpus </em>granted, 844 <em>F.2d </em>1023 (3d Cir.1988). In <em>State v. Crisantos, supra, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 278, 508 A.2d 167, however, our Supreme Court emphasized that the Code formulation of the rational basis test is more restrictive than the pre-Code <em>Powell </em>guidelines under which a charge on a lesser-included offense was proper when there existed a \u201cscintilla of evidence\u201d with respect to that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Theft is not only a lesser-included offense of second degree robbery, but it is also an essential element of the offense. <em>See State v. Lawson, </em>217 <em>N.J.Super. </em>47, 51, 524 A.2d 1278 (App. Div.1987); <em>State v. Carlos, </em>187 <em>N.J.Super. </em>406, 412, 455 A.2d 89 (App.Div.1982). Under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1a, a person is guilty of robbery if, in the course of committing a theft, he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">(1) Inflicts bodily injury or uses force upon another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">(2) Threatens another with or purposely puts him in fear of immediate bodily injury; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-9\">An act shall be deemed to be included in the phrase \u201cin the course of committing a theft\u201d if it occurs in an attempt to commit theft or in immediate flight after the attempt or commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">A person is guilty of theft if he violates any of the substantive sections of <em>Chapter </em>20 of the Code, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-1 to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-34. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-3a denominates the unlawful taking of movable property a theft:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-11\">a. Movable property. A person is guilty of theft if he unlawfully takes, or exercises unlawful control over, movable property of another with purpose to deprive him thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AM3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-11b, dealing with shoplifting, provides in part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">b. Shoplifting. Shoplifting shall consist of any one or more of the following acts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">(1) For any person purposely to take possession of, carry away, transfer or cause to be carried away or transferred, any merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered for sale by any store or other retail mercantile establishment with the intention of depriving the merchant of the possession, use or benefit of such merchandise or converting the same to the use of such person without paying to the merchant the full retail value thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">There is, of course, an \u201coverlap between the specific offense of shoplifting and the general theft provisions,\u201d Cannel, Criminal Code Annotated, Comment 2, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-11, and, therefore, one charged with shoplifting may also be prosecuted under the general theft provision. <em>See State v. Milano, </em>94 <em>N.J.Super. </em>337, 340, 228 A.2d 347 (App.Div.1967). <em>See also State v. Sein, </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>300, 556 A.2d 1298 (App.Div.), certif. granted 117 <em>N.J. </em>159, 564 A.2d 877 (1989). Moreover, \u201c[b]y virtue of the \u2018consolidation\u2019 provision of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-2(a), a defendant charged with robbery is now on notice that <em>any </em>conduct denominated as theft is within the four corners of a robbery indictment.\u201d <em>State v. Talley, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>385, 393, 466 A.2d 78 (1983) (emphasis in original); <em>State v. Rose, </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>511, 514, 568 A.2d 545 (App.Div.1990). Thus, theft of movable property in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-3a and shoplifting in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-11b are included offenses of second degree robbery. <em>See State v. Lawson, supra, </em>217 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 50-51, 524 A.2d 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">Since theft of movable property and shoplifting are lesser-included offenses of second degree robbery, we are satisfied that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury with respect to either of them. In our view, there was a rational basis in the evidence to convict the defendant of either theft of movable property in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-3a or shoplifting in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-11b and. to acquit him of second degree robbery. The jury might have rejected the State\u2019s proofs that defendant used force against Polk when he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>stopped after leaving the store and it might have found that defendant\u2019s infliction of bodily injury on Brosmer and Berger after he was returned to the store occurred after flight had been concluded and defendant was in custody. <em>Cf. State v. Mirault, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>492, 500-501, 457 A.2d 455 (1983). Thus, the jury might have found that the bodily injury to the two store detectives was not inflicted in the course of committing a theft. While such a result would have been extraordinary, it nevertheless could have been reached by the jury. Consequently, the trial court should have instructed the jury on the lesser-included offense of either theft of movable property or shoplifting.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Even though the evidence that defendant was guilty of second degree robbery is overwhelming, we are constrained to reverse defendant\u2019s conviction for second degree robbery and remand the matter for a new trial on that charge. We suggest that if, on retrial, the evidence is the same as it was in this matter, the trial court should relate the evidence more precisely to the legal issues involved so that the jury\u2019s determination as to whether a second degree robbery occurred is not solely limited to or based upon the infliction of bodily injury upon Berger and Brosmer by defendant after he had been brought back into the store, as was done in the supplemental charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">We have carefully considered the remaining contentions (Points II and III, <em>supra) </em>and all arguments advanced in support of them and find that they clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2). We, therefore, affirm defendant\u2019s convictions for simple assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">Accordingly, except to reverse defendant\u2019s conviction for second degree robbery and to remand the matter for a new trial on that charge, the judgment under review is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
