Plaintiff, on behalf of the estate of her mother, Lucy Vuocolo (decedent); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>sought to recover damages for pain and suffering which occurred during her mother\u2019s lifetime as a result of contracting pancreatic cancer. She alleged that dioxin, a toxic substance which defendant released into the environment, substantially increased decedent\u2019s risk of contracting cancer. The trial court, on cross-motions for summary judgment, held that plaintiff had failed to establish her claim and dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">In 1955, defendant\u2019s predecessor, Diamond Alkali, put into operation a chemical plant at 80 Lister Avenue in the Ironbound section of Newark. In 1960, an explosion at the Lister Avenue plant released a large amount of dioxin, a dangerous by-product of the chemical process, into the environment. An additional amount of dioxin was dispersed some time later when the building was destroyed and removed from the site. Although the explosion occurred in 1960, it was not until 1983 that the explosion and the dioxin release became public knowledge. Thereafter, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) conducted tests in the area surrounding the Lister Avenue plant. On September 16,1985, the DEP took soil samples from decedent\u2019s property and tested them for dioxin. By letter dated November 22, 1985, the DEP informed plaintiff that only harmless trace amounts of dioxin were discovered in the samples and that remedial action was not necessary. The DEP also determined that there were no harmful concentrations of dioxin in the other homes it sampled. Nonetheless, it conducted a street sweeping operation to rid the area of any contaminated dirt and dust.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">In 1971, more than 10 years after the explosion, decedent moved into a home at 60 Joseph Street, which is located less than two blocks from defendant\u2019s Lister Avenue plant. Decedent was active in the neighborhood and was frequently outside working or walking. Sometime after moving to Joseph Street, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>decedent was diagnosed as having pancreatic cancer from which she died on January 23, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">In 1985, plaintiff instituted this action on behalf of her mother\u2019s estate against defendant. Although plaintiff was unable to quantify decedent\u2019s ingestion of dioxin or even establish that she in fact ingested any amount of dioxin or was even exposed to dioxin, plaintiff claimed, based on principles discussed in <em>Evers v. Dollinger, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>399, 471 A.2d 405 (1984) and <em>Hake v. Manchester Township, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>302, 486 A.2d 836 (1985), that it was unnecessary to show causation in the traditional sense as long as she could establish that defendant put decedent at risk and decedent was ultimately injured. In support of plaintiff\u2019s claim, Dr. Deborah Barsotti, a pathologist, submitted a report in which she concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">[I]t is my opinion that Mrs. Vuocolo was exposed to TCDD in sufficient quantities to develop clinical toxicity as demonstrated by chloracne. Furthermore, Diamond Alkali\u2019s accident that released TCDD into the surrounding area is responsible for the preponderance of TCDD to which Mrs. Vuocolo was exposed. Subsequently, Mrs. Vuocolo died of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Due to the rare nature of the cancer and the male preponderance, it is my opinion that Mrs. Vuocolo\u2019s exposure to TCDD substantially increased her risk of developing adenocarcinoma and may have caused or promoted this disease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Defendant conceded that it released dioxin into the atmosphere and that decedent died from pancreatic cancer. However, defendant denied responsibility for decedent\u2019s death and maintained that plaintiff was not entitled to recovery as she did not establish a causal link between decedent\u2019s cancer and the dioxin release. Judge Thompson in the Law Division denied cross-motions for summary judgment to enable plaintiff to complete discovery, but indicated that he would grant summary judgment if the proofs remained the same. The judge, in part, reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">It is fundamental that a plaintiff\u2019s burden of proof includes a showing that she has suffered an injury proximately caused by defendants\u2019 acts or omissions. <em>Germann v. Matris </em>[Matriss], 55 <em>N.J. </em>193, 205 [260 <em>A.2d </em>825] (1970). Similarly, plaintiff must present proof to a reasonable degree of medical probability that she has suffered an injury proximately caused by defendant. <em>Johnesee v. Stop and Shop Co., </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>426, 431 [416 <em>A.2d </em>956] (App.Div.1980).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>In response to defendants\u2019 motion, plaintiff contends that her answer to interrogatories and the unsigned report of Dr. Deborah Barsotti, Ph.D. establish solid factual foundations for each element plaintiff must prove and therefore defeat defendants\u2019 claim for summary judgment. Dr. Barsotti concludes that Mrs. Vuocolo exposure to dioxin \u201csubstantially increased her risk of developing adenocarcinoma and may have caused or promoted this disease.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoB\">It is well established that when a moving party demonstrates a right to summary judgment, the opponent of the motion must show by competent evidential material that a genuine issue of material fact exists. <em>James Taleott Inc. v. Shulman, </em>82 <em>N.J.Super. </em>438, 443 [198 A.2d 98] (App.Div.1964). Dr. Barsotti\u2019s report falls short of that which is necessary to satisfy a plaintiffs burden of proof in this type of litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">The burden of proof rests upon a plaintiff to prove causal relationship by a preponderance of the evidence. Proof of \u201cpossibility\u201d is not enough. Such proof must be \u201cprobability.\u201d <em>Evers v. Dollinger, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>399 [471 <em>A.</em>2d 405] (1984) and <em>Hake v. Manchester Township, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>302 [486 A.2d 836] (1985) have not reversed the basics of the law. However, unless plaintiff has completed discovery, summary judgment can not be granted. See <em>Salomon v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>58 [484 A.2d 320] (1984). If discovery is completed at a future date and the proofs remain in this posture, then at that time it would be appropriate to grant the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">After discovery was completed, defendant and plaintiff renewed their motions for summary judgment. Since plaintiff failed to proffer any additional evidence as to a causal relationship between the release of the dioxin and decedent\u2019s death from cancer in 1981, the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed this action with prejudice. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of defendant and in denying her cross-motion for summary judgment. She seeks a reversal of the judgment in favor of defendant, the entry of judgment in her favor and a remand of the matter to the trial court for a determination of damages. According to plaintiff, legal causation is established where a defendant \u201csubstantially increases\u201d the risk of disease or death and the disease or death becomes a reality. We disagree and affirm the summary judgment in favor of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">It is fundamental that in order to visit tort liability upon a defendant a \u201cplaintiff must prove tortious conduct, injury and proximate cause.\u201d <em>Ayers v. Jackson Township, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>557, 585, 525 A.2d 287 (1987); <em>see Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 30 at 164-165 (5th ed. 1984). \u201cProximate cause\u201d has been defined as \u201cany cause which in the natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by an efficient intervening cause, produces the result complained of and <em>without which the result would not have occurred.\u201d Fernandez v. Baruch, </em>96 <em>N.J.Super. </em>125, 140, 232 A.2d 661 (App.Div.1967), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 52 <em>N.J. </em>127, 244 A.2d 109 (1968) (Emphasis supplied). Thus, a plaintiff must show that a defendant\u2019s conduct constituted a cause in fact of a decedent\u2019s disease and subsequent death because an act or omission is not regarded as a cause of an event if the event would have occurred without such act or omission. <em>Kulas v. Pub. Serv. Elec. &amp; Gas Co., </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>311, 317, 196 A.2d 769 (1964); <em>Battista v. Olson, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>137, 148-149, 516 A.2d 1117 (App.Div.1986); <em>Henderson v. Morristown Memorial Hosp., </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>418, 428-429, 487 A.2d 742 (App.Div.), certif. den., 101 <em>N.J. </em>250, 501 A.2d 922 (1985). <em>See also Prosser &amp; Keeton on the Law of Torts, supra, </em>\u00a7 41 at 265. This rule has been tempered by decisions holding that, even if damage would have occurred in the absence of a defendant\u2019s negligence, liability may be imposed upon a showing that the negligent conduct was a substantial factor in causing the harm alleged. <em>State v. Jersey Cent. Power &amp; Ught Co., </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>102, 110, 351 A.2d 337 (1976); <em>Henderson v. Morristown Memorial Hosp., supra, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 429, 487 A.2d 742. This \u201csubstantial factor\u201d exception to the general rule of proximate causation rests largely on the acceptance of the following tort principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\">[An] actor\u2019s negligent conduct is a legal cause of harm to another if (a) his conduct is a substantial factor in bringing about the harm____ [Restatement, <em>Torts </em>2d, \u00a7 431 at 428 (1965)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>(1) Except as stated in Subsection (2), the actor\u2019s negligent conduct is not a substantial factor in bringing about harm to another if the harm would have been sustained even if the actor had not been negligent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">(2) <em>If two forces are actively operating one because of the actor\u2019s negligence, the other not because of any misconduct on his part, and each of itself is sufficient to bring about harm to another, the actor\u2019s negligence may be found to be a substantial factor in bringing it about. [Restatement, Torts </em>2d, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 432 at 430 (Emphasis supplied)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">These principles have been utilized broadly to justify a relaxation of a plaintiffs burden of proof in certain situations. Thus, in medical malpractice cases, because of complicated proof problems, our courts have adopted the \u201clost chance\u201d doctrine or applied the \u201csubstantial factor\u201d exception to reduce a plaintiffs burden of proof as to causation. For example, in <em>Evers v. Dollinger, supra, </em>plaintiff sued her physician alleging that the delay in treatment caused by his failure to diagnose properly her breast cancer enhanced the risk that the cancer would recur. Because plaintiffs cancer did recur during the proceedings, the Supreme Court did not consider or decide whether \u201cthe unquantified (and unquantifiable) but nevertheless certain increase in the risk, standing alone, is sufficient injury to sustain plaintiffs cause of action.\u201d <em>Evers v. Dollinger, supra, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>at 406, 471 <em>A.</em>2d 405. However, relying largely upon Pennsylvania law, the Court held \u201cthat when there is evidence that a defendant\u2019s negligent act or omission increase[s] the risk of harm ... and ... the harm [is] sustained, \u2018it becomes a question for the jury as to whether or not that increased risk was a substantial factor in producing the harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414-415, 471 A.2d 405 (citing <em>Hamil v. Bashline, </em>481 <em>Pa. </em>256, 269, 392 A.2d 1280, 1286 (1978)). Agreeing with <em>Hamil, </em>the Court distinguished \u201cthe more routine tort case, in which the law requires proof that the result complained of probably would not have occurred \u2018but for\u2019 the negligent conduct of the defendant,\u201d <em>id. </em>95 N.J. at 415, 471 A.2d 405, from the medical malpractice case at issue by noting that in the latter, the physician is \u201ccharged with having failed in a duty to protect against harm from another source____\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>ingly, the Court held that the physician could be held liable if it were established</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-4\">within a reasonable degree of medical probability, that the seven months delay resulting from defendant\u2019s failure to have made an accurate diagnosis and to have rendered proper treatment increased the risk of recurrence or of distant spread of plaintiff\u2019s cancer, and that such increased risk was a substantial factor in producing the condition from which plaintiff currently suffers, [Id. at 417, 471 A.2d 405].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">In <em>Hake v. Manchester Township, supra, </em>which was decided a year after <em>Evers, </em>the Supreme Court removed the lost chance doctrine from the exclusive realm of medical malpractice cases and applied it to a wrongful death action. There, plaintiffs sued Manchester Township and several of its police officers claiming that the defendants\u2019 failure to render prompt emergency care to their son, when the police discovered him unconscious in his jail cell, deprived him of a chance to be revived. Although holding that plaintiffs had a viable claim, the Court limited the applicability of the doctrine to cases where there exists a duty to save a life and there is a substantial possibility of rescue and stressed that the doctrine applies only to a \u201cnarrow class of cases of lost chance of survival____\u201d <em>Hake v. Manchester Township, supra, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>at 311, 486 A.2d 836. Thus, the Court held \u201cthat in establishing causation it suffices for plaintiffs to show that defendants\u2019 negligent conduct negated a substantial possibility that prompt rescue efforts would have been successful, thereby constituting a substantial factor in causing decedent\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 306, 486 A.2d 836.</p>\n<p id=\"AjV\">In <em>Ayers v. Jackson Township, supra, </em>which concerned a toxic tort suit under the Tort Claims Act, the Supreme Court \u201cdecline[d] to recognize [a] cause of action for the <em>unquantified </em>enhanced risk of disease____\u201d <em>Ayers v. Jackson Township, supra, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>at 598, 525 A.2d 287. (Emphasis in original). Although the Court recognized the extreme difficulties facing toxic tort plaintiffs, it did not \u201cdecide whether a claim based on enhanced risk of disease that is supported by testimony demonstrating that the onset of the disease is reasonably probable could be maintained under the Tort Claims Act.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 599, 525 A.2d 287. (Citation omitted). The Court demonstrated its reluctancy to increase the applicability of this doctrine by noting \u201cthat the recognition of an \u2018enhanced risk\u2019 cause of action, particularly when the risk is unquantified, would generate substantial litigation that would be difficult to manage and resolve.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597, 525 A.2d 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The Supreme Court recently revisited these issues in <em>Mauro v. Raymark Indus., Inc., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>126, 561 A.2d 257 (1989). There, plaintiff, a state employee, was exposed to materials containing asbestos during the course of his employment. In 1981, he was examined by a state-employed physician. Although the results of the tests performed were \u201cnormal,\u201d the report stated: \u201c[Y]our exposure to asbestos has been significant and there is some evidence that this exposure may increase the risk of development of lung cancer.\u201d <em>Mauro v. Raymark Indus., Inc., supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 129, 561 A.2d 257. Plaintiff instituted suit against several manufacturers of asbestos products based on injuries allegedly sustained as a result of his exposure to asbestos. At trial, \u201cplaintiff\u2019s expert testified that there was a \u2018high probability\u2019 that plaintiff had <em>an increased risk </em>of contracting cancer during his lifetime. The expert was unable to testify that it was <em>probable </em>that plaintiff would <em>contract </em>cancer____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 128, 561 A.2d 257. (Emphasis in original). As a result, the trial court refused to allow plaintiff\u2019s claim for enhanced risk of developing cancer to go to the jury. We affirmed the judgment. <em>Mauro v. Owens-Corning Fiberglass Corp., </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>196, 542 A.2d 16 (App.Div.1988). We refused to recognize plaintiff\u2019s claim for enhanced risk of cancer because plaintiff\u2019s expert \u201cwas unable to quantify plaintiff\u2019s enhanced risk of cancer and to predict, within a degree of reasonable probability that plaintiff will develop cancer----\u201d <em>Mauro v. Owens-Coming Fiberglass Corp., supra, </em>225 <em>N.J. Super, </em>at 205, 542 A.2d 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">Although the <em>Mauro </em>Court recognized the existence of claims based on enhanced risk of disease, it held specifically that damages are only recoverable in those cases where there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>evidence establishing the future occurrence of disease as a reasonable medical probability. As the Court explained, a claim for damages predicated upon enhanced risk of disease is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APk\">conceptually analogous to the claim of a personal-injury plaintiff with a damaged knee to recover damages for the prospective onset of an arthritic condition that may result from the knee injury. <em>See Jackson v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., </em>781 F.2d 394, 412 (5th Cir.) (describing <em>General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Layton, </em>353 So.2d 749 (Miss.1977)\u2014where plaintiff with bruised knee recovered damages for prospective arthritis\u2014as \u201cindistinguishable\u201d from asbestos plaintiffs\u2019 claim for prospective cancer), <em>cert. </em>denied, 478 <em>U.S. </em>1022, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>3339, 92 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>743 (1986). Under our case law, the personal-injury plaintiff conceivably could claim medical-surveillance damages and emotional-distress damages on the basis that the knee injury might cause arthritis, but could not recover damages for the prospective arthritic condition\u2014the \u201cenhanced risk\u201d of arthritis\u2014unless its occurrence was established as a matter of reasonable medical probability. <em>Coll v. Skerry, supra, </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>[166] at 174-75 [148 A.2d 481 (1959) ]. Thus, the fact that Mauro\u2019s claims for medical surveillance and emotional distress, attributable to his enhanced risk of cancer, were submitted to the jury does not exhaust his claim for damages based on the prospective occurrence of cancer\u2014the \u201cenhanced risk\u201d of cancer. <em>Accord Herber v. Johns-Manville Corp., supra, </em>785 <em>F.2d </em>[79] at 82 [ (3rd Cir.1986) ]. The question before us is whether that component of the claim should have been submitted to the jury in the absence of evidence establishing the future occurrence of cancer as a reasonable medical probability. We hold that the prospective-cancer component of plaintiff\u2019s enhanced-risk claim was properly withheld from the jury. <em>[Mauro v. Raymark Indus., Inc., supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 138-139, 561 A.2d 257].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Applying these principles here, we are satisfied that the trial court properly dismissed plaintiffs claim. First, this is not a lost chance case. Although defendant released dioxin into the environment and decedent died of pancreatic cancer, there is no proof of a neglected duty on the part of defendant to save decedent\u2019s life as was required by <em>Evers, supra, </em>and <em>Hake, supra. </em>Likewise, plaintiff\u2019s expert could not quantify decedent\u2019s enhanced risk of cancer nor state to a reasonable medical probability that the release of dioxin caused decedent\u2019s cancer and death. The fact that decedent actually contracted cancer and died of the disease is irrelevant. In order to hold a defendant liable under the principle of enhanced risk (regardless of whether the disease actually manifests itself) plaintiff must demonstrate to a reasonable medical probability that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>defendant\u2019s activities substantially increased the risk of disease. Plaintiff has not done this notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s affording her ample opportunity to conduct further discovery and present the necessary proofs. Quite simply, the matter is more akin to a traditional personal injury tort case. Because plaintiff has not and apparently cannot establish a causal link between defendant\u2019s conduct and decedent\u2019s disease and ultimate death, she is not entitled to recover against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Beyond the fact that plaintiff\u2019s expert, Dr. Barsotti, could not testify to a reasonable medical probability that defendant had substantially increased decedent\u2019s risk of contracting cancer, her report is a net opinion, which does not provide a proper medical foundation to support plaintiff\u2019s claim. Historically, courts have refused to admit expert medical testimony based on mere speculation, or possibility, unsupported by the evidence. As one commentator has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\">It seems universally agreed that an expert medical opinion as to the cause of death, disease, or other physical condition is inadmissible if it is solely an unsupported conclusion of the witness, since however well qualified the witness is, and however scientific or abstruse the subject matter is, an opinion must have reference to the material facts of the case as reflected by the evidence. [Annotation, \u201cOpinion Evidence\u2014Disease or Injury,\u201d 66 <em>A.L.R.2d </em>1082, 1086 (1959)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-9\"><em>See Clearwater Corp. v. City of Lincoln, </em>202 <em>Neb. </em>796, 277 <em>N.W.2d </em>236, 241 (1979) (holding \u201cfejxpert testimony should not be received if it appears the witness is not in possession of such facts as will enable him to express a reasonably accurate conclusion as distinguished from a mere guess or conjecture. The witness should not be allowed to express an opinion on an inadequate basis____\u201d). Put in different terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-11\">Expert medical opinion evidence as to causation between an event and death, disease, or a physical condition is inadmissible if it would amount to the expression of a pure conclusion, without reference to factual causative antecedents incorporated in questioning or unsupported by evidence in the record, inasmuch as admission would amount to an invasion of the fact-finding function <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>of the jury. [Annotation, \u201cOpinion Evidence\u2014Disease or Injury,\u201d 66 <em>A.L.R.</em>2d, <em>supra, </em>at 1116-1117].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">New Jersey has followed the majority rule and has declined to admit expert opinion without a proper factual foundation. In <em>Gribbin v. Fox, </em>130 <em>N.J.L. </em>357, 32 A.2d 853 (Sup.Ct.1943) aff\u2019d, 131 <em>N.J.L. </em>187, 35 A.2d 719 (E. &amp; A.1944), the former New Jersey Supreme Court excluded the testimony of an expert witness who was unable to state definitely the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s blood deficiency. The court held that the \u201cevidence was improperly admitted in that all that it did was to establish a possible cause for the condition and it failed to negative other possible causes.\u201d <em>Gribbin v. Fox, supra, </em>130 <em>N.J.L. </em>at 359, 32 A.2d 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">This prohibition against speculative expert opinion has been labeled by modern courts as the \u201cnet opinion rule.\u201d Under .this doctrine, expert testimony is excluded if it is based merely on unfounded speculation and unquantified possibilities. In <em>Johnesee v. Stop &amp; Shop Cos., </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>426, 431, 416 A.2d 956 (App.Div.1980), we held that \u201cmedical-opinion testimony must be couched in terms of reasonable medical certainty or probability; opinions as to possibility are inadmissible.\u201d Courts considering the issue since the <em>Johnesee </em>case have agreed that expert opinion, unsubstantiated by medical certainties or probability, is inadmissible. <em>See State v. Freeman, </em>223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>92, 116, 538 A.2d 371 (App.Div.1988). <em>See also State v. Smith, </em>210 <em>N.J.Super. </em>43, 57, 509 A.2d 206 (App.Div.), certif. den., 105 <em>N.J. </em>582, 523 A.2d 210 (1986); <em>Schrantz v. Luancing, </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>434, 439, 527 A.2d 967 (Law Div.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">. Analyzed in this light, plaintiff\u2019s expert\u2019s opinion is nothing more than mere speculation and possibility. Dr. Barsotti\u2019s - opinion is not even phrased in terms of reasonable medical certainty or probability and as such, is not admissible to substantiate plaintiff\u2019s claim or save plaintiff\u2019s case from summary judgment. Moreover, although Dr. Barsotti\u2019s report is lengthy, it is very generalized and focuses much more on the nature and history of dioxin rather than upon the 1960 explosion and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>effect on decedent. Dr. Barsotti only referred to decedent briefly in her report and much of this is merely a restatement of decedent\u2019s life history and medical records. Dr. Barsotti never examined decedent at any time. Moreover, she never conducted any dioxin tests in the Lister Street area or on the numerous other people who lived and worked in the area. The most that Dr. Barsotti was willing to state was that \u201cMrs. Vuocolo\u2019s exposure to TCDD substantially increased her risk of developing adenocarcinoma and may have caused or promoted this disease.\u201d Thus, Dr. Barsotti\u2019s opinion is speculative and not based on reasonable medical certainty or probability.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
