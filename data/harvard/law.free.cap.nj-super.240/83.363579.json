At first blush, that would appear to be \u201ca mayor-council form of government\u201d calling for appointment of the municipal judge \u201cby the mayor with the advice and consent of council.\u201d The respondent municipal council, however, urges that its government is not \u201ca mayor-council form\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:8-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>The relevant provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:8-5 have been in effect since 1948. In 1950, the Legislature adopted the Faulkner Act, designed to permit \u201ceach municipality to select on its own initiative and without subsequent legislative approval any one of several forms of municipal government previously approved by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Bucino v. Malone, </em>12 <em>N.J. </em>330, 335, 96 A.2d 669 (1953). The approved plans were described in <em>Bucino </em>as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-5\">grouped in three general local government divisions\u2014the Mayor-Council, the Council-Manager, and the Small Municipality. There are six alternative plans under the Mayor-Council Division, four under the Council-Manager Division, and four under the Small Municipality Division, or a total of 14 optional plans.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 336, 96 A.2d 669.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Although only six of the statutory forms are designated as \u201cmayor-council\u201d plans, all 14 call for both a mayor and a council. In the \u201cmayor-council\u201d plans, the mayor is elected by the voters and is not a member of the council; in all other plans, the mayor is a member of the council, elected as mayor by the council in some plans and by the voters in others.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">The council urges that in Faulkner Act municipalities only those plans designated \u201cmayor-council\u201d should be treated as \u201cmayor-council\u201d forms under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:8-5. The mayor does not contend that every municipality having a mayor and a council, <em>i.e., </em>every Faulkner Act municipality, is a \u201cmayor-council\u201d form within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:8-5. She urges, rather, that the particular characteristics of the \u201csmall municipality plan C\u201d justify characterizing it as a \u201cmayor-council\u201d form for purposes of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">We agree with both parties that the term \u201cmayor-council\u201d form as used in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:8-5 cannot reasonably be read as referring to every form of government in which there is a mayor and a council. Under the Faulkner Act, every municipality has a mayor and a council; the existence of those offices says nothing about the form of government. As the parties recognize, the distinctive treatment provided by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:8-5 for municipal judge appointments under a \u201cmayor-council <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>form\u201d presumably reflects some identifiable and relevant difference between that and other forms. We perceive the critical difference to be in the role of the mayor.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The mayor is not a council member in any of the Faulkner Act \u201cmayor-council\u201d plans, but is a council member in all other Faulkner Act plans. That difference between \u201cmayor-council\u201d and other plans impacts directly on the appointment process: it would be anomalous to permit or require a mayor to vote, or to otherwise participate, in the council\u2019s confirmation or rejection of his or her own appointment. The reasonable reading of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:8-5 is that a \u201cmayor-council form of government\u201d permitting mayoral appointment of the municipal judge must be one in which the mayor has no role as a council member. Faulkner Act council-manager and small municipality plans thus are not \u201cmayor-council\u201d forms of government within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:8-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">We affirm that portion of the February 8, 1989 final order which determines that \u201cthe governing body of the Township of Fairfield shall have the right to appoint the Judge of the Municipal Court.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b116-13\">Notwithstanding the repeal, the statutory provisions continue in effect until the adopted charter is \"abandoned or altered\" pursuant to law. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:69A-208.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
