O\u2019Brien struck her car. At the time, O\u2019Brien was employed by defendant Leisure Time Tours (Leisure Time), which owned the van O\u2019Brien was operating in the course of his employment. Lehmann sued defendants Leisure Time and O\u2019Brien seeking recovery for her injuries. At the time the suit was instituted, Leisure Time was insured by Transit Casualty which defended the action. In March 1984, the case went to trial. The jury returned a verdict of $10,000 in favor of plaintiff and the trial judge ruled that she was entitled to prejudgment interest on the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s motions for additur or a new trial were denied and she appealed. In April 1986, this court affirmed. During the pendency of the appeal, Leisure Time\u2019s insurer, Transit, became insolvent and its obligations (including this one) were assumed by the New Jersey Property-Liability Insurance Guaranty Association (Association).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">In April 1986, plaintiff\u2019s counsel sent a warrant to the Association\u2019s counsel (the Association continued to retain defendants\u2019 trial counsel) to satisfy the judgment for $10,000 plus interest. The Association\u2019s counsel returned the warrant unsatisfied, stating that the Association would not pay interest awards on such judgments. On May 23, 1986, plaintiff\u2019s counsel again sent the Association\u2019s counsel a warrant for satisfaction of the judgment plus interest. This time, the Association\u2019s counsel accepted the warrant and filed it with the trial judge. However, the warrant filed mistakenly provided only for the Association\u2019s payment of the $10,000 judgment amount and <em>not </em>for any prejudgment or post-judgement interest. To remedy this mistake, plaintiff filed a notice of motion in mid-June 1986 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>vacate the warrant, which was formally set aside by way of an order entered on July 7, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">In September 1986, plaintiff proceeded by way of writ of execution against Leisure Time\u2019s property. In 1987, when plaintiff sought to levy against one of Leisure Times\u2019s buses, Leisure Time filed a motion for stay of the writ of execution. The trial judge stayed enforcement of the writ pending a hearing on the issues of pre- and post-judgment interest. Leisure Time argued that the Association was precluded by statute from paying pre- or post-judgment interest and plaintiff was statutorily barred from pursuing Leisure Time and O\u2019Brien for that interest. In response, plaintiff\u2019s counsel contended that the pertinent statute did not prevent the Association from paying interest on plaintiff\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">The trial judge determined that the Association was required to pay plaintiff both pre- and post-judgment interest and that plaintiff was barred from pursing claims directly against Leisure Time and O\u2019Brien. The Association, on behalf of defendants, appealed from that portion of the trial judge\u2019s written order which required it to pay the interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">In November 1987, another Superior Court judge issued an unreported opinion regarding the Association in an unrelated case which concluded that the Association was not statutorily required to pay prejudgment interest and that, instead, the plaintiffs could pursue the defendants to collect the prejudgment interest due. In light of the conflict between defendants and the Association which was perceived to exist as a result of this decision, the Association\u2019s counsel was permitted to withdraw, and new counsel was substituted for defendant Leisure Time. Leisure Time\u2019s new counsel then advised this court that it did not intend to appeal the trial judge\u2019s interest determination. As a result, the Association\u2019s position was unrepresented on appeal and the Association was granted the right of intervention. As a result, Leisure Time and the Association are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>pitted against each other on this appeal which is solely focused on the question of pre- and post-judgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">We turn first to the question of prejudgment interest. The New Jersey Property-Liability Insurance Guaranty Association Act <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-1 et seq.), which sets forth the rights and duties of the Association, was adopted in 1974 to protect policyholders of insurance companies which became insolvent. <em>Railroad Roofing &amp; Bldg. Supply Co., Inc. v. Financial Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>384, 389, 427 A.2d 66 (1981). The protection provided by the act extends to non-policyholder claimants such as the plaintiff in this case. <em>Sussman v. Ostroff, </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>306, 310-311, 556 A.2d 1301 (App.Div. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The purpose of the act is \u201c... to provide a mechanism for the payment of covered claims____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-2a. The \u201cmechanism\u201d provided by the act is the Association: a private, nonprofit, unincorporated legal entity comprised of all insurers licensed in New Jersey to offer property and liability insurance within the coverage of the act. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-6; <em>Sussman, </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 311, 556 A.2d 1301. Under the act, the Association is required to assume the contractual obligations of an insolvent insurer and to pay certain claims of the insurer\u2019s policyholders up to the limit of a policyholder\u2019s contract, but subject to a maximum liability of $300,000. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-8; <em>Sussman, </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 311, 556 A.2d 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">The Association\u2019s responsibility to pay claims under an insolvent insurer\u2019s policy is limited to the payment of \u201ccovered claims.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-5d; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-8a. In defining a \u201ccovered claim\u201d, the act provides that this claim \u201cshall <em>not </em>include amounts for interest on <em>unliquidated </em>claims____\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-5d (emphasis added). Thus, the Association is precluded by statute from paying interest on \u201cunliquidated claims.\u201d (The term \u201cunliquidated claims\u201d is not further defined in the act.)</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Leisure Time argues that plaintiff\u2019s claim was \u201cliquidated\u201d on March 27, 1984, the date she received a judgment. The amount of her damages ($10,000) was thus certain when the Association assumed Transit\u2019s obligations in December 1985. Therefore, Leisure Time contends that plaintiff\u2019s claim was \u201cliquidated,\u201d and the disputed language of the act presents no barrier to the award of prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">In contrast, the Association urges that the act bars it from paying any prejudgment interest on the claims that it assumes. This is so, the Association maintains, because a claim is plainly \u201cunliquidated\u201d before it is reduced to judgment and such \u201cunliquidated\u201d claims are subject to the statutory bar on the payment of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Our recent decision in <em>Hendricks v. A.J. Ross Company, et al., </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>243, 556 A.2d 1267 (App.Div.1989) lays this controversy to rest. In <em>Hendricks, </em>the plaintiff obtained a money judgment against an insured defendant which included $13,000 in prejudgment interest. Because the defendants\u2019 insurer had become insolvent, the defendants\u2019 insurance claim was referred to the Association. The Association refused to pay the $13,000 in prejudgment interest on the plaintiff\u2019s judgment. Litigation ensued and eventually the trial judge held that prejudgment interest on a tort claim was statutorily barred interest on an \u201cunliquidated\u201d claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Plaintiff appealed and we affirmed stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">[t]he usual understanding is that a tort claim, at least one seeking damages for pain and suffering, is unliquidated. <em>See Busik v. Levine, </em>63 <em>N.J </em>351, 356-357 [307 A.2d 571] (1973), app. dism. 414 <em>U.S. </em>1106, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>831, 38 L.Ed.2d 733 (1973). Indeed, in authorizing the award of prejudgment interest on tort claims through the adoption of <em>R. </em>4:42\u201411(b), the Supreme Court recognized that the award of prejudgment interest had been limited theretofore to liquidated claims and that tort claims were unliquidated. <em>Id. </em>at 358-359 [307 A.2d 571.]. Therefore, when the Legislature enacted the New Jersey Property-Liability Insurance Guaranty Act in 1974, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-1 <em>et seq., </em>and excluded \u201cinterest on unliquidated claims\u201d from \u201ccovered claims\u201d [in 1979, pursuant to an amendment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-5d], it undoubtedly had in mind prejudgment interest on tort claims which the Supreme Court had authorized in 1971 through the adoption of <em>R. </em>4:42-11(b). Consequently, we agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>plaintiffs claim remained unliquidated until the jury returned a verdict and that any prejudgment interest accruing while the claim was unliquidated would constitute \u201cinterest on an unliquidated claim.\u201d <em>[Hendricks, </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 246-247, 556 A.2d 1267.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">In short, the fact that plaintiff\u2019s claim was reduced to judgment in March 1984 did not change its status as unliquidated for prejudgment interest purposes. Under the statute as interpreted in <em>Hendricks, </em>the Association is precluded from paying prejudgment interest on such an unliquidated claim. Therefore the award of prejudgment interest to plaintiff here was improper and the decision by the trial judge should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\"><em>Hendricks </em>also addresses the Association\u2019s alternative suggestion that Leisure Time should pay the prejudgment interest due plaintiff. There, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">[w]e also agree with the trial court\u2019s further conclusion that a party insured by an insolvent carrier is not responsible for the payment of prejudgment interest when the Association is exempt from that responsibility. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-5(d) states in pertinent part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">\u201cCovered claim\u201d shall not include any amount due any reinsurer, insurer, insurance pool, or underwriting association, as subrogation recoveries or otherwise; provided, that a claim for any such amount, asserted against a person insured under a policy issued by an insurer which has become an insolvent insurer, which, if it were not a claim by or for the benefit of a reinsurer, insurer, insurance pool, or underwriting association, would be a \u201ccovered claim,\u201d may be filed directly with the receiver of the insolvent insurer, but in no event may any such claim be asserted in any legal action against the insured of such insolvent insurer. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">The underscored clause in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-5(d) appears prior to the exclusion from \u201ccovered claims\u201d of \u201cinterest on unliquidated claims.\u201d Nevertheless, we believe that this clause reflects a general legislative policy to avoid imposition of liability upon an insured for claims which may not be pursued against the Association. Moreover, even if <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:30A-5(d) did not mandate that an individual insured not be held responsible for prejudgment interest due to its insurer\u2019s insolvency, it would be appropriate under the circumstances for the court to exercise its power under <em>R. </em>4:42-ll(b) to suspend the running of prejudgment interest. <em>See Busik v. Levine, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>at 384 [307 A.2d 571] (Conford, J., dissenting). <em>[Hendricks, </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 247-248, 556 A.2d 1267.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">While this is a closer question than the basic issue of the Association\u2019s liability, we think that the <em>Hendricks </em>interpretation of the statute is reasonable and reject the claim that Leisure Time is responsible for payment of prejudgment inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>est to plaintiff. <em>But see Wilton v. Cycle Trucking, Inc., </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>326, 573 A.2d 462 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">We turn finally to the issue of post-judgment interest. Under the rules of court, the usual practice is to allow post-judgment interest \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise ordered by the court or provided by law <em>...\u201d R. </em>4:42-11(a). Thus, unless there is a legal impediment to the payment of such interest, its grant or denial is discretionary with the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Here, the only statutory bar to the payment of interest is with respect to unliquidated claims. Plaintiff\u2019s claim became \u201cliquidated\u201d on March 27, 1984. Post-judgment interest was thus theoretically payable by the Association from that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">The Association acknowledges its responsibility for the interest which accrued after it began to participate in the case but argues that it would be inequitable to require it to pay the interest which accrued after the entry of the judgment but prior to its assumption of Transit\u2019s obligations. The gist of this argument is that such a payment of interest, for a period over which it had no control, would unwarrantedly limit its ability to pay the claims of \u201cother deserving claimants.\u201d In deciding as she did, the trial judge explicitly stated that there was \u201cno equitable or exceptional reason\u201d that barred the Association\u2019s payment of post-judgment interest. Here, plaintiff was injured in 1980. Unlike a litigant in an ordinary tort case, she will receive no interest up to the date of the judgment, March 27, 1984. She has waited more than nine years for her recovery. Under the circumstances, and in the absence of any evidence to suggest that other \u201ccovered\u201d claimants of the Association are at risk, the judge\u2019s decision to allow post-judgment interest for the contested period was well within her discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Affirmed in part; reversed in part; the matter is remanded so that the judgment can be modified to eliminate the allowance of prejudgment interest.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
