Woodward, after the name Chas. R. Woowared was indorsed thereon, was entirely worthless, whether said indorsement was false or true. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tomlinson, </em>35 Cal. 503; <em>People </em>v. <em>Munroe, </em>100 Cal. 666; 38 Am.

The demurrer should have been sustained, as matters <em>aliunde </em>should have been alleged to make this a case of forgery at all. The motion to instruct the jury to acquit, because the <em>corpus delicti </em>had not been proven, should have been granted. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>90 Cal. 586.) The court erred in admitting the judgment-roll of Santa Clara county in <em>People </em>v. <em>Alden, </em>as it was not accompanied by any written permission for its abstraction from the records of that county. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>(Code Civ. Proc., secs. 1904, 1905, 1950, 2051; <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>57 Cal. 571.) It was error to refuse to instruct the jury that forgery is the signing by one without authority, and falsely and with intent to defraud, the name of another to an instrument which, if genuine, might apparently be of legal efficacy, or the foundation of a legal liability. <em>(State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>19 Iowa, 299; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>8 Iowa, 231; <em>Waterman </em>v. <em>People, </em>67 Ill. 91; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tomlinson, </em>100 Cal. 666; 38 Am.

Proc., sec. 2057); and how they were obtained is of no consequence as matter of rebuttal. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1875.) Defendant\u2019s first instruction was properly refused, because already substantially given. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cloonan, </em>50 Cal. 450; <em>Bullard </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>67 Cal. 477; <em>People </em>v.

Woodward, on the return of the certificate properly indorsed; that he falsely and feloniously, and for the purpose of fraudulently procuring the money mentioned in said certificate, forged on the back thereof the name Chas. R. Woowared; that he then gave the certificate thus in appearance properly indorsed to an acquaintance named Perrine, who was in the employment of Armes &amp; Dallam, a business firm in San Francisco, and asked him to get it cashed as he (appellant) did not want to lose time; that he told Perrine that the money was his, but had been paid to Woodward for him, and Woodward had deposited it and took a certificate in his (Woodward\u2019s) own name, <em>and had indorsed it; </em>that Perrine turned it over and saw that it was indorsed, but did not notice the difference in spelling between the name indorsed and the one in the body of the instrument; that Perrine took the certificate to the bookkeeper of Armes &amp; Dallam and asked him to cash it; that the bookkeeper referred the matter to Mr. Armes, one of the firm, who, seeing it indorsed, supposed it was all right, and indorsed it with the firm name and gave a check for the amount, whereupon the bookkeeper paid the one hundred and forty dollars to Perrine, who gave it to appellant, who upon the next day left the state. In a day or two the false indorsement was discovered; and appellant was afterward arrested in Oregon.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Appellant moved to dismiss the information; demurred to the information; objected to certain evidence; moved the court to instruct the. jury to acquit; asked certain instructions, which were refused, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>made a motion in arrest of judgment. In all said matters the rulings of the court were adverse to appellant, and he took exceptions to the rulings; but it is unnecessary to notice them separately, for, upon examination, they are all found to rest upon the proposition that the facts above recited do not make a case of forgery on account of the difference in the spelling in the indorsement of the last part of the name Charles K,. Woodward. This proposition cannot be maintained. The fraudulent purpose and the felonious intent to commit a forgery are as clearly manifested and as completely executed as they would have been if the spelling of the forged name had been entirely correct; and the doctrine of <em>idem sonans </em>fully applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The case was tried in the city and county of San Francisco; and the prosecution, for the purpose of contradicting and impeaching the appellant, who had testified as a witness, was allowed to introduce over appellant\u2019s objection an original judgment-roll in a case which had been tried and decided in the county of Santa Clara; and counsel for appellant argues that this was error, because, as he contends, this record was illegally taken from the office of the county clerk of Santa Clara county, as no order of court allowing its removal was shown\u2014contrary to the provision of section 1950 of the Code of Civil Procedure. This position is not tenable. Whether or not the record was removed from Santa Clara county to San Francisco without authority may, perhaps, be a question of some consequence to the person who removed it, but is of no consequence in the case at bar; its competency as evidence in the San Francisco court in no way depended upon the means by which it was brought there.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">We see no other point necessary to be noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">The judgment and order appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Henshaw, J., and Temple, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
