Peck, </em>for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-12\">Where a material fact is not found the judgment will be set aside upon appeal. <em>(Traverso </em>v. <em>Tate, </em>82 Cal. 170; <em>Estate of Langan, </em>74 Cal. 353.) . In order to justify a judgment of ejectment, facts must exist, and be .found in the findings, which show as a matter of law that plaintiff is entitled to the possession of the premises. <em>(Sauer </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>87 Cal. 34; <em>Hestres </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>37 Cal. 385; <em>Meeks </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>v. <em>Kirby, </em>47 Cal. 168.) As defendant was a tenant at will and rightfully in possession until notice given, there should have been a finding as to notice to show that the holding of possession had become wrongful. (Civ. Code, sec. 789; <em>Frisbie </em>v. <em>Price, </em>27 Cal. 253.) Facts not found are presumed not to exist. <em>(West Coast Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Newkirk, </em>80 Cal. 275.) The findings, \u201c and ever since the eleventh day of December, 1890, wrongfully withheld possession,\u201d and \u201c that on the eleventh day of December, 1890, the defendant\u2019s possession for the first time became adverse to plaintiff,\u201d and \u201c and by her acts a* that date she ousted the plaintiff from possession,\u201d are all conclusions of law. <em>(Paulson </em>v. <em>Nunan, </em>64 Cal. 290; <em>In re Langan, supra; Caperton </em>v. <em>Schmidt, </em>26 Cal. 495; 85 Am. Dec. 187; <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Treadwell, </em>16 Cal. 222; Thompson on Trials, par. 1412; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>15 Cal. 101.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b48-5\"><em>F. H. Gould, </em>and <em>J. H. Rogers, </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-6\">If the complaint states a cause of action, as the court has determined in this case it does, it is sufficient to find as a fact that the allegations of the complaint are all true. <em>(McEwen </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>7 Cal. 260.) It is not necessary for the court in its findings to present the result of last analysis. The facts to be found and to be pleaded lie in the same plane. <em>(Hihn </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>30 Cal. 286.) The fact that a finding of facts is called a conclusion of law does not make it one, and if findings of fact are found among conclusions of law, and there is a conclusion of law sup. ported thereby, the judgment cannot be overturned. <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>42 Cal. 192; Hayne on New Trial and Appeal, sec. 242; <em>Brenner </em>v. <em>Liverpool etc. Ins. Co., </em>51 Cal. 107; 21 Am. Rep. 703; <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Sonoma Valley Bank, </em>59 Cal. 148; <em>Meek </em>v. <em>McClure, </em>49 Cal. 626.) The allegations in this state to maintain ejectment are the .title of plaintiff and possession by defendant. <em>(Payne </em>v. <em>Treadwell, </em>16 Cal. 220; <em>Haight </em>v. <em>Green, </em>19 Cal. 118; <em>Salmon </em>v. <em>Symonds, </em>24 Cal. 266; <em>Depuy v. Williams, </em>26 Cal. 314.) Defendant cannot disavow her tenancy, dispute her landlord\u2019s title, and still demand her notice to quit. <em>(Conner </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>v. <em>Jones, </em>28 Cal. 60; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Ogg Shaw, </em>16 Cal. 88; <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Walley, </em>32 Cal. 225; <em>Bolton </em>v. <em>Landers, </em>27 Cal. 104; <em>Sampson </em>v. <em>Applegate, </em>75 Cal. 345.) The fact appears positively from, defendant\u2019s own pleading, and is therefore admitted. Facts that are admitted should not be found. <em>(Phelan </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>43 Cal. 306; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Arnott, </em>80 Cal. 348.) An averment of ouster is not a conclusion of law. (17 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 289; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>15 Cal. 101; <em>Boles </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>15 Cal. 151; <em>Garrison </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>15 Cal. 93; <em>Boles </em>v. <em>Weifenback, </em>15 Cal. 144.) The word \u201cwrongfully,\u201d in the allegation \u201cdefendant wrongfully withheld possession of the said land,\u201d is. harmless surplusage. <em>(Payne </em>v. <em>Treadwell, supra.) </em>Immaterial findings should be disregarded. <em>(Melone </em>v. <em>Del Norte County, </em>77 Cal. 217; <em>Robarts </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>65 Cal. 402; <em>McCourtney </em>v. <em>Fortune, </em>42 Cal. 387; <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>57 Cal. 535.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b49-5\">Vancliff, C.</author>\n<p id=\"A3\">.Ejectment. Judgment for plaintiff.. Appeal from judgment on judgment-roll.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Appellant claims that the findings do not support the-judgment, because: 1. The finding (No. 16) that defendant \u201c ousted the plaintiff\u201d is a conclusion of law, in that it does not find the facts constituting the ouster; 2. That there is no finding \u201c that plaintiff, at the time of commencing the suit, was entitled to the possession\u201d of the demanded premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">1. In the case of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Mohn, </em>87 Cal. 497, it was said: \u201c They [findings] should be statements of the ultimate facts, and not of the probative facts. <em>(Mathews </em>v. <em>Kinsell, </em>41 Cal. 512.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">In <em>Hihn </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>30 Cal. 286, the court said: \u201cIt has been uniformly held that it is not necessary for the court in its findings to present the results of last analysis, but, on the contrary, that it would be sufficient if the court found the facts entering as terms into the legal proposition upon which the prevailing party based his right of recovery. The \u2018 facts\u2019 which the court is to find, and the <em>\u2018 </em>facts\u2019 which a pleader is to state, lie, ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>cording to the decisions in this state, in the same plane \u2014that is, in both connections, facts are to be stated according to their legal effect.\u201d \"</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">In <em>Murdock </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>90 Cal. 435, the court said: \u201cA finding which follows the pleading is sufficient. In this, as in other cases, it is sufficient to find the ultimate facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Therefore, to determine the sufficiency of a finding of fact, it is only necessary to ascertain what statement of that fact is required in the pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">In <em>Payne v. Treadwell, </em>16 Cal. 243, the court said: \u2018\u201cNow, what facts must be proved to recover in ejectment? These only: that the plaintiff is seised of the premises, or of some estate therein, in fee, or for life, or for years, and that the defendant was in their possession at the commencement of the action.....It is the ultimate facts\u2014which could not be struck out of a \u00a1pleading without leaving it insufficient\u2014and not the -evidence of these facts, which must be stated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">In <em>Garrison </em>v. <em>Sampson, </em>15 Cal. 95, proof of holding over of premises by defendant was objected to by defendant, on the ground that such proof was inadmissible under the general allegation of the complaint, and could only be admitted under specific averment of the facts. The court, on appeal, said: \u201cWe do not think this point well taken.....A holding over by the defendant is, in effect, an ouster, and may be so charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Av\">In <em>Boles </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>15 Cal. 151, the court said: \u201c The complaint .... distinctly alleges prior possession in the plaintiffs, and an entry and ouster by the defendants, and that the defendants are still in possession of the property. There can be no doubt of the sufficiency of these allegations.\u201d (See, also, <em>Boles </em>v. <em>Weifenback, </em>15 Cal. 144.)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">While I think the ultimate fact of ouster is sufficiently -expressed in finding No. 16, under the heading of <em>fads, </em>there can be no doubt that it is so in finding No. 6, ainder the heading of \u201cconclusions of law,\u201d as follows:\"\u201cThat on December 11, 1890, defendant did oust and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>eject plaintiff from the possession of said lot 5, block 3, and has ever since wrongfully and unlawfully withheld said possession from plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">Here the fact of <em>ouster </em>is distinctly expressed, and, as to the <em>withholding </em>of possession, the qualifying words \u201cwrongfully and unlawfully\u201d are harmless surplusage. The force of this finding, as a fact, is not impaired by its having been placed under the heading of conclusions of law. <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>42 Cal. 180; <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>79 Cal. 490; <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Sonoma Val. Bank, </em>59 Cal. 149; <em>Bath </em>v. <em>Valdez, </em>70 Cal. 355; <em>Spargur </em>v. <em>Heard, </em>90 Cal. 228; <em>Millard </em>v. <em>Legion of Honor, </em>81 Cal. 343.)</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The court found, in effect, that the occupancy of the demanded premises by the defendant, up to August, 1890, was under and with the consent of the plaintiff. Appellant contends that this is a finding that defendant was a tenant at will, and that, since there is no finding of service of notice in writing to remove from the premises, according to section 789 of the Civil Code, the tenancy was not terminated before the commencement of the action; and consequently plaintiff had no right to the possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">While it is the general rule that in actions between landlords and tenants at will, in order to give the former a right of action notice to quit is necessary, yet, in the 'case at bar, the allegations of the complaint of the seisin and right of possession of the plaintiff are denied in the answer, and a distinct claim of ownership by the defendant is there alleged. In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Ogg Shaw, </em>16 Cal. 90, the court said: \u201cThe tenant, having disclaimed the title of the landlord and his own relation of tenant, cannot invoke the protection and advantages of that relation.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">\u201cThe defendant\u2019s answer expressly makes this denial of title and holding the possession as tenant, or that plaintiff was entitled to the possession.....The effect of this denial was to make the defendant a trespasser He was not entitled to notice to quit. Whenever he assumed to hold in defiance of the plaintiff\u2019s title, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>plaintiff was authorized to maintain his action for the recovery of the premises, and he could not set up the denial of the title and then claim the benefit of holding in subordination to it. (Taylor\u2019s Landlord and Tenant, 309; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>6 Johns. 272; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Deyo, </em>3 Johns. 422.)\u201d The decision in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Ogg Shaw, supra, </em>was affirmed in <em>Bolton </em>v. <em>Landers, </em>27 Cal. 104; <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Applegate, </em>75 Cal. 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">2. As to plaintiff\u2019s right to the possession of the demanded premises, the findings are amply sufficient. They show the paramount source of title in one Murry (antedating any claim of defendant or her grantors), and mesne conveyances from Murry down to plaintiff; the conveyance to the latter having been executed and delivered to her some nine months before the commencement of the action. These disclose title in the plaintiff, carrying with it the right to possession. In <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Treadwell, supra, </em>the court, by Justice Field, said: \u201cThe right to the possession follows as a conclusion of law from the seisin, and need not be alleged. . . . . The right of possession accompanies the ownership, and from the allegation of the fact of ownership\u2014 which is the allegation of seisin in \u2018ordinary language\u2019 \u2014the right of present possession is presumed as a matter of law.....The withholding of the possession from one who is seised of the premises is presumptively adverse to his right, and wrongful.\u201d (See, also, <em>Haight </em>v. <em>Green, </em>19 Cal. 118; <em>Salmon </em>v. <em>Symonds, </em>24 Cal. 266; <em>Depuy </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>26 Cal. 314.)</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">I think the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">Belcher, C., and Britt, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">Harrison, J., Garoutte, J., Van Fleet, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
