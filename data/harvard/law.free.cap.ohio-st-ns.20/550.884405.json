Where the language of a devise clearly and unequivocally creates in the devisee a definite and determinate estate, and the terms <em>used,proprio </em>vigore, exclude every other estate-in such devisee, to authorize such estate to be supplanted by construction, there must be created elsewhere in the will an equally determinate estate in the same subject of the devise, by the use of equally unequivocal language.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b568-9\">I am not contending that there should be express words of' rebuttal to overcome the estate created by the words <em>\u201c </em>in trust only,\u201d but I am contending that whatever is relied upon for such purpose shall at least be equally certain, and create an equally determinate estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b568-10\">\u201c I hold it to be a rule that admits of no exception, in the construction of written instruments, that where one interest is given, where one estate is conveyed, where one benefit is bestowed in one part of the instrument, by terms clear, unambiguous, liable to no doubt, clouded by no obscurity, by terms upon which, if they stood alone, no man breathing, be-he lawyer, or be he layman, could entertain a doubt \u2014 in order to reverse that opinion, to which the terms would, of themselves and standing alone, have led, it is not sufficient that you should raise a mist; it is not sufficient that you should create a doubt; it is not sufficient that you should! show a possibility; it is not even sufficient that you should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>deal in probabilities; bnt you must show something in another part of that instrument, which is as decisive the one-way as the other terms are decisive the other way; and that the interest first given cannot be taken away either by <em>taciturn </em>or by <em>dubium </em>or by <em>possibile, </em>or even by <em>probabile,. </em>but that it must be taken away, and can only be taken away by <em>expressum et certumP Thornhill et al. </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>2 Clark &amp; Finn. 22 (House of Lords Cases). This case is cited and approved in <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>13 Ohio St. 95, and is there' followed in construing a will, where the context more certainly overcomes a previously devised estate, than can possibly be claimed for the context in this will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b569-5\">LV. The operative words \u201c in trust only \u201d may not be rejected in construing the will, if the will can be construed and retain the words.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b569-6\">\u201cEvery string ought to give its sound.\u201d <em>Blamford </em>v. <em>Blamford, </em>3 Buils. 103.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b569-7\">\u201c To authorize the rejection of words in a will, there must be an absolute impossibility of construing the will, those-words being retained. The mere improbability that a testator could have meant what he has expressed, neither amounts' to a cause for rejection, nor renders the devise void for uncertainty.\u201d* <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Brailsford, </em>2 Mer. 25.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b569-8\">Y. The will may not be so construed as to give to Jane-Taylor the beneficial interest in the thing devised.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b569-9\">When the testator says, \u201c I give in trust <em>only\u00a1\\ </em>he says two-things, \u2014 the one as certainly as the other: that he gives in trust, and that he <em>does not </em>give to her the beneficial interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b569-10\">YI. If the context of this will creates a doubt as to-whether the testator did not intend to vest in the devisee the-beneficial interest, I have to say: The only province of a court in construing a will, is to determine what the will is not what the testator intended to do, but what has he done; while it is the intention of the testator which is sought, this-must be understood as his <em>expressed intention, </em>as distinguished from any intention which he may have had, and which he has not expressed; and if we find, two inconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>intentions, the one which is <em>declared </em>may not be made to give \u2022way to one which is only a matter of <em>vnferenee.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b570-5\">YII. A court will be astute to find a meaning for that which is less certain, to make it harmonize with what is certain ; and \u201c where an instrument is open to two constructions, and one will give effect to the whole, and the other will destroy a part, the former must always be adopted.\u201d <em>Pruden </em>v. Pruden, 14 Ohio St. 251. And see <em>Parker </em>v. Parker, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b570-6\">This will and all its provisions can stand with my construction; but with the construction contended for by the defence, the trust estate must be destroyed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b570-7\"><em>We </em>may not hunt for reasons in the context to defeat a declared intention; the testator had a right to make her a trustee for life only, to put the <em>corpus </em>in the hands of his executors and the income arising therefrom in trust in the hands of his wife; to postpone the enjoyment by the residuary legatees . as he pleased, and, generally, to do just what we claim. We have no right to inquire why he has done so; he had the right to do so, and to carry his reasons into the grave with him, and we have no right to dig them up. We can only inquire, <em>What has he done ? We have no right to </em>force <em>the will to harmonize with a view that we can find reasons for.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b570-8\">VIII. Where a trust is created and is not declared, \u2014 the beneficiaries are not named, \u2014 and such trust is of personalty, a general bequest of the residuum, such as is here, will carry the trust estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b570-9\">Judge Redfield, in speaking of a residuary bequest as to personal property, says: \u201cIt seems to be settled,\u201d that it \u201c carries not only everything not attempted to be disposed of, but everything which turns out not to have been effectually disposed of, as void legacies, and lapsed legacies. A presumption arises in favor of a residuary legatee, as to personalty, against every other person except the particular legatee. The testator is supposed to give it away from the residuary legatee, only for the sake of the particular legatee.\u201d 2 Red field on Wills, 442, 445.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b570-10\">In Hill on Trustees, (*136), is this language of the author: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>\u201cIt follows, therefore, that where the subject of the disposition that fails is personal estate [the trust fund in this case]'' a resulting trust will arise for the next of kin, in those cases only where there is no general residuary gift, or where it is \u2022 the whole or part of the residuary gift itself that fails.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-5\">2 Story\u2019s Eq.

These are -daily considered by courts, not only in construing private instruments, but also public laws. Thus, if a statute literally construed would be unconstitutional, it will not be so construed, but, if possible, some other interpretation will be given to it, though inconsistent with its strict letter. And so if an instrument may have two interpretations, \u2014 one making it illegal, the other legal \u2014 or, one making it unreasonable, the other reasonable \u2014 that interpretation will be adopted that -makes it legal and reasonable.

Because it makes the very fourth clause, upon which \u2022they rely, wholly unnecessary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-7\">2. It is inconsistent with the context of the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-8\">3. It requires an accumulating fund, when there is not one \u2022word in the will providing for any such thing, in respect to the rents, issues, and profits embraced by the fourth clause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-9\">4<em>. </em>It ignores the <em>negative pregnant </em>contained in the provi-sion that the <em>capital </em>shall not be diminished.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-10\">5. And the further negative pregnant arising upon the provision that the residuary legatees were not to take until the \u2022death of the widow, though that event might not happen until long after they became of age.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-11\">6. It would make the will provide for a trust ruinous to whomsoever should undertake it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-12\"><em>1. </em>And devolve this trust upon an aged female, <em>wholly incapable of executing it, </em>and continue it to the last moment of &gt;her life.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-13\">8. And devolve it upon her without requiring any security, instead of leaving the fund in the hands of the executors, who were bound to give security; or, devolving it upon some competent person and requiring him to give security.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-14\">9. And it would make the will provide for an accumulat\u00a1dng fund, without any provisions as to investment, reinvest<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>ment, or account \u2014 and this in the face of the fact that where the testator intended investment, reinvestment, etc., he gives .the most explicit directions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b573-5\">10. And it ignores the distinction that seems to have been in the testator\u2019s mind between the capital or <em>corpus </em>of his estate, .the residuum of which is to go to the plaintiffs, under the sixth clause, and the profits, etc., mentioned in the fourth clause, and as to which there is no express bequest, except, to the widow.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b573-6\">Considerations much less cogent than these have rebutted plainer words of trust than those on which the plaintiffs rely.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b573-7\">In view of the whole will, the words <em>\u201c </em>in trust only \u201d may be rejected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b573-8\">11. But it is not \u2022 necessary to reject them. The word \u201ctrust\u201d may be construed to mean and create an <em>\u201cuse,\u201d </em>which applied to this case would make the fourth clause a bequest for the <em>use </em>or benefit of the widow. 8 Peters, 326.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b573-9\">III.

We naturally, therefore, inquire, first, is there a trust? Does the wife take the rents, dividends and interest, mentioned in the fourth clause of the will, as a beneficial and absolute estate; or does she take them in trust, no matter now, whether that trust, if it exists, will result to herself as heir-at-law, by implication, or will inure to the bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>fit of Orando Taylor\u2019s children, by virtue of the sixth clause-of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The operative words of the bequest, by themselves considered, unmistabedly and admittedly, give to Mrs. Taylor a mere trust. The bequest is plainly expressed to be <em>\u201c in trust,\u201d' </em>and, as if to make it more certain, it is declared to be \u201c in trust <em>only.\u201d </em>The question presented, therefore, is whether these words, \u201cin trust only,\u201d are so in conflict with other parts of the will as to justify their rejection or modification, on the ground that the will, taken in all its parts and provisions, shows an intention to give to the wife an absolute and beneficial estate in the rents, dividends and interest, and not a-mere naked trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">It is a well-settled rule of law, that in order to justify such rejection or modification, the repugnancy must arise upon the-face of the will itself, and cannot be created or supplied by extraneous proof. And it is true also, as has been argued by counsel, that there is no other distinct word or clause in this-will, so in conflict with the clause in question, as necessarily to require the rejection of one or the other. I apprehend,, however, that a direct repugnancy of that nature is not always necessary for the purpose, but that the repugnancy may-consist in the fact that the clause to be rejected is in conflict with the general scope and tenor of the will, including as-well its implications and omissions, as its positive provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The words \u201cin trust only\u201d importing clearly an intention to give to the wife a mere trust, the question to be decided is, whether a contrary intention is more clearly manifested elsewhere, or otherwise, in the will. In other words, does-the simple reading of the will \u2014 the whole will and nothing-but the will \u2014 inspire the belief that the testator meant to-give to his wife a beneficial interest, or does it inspire the-belief that he meant merely to impose upon her the burden of a trust ? If upon such reading the latter conviction is reached, then we ought to reject the words \u201c in trust-only,\u201d or assign them some other than their strict legal import, so as to make them harmonize with the other provisions of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>The provisions and features of the will which seem to negative the idea of a mere trust estate in the wife are these:</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">1. The trust is limited to the life of the wife; a limitation wholly useless in case an actual trust was intended, but which is apt and appropriate on the supposition that she was to have-a beneficial interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">2. The bequest is accompanied by a <em>proviso, </em>that the <em>corpus </em>from which a part of the subject of the bequest arises,, namely, the debts and stock, shall <em>not </em>he diminished; <em>&amp; proviso </em>evidently pointed at the wife, and pregnant with the implication that something else which had been mentioned <em>might </em>be diminished by her; which something else could be-nothing but the <em>income </em>so bequeathed. To hold that this-proviso means, that one trust fund shall not be increased at the expense of the other, is wholly inadmissible. A proviso-is in its nature disjunctive, expressing opposition of meaning. But no opposition of meaning can be found in what precedes-the proviso, unless it be found in the fact that the wife had been invested with the right to diminish the fund so put into-her hands. And in what manner could the testator suppose she would diminish it ? Not, surely, by taking from the income and adding to the <em>corpus </em>from which it was to arise,, A proviso for the purpose of guarding against <em>such </em>a diminution of the income fund would have been useless -and nonsensical. If such had been the intention, the copulative word <em>\u201c </em>and \u201d would have been used, and not the disjunctive word. <em>\u201c </em>provided; \u201d because, in that case, there would be no opposition of meaning, but a mere continuation of the same meaning, and the testator would have said: \u201c I give the-income to my wife as a trust fund, <em>and </em>the <em>corpus </em>from, which it springs shall not be diminished.\u201d Declaring the income to be a mere trust fund in her hands, was all the inhibition against its use or diminution that was needed, and .it. only remained to <em>add </em>a like inhibition as to the <em>corpusT, </em>which had not yet been disposed of. But the language is,, <em>\u201cprovided </em>that such debts and stock shall <em>not </em>be diminished.\u201d Here is an undeniable implication that the income-might be diminished.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number><em>3. </em>The testator, while he is careful to provide for the management and protection of the <em>corpus </em>from which the fund is to arise, gives no direction as to the management or protection of the fund itself, or the manner of executing the'trust. Not a word is said as to the times, places, or forms of its investment, or requiring its investment at all; nor is any direction given as to the appointment of another trustee, in the event that the wife should die before the majority of the youngest child of Grundo Taylor, or in case she should decline to act as trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">4. No beneficiaries of the trust are named, and none can be inferred even, unless the inference is to be drawn from the use of general terms contained in the sixth clause, which can be fully satisfied, and more appropriately construed, without :any such inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">5. The receipt of the.devise and bequest made to the residuary legatees is postponed till the decease of the wife, notwithstanding the fact that they might all become of age, and be fully qualified to receive and enjoy them during her life, and without any apparent reason for such postponement, except on the supposition that the wife took a beneficial inter-est.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">6. The absence of any apparent reason for <em>severing </em>the two funds, the <em>corpus </em>and the income, constituting as they naturally do but one, if the testator intended to give the whole to the residuary legatees; and when we add to this, that one of the funds, the one most easy of management, and -already secure, was put into the hands of <em>two </em>trustees, with bond and security for its faithful administration, and the other\u2019, a fund whose management required much labor and skill, was placed in the hands of <em>one of the same </em>trustees,\u2014 or it might be, the same person acting both as trustee and -sole executrix, and without any security whatevei\u2019 \u2014 the supposition that the testator so intended becomes not only impi\u2019obable, but almost absurd. All this was natural enough, and strictly sensible and pi\u2019oper, on the theory that the funds -were thus separated because they ai-e\u2019 given to separate -parties; but if the testator intended both funds for the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>persons, the provisions of his will in that respect are not only apparently without any just or wise object had in view, but they seem to be without any object whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">These several provisions, implications and omissions of the will strongly repel the idea of an intention to create a trust estate in the wife. Taken separately neither of them may have much force, and each may, on some imaginable theory, be reconcilable with the idea that the wife takes no beneficial interest. But combined, constituting as they do the scope and body of the will, they compel the conviction, that there must be something radically wrong in the assumption, that any real trust was intended, and they force the mind to go back, as it were, and re-read the- words \u201c <em>in trust only\u201d </em>and see whether some secondary meaning cannot be assigned them, or whether they cannot be rejected altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Although the phrase \u201cin trust\u201d has a well defined.and settled legal meaning, it must be remembered that\u2019 it is a <em>technical </em>phrase, and peculiarly liable, therefore, to be misapplied, or used in some secondary sense, by persons not learned in the law. I can imagine two such secondary senses, or rather inadmissible senses, in one or the other of which the phrase in question might have been, and most probably was, used by the draftsman of this will. He may have intended the idea, that this life income was <em>mtrusted </em>to the wife\u2019s discretion, to be used in whole or in part by her, as she might see proper, thus using the term \u201c trust \u201d in the sense of <em>confidence. </em>Or, he may possibly have intended to apply the words \u201c <em>in trust </em>only, and during her natural life only,\u201d to the corpus, and not to the income, on the ground that by having the use, the wif\u00e9 virtually had the <em>corpus </em>in her hands. To assign the words either of these secondary meanings, however, would in legal effect be equivalent to their rejection. In case the first suggested meaning was the one actually intended, the wife would take an absolute estate ; and upon the latter supposition, the words \u201c in. trust only \u201d would be mere surplusage. I have little doubt but. the former was the sense in which the draftsman of this will used the phrase. He meant, in other words, to do what the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>law has over and over again decided cannot be done \u2014 toengraft a remainder upon a fee. He intended to give the wife full dominion and power of disposition over the property, and then provide that any part of it which <em>she chose </em>to leave at her death, should go over to G-rundo Taylor\u2019s children, <em>trusting </em>entirely to her to make a just and proper disposition of it, at or before her death. The law is well settled that such a devise would vest an absolute estate in the wife, and <em>that </em>for the plain reason, that a party cannot give his property absolutely to one, and qualifiedly to another. He cannot give full and unlimited dominion. over it to one, and any dominion over it or right in it to another. He cannot will his property to another, and then make a will for that other. Now, I can well imagine that the testator might have fallen into the very common error of supposing that he-could thus give the full and free use and disposition of this property, and at tbe same time limit over to the residuary legatees whatever the wife might choose to leave at her death. If such were his purpose, and he was ignorant of the true import of the technical words \u201c <em>i/n trust f </em>I know of no words he would be much more likely to adopt, to express the <em>confidence </em>he thus reposed in his wife than the words <em>\u201c </em>in trust.\u201d In this sense the words are in harmony with the other provisions of the will. In their strict legal meaning they are at. war with all it contains, so far as any light is shed by its contents upon this question of trust. Strike out these words, or, what is the same thing in legal effect, give them this-secondary and impracticable import, and the will becomes sensible, reasonable, and consistent with itself. In their technical' sense they have no apparent kinship with the other words of the will. They stand there as strangers and intruders, apparently in sympathy with nothing that preeedes- or follows them.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">That the draftsman of this will was capable of making such a mistake, and that some such mistake equally gross and bungling, either here or elsewhere, in the will, was actually committed by him, is quite evident. He was manifestly unkilled in the art of expressing thoughts by words. The testa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>\u00a1tor\u2019s intentions, regarding two of the principal subjects of his will, namely, the <em>hind of estate </em>the wife should take in the life income from the property, and, if a mere trust estate, for <em>whose benefit </em>it should be held by her, are not only not made clear and certain, but it would almost seem as if the language \u2022employed had been used for the purpose of covering them up, and it is only by a very liberal use of the rules of construction that they can be reached, or rather conjectured, at all. Some of the words of the will must be eliminated, or severely modified, otherwise no sensible and reasonable con\u2022clusion can be attained as to what the testator\u2019s intentions in relation to this life income reallywere. We are compelled either to eliminate the phrase \u201cin trust only,\u201d or else to eliminate from the will its reasonableness, its good sense, and the harmony and consistency of its several parts. These words out, and all is plain. With them in, the will is a riddle The maxim that a remainder cannot be engrafted on a fee is a truism resulting from adjudications made in cases where blunders, like the one here supposed, have been committed, and where a consequent repugnancy has resulted. Inconsistent estates in the same property were apparently devised. In one part of the will, or viewed from one standpoint, the testator seemed to have intend\u00e9d an absolute fee in the first devisee, while in another part of the will, or viewed from a different standpoint, he seemed to intend a remainder in fee to a second devisee. Both intentions cannot be carried out. Either both the apparent devises must be declared void for uncertainty, or else one or other must be rejected, or modified. The latter alternative has invariably, been adopted by the courts. The cases under this head, accordingly, arrange themselves into two classes, those where the present estate is left to stand as a fee-simple^ and the remainder is rejected, and those where the remainder is left to stand, and the present estate is cut down to a life interest. I cannot better summarize the rules by which courts seem to have been guided in both classes of cases, as I understand those rules, than by saying, that we are to discriminate in favor of the estate, or rather the intention, which the <em>will, </em>taken in all its parts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>most strongly supports. It is simply a question of probable meaning, to be decided in the light of <em>all </em>that appears in the will. A leading case of the last-mentioned class, where the fee-simple estate was cut down to a life interest and the remainder permitted to stand, is that of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>6 Pet. 68. There the language of the bequest to the wife, by itself considered, clearly imported an\u2019absolute title. The bequest was'expressed to be \u201cfor her own use and benefit, and <em>disposal </em>absolutely.\u201d And yet the court held that enough appeared elsewhere in the will to show that the testator meant to give her only a life estate. This case was \"substantially followed by us in the case of <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Bowyer et al., </em>19 Ohio St. 490, where the leading cases on the subject will be found referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">I allude to these adjudications for a single purpose, and that is, to show that the principle which necessarily underlies them all is broad enough to reach the present case. That principle is no narrower than this, that language plainly importing a devise or bequest, of <em>any description </em>of estate, may, by what appears elsewhere in the will more plainly, be overcome or modified, so as to annihilate the estate, or <em>change it </em>into an estate of a <em>different hind. </em>If the result indicated is a <em>change, </em>it matters not whether the change is to be made by cutting down, or by magnifying the estate. The same reason and the same necessity underlie both processes. If the hand of construction is at all to be laid upon the immediate .words of the devise or bequest, it must be left free, as well to build up as to pull down. If a' fee-simple may be thus <em>cut down </em>to. a life estate, for a similar reason a <em>trust </em>estate may be <em>raised </em>to a beneficial estate.' It is a rule which necessarily works both ways, if it works at all. It is a rule which can never be applied except to wills which are inartifieially drawn. It is said that no two wills are alike, and the saying is very probably true if applied only to wills inartificially drawn, and therefore the manner and process of applying the rule in each case will depend upon the particular nature of the blunder committed by the draftsman. I have already indicated the character of the blunder which wa <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>think most probably occurred in drawing this will. If we are right in this, it was the testator\u2019s intention to give the wife a beneficial interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Upon the whole, we are of opinion that these words <em>\u201c </em>in trust only,\u201d in their ordinary legal sense, are so in conflict with the general scope and tenor of the will, that they must be rejected, or held to have no legal effect in its construction, and that the wife took an absolute property in the rents, dividends, and interests specified in the fourth clause of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Petition dismissed, without costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b581-7\">Scott, C.J., and \u2018White, Day, and McIlvaine, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
