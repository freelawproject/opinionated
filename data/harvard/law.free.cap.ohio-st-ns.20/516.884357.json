Where the bill of exceptions does not profess to set out all the evidence, nor all the facts which the evidence of the plaintiffs tended to prove, if improper evidence was allowed to be introduced by the defendants, which was calculated to mislead the jury, to the prejudice of the plaintiffs, the court cannot say, on error, that no prejudice resulted.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-8\">Error to the court of common pleas of Muskingum county. Reserved in the district court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-9\">The plaintiffs in error, who were plaintiffs below, filed their petition in the court of common pleas to recover certain real estate of which the defendants were in possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-10\">Both parties claim under the will of James Taylor, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-11\">The title of the defendants is derived under the following clause of said will:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-12\">\u201c <em>Mrst. </em>I give and bequeath unto my beloved wife, Jane Taylor, the whole of my home-farm where I now reside, as an estate in fee-simple.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-13\">The plaintiffs derive title under the sixth clause of the will; and it is admitted that if the land in controversy did not pass to Jane Taylor, the widow of the testator, as part of his home-farm, under the clause of. the will above quoted, the plaintiffs were entitled to recoyer as devisees of the residue of the testator\u2019s real estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-14\">The sixth clause is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-15\"><em>\u201cSixth. </em>After the death of my beloved wife, Jane Taylor, I direct that all my estate, real, personal, and mixed, except my home-farm, my spring lot, my upper place, and the Ryan farm, as above provided, be divided, share and share alike, between the lawful children of my nephew, Grundo Taylor: provided, however, no such division be made until the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>youngest child of my said nephew, Grundo Taylor, shall have arrived at tlie' age of twenty-one years.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-5\">It appears from the bill of exceptions that, on the trial, the plaintiffs gave evidence tending to show that, prior to the* year 1826, Captain James Taylor was the owner in fee-simple of a body of land, within which' is embraced the lands described in the petition, and had sold and conveyed the same to John Boyd and Joseph Boyd, and that the Boyds had made partition of the same between themselves, by their deeds executed and delivered in that behalf, which deeds were also given in evidence, and that thereafter the Boyds occupied and farmed the several parcels separately as two farms; that afterward, and in 1826, Captain Taylor took back the title to most of the lands by a decree of court, and, in 1826, went back into the possession of both the farms, he residing upon-the farm formerly owned by John Boyd; that the portion formerly owned by Joseph Boyd was a complete farm, and abutted upon the farm formerly owned by John Boyd; that from the year 1826, when Captain Taylor went back into the possession of the premises, till his death, in March, 1843, he used and denominated- the two parcels as-two separate farms, calling the lands claimed by the plaintiffs in their petition the <em>\u201c </em>Jo. Boyd farm.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-6\">The plaintiffs also introduced evidence tending to show that Captain Taylor, in his lifetime, and before the making of the will, said he had received his means, or a considerable portion of it, from George Taylor, the father of Grundo Taylor, and brother of Captain Taylor, and that GeOrge Taylor had willed all his property to him, Captain Taylor ; and also that he intended to will said \u201c Jo. Boyd farm \u201d to Grundo\u2019s children, and to provide for, and will all his property to, Grundo and his children, in consequence of the aid he had received from George Taylor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-7\">The defendants, to maintain the issue on their part, amongst other things, called John Peters, and proposed to prove by him that the body of land so owned by Captain Taylor at his death, including the <em>\u201c </em>Jo. Boyd farm,\u201d had a neighborhood reputation, and was generally known and spoken of in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>neighborhood, from 1826 to the death of said Taylor, in March, 1843, as the <em>\u201c </em>Capt. Taylor farm,\u201d and that the witness had never heard it spoken of as two farms. To the introduction of which evidence the plaintiffs objected; but .the court overruled the objection; and the testimony was received, and plaintiffs excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-5\">The defendants further called John M. Lane as a witness, and asked him if he knew by what name the body of land-owned by Captain Taylor, at the time of his death, including the land claimed in this case, was generally known in the neighborhood, from the year 1826 to the death of Captain Taylor in 1843. To which the plaintiffs objected; but the court overruled .the objection ; and the witness stated he had only heard the same spoken of as the \u201c Capt. Taylor farm.\u201d Thereupon he was asked by counsel for defendants, if he had ever heard the same spoken of as two farms. To which the plaintiffs objected; but the court overruled the objection ; and the witn\u00e9ss answered that he had never heard the same spoken of as two farms. To the admission of which evidence the plaintiffs excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-6\">The defendants also, amongst other things, offered in evidence a certified copy of the will of said George Taylor, father of Grundo Taylor, and a transcript of the proceedings and certificates thereto attached. When the counsel for the plaintiffs inquired of counsel for the defendants, for what purpose it was desired to put in evidence said will, they answered that it was for the purpose of showing the extent of the means of George Taylor, and to show that Captain Taylor received nothing from the estate of George Taylor; whereupon the copy of said will was read in evidence; and counsel for plaintiffs objected to giving in evidence said transcript and certificates; but the court overruled the objection and allowed said transcript and certificates to be given in evidence; to-which ruling of the court the plaintiffs excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-7\">It also appeared from this will that Grundo Taylor was the-illegitimate son of said George, of which fact, the bill of exceptions states, said will was the only evidence. The fact of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>the illegitimacy of Grundo the jury was allowed to consider as evidence in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-5\">One of the instructions asked by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to be given to the jury, is as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AIf\">\u201c While the fact may be considered that this land was all in one body, and that the whole of it was sometimes spoken of by the neighbors as the \u2018 Capt. Taylor farm,\u2019 yet this is not necessarily to exercise a controlling influence in the decision of this case; and if the jury shall be satisfied that, notwithstanding the fact that the land was in one body, and the whole body was sometimes spoken of as the Capt. Taylor farm,\u2019 Capt. Taylor intended the words home-farm\u2019 to apply to a part only of the lands as situated in a body; in that case the jury is bound to give effect to the intention of Capt. Taylor; to give effect to the words <em>home-far</em>m in the sense that <em>he </em>intended to use them, and therefore find for the plaintiffs.\u201d But the court refused so to charge the jury without qualifying <em>as the same is qualified in the charge given; </em>to which ruling of the court the plaintiffs excepted.\u201d The bill of exceptions contains the whole of the charge of the court, but only so much of it is here stated as is necessary to an understanding of the decision of this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-7\">\u2022 In summing up the evidence to the jury the court, among \u2022other things, said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-8\"><em>\u201c </em>Evidence has been offered tending to establish that Capt. Taylor received such aid from his brother, the father of Grundo Taylor, that he said at various times that he owed all he was worth to Grnndo\u2019s father; the will of George Taylor, and,certain proceedings under it, have been put in evidence; that Capt. Taylor had no children; that Capt. Taylor received but little property with his wife; that $800 of his wife\u2019s share of her father\u2019s estate was invested by Capt. Taylor\u2019s direction in bank stock in her name, he adding some $200 of his own money in order to make her the owner of $1,000 of stock; that Grundo married, had a number of children, etc.; that Grundo was the illegitimate son of the testator\u2019s brother; that Capt. Taylor gave him a farm on Jonathan\u2019s \u2022creek; that this farm was sold, and all the proceeds, except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>a horse and wagon, applied on the 482 acres; that the Pelham lot and two other lots of the <em>\u201c </em>Burgh \u201d were bought and fenced in with the other farming land, making about 482 acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-5\">\u201c Evidence has also been offered tending to show the neighbors spoke of this land as being one or more farms.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-6\">In prescribing the rule to guide the jury in determining whether the land in controversy constituted part of the home-farm devised by the first clause of the will, the court used the following language:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-7\">\u201c If you find that, up to the date of the will, Capt. Taylor -dealt with and talked about, etc., this 482 acres as two farms, and also find that the 482 acres have acquired among the neighbors, as I have described, a distinct, definite reputation as one farm, or as his <em>\u2018 </em>home-farm/ then you must decide, from all the evidence I have told you was properly before you, referring particularly to his declaration of intention, the circumstances surrounding the testator at the time of making the will, the property he had, how and when acquired, the objects of his bounty, his family and relations, and his relation to them, the value of the provision made for his widow by the law as compared with the one made by the will under either interpretation of it, in which sense Capt. Taylor used those words, whether he used them in accordance with his own mode of dealing with the land, or in the neighborhood meaning.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-8\">At the end of the charge an exception is taken in the following language:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-9\">\u201c To which charge so given, and to every part thereof, the plaintiffs excepted, and prayed the court to sign and seal this their bill of exceptions in such behalf, and make the same a part of the record in this case; all which is accordingly done.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-10\">The verdict and judgment were for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-11\">The plaintiffs now assign for error, among other things, that the court erred in admitting in evidence the neighborhood reputation as testified to by Peters and Lane; in admitting in evidence the transcript of. the proceedings and certi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>ficates to the will of George Taylor; in refusing to charge as asked, and in the charge as given; and in saying to the jury that the will of George Taylor was evidence of the illegitimacy of Grundo Taylor.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b536-5\"><em>Lucius P. </em>Marsh, for plaintiffs in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiR\">The question litigated below was upon the construction of a clause in the -will of Capt. Taylor, the clause being, \u201c <em>the whole of my homefa/rm tohere I now </em>reside.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-7\">I may here remark, that the words, \u201c <em>the whole of\u201d </em>do no't aid us in construing the clause, for the reason that they are used of every parcel specifically devised by him, viz.: \u201c <em>The whole of </em>my home-farm,\u201d \u201c <em>the whole of </em>my lot.. . . known as Capt. Taylor\u2019s spring lot,\u201d \u201c <em>the whole of </em>my farm called the upper farm.\u201d The thing to be ascertained is the intention of the testator. The terms of the will, \u201chome-farm where I now reside,\u201d are clear and unambiguous ; they are made uncertain by extrinsic evidence; the uncertainty thus created may be removed by extrinsic evidence. Phil, on Evidence (4th Am. Ed.), p. 636 <em>et seq.; </em>Wigram on Wills, 11, 14; <em>Doolittle </em>v. <em>Blakesley, </em>4 Day\u2019s R. 265. In the last ease the words \u201c home-farm \u201d are construed, and their application ascertained; and see <em>Hatch </em>v. Hatch, 2 Hayw. 32; <em>Venable </em>v. McDonald, 4 Dana, 336; <em>Painter </em>v. Painter, 18 Ohio, 265; and <em>Ashworth </em>v. <em>Carlton, </em>12 Ohio St. 381.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-8\">It is here complained that the court below admitted improper evidence, and erred in its charge to the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-9\">The plaintiffs having given evidence tending to prove their case, the defendants then put in evidence the testimony of Peters.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b536-10\">I submit that the question made and sought to be solved by proof is this: what did Capt. Taylor mean and intend by the use of the words \u201c home-farm where I now reside \u201d <em>% </em>what land in <em>his </em>mind did the term \u201c home-farm \u201d cover and include ? It is not competent to arrive at his meaning, his intentions, by proving what his neighbors called or denominated the entire tract. He doesn\u2019t say of his home-farm What he says of his \u201c spring lot: \u201d of the latter he says \u201c the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>lot <em>called </em>Capt. Taylor\u2019s spring lot,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>\u201c that is the name by which it is generally known.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-5\">It may be that in the case of the \u201c spring lot \u201d it would be-competent to prove that a lot had a neighborhood reputation as \u201c Capt. Taylor\u2019s spring lot.\u201d He says the same of the- \u201c upper farm : \u201d \u201c the farm <em>called </em>my upper farm.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-6\">He does not say of the farm devised to his wife \u201c the farm <em>called </em>my home-farm,\u201d but \u201c I devise the home-farm where I now reside,\u201d etc. He points out the way and means of identifying it: \u201c the farm where I now reside.\u201d He doesn\u2019t profess to adopt any general or particular name by which the farm is generally known. He doesn\u2019t say \u201cblackacre,\u201d or \u201c spiting lot,\u201d but \u201c the farm where I now reside,\u201d \u201c my home\u00bb farm.\u201d I submit that it is not competent to prove that by general reputation the <em>whole </em>body of land was known as \u201c Capt. Taylor\u2019s home-farm.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-7\">But if such proof be competent, it must be limited to <em>general reputation; </em>it must be proof that a body of land had in the neighborhood a name at least synonymous with the words-used in the will, and the witness must first qualify himself, must show that he has the means of knowing that reputation, before he can say what it is.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-8\">My objections, then, to the testimony of Peters are as-follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-9\">1st. He doesn\u2019t show he was qualified to testify of the general reputation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-10\">2d. He doesn\u2019t say that this body of land or any part of it; had any name by general reputation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-11\">3d. The name he gives the whole parcel is, \u201cthe Capt. Taylor farm.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-12\">4th. \"Witness had never heard it spoken of as two farms.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-13\">What is said of the testimony of Peters may be said with more force of the testimony of Lane, admitted in evidence,, under objection.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-14\">He is asked the direct question whether he had ever heard the body of land spoken of as two farms; to which he answers he has not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b537-15\">H it be true that these witnesses have testified substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>to a general reputation, and if this court will presume they were qualified to do so, the name which such reputation gives 'this land is <em>\u201cthe Gcupt. Taylor farm\u201d </em>not the name which -the testator gives in his will; he says \u201c my home-farm where I now reside,\u201d while the witnesses say the whole parcel was, as far as they knew, generally called \u201c the Oapt. Taylor -farm.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-5\">It is here substantially put to the jury,,that unless there were <em>two farms, </em>the home-farm covered it all; and that if <em>nobody </em>had spoken of this body of land as two farms, Capt. Taylor intended, in the use of the term \u201chome-farm,\u201d to cover it all. If a part of the land constituted the home-farm, we were entitled to recover the balance, whether that balance was a <em>farm </em>or not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-6\"><em>We </em>may have come short in our proof of establishing the <em>second </em>farm in the tract, while we may have proved that the \u201c home-farm\u201d covered only that part of the tract not de-scribed in our petition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-7\">It may be true that where there is doubt as to the sense in which a testator uses a word or phrase, his intention may be ascertained by proof of general reputation in the neighborhood as where he uses a provincialism, used in different -localities in a different sense; but that isn\u2019t this case. He says my \u201chome-farm; \u201d what did <em>he </em>mean and intend?</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-8\">It cannot be said, that it does not appear (admitting all I claim) that the plaintiffs are prejudiced thereby. If hearsay evidence is objected to and permitted to go to the jury, the judgment must be reversed unless it affirmatively appear in the record that the party is <em>not </em>prejudiced thereby. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Barkalow, </em>11 Ohio St. 470; <em>Lowe </em>v. <em>Lehman, </em>15 Ohio St. 179.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-9\">The court erred in admitting the transcript of the proceedings and certificates attached to the will of George Taylor. They were not competent evidence for the purpose for which they were introduced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b538-10\">But is it competent for the defendants to prove the extent of the means of the grandfather of plaintiffs, and that the tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>tator under whom plaintiffs claim toot noticing of his bounty by the terms of his will, or otherwise?</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-4\">It cannot be said that such proof becomes competent by reason of the failure of plaintiffs to object to the reading of the will. If a party expressly consents to the admission of one item of improper testimony, is he therefore bound to-allow to go to the jury all the improper evidence that is-offered ? Here, if the will of Geo. Taylor was improper evidence, it simply went in without objection; there was no express consent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-5\">It cannot be claimed either, that because the plaintiffs proved the declarations of Capt. Taylor; that he got money from Geo. Taylor\u2019s estate; that all he was worth he owed to-the father of Grundo, and that he was consequently under obligation to provide for the children of Grundo, therefore-defendants might prove that George had no estate, or but a small one, and that Capt. Taylor got -nothing from it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-6\">It was not competent to prove the illegitimacy of Grundo-Taylor, the father of the plaintiffs. Such proof did not tend to illustrate the issue \u2014 to show what was the \u201c home-farm \u201d in. the intention of Capt. Taylor. Such proof was not only not competent, but was prejudicial to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-7\">But if the fact of illegitimacy could be proved, the will of George Taylor was not evidence of it. A man may not bastardize his offspring, or any of- them, who may incur his displeasure, by saying, in his will, that they are illegitimate. The statement of the ancestor, <em>not wider </em>oath, is not competent evidence because it happens to be in a will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-8\">The court erred in refusing to charge the jury as requested by plaintiffs in regard to the effect to be given to the words \u201chome-farm,\u201d and the intention of the testator in using them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-9\">The court erred in the charge given to the jury.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b539-10\"><em>Hunter &amp; Daugherty, </em>for defendants in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-11\">The question of right between the parties depends upon-the meaning and effect of the words: \u201c <em>The whole of m</em>y <em>home-farm where I now </em>reside,\u201d as applied to the land in his-possession at his death. The first effort of the counsel for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>plaintiffs, in his argument, is to destroy the effect of the qualifying word <em>\u201c whole\u201d </em>in the description of the thing devised, and this he essays to do at a dash, as though it were a mere trifle, scarcely worthy of notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-5\">His argument is, that the repeated use of the phrase as applied to different things impairs the effect it might have if \u2022only used once. Doubtless, as applied to the home-farm, and in view of the character of the claim asserted by the plaintiffs, the phrase has a most pertinent effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-6\">If the testator had a <em>\u201c home-farm \u201d </em>it was the lands he took hack from the Boyds and occupied as one farm from the year 1826 to the time of his death, March 20,1813, and in devising it to his wife, for convenience of description, and to distinguish it from another farm called his \u201c <em>upper fa/rm\u201d' </em>he called it his <em>home-farm.\u201d That \u201chome-farm\u201d </em>\u2014 certainly none other \u2014he devised to his wife \u2014 the <em>\u201c whole \u201d </em>of it. And the word \u201c <em>whole \u201d </em>was evidently used to exclude any question that might otherwise be raised as to the extent of the subject-matter intended to be devised; and the only extrinsic fact necessary to be shown by proof outside of the will, to establish the right of the widow as devisee to the \u201c whole <em>of the .homefa/rm\u201d </em>would be such as would identify the farm on which the testator resided at the date of his will, and according to the original public surveys, or other known metes and bounds, what would be its description according to a proper .survey. This done, there would not be any <em>ambiguity; </em>and the effect would be as certain as if such description, according to a proper survey, had been embodied in the devise.

Boyd farm.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b545-9\">To rebut this testimony it was plainly proper to prove that the tract was not so known and denominated after Capt. Taylor became the owner thereof in 1826, but that it was knowm and denominated as <em>one </em>farm, called \u201c The Capt. Taylor farm,\u201d and not otherwise. And that it was not otherwise called, could only be proved by the testimony of witnesses, that they had never heard it spoken of as more than one farm.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b545-10\">But, say plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, the witnesses Peters and Lane did not call it the home-farm.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq8\">Neither did the plaintiffs\u2019 testimony tend to prove that any <em>pcurt </em>of it was so called.

And the same of Lane.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-8\">If this was the objection to the testimony, it ought to be' <em>qffvrmatwel/y </em>shown by the bill of exceptions that the witnesses <em>did not </em>show themselves qualified to speak, or their testimony on that subject should be set out so that the court could judge whether they were qualified. Error is never presumed-The presumption in respect to official acts, and especially in. respect to the proceedings of courts of general jurisdiction, is, <em>\u201c Omnia gprcesumuntur rite et solenniter esse aeta donee 'probetur i/n eontra/riumP </em>(Broom\u2019s Max. 637.) Here the bill of exceptions does not purport to set forth <em>all </em>the testimony of Peters and Lane, nor does it state anything from which it must be inferred that they were not qualified. The presumption therefore is, that they showed themselves qualified\u2019 before the court permitted them to testify as to reputation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-9\"><em>Agawi: </em>It is said that the witnesses do not \u201c say that this. body of land, or any part of it, had any name by general reputation.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-10\">Now, bearing in mind that the presumption is that the witnesses were qualified to speak, their testimony <em>does </em>show that the tract had a name by general reputation, to wit:</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-11\">\u201c The Oapt. Taylor Farm.\u201d And here it is again to be observed, that the whole of their testimony is not set out.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-12\">It is next objected, that the name testified to was the' Oapt. Taylor Farm, and not the home-farm. On this I have' already remarked.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-13\">Finally, it is objected that the witnesses were permitted^ to testify that they had never heard it spoken of as two. farms.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>But this hind of negative testimony is admissible in all cases of proof of reputation, whether of persons or things.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-5\">It is also said that the court erred in admitting the transcripts of the proceedings and certificates to the will of Geo. Taylor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-6\">The plaintiff had given testimony tending to prove that the testator had acquired his means from the estate of his brother George Taylor, deceased, from which it might be argued that he would make provision for the plaintiffs who were grandchildren of said George. To rebut this testimony the defendants gave the testimony excepted to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-7\">If the testimony in chief was admissible, the rebutting testimony was also admissible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-8\">I confess that the inclination of my mind is, that the plaintiffs\u2019 testimony was not admissible. Apart from any other consideration, it seems to me that the inference to be drawn from it is <em>too remote. </em>But, in view of the authorities already cited, and especially Redfield, 621, \u00a7 25, we did not think it prudent to object to the testimony. The opinion of Caldwell, J., in <em>Moore </em>v. <em>The State, </em>2 Ohio St. 505-6, is also, perhaps, worthy of consideration, in this connection, upon the question of what testimony is too remote.</p>\n<p data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b547-9\">But if the plaintiffs\u2019 testimony was inadmissible, then they were not prejudiced by tlie rebutting testimony of the defendants. For the latter could, by no possibility, do more than rebut the incompetent testimony of the plaintiffs. I admit the general rule that the admission of incompetent testimony on one side will not justify the admission of incompetent testimony on the other. Thus, if the plaintiff, without objection, give incompetent testimony, the <em>defendant </em>cannot maintain error on the ground that incompetent rebutting testimony was rejected by the court. But the case is wholly different where it is the <em>plaintiff </em>below, who comes into a court of errors and complains that the rebutting testimony was received. For here, the question instantly arises, <em>\u201c Was </em>he <em>prejudiced </em>by it ? \u201d And if it appeared that it could have had' no other effect than to rebut <em>his own incompetent testir </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number><em>mony, </em>then it is mathematically certain that he was not pre judieed by it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-5\">It will be seen, from what I have just said, that I also admit that other rule, that where incompetent testimony has-been given, against an objection, it is not necessary that the-party objecting shall show that he was <em>actually </em>prejudiced thereby. It is sufficient, if it appear that he <em>may have been </em>so prejudiced. But that possibility must exist. And hence,, if no such possibility could exist \u2014 if the whole effect of the testimony in question was to rebut equally incompetent testimony on the other side \u2014 there has been no prejudice to the party complaining, and the judgment will not be reversed. It is on this ground that courts found the distinction between the admission of material and immaterial testimony, and hold that if the testimony was immaterial to the issue and could not have prejudiced the party objecting to it, the judgment will not be reversed.. And this is so, even where the testimony is not rebutting. <em>A fortiori </em>is it so, when it is merely in rebutter of incompetent testimony given by the other side.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-6\">\u201c Courts will not reverse a judgment merely because improper or irrelevant testimony has been received, if there is no reason to apprehend that the improper or irrelevant testimony could have had any influence upon the jury.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Barklow, </em>11 Ohio St. 475; <em>Baddington </em>v. <em>Shearer, </em>22 Pick. 427; <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Short, </em>21 Id. 142.</p>\n<p data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-7\">The court properly refused to charge the jury as requested by counsel for plaintiffs, without qualification.</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-8\">It is said, the court erred in the charge given to the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-10\">This assignment of error cannot be noticed. The only exception taken to the charge was, \u201cTo which charge so given, and to every part thereof, the plaintiffs excepted.\u201d A charge cannot be excepted to <em>in gross, </em>in this manner. The true rule is to require specific exceptions to the charge to be made before the jury retire, so that the court may consider them, and correct any error into which it may inadvertently have fallen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>There was no error in the charge, at least none to the prejudice of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b549-5\"><em>Lucius P. </em>Marsh, for plaintiffs, in reply:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-6\">A man may be the owner of several farms adjoining each other, upon one of which he lived, and which he called his \u201chome-farm,\u201d and on a devise of the \u201chome-farm,\u201d with proof of such state of case, the devisee would only be entitled to the <em>one </em>farm,, and in making such proof, the matter to be ascertained would be, what body of land did the testator intend in the use of the words \u201c home-farm.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-7\">Undoubtedly, evidence would be admissible, that before and after making a will, the testator was in the habit of calling the one farm the \u201chome-farm,\u201d and the others, the- \u201c Brown farm,\u201d the \u201c Smith farm,\u201d etc. If there were two farms, proof that he was in the habit of calling one the \u201c Jo.

There was no direct proof that he knew of this neighborhood talk; and he was in no way connected with it, unless it be from a presumption arising that every man knows everything that is a matter of general notoriety. I say the law will not presume he knew of the matters testified by the witnesses, because it was not, and they don\u2019t say it was, a matter of general reputation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b550-7\">But if it be presumed that he knew of this talk in the neighborhood, of the name given to the lands, he might, or he might not, be controlled by such knowledge in giving the land a name in his will; and I insist that no presumption arises that he would or did. The name given to the lands by the neighborhood talk, if Capt. Taylor knew it, can\u2019t aid us any; the neighbors apply one name to both farms; he applies another name to one of them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b550-8\">The witnesses, or one of them, was asked the direct question whether he had ever heard this body of land spoken of as two farms, and he answered that he had not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b550-9\">This is hearsay evidence, and calculated in its nature to mislead the jury; they are led to believe that the neighbors must have known whether there was more than one farm; and the court instructed the jury to look to all the evidence to ascertain whether there was more than one farm.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b550-10\">White, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq1\">The question for determination on the trial of this case, was whether the lands described in the petition formed a part of the home-farm of the testator on which he resided at the date of his will. And it seems plain to us that this fact was sought to be ascertained upon an erroneous view of the law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">The plaintiffs, without objection, gave evidence tending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>-to show that the testator had received a large part of his means from the father of Grundo Taylor, and that, in consequence of such aid, the testator had said he intended to provide for and will his property to Grundo and his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">To rebut this, the defendants were allowed, also without objection, to give in evidence the will of Grundo\u2019s father; .and were also allowed to submit to the jury, as proper for their consideration, the fact of the illegitimacy of Grundo.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">In the charge, the jury were told these were proper matters for their consideration in determining the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">It was said, in the charge, that the jury might refer to the testator\u2019s declaration of intention, the circumstances surrounding him at the time of making the will, the property he had, how and when acquired, the objects of his bounty, his family and relations, and his relation to them, the value of the provision made for his widow by the law as compared with that made by the will, in order to ascertain the meaning of the words describing the land devised.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">Such considerations can afford no legitimate aid in determining the extent or boundaries of a farm, which was the only question in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">In the admission of improper evidence on the part of the defendants, which operated only to rebut evidence improperly introduced by the plaintiffs, there was no error to the prejudice of the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">But the evidence of general reputation, which was admitted against the objection of the plaintiffs, that the whole body of land constituted the home-farm, or but one farm, was not of that character. And the question is, whether it was error to admit this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">The operation of a will is to be determined by the language it contains. But, as in the case of deeds or other instruments, parol evidence is admissible to show what it is that corresponds with the description.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">\u201c If the word Blackacre be used in a will, there must be evidence to show that the field in question is Blackacre. Where there is a devise of an estate purchased of A., or of a farm in the occupation of B., it must be shown by extrin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>sic evidence what estate it was that A. purchased, \u2022 or what, farm was in the occupation of B., before it can be known, what was devised. So, whether parcel or not of the thing devised, is always matter of evidence. In these and similar cases, the instrument appears on the face of it to be' perfectly intelligible, and free from ambiguity, yet extrinsic evidence must, nevertheless, be received for the purpose' of showing what the instrument refers to.\u201d Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, p. 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The premises in question are not devised by name, nor is this a case in which there are two or more subjects, either of which will equally answer the description in the will. The-descriptive words of the devise are, \u201c The whole of my home-farm where I now reside, as an estate in fee-simple.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The testator admittedly had but one home-farm, and, as-already remarked, the only question was as to its extent or boundaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The fact sought to be proved that there were two farms,, was only material as showing the extent of the home-farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">The extrinsic evidence must be pertinent and material to the fact to be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">The situation of the land, the manner in which it had been used and treated, are proper subjects of inquiry. Such was-the character of the evidence in <em>Doolittle et ux. </em>v. <em>Blakesley, </em>4 Day\u2019s R. 265. But it seems clear to us that hearsay, or neighborhood reputation, cannot be resorted to.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">The case of <em>Anstee </em>v. <em>Nelms </em>(1 Hurls. &amp; Nor. 225) is, we think, distinguishable from the present. There the land devised was described as \u201cin the parish of Doynton.\u201d The parish was referred to by its name as one of the municipal subdivisions of the country; and it was held that the parish must be presumed to have been understood as including what was commonly reputed to be within' it.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">But it is said the plaintiffs were not prejudiced by the evidence. Its tendency was to prejudice; and in the charge, the jury were directed that if they found that the 482 acres-had acquired among the neighbors a definite reputation as one farm, or as the testator\u2019s home-farm, they must consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>such reputation in determining whether the testator used the-descriptive words of the devise in a sense in accordance with his own mode of dealing with the land, or in the neighborhood meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The bill of exceptions does not profess to set out all the evidence ; nor all the facts which the evidence of the plaintiffs-tended to prove. If, therefore, improper evidence was allowed to be introduced by the defendants, which was calculated to mislead the jury to the prejudice of the plaintiffs,, there is no ground upon which we can say, as matter of law,, that no prejudice resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The foregoing views render it unnecessary to consider the-objection of the defendant\u2019s counsel, as to the form in which the exception was taken to the general charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">It may be added, however, that the charge asked by the-plaintiffs\u2019 counsel in regard to the effect to be given to the words <em>\u201c </em>home-farm,\u201d and which was refused by the court,, was calculated, under the state of the evidence, to mislead-the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b553-9\">Scott, C.J., and \"Welch-, Day, and MoIlvaine, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
