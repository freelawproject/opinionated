Andrews to contest the validity of the last will of John Bradford. The petition was in the form prescribed by the code, and was filed within two years after probate of the will. One of the defendants, William Bradford, filed an answer, in which, by way of cross-petition, he joined with the plaintiff in asserting the invalidity of the will, and in praying to have it set aside. A summons was thereupon issued and served upon the plaintiff and the other defendants, requiring them to answer this cross-petition of William. Subsequently, and after the expiration of the two years, the statutory period of limitation, the plaintiff dismissed his petition. A motion was then made by one of the defendants to dismiss the answer and cross-petition of William, on the alleged ground that the dismissal of the original petition put an end to the case. This motion the court overruled. It being then discovered that two of the parties interested ip the contest, namely, Eliza Bradford and Sarah Watson, had not been made parties to the proceeding, they were, on motion of William Bradford, made defendants, and served with process, requiring them to answer the cross-petition. Upon their appearance Eliza Bradford and Sarah Watson answered, setting up the statutory limitation of two years, as a bar to the action against them. On demurrer to this answer, and also on demurrer to the answer and cross-petition of William Bradford, the court held the answer of said Eliza and Sarah to be sufficient, and that the action was barred as to all the defendants, and gave judgment dismissing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>the same accordingly. To reverse tbis judgment is tbe object of tbe present petition in error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b224-5\"><em>C. L.

And see Redfield on Wills, 322, 323.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-8\">The distinction as to limitation of \u201c actions and suits,\u201d and limitation of \u201cproceedings in error,\u201d is recognized in the <em>index </em>in vols. 10, 12, 13 and 14, of the Ohio State Reports.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-9\">The court below did not decide that it had no jurisdiction of the persons of Sarah Watson and Eliza Bradford; still less as to the subject-matter; but only, <em>in the exercise of its </em>jurisdiction, that they had a good defence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-10\">The plea of limitation no more \u201c ousts the jurisdiction \u201d of the court than the plea of payment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b228-11\"><em>Young &amp; Gottschall </em>and <em>Houle ds McMaha/n </em>for defendants in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-12\">1.

Lamb, 17 Ohio St. 385-387.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-15\">So far as they were concerned, within two years aftej <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>probate had, no one appeared and contested the validity of the will. After that time the probate as to them, at least, was \u201c forever binding.\u201d The estoppel was mutual Neither of them coxrld contest the will against the other parties, and the latter cordd not contest-it as against them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-5\">The judgment is not in conflict with the decision in <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>14 Ohio St. 157. In rendering the judgment the court does not pass upon the validity of the will, but simply decides that the issue cannot now be made up to try its validity, because the action was not commenced in time to give the court and jury jurisdiction. And this fact being admitted, what is there for the jury to try<em>?</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-6\">It was not sufficient that an action against some of ths defendants was commenced within the two years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-7\">1. There was no \u201cunity of interest\u201d but only a \u201ccontinuity of interest \u201d between the parties. Unity means indivisibility. In one sense all parties have a common interest in a will; that is, the will affects them all in common. But they generally have very different and often adversary interests in it. And see <em>Thompson </em>v. Thompson, 13 Ohio St. 356.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-8\">The statute says an action shall be deemed commenced as to each \u201c <em>defendant </em>\u201d at the date of summons upon himself or on a \u201c <em>eo-defendcmtP </em>Code, sec. 20; and see secs. 55, 85, 56, 57.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-9\">Now, until the two years had elapsed Eliza Bradford and Sarah Watson were not defendants at all; and hence, within the two years, as to them, there were no \u201c co-defendants,\u201d and no service upon any co-defendant of theirs; and no action commenced against them within that time by service upon a co-defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-10\">Nor did any of the defendants undertake to defend for these two or for their benefit, or to represent them. Nor did it appear from the record that they had any interest, common, general, or otherwise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-11\">The action to which they were made defendants, but not in due time, failed upon its merits, and this is a proceeding reverse it, but not a new action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>2. No action having been commenced against two of the legatees under the will, within the two years, and this suit having been dismissed, and the will being consequently valid as to them, the court had no jurisdiction to proceed against the other defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-5\">The provisions of the statute which apply to this case are : wills act, secs. 15, 19, 20, 21, S. &amp; C. 1618; probate act, secs. 24, 25, S. <em>&amp; </em>0.1216; Code, sec. 70, S. <em>&amp; </em>C. 964.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-6\">Under these provisions of the statute, <em>the issue </em>is \u2014 was this paper, this writing here produced and offered to the jury as a unit, one indivisible thing, the last will of the testator ? Not, was this line, this paragraph, this page, this legacy or this devise valid ? Not was this writing a valid will as to A., B. and C., the parties to this suit ? But does the writing, as a unit, possess the qualities which, under the laws of this State, make it the last will of the testator. <em>Mears </em>v. <em>Mears, </em>15 Ohio St. 94-98.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-7\"><em>As to parties : </em>There can be no contest without parties. Code, secs. 70, 85; 17 Ohio St. 386; wills act, sec. 21. What parties are meant <em>% </em>Not certainly such parties only as the plaintiff may choose to make defendants to his bill or petition, but proper parties, or all whose rights are to be affected by the verdict or decree, viz.: all the heirs, distributees, legatees, and devisees. <em>Mears </em>v. Mears, 15 Ohio St. 96; 2 Redfield on Wills, 29, note 30.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-8\">The controversy cannot be determined without prejudice to the rights of absent parties, and hence cannot be determined at all until these parties are brought in. Code, sec. 40.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-9\">And this is so, because of the unity and indivisibility of the subject of the action, and because the common interests of the parties cannot be saved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-10\">See <em>Meese and wife </em>v. <em>Keefe et </em>al., 10 Ohio, 362; <em>Wilkins </em>v. <em>Philips, </em>3 Ohio, 49; <em>Massie </em>v. <em>Matthews, </em>12 Ohio, 351; <em>Sturges </em>v. <em>Longworth, </em>1 Ohio St. 544, for cases in which the saving of one inures to the benefit of all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-11\">Now, for a similar reason, viz.: the unity, entirety, and indivisibility of the subject of the action, and the impossibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>of severing the interest of the parties, it would seem that where the statute has run in favor of one of the parties, so as to protect him against a contest, that protection necessarily extends to all. This court has declared this principle in <em>Smetters </em>v. <em>Rainey et </em>al., 13 Ohio St. 568; <em>Smetters and Harris </em>v. <em>Rainey et al., </em>14 Ohio St. 287.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-5\">This case disposes of all the points made by the plaintiff in error in the present case. The action was not deemed pending from the date of the summons served upon a co-defendant, and was not regarded as having failed otherwise than upon its merits; and the plea of the statute of limitations by one defendant ousted the jurisdiction of the court over the subject-matter, and the action was dismissed as to all the defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-6\">The case of <em>Holt </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>17 Ohio St. 374, is not against us. In a proceeding to contest a will to which only a part of the persons interested are made parties, the verdict binds only the parties, and it binds them only by way of <em>estoppel. </em>This is the gist of the decision; and surely there is nothing in it which decides or even justifies an inference that the validity of a will can be properly tried and determined in a contest between only part of the persons interested. Quite the contrary is the effect of the decision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-7\">3.

A writ of error or reservation of a case from the district court is appellate jurisdiction. <em>Chase </em>v.

If however this court shall be of opinion that the superior court had jurisdiction over the subject-matter, still we claim that such jurisdiction was not properly invoked in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-15\">The two modes of contest are by bill in chancery or petition under the code. By one of these modes the jurisdiction of the court must be invoked, or it is not invoked at all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>The plaintiff in the case below chose the latter mode, and to his petition the plaintiff in error filed what he calls \u201c an answer and cross-petition.\u201d This answer was not an answer, because it contained no denial, or statement of new matter constituting a defence, counter claim, or set off, but simply a repetition of the allegations of the petition; and it was not a cross-petition because it was not an answer. Code, secs. 92, 84. Not being a counter claim or set off, the defendant (plaintiff in error) had no right to proceed to trial after the original petition was dismissed. The plaintiff had the right to dismiss his case at any time before the final submission to the court or jury, and such dismissal dismissed the whole case except as to a defendant who had presented a counter claim or set off. Code, secs. 372, 373. The plaintiff did dismiss the case, and with it the \u201c answer and cross-petition \u201d of the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b233-5\">Welch, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9n\">We think the superior court erred in holding the action barred, and in dismissing the proceeding. Where a petition for such a contest is filed within the statutory period of limitation, although only part of the persons interested are made parties thereto, the right of action is saved as to all who are ultimately made parties, notwithstanding some of them are not brought into the case until after the period of limitation has expired. If any person interested appears, and in good faith files his petition for a contest, the statute entitles him to a trial, and the verdict of a jury, touching the validity of the will; and that verdict will be binding upon all parties who may be before the court as such, at the time of its rendition. The interest of the parties is joint and inseparable. Substantially this is a proceeding <em>in rem, </em>and the court cannot take jurisdiction of the subject-matter by fractions. The will is indivisible, and the verdict of the juiy either establishes it as a whole, or wholly sets it aside. To save the right of action therefore to one is necessarily to save it to all. The case belongs to that class of actions where the law is compelled either to hold the rights of all parties in interest to be saved, or all to be barred. And it seems now to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>quite well settled law, that the preference will in such cases be given to the right of action, and not to the right of limitation. The right to sue is a favored right, and is guaranteed by constitutional provision, while the right of limitation generally meets with more or less disfavor. I am aware that the case of <em>Smetters and Harris v. Rainey and others </em>(14 Ohio St. 287) conflicts with this doctrine, and I am frank to say, for myself, that I deem that case a departure from well-established principles, and one that should be overruled whenever a proper case occurs for reconsidering the question involved. The question there, though really involving a like principle with that involved in the present case, was not identical, and need not, therefore, be passed upon by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">But, say the counsel for defendants in error, the plaintiff below dismissed his petition, after the expiration of the two years, and this put an end to the action, and left the matter standing as it would have stood had no petition ever been filed. When the jurisdiction of the court has once attached in such a case, I suppose it is not in the power of the petitioner to withdraw the action against the will of the other parties in interest. The status of the parties, as plaintiffs or defendants, is merely nominal. Those named as defendants have a right, equally with the nominal plaintiff, to insist upon a contest. Otherwise, there woxild be no safety to the defendants who happened to be identified in interest with the plaintiff, except in the commencement of separate similar actions, or the filing of a cross-petition by each.. We need not, however, decide this question, for the precaution was taken in the present Case to file such cross-petition before the period of limitation had expired or the original petition had been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">But it is contended that this cross-petition was not well filed, and was a nullity, becaiise the answer containing it is not such as the code requires. The argument is this : The proceeding is an action under the code, and not by bill in chancery; relief by way of cross-petition can only be had under the code (sec. 84), by a claim therefor set up 'in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>answer; and the answer of William Bradford, in which this prayer for relief is contained, being in perfect accord with the plaintiffs case, is not an answer within the definition of the code (sec. 92), because it does not contain a \u201c denial \u201d of any allegations in plaintiffs petition, or a statement of any \u201c new matter constituting a defence, counter claim, or set off.\u201d We think this logic unsound. If it is not, and if counsel are right in claiming that the plaintiff can, at any time, withdraw tne whole case by dismissing his petition, then no defendant in the action is safe against the statute of limitations, without commencing a separate and independent proceedingand thus, in every contest there might be as many actions as there are parties desiring to set aside the will. This cannot be the law. An answer admitting the case made in the petition, and joining in the prayer for relief, is an answer within the meaniug of the code, entitling the respondent to set up and claim therein relief by way of cross-petition, according to the provision in the 82d sec. of the code. The 92d sec. of the code only requires that the answer shall contain a \u201c denial \u201d of allegations that are \u201c controverted,\u201d and a statement of \u201c new matter \u201d where there is <em>\u201c </em>any \u201d such new matter. Here no allegations were controverted, and there was no new matter to set up. The 92d section was never intended to include an affirmative answer to the petition, nor was section 82 intended to drive the defendant to his separate action for relief, in all eases where he could not truthfully deny, or justly avoid the case made in the petition. It should be observed, moreover, that if counsel for the defendants in error are right in this position, it matters not in the present case, because the cross-petition of William Bradford has all the substantial elements of an original case, process at his suit having been served upon the other parties, requiring them to answer his cross-petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Another ground taken by counsel for the defendants in error is, that the superior court had no jurisdiction of the subject-matter, and that therefore the judgment of the court rHsmiRsing the action was a right judgment, although based upon a wrong reason. They say that the jurisdiction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>common pleas in will contests is appellate, and cannot, therefore, be exercised by the superior court, which has no appellate jurisdiction. We think that the jurisdiction of the common pleas in such cases is original. The statutory contest of a will lacks the essential elements of an appeal. It has not the same parties as in the court below. In the latter, in fact, it is purely <em>ex \u00a1pa/rte, </em>while in the common pleas it is <em>i/nter gga/rtes. </em>In the same statute which provides for the contest there is an express provision for an <em>\u201c </em>appeal,\u201d in cases where the probate of the will is refused (S. <em>&amp; </em>C. 1216, secs. 22 and 23), requiring notice of the intention to appeal, and pointing out the steps to be taken in order to perfect the appeal. No similar provisions are made for cases where the will is admitted to probate. The contest is an original proceeding, not otherwise connected with the probate of the will, than in the fact that it cannot be had until the probate takes place, because until then there is in law no will to contest, and in the further fact that on the trial of the contest the record of probate is to be used as evidence. Before the establishment of the probate court, the probate of the will and the contest were iu the same court. Had the legislature intended, by tbo act establishing the probate court, so far to change the nature of a will contest from what it had been for long years before, as to make it an appeal, instead of an original proceeding, they certainly would have made more direct provisions for that purpose. They, moreover, would hardly have left the right of appeal to depend on whether the party chose to bring his action under the code, or to file a bill in chancery under the wills act.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">We are of opinion that the superior court erred in dismissing the action, and therefore, reverse its judgment, and remand the cause for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\n<em>Judgment aeeordmgly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b236-7\">Beinkerhofr, C.J., and Soott, White, and Day, JJ., con curred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
