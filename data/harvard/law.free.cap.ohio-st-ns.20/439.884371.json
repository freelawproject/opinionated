It was a petition for alimony, filed by the defendant in error, the late wife of the plaintiff in error, after he had procured a decree of divorce in one of the courts of Indiana. At the time of the procuration of the decree she resided in Ohio, and had no actual notice of the proceeding. No alimony was allowed to her by the Indiana court, and at the date of the decree for divorce the husband was possessed of but little property, amounting to only some three hundred dollars. Upon the final hearing of the petition for alimony,, after the cause had been remanded by this court for further proceedings, evidence was offered on the part of the wife to-prove that the husband had, after the date of the divorce,, and prior to the filing of the petition for alimony received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>a large accession to his property, to the amount of some twenty thousand dollars, by inheritance from his father. This evidence was objected to by the husband; but the court overruled his objection, and rendered a decree for alimony much exceeding the whole amount of the husband\u2019s property as it existed at the time of the divorce. In receiving this evidence, and in rendering this decree, it is alleged that the court erred.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Av_\"><em>Thomas Millikin </em>for the motion:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-5\">1.

The court has a broad discretion in determining the amount of alimony. In a proper ease there is no good reason why the court may not, among other things, look to and regard what the husband has in expectancy, as well as that which he has in possession. Here, however, the court were not called upon to do so. The expectancy had been realized, and become part of the husband\u2019s estate. What was before contingent had now become certain, and the court could then much more justly and fairly determine what, under <em>all </em>the circumstances of the parties, would be a reasonable alimony. Es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>pecially is this true of a ease like the present, where, under and other rule, the husband would have it in his power, by procuring an <em>expcvrte </em>divorce, to fix the <em>t\u00edme </em>for estimating her alimony. We think the court had the right, in the exercise of its discretion, to regard the property of the husband as of the date of the <em>exparta </em>divorce, or as of the date of the application for alimony, or both, as under all the circumstances seemed reasonable and just.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The motion is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
