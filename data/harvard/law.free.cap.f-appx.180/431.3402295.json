Simuel alleges that the district court erred in denying his motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>to withdraw his guilty plea. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">A defendant who seeks to withdraw his guilty plea before sentencing must demonstrate a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d for withdrawal of the plea. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B). A \u201cfair and just\u201d reason is one that essentially \u201cchallenges the fairness of the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 proceeding\u201d or \u201cchallenges the fulfillment of a promise or condition emanating from the proceeding.\u201d <em>United States v. Lambey, </em>974 F.2d 1389, 1394 (4th Cir.1992). A court should closely scrutinize the Rule 11 colloquy and attach a strong presumption that the plea is final and binding if the Rule 11 proceeding is adequate. <em>Id. </em>We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>81 F.3d 1300, 1305 (4th Cir.1996). After reviewing the record, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by finding no fair and just reason for the withdrawal of Simuel\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Simuel\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
