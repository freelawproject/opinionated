The district court based its dismissal on its conclusion that the case could not proceed in an orderly and timely manner because Johnson was incarcerated in another state. Johnson argues that this conclusion is erroneous and that the district court\u2019s decision impinges on his right to due process and the timely pursuit of his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">\u201cPrisoners retain a right of adequate, effective, and meaningful access to the courts.\u201d <em>Roberson v. Hewes, </em>701 F.2d 418, 420 (5th Cir.1983). In the absence of a factual basis for concluding that Johnson could not effectively maintain his civil rights action, the district court erred in dismissing it. <em>See id.; Mitchum v. Purvis, </em>650 F.2d 647, 648 (5th Cir.1981). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is vacated and the matter is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b577-37\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
