After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines, but still must calculate and consider the guideline range as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). We will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it is both reasonable and within the statutorily prescribed range. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-23\">As Dowell\u2019s 210 month prison sentence was within the properly calculated sentencing guideline range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment, it is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449 (4th Cir.2006). Dowell has not rebutted that presumption as the district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, calculated and considered the guideline range, and weighed the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-24\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-25\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b511-18\"> We vacated Dowell's original 210 month prison sentence in light of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Dowell, </em>145 Fed. Appx. 804 (4th Cir.2005). On remand, after taking into account the advisory guidelines, the district court resentenced Dowell to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
