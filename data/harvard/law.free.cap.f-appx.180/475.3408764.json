We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-22\">When the United States is a party, a notice of appeal must be filed no more than sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v.

Aexander\u2019s counsel certified that he electronically filed the notice of appeal on July 26, 2005. Because Aexander failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal peri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>od, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
