This contract dispute arose when U.S. Steel terminated its contract with Iron Mountain. Iron Mountain asserts the district court erred in concluding: (1) the parties had not modified the clause in the original contract providing that U.S. Steel could terminate the agreement with 30 days notice; (2) the parties\u2019 course of dealing did not limit U.S. Steel\u2019s right to terminate the contract; (3) U.S. Steel did not violate the implied duty of good faith; (4) no damages were sustained in the termination of the contract; and (5) punitive damages were not recoverable. After reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no error in the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, and affirm for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s order of January 3, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
