She and the owner of the cable television companies embarked on a scheme to defraud the IRS, the cable networks who supplied television content, and the DOD out of millions of dollars. The scheme was enacted by falsifying the books and records of the companies, underreporting the number of cable subscribers to reduce the amounts owed to content providers, and the submission of false invoices to the DOD for non-existent construction costs. Counts 9, 19, 64 and 65 of the indictment were dismissed with the government\u2019s consent. Additionally, the government moved to dismiss counts 70 and 71; the district court granted the motion and dismissed those counts. The jury found Pirchesky guilty on all remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">The following issues are presented for appellate review:</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">(1) Whether the district court abused its discretion in excluding expert testimony that Pirchesky\u2019s mental condition precluded the formation of specific intent;</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">(2) Whether the district court erred in denying Pirchesky\u2019s motion to sever the false statement and claim charges;</p>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">(3) Whether the district court erred in denying Pirchesky\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment for multiplicitousness;</p>\n<p id=\"b867-13\">(4) Whether there existed sufficient evidence to support Pirchesky\u2019s convictions for mail fraud, money laundering, false claims and statements, and the filing of false tax returns; and</p>\n<p id=\"b867-14\">(5) Whether Pirchesky\u2019s sentence violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-16\">The exclusion of psychological opinion testimony is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>415 F.3d 1257, 1265 (11th Cir.2005). Denials of motions to dismiss the indictment on the grounds of misjoinder or multiplicity are reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Castro, </em>89 F.3d 1443, 1450 (11th Cir.1996) (misjoinder); <em>United States v. Sirang, </em>70 F.3d 588, 595 (11th Cir.1995) (multiplicity).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-17\">Denials of motions for judgment of acquittal based on the alleged insufficiency of the evidence are reviewed <em>de novo, </em>with the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, and all reasonable inferences and credibility choices made in the government\u2019s favor. <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1324 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-18\">\u2018We review constitutional challenges to a sentence <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1321 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-19\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-20\">After reviewing the record, reading the parties\u2019 briefs, and having the benefit of oral argument, we first conclude that the proffered psychological testimony was properly excluded because it failed to meet statutory and evidentiary requirements. Second, we conclude that the DOD conspiracy was properly joined with the cable television conspiracy because, under Fed.R.Crim.P. 8(a), they were similar offenses. Joinder was also proper under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>Fed.R.Crim.P. 8(b), since the DOD scheme had a direct logical and evidentiary connection to the cable television scheme, and was further related to it based on their mutual interdependence with the IRS conspiracy. Moreover, we conclude from the record that the indictment was not multiplicious.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Because ample evidence supported the jury\u2019s verdicts, the district court correctly denied Pirchesky\u2019s motions for judgment of acquittal on the substantive offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Finally, we conclude that the district court did not violate the Due Process or Ex Post Facto Clauses by enhancing Pirchesky\u2019s sentences based on facts not alleged in the indictment or proven to a jury. Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which was rendered prior to Pirchesky\u2019s sentencing and which governed that proceeding, the use of extra-verdict facts to enhance a sentence does not run afoul of the Constitution, and the only relevant maximum is the statutory maximum. <em>See United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1302-03 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 432, 163 L.Ed.2d 329 (2005). This court previously has rejected arguments similar, if not the same, to Pirchesky\u2019s due process and <em>ex post facto </em>arguments, holding that the statutory maximum as provided in the United States Code did not change between the commission of the crimes and sentencing and satisfied due process concerns. <em>See id. </em>at 1307-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">Based on the foregoing discussion, we affirm Pirchesky\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
