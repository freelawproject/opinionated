California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and McDowell\u2019s response shows that there are no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. The record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration on direct appeal of McDowell\u2019s apparent claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 313-14 (5th Cir. 1987). Accordingly, without prejudice to McDowell\u2019s right to file a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and this appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. McDowell\u2019s request for new appointed counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b531-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
