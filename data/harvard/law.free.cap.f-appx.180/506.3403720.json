He presents two claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-15\">First, he contends the district court reversibly erred when it sentenced him pursuant to the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) <em>(Fanfan </em>claim). In this regard, Martinez-Casares\u2019 being sentenced pursuant to a mandatory system constituted error. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005). Because he preserved his <em>Fanfan </em>claim in district court by objecting based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), we review for harmless error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Mesa, </em>443 F.3d 397, 403-05 (5th Cir.2006). The Government bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the district court would <em>not </em>have sentenced Martinez-Casares differently under an advisory system. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 464 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-18\">The sentencing transcript gives no indication whether the court would have imposed the same sentence had the Guidelines been advisory. Further, contrary to the Government\u2019s claim, that the sentence may be reasonable does <em>not </em>demonstrate the district court would have imposed the same sentence had it not been bound by the Guidelines. <em>See id. </em>at 464-65. Moreover, the court\u2019s granting a downward de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>parture alone does not prove beyond a reasonable doubt the error did not affect Martinez-Casares\u2019 sentence. <em>See United States v. Garza, </em>429 F.3d 165, 171 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1444, 164 L.Ed.2d 143 (2006). Therefore, we vacate Martinez-Casares\u2019 sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Martinez-Casares also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury in the light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). This challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Martinez-Casares contends <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule it in the light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such claims on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Martinez-Casares concedes this claim is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent; he raises it only to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">\n<em>CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b535-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
