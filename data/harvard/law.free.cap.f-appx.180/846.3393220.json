Appellants primarily allege harassment, conspiracy and malicious prosecution based on their assumption that since \u201cthey are licensed by the State of Alabama as an automotive dismantler,\u201d they can operate a junk yard without the City\u2019s junk yard license. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Appellees on the federal claims and remanded the state law claims to the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, the court from which this case was initially removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-23\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>court. <em>Hairston v. Gainesville Sun Pub. Co., </em>9 F.3d 913, 918 (11th Cir.1993). A genuine issue of material fact does not exist unless there is sufficient evidence favoring the non-moving party for a reasonable jury to return a verdict in its favor. <em>Chapman v. AI Transport, </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1023 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc) (quoting <em>Haves v. City of Miami, </em>52 F.3d 918, 921 (11th Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Appellees based on its well-reasoned memorandum opinion filed on November 18, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
