The government argues that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence and failed to properly consider the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d) in determining Halsema\u2019s <em>post-Booker </em>sentence. The government argues that the sentence is unreasonable because the sentence was less than half of the low end of the Guidelines range and because several of the district court\u2019s reasons were reasons rejected for downward departures under the <em>pre-Booker, </em>mandatory Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">\u201cThe district court\u2019s interpretation of the [Sentencing [Guidelines is subject to <em>de novo </em>review on appeal, while its factual findings must be accepted unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Jordi, </em>418 F.3d 1212, 1214 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 812, 163 L.Ed.2d 639 (2005). Under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>we must determine whether a defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence is \u201cunreasonable.\u201d 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Specifically, the Court has directed sentencing courts to consider the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in imposing sentences under the advisory Guidelines scheme. <em>Id. </em>at 261,125 S.Ct. at 765-66. \u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The \u00a7 3553(a) factors serve as guides for the district and appellate courts in determining whether a sentence is reasonable. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cWe must evaluate whether the sentence imposed ... fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. The \u201cparty who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">We have determined that sentences at the low-end of the applicable Guidelines range were reasonable when the district court considered \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1246; <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Recently, we concluded that a sentence was reasonable, even though it was less than half of the low end of the applicable Guidelines range, because the district court correctly calculated the advisory Guidelines range and considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors when it imposed the sentence. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">At Halsema\u2019s sentencing the district court correctly calculated the Guidelines range as 57 to 71 months. The district court, however, sentenced Halsema to 24 months imprisonment. The district court explicitly stated that it had \u201creviewed and fully considered the factors set out in 18 United States Code, Section 3553(a)____\u201d Section 3553(a) provides that a sentencing court shall consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-12\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-14\">(2) the need for the sentence imposed\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-15\">(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-16\">(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-17\">(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-18\">(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-19\">(3) the kinds of sentences available;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>(4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established for\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-5\">(A) the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable category of defendant ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">(5) any pertinent policy statement ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">(6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-8\">(7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">The district court stated that Halsema\u2019s 24-month sentence \u201cis sufficient to provide just punishment ... and serves as an adequate deterrent to others.\u201d The district court also offered specific reasons for its sentence. The district court relied on expert testimony that a longer sentence would negatively affect Halsema\u2019s rehabilitation. The district court noted that Halsema had progressed with treatment and, furthermore, that he had suffered greatly from his incarceration thus far. The district court believed that 24 months was sufficient punishment for Halsema\u2019s offense. These reasons are appropriate considerations under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">We are satisfied that the district court seriously considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The government has failed to establish that the sentence was unreasonable. Although the district court\u2019s reasons for the lesser sentence might not have supported a downward departure under the mandatory Guidelines, they are appropriate considerations under an advisory system. Accordingly, we</p>\n<p id=\"A_\">AFFIRM.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b133-28\">.
