Prado-Martinez, </em>105 Fed.Appx. 631 (5th Cir.2004). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because Prado cannot prevail on his <em>Booker </em>claims, a ruling on the enforceability of his appeal waiver is pretermitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">Prado challenges the constitutionality of his sentence under <em>Booker. </em>Absent extraordinary circumstances, we will not consider a defendant\u2019s Booker-related claims presented for the first time in a petition for writ of certiorari. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>409 F.3d 675, 676 (5th Cir.2005). Had Prado raised his Booker-related claims in his initial appellate brief, this court would have reviewed the argument for plain error. <em>Id. </em>at 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">Prado has not demonstrated either Fan-fan or <em>Booker </em>error under a plain-error standard of review. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 600 (5th Cir.2005). The judge did not make any statements during sentencing indicating that he disagreed with the sentence imposed or that he would have imposed a lesser sentence had he not considered the Guidelines mandatory. <em>See United States v. Robles-Vertiz, </em>442 F.3d 350, 352 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Gutierrez, </em>428 F.3d 201, 203 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1383, 164 L.Ed.2d 88 (2006). Nor was there an adverse relationship between the actual sentence imposed and the range of sentences provided by the Guidelines, as Prado\u2019s sentence was within the applicable guideline range. <em>See Robles-Vertiz, </em>442 F.3d at 352. Accordingly, Prado has not shown that either Fanfan or <em>Booker </em>error affected his substantial rights. Because Prado fails plain-error review, he has failed to show extraordinary circumstances warranting consideration of an issue raised for the first time in a petition for writ of certiorari. <em>Taylor, </em>409 F.3d at 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-20\">Prado\u2019s claim that in the alternative, the <em>Booker </em>error (as well as the Fanfan error) should be presumed prejudicial has been rejected by this court. <em>See United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 561 <em>&amp; </em>n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 194, 163 L.Ed.2d 209 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-23\">Prado argues that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence had it not erroneously believed that the imprisonment range was 135 to 168 months. This claim is not reviewable because it is not within the scope of the Supreme Court\u2019s remand or this court\u2019s order to file letter briefs. <em>Gradsky v. United States, </em>376 F.2d 993, 996 (5th Cir.1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>We conclude, therefore, that nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>decision requires us to change our prior affirmance in this case. We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b559-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
