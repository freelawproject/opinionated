He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. The last significant action in the district court was the August 2005 denial of Johnson\u2019s motion to amend his \u00a7 2255 motion. Although we find that mandamus relief is not warranted because the delay since the last significant action is not unreasonable, we deny the mandamus petition without prejudice to the filing of another mandamus petition if the district court does not rule expeditiously on Johnson\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. We grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis, and deny Johnson\u2019s motion to expedite consideration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>this petition. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
