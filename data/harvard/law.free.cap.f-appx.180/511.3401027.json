He asserts: the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional, in the light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); and \u00a7 1326(b) must be severed from the remainder of the statute and his conviction reduced to one under \u00a7 1326(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">Diaz\u2019s conviction was pursuant to a plea agreement, in which he waived: \u201cany right to have facts that the law makes essential to the punishment either (1) charged in the indictment or (2) proven to a jury or (3) proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d; and, other than for a sentence above the statutory maximum, the right to appeal his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-15\">The Government contends: the waiver provisions in Diaz\u2019s plea agreement preclude his attack on the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b); and, as a result of the waivers, Diaz lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-16\">The waiver-of-appeal provision is construed against the Government as the drafter of the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Somner, </em>127 F.3d 405, 408 (5th Cir.1997). Because Diaz\u2019s plea agreement does not specifically waive the right to attack the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b), we conclude the waiver provision does not preclude this appeal. <em>See id. </em>Because Diaz would be entitled to a lesser sentence if his constitutional challenge were successful, he presumably has standing. <em>See Henderson v. Stalder, </em>287 F.3d 374, 380 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1048, 123 S.Ct. 602, 154 L.Ed.2d 521 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-17\">Even if he has standing, however, Diaz cannot succeed because his constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Diaz contends <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in the light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such contentions on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Diaz concedes his contention is foreclosed in the light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>but raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b540-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
