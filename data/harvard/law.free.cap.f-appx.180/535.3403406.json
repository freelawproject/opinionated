He makes numerous challenges to his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-18\">The record indicates that Alvarez-Ocanegra knowingly and voluntarily entered a guilty plea,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> reserving only the right to challenge \u201cany upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 from the Guideline range found by the district court,\u201d \u201cwaive[d] his right to appeal his sentence on any ground, including any appeal right conferred by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742.\u201d <em>See United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 517-18 (5th Cir.1999); Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(N). The Government has invoked the waiver provision. As the district court did not upwardly depart in this case, Alvarez-Ocanegra\u2019s challenges to his sentence are waived under the terms of his plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-22\">Alvarez-Ocanegra\u2019s argument that the Government withheld evidence in violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), is waived by Alvarez-Ocanegra\u2019s valid guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Lampazianie, </em>251 F.3d 519, 526 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>733 F.2d 371, 376 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-23\">Alvarez-Ocanegra\u2019s argument that the Government violated the treaty under which he was extradited by enhancing his sentence based on a prior conviction also waived. Alvarez-Ocanegra provided neither adequate argument in support of his assertion nor adequate citation to authorities. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993) (holding that claims not adequately argued in the body of the brief are deemed waived on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-24\">Alvarez-Ocanegra\u2019s argument that his conviction is invalid because \u00a7 841 is unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000). Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>varez-Ocanegra concedes that his argument is foreclosed. He raises the issue only to preserve it for Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b563-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b563-20\">. Alvarez-Ocanegra argues that his guilty plea was not knowingly and voluntarily entered because he was not advised that drug quantity was an element of his offense that must be proved to a jury. We will not consider the issue because it was raised for the first time in his reply brief. <em>Unida v. Levi Strauss &amp; Co., </em>986 F.2d 970, 976 n. 4 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
