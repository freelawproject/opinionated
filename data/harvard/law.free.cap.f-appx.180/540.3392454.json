Because the petition for review is timely only as to the November 18, 2004, order, we have jurisdiction over that order only. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>Karimian-Kaklaki v. INS, </em>997 F.2d 108, 111 (5th Cir.1993); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-20\">Valiente has not demonstrated that the BIA abused its discretion in denying the motion to reopen. <em>Ogbemudia v. INS, </em>988 F.2d 595, 600 (5th Cir.1993). She argues that counsel was ineffective in failing to appear on her behalf in Texas and in failing to obtain a change of venue. Valiente asserts that she was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness because she would have requested asylum had he attended or had her case been transferred to California, conclusionally stating that she fears for her life if she returns to her native country of Guatemala.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-21\">Valiente has not made any argument that she suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution based on any statutorily protected ground so as to be eligible for asylum. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); <em>Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 349 (5th Cir. 2002). Because she has not shown statutory entitlement to asylum and because she has conceded removability, she cannot show that counsel\u2019s alleged ineffectiveness affected the outcome of her case. <em>See Miranda-Lores v. INS, </em>17 F.3d 84, 85 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Cir.1994). Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b568-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
