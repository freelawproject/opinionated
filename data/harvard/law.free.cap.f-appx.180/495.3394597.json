He appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>against him. Reviewing <em>de novo, </em>we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">First, Reyna claims that three vehicles were improperly seized and forfeited. The district court correctly concluded it lacks jurisdiction to hear disputes over the vehicles. The <em>res </em>has never been in federal custody and has not been subject to federal forfeiture. Instead, the vehicles are <em>in custodia legis </em>of the Tarrant County state district court of Texas. That court has exclusive jurisdiction over the <em>res. See Scarabin v. D.E.A., </em>966 F.2d 989, 994-95 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Second, Reyna claims that he received inadequate notice that two sums of currency, $136,238.00 and $22,733.20, were to be forfeited in connection with his criminal case. The district court correctly rejected this claim. The Government mailed written notices to Reyna\u2019s address, to his attorney, and to his parents. The Government also published notice in the <em>Wall Street Journal. </em>All of these notices advised of the right to file a claim or petition for remission. Reyna\u2019s contention that he received insufficient notice is belied by the fact that he filed for remission (through his attorney) after the Government mailed notice. Under the circumstances of this case, the Government\u2019s notice was \u201creasonably calculated ... to provide notice to the claimant.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>434 F.3d 357, 367 (5th Cir.2005). It satisfied both constitutional and statutory procedural requirements. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Third, Reyna brings substantive challenges to the forfeiture of the currency. He argues that he earned the money through legitimate means and that the Government seized it pursuant to invalid search warrants. The district court correctly rejected these claims for want of jurisdiction given that Reyna failed to file a legal claim with the forfeiting agency. <em>See United States v. Schinnell, </em>80 F.3d 1064, 1069 n. 7 (5th Cir.1996). If Reyna had done so, he would have triggered a judicial proceeding through which he could have asserted defenses to forfeiture. Instead, Reyna sought remission. \u201c[T]his court may not review the merits of [Reyna\u2019s] claim because such remissions are acts of grace by the agency.\u201d <em>Scarabin, </em>919 F.2d at 338. \u201cHaving failed to avail [himself] of the procedures for requiring the government to institute judicial forfeiture proceedings in the first instance, remand is not available to reopen the inquiry into whether there was an adequate basis for this proceeds forfeiture.\u201d <em>Schinnell, </em>80 F.3d at 1069 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b523-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, this Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
