We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-18\">In 1995 Hutchinson pleaded guilty to one count of carjacking in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119 and one count of use of a firearm during an act of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). <em>See United States v. Hutchinson, </em>75 F.3d 626 (11th Cir.1996). After serving his term of imprisonment, Hutchinson began a three-year period of supervised release on January 20, 2004. On December 7, 2004, Hutchinson\u2019s probation officer filed a superseding petition for revocation of supervised release that alleged that Hutchinson had committed eight violations of the conditions of his supervised release. Violation 8 of the petition charged that Hutchinson had been arrested by officers of the Miami Dade Police Department in October 2004 and that he been found guilty of grand theft auto in the third degree under Florida law on November 15, 2004.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At a revo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>cation hearing before the magistrate judge, Hutchinson stated that he had pleaded no contest to the grand theft auto charge and admitted to violating the conditions of his supervised release by failing to refrain from violating the law. The district court found Hutchinson guilty of violating the conditions of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">At sentencing the government proffered that the Broward County Sheriffs Department had issued a warrant for Hutchinson\u2019s arrest in connection with another auto burglary that occurred before the offense charged in the revocation petition. Officer Mike Sweeney of the Broward County Sheriffs Department attended the hearing at the government\u2019s request but was not sworn in as a witness. At one point during the hearing, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\">[THE GOVERNMENT]: How many burglaries did [Hutchinson] confess to doing, besides the one in Broward County before the one in Dade?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcQ\">OFFICER SWEENEY: Hundreds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ag\">Sentencing Transcript at 5. Hutchinson did not object to Officer Sweeney\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Later in the hearing, Hutchinson stated that he had never admitted to hundreds of auto burglaries, only \u201cthat [he] knew of hundreds going on.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. In reference to the Broward County offense to which Officer Sweeney was prepared to attest, Hutchinson stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">The stuff he is talking about happened prior to May 7, 2004 and before I came in front of you, even the one that I am being detained on in state court is the same thing. This is prior to me going to a drug program. I plan to go there and admit to it, too. I was there when it happened. I never denied that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">Id. at 8-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">The government argued that the district court should impose the statutory maximum sentence of three years, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (setting a maximum sentence of three years following revocation of supervised release for a Class B felony), instead of a sentence within the applicable sentencing guideline range of 8 to 14 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a) (corresponding to a Grade B violation and criminal history category III).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Before imposing the sentence, the court stated: \u201cThe crime that brought us all together originally is a very, very serious crime. When you have that kind of assault, you have dangerous conduct coupled with drug addiction and other crimes, the issue of public safety really comes to the forum.\u201d Sentencing Transcript at 12. The court also said that it was \u201cvery much concerned about the commission of additional criminal acts,\u201d that \u201c[c]ar theft is a serious crime,\u201d that it must \u201cmake sure public safety issues are properly evaluated,\u201d and that \u201cthere has been a series of violations that are very, very significant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12-13. The court then revoked Hutchinson\u2019s supervised release and imposed a 36 month sentence. Afterwards, the court, in reference to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), explained that it had considered \u201cthe need to protect the public\u201d and \u201cthe defendant\u2019s repeated violations of the law\u201d and that it had concluded that \u201ca reasonable sentence needs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>to exceed the guidelines in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Hutchinson contends that the district court erred in sentencing him in excess of the advisory sentencing range. Hutchinson argues that the court based its sentence on a statement of alleged conduct\u2014 Officer Sweeney\u2019s statement that Hutchinson had confessed to \u201chundreds\u201d of auto burglaries \u2014 that was not alleged in the revocation petition and that lacked evidentiary support.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s decision to exceed the sentencing range in Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Dunham, </em>240 F.3d 1328, 1330 (11th Cir.2001). We also review evidentiary rulings of the district court for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1202 (11th Cir.2005). We review unpreserved evidentiary error only for plain error. <em>Id. </em>Under that standard, we may exercise our discretion to correct the error only if (1) there is error that (2) is plain, (3) affects substantial rights, and (4) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 1202-03; <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">In determining a defendant\u2019s sentence following the revocation of supervised release, a district court must consider both the statutory requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) and the policy statements contained in Chapter 7 of the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000). Section 3583(e)(3) authorizes a district court, after considering the factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), to revoke a term of supervised release and to sentence the defendant to up to three years for a Class B felony. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). The policy statements contained in Chapter 7 of the sentencing guidelines, including the recommended sentencing ranges of \u00a7 7B1.4, \u201care merely advisory and not binding.\u201d <em>United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 799 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Cook, </em>291 F.3d 1297, 1301 (11th Cir.2002); <em>Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d at 1320 (\u201cThe court was not required to apply the \u00a7 7B1.4 recommended sentence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">During sentencing, a district court \u201cmay consider any information, including reliable hearsay, regardless of the information\u2019s admissibility at trial, provided that there are sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Castellanos, </em>904 F.2d 1490, 1495 (11th Cir.1990). To establish that the district court erred in considering hearsay evidence, \u201c[t]he defendant must show \u2018(1) that the challenged evidence is materially false or unreliable, and (2) that it actually served as the basis for the sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>931 F.2d 842, 847 (11th Cir.1991) (quoting <em>United States v. Reme, </em>738 F.2d 1156, 1167 (11th Cir. 1984)). Hutchinson must satisfy both elements of <em>Taylor </em>to show that the district court\u2019s consideration of Officer Sweeney\u2019s statement that Hutchinson had confessed to \u201chundreds\u201d of alleged car thefts was harmful.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Even if Hutchinson could establish that Officer Sweeney\u2019s statement is unreliable and that the sentencing court relied on it to depart upward from the \u00a7 7B1.4 sentencing range, the error does not rise to the level of plain error. The record indicates that the court considered the seriousness of Hutchinson\u2019s original carjacking offense, his continued substance abuse, his repeated violations of the law (including cocaine use and the commission of two known auto burglaries while on supervised release), and the public\u2019s safety. The court also explicitly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and concluded that the maximum available sentence was reasonable in this case. Based on our review of the record and the sentencing transcript, we conclude that, absent Officer Sweeney\u2019s statement that Hutchinson committed \u201chundreds\u201d of alleged car thefts, the district court would have imposed the same sentence. Accordingly, there is no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">We also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by sentencing Hutchinson to the statutory maximum of three years imprisonment for violating the terms of his supervised release. Based solely on the October 2004 offense in Miami Dade County that was charged in the revocation petition, the district court had an adequate basis for imposing the three year maximum. Moreover, at sentencing Hutchinson essentially admitted to the Broward County offense and, in connection with the same revocation petition, admitted to submitting a urine sample that tested positive for cocaine. All of these transgressions occurred within months of Hutchinson\u2019s release from prison. In these circumstances, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in exceeding the advisory, nonbinding sentencing range of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4. <em>See United States v. Hofierka, </em>83 F.3d 357, 362 (11th Cir.1996) (affirming a five-year maximum statutory sentence, which was double the top end of the Chapter 7 sentencing range, where the defendant began committing drug offenses shortly after his release from prison); <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>976 F.2d 1380, 1381 (11th Cir.1992) (finding no abuse of discretion where the court imposed a two-year maximum statutory sentence, instead of a sentence within the Chapter 7 sentencing range of 7 to 13 months, after revoking defendant\u2019s supervised release because he tested positive for cocaine use).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">We must also review Hutchinson\u2019s sentence for reasonableness in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). For the reasons we have already discussed, we find that the district court\u2019s sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-10\">. The other violations alleged in the revocation petition included: two violations for submitting urine specimens that tested positive for cocaine (Violations 1 and 2); three violations for failing to notify his probation officer of a change of residence (Violations 3, 4, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>5); one violation for failing to participate in a substance abuse program (Violation 6); and one violation for being discharged from a residential treatment program (Violation 7). Hutchinson admitted to Violations 1, 4, and 7, and the district court also found Hutchinson guilty of Violations 3, 5, and 6. Violation 2 was dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b104-13\">. The parties do not dispute that the maximum sentence that applies is three years or that the applicable sentencing guideline range is 8 to 14 months under \u00a7 7B 1.4(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b105-9\">. Hutchinson does not argue that the unsworn statement by Officer Sweeney during the revocation hearing violates his due process right to confront adverse witnesses or that it violates Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1(b)(2). <em>See Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 489, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 2604, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972); <em>United States v. Frazier, 26 </em>F.3d 110, 114 (11th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Penn, </em>721 F.2d 762, 764 (11th Cir.1983). Accordingly, he has waived that argument. <em>Johnson Enters. of Jaclcsonville, Inc. v. FPL Group, Inc., </em>162 F.3d 1290, 1308 n. 43 (11th Cir. 1998) (\u201cClaims not presented to the court of appeals are considered waived.\u201d); <em>Cont\u2019l Technical Servs., Inc. v. Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp., </em>927 F.2d 1198, 1199 (11th Cir.1991) (\"An argument not made is waived.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
