The district court sentenced him to 115 months in prison. Moss timely appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-19\">Moss first contends that his sentence violates the Sixth Amendment, pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). As Moss correctly notes, <em>Booker </em>held that the mandatory application of the federal sentencing guidelines to impose sentencing enhancements based on facts found by the court by a preponderance of the evidence violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 233-34, 125 S.Ct. 738. However, the district court treated the guidelines as advisory in determining Moss\u2019 sentence and the use of the preponderance of the evidence standard while applying the guidelines as advisory does not violate the Sixth Amendment. <em>United States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65, 72 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-20\">Moss also argues that the district court erred by allocating two criminal history points under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7\u00a7 4Al.l(b) and 4A1.2(e) (2003) for an unlawful concealment adjudication that occurred when he was eleven years old. We find that such an adjudication did not constitute a \u201cjuvenile status offense\u201d under USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(2) and that his commitment to the Office of Juvenile Justice for violating probation for that adjudication amounted to confinement under USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(d)(2). Consequently, the unlawful concealment adjudication was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>properly included in Moss\u2019 criminal history calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">For these reasons, we affirm Moss\u2019 sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
