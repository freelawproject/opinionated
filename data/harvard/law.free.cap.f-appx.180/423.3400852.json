Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Pongilatan fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we uphold the denial of her requests for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-23\">Additionally, Pongilatan challenges the immigration judge\u2019s denial of her request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>for relief under the Convention Against Torture, challenging the standards applied below to this determination. Because she failed to raise this claim before the Board, however, we lack jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>862 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 1049, 125 S.Ct. 861, 160 L.Ed.2d 769 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
