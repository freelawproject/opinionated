Barahona argues that the district court clearly erred by imposing a two-level upward adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B 1.1(c) when calculating the advisory guidelines range. He contends that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>evidence before the district court shows that his role in the offense was equal to that of his co-defendants and does not establish that he supervised or managed their actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">We agree that the evidence before the district court does not establish Barahona\u2019s management or supervision of other participants in the offense as required to apply the enhancement in \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). <em>See United States v. Jobe, </em>101 F.3d 1046, 1068 (5th Cir.1996). Accordingly, we VACATE Barahona\u2019s sentence and REMAND to the district court for resentencing. <em>See United States v. Duhon, </em>440 F.3d 711, 716 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b565-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
