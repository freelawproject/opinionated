No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-24\">Mina challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his request for a minor role reduction, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.20)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He contends that he only was a crew member on a \u201cgo-fast\u201d boat carrying 600 kilograms of cocaine, that he had no ownership interest in the drugs, that he was paid little compared to the drug value, and that more persons were involved in the drug smuggling venture than just the boat crew.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-25\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s determinations about a defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>role in an offense. <em>See United States v. Ryan, </em>289 F.3d 1339, 1348 (11th Cir.2002). The defendant bears the burden of establishing a mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Sentencing courts should consider two principles when determining the defendant\u2019s role in the offense: \u201cfirst, the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable at sentencing, and, second, [his] role as compared to that of other participants in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 940 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The district court committed no clear error in determining that Mina\u2019s role in the offense was more than minor. Mina\u2019s sentence was based only on the relevant conduct for which he was held accountable at sentencing: the 600 kilograms of cocaine seized from the boat. Mina offered no evidence that his participation as a crew member was minor compared to the other crew members on the boat, apart from the captain, whom the district court indicated would receive a role enhancement. The government\u2019s fact proffer at the plea colloquy showed that, after a Coast Guard helicopter attempted to contact the go-fast boat, the boat sped away, and the crew members, including Mina, dumped 30 20-kilogram bales of cocaine overboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">And the district court correctly pointed to the large drug quantity in denying the minor role reduction. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 943 (amount of drugs imported is \u201cmaterial consideration\u201d in assessing defendant\u2019s role in his relevant conduct). Also, the district court stated that Mina was being held accountable only for the amount of cocaine on the go-fast boat. Thus, Mina\u2019s argument about a larger conspiracy is not pertinent to whether he was a minor participant in the charged conspiracy. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 944. We see no error in the district court\u2019s refusal to apply a minor role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-17\">. Mina also contends for the first time on appeal that he was entitled to a minimal role reduction, \u00a7 3B 1.2(a). As the district court did not err in refusing Mina\u2019s request for a minor role reduction, we reject Mina\u2019s argument about receiving no minimal role reduction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
