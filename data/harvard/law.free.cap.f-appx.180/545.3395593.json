Brown argues that his sentence was unreasonable in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), due to the disparity in the punishment imposed for offenses involving powder cocaine versus those involving cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-24\">We note that Brown\u2019s plea agreement contained a waiver of the right to appeal his sentence. The Government does not seek enforcement of the waiver, however, and we therefore do not consider it. <em>See United States v. Lang, </em>440 F.3d 212, 213 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-25\">The district court imposed a sentence within the advisory guideline range, and Brown does not challenge the district court\u2019s calculation of that range. Brown\u2019s sentence is therefore presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). We have previously rejected arguments challenging the disparity in the penalties for offenses involving powder and crack cocaine, which are mandated by Congress. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Wilson, </em>77 F.3d 105, 112 (5th Cir.1996). Because the advisory guidelines range should be determined in the same manner as before <em>Booker, Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519, Brown has not overcome the presumption that his sentence is rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>sonable, <em>see Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554; <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b573-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
