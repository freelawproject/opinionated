In January of 2004, at the request of Wife, Judge Airton Pinheiro de Castro (\u201cJudge de Castro\u201d) of the Brazilian Court sent a letter to the Delta National Bank and Trust Company, located in Miami, Florida, asking for information relating to the existence of any financial assets held in the name of Husband. The letter stated that if such assets were found, 50% of such assets should be \u201cblocked as soon as they are located\u201d in order to aid the Brazilian Court during the dissolution proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-19\">In January of 2005, Wife filed an action in the District Court for the Southern District of Florida under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782 and obtained an ex parte order by the District Court on the 21st of that month, appointing a Miami counsel for her who would issue subpoenas on her behalf. Through her local counsel in Miami, Wife then served subpoenas on Delta National Bank and Safra National Bank of New York, which also had a branch in Miami, Florida. The subpoenas sought \u201c[a]ccount statements, or other documents from ... any accounts in the name of [Husband], as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>well as any other accounts for which he had signature authority\u201d covering a period of four months, from October, 2002 through January, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">On March 18, 2005, Husband filed a motion for a protective order, a motion to quash the subpoenas issued by Wife\u2019s local counsel, and a motion to vacate the ex parte order granting Wife local counsel because, Husband alleges, Wife was using the strategy to circumvent discovery restrictions under Brazilian law. Husband argued that Wife should be required to obtain the requested financial documents directly through Husband by way of the divorce proceeding in Brazil. On April 20, 2005, the District Court referred the case to Magistrate Stephen T. Brown. The parties filed motions before the Magistrate, with Husband arguing that Judge de Castro\u2019s written request of January, 2004 only mentioned Delta National Bank and not Safra National, and thus the subpoenas issued by Wife\u2019s local counsel were overly broad. Wife argued that she had sought relief under \u00a7 1782 in the United States because Husband\u2019s pleadings in the Brazilian Court had claimed \u201cI [Husband] do not have and have never had a bank account in the United States.\u201d In response to Husband\u2019s claim that the subpoenas issued by Wife\u2019s local counsel in Miami were overly broad, Wife argued that Judge de Castro was interested in Husband\u2019s bank accounts in Miami in general, and did not specifically limit discovery to the Delta National Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">On June 16, 2005, the Magistrate granted Husband\u2019s Motion for Protective Order \u201cto the extent that the discovery is limited to \u2018accounts in the name of Amilcar Augusto Lopes Junior.\u2019 \u201d He then compelled discovery of documents from both Delta National and Safra National Banks for the period from October, 2002 through January, 2003. The Motion to Quash Subpoenas and Motion to Vacate the ex parte order granting Wife local counsel were denied. Husband filed objections to the Magistrate\u2019s Order with the District Court on July 13, 2005. The next day, the District Court denied Husband\u2019s request for oral argument and adopted in its entirety the Magistrate\u2019s order. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">I. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">The parties, the Magistrate, and the District Court all agree that this issue is governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782, which authorizes a district court, in its discretion, to obtain testimony or require the production of documents for use in a proceeding being conducted before a foreign tribunal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As such, the relevant case law to consider is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number><em>Intel Corp. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., </em>542 U.S. 241, 124 S.Ct. 2466, 159 L.Ed.2d 355 (2004), which lays out factors for courts to consider when applying \u00a7 1782. Because the appeal is of the District Court\u2019s decision to adopt the Magistrate\u2019s order \u2014 which means the District Court exercised the discretion granted to it under \u00a7 1782 \u2014 we review the District Court\u2019s order for abuse of discretion. We will review the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the <em>Intel </em>factors de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Husband claims that the Magistrate and District Court erred in applying the <em>Intel </em>factors, and granted Wife \u201cunprecedented and unauthorized relief\u2019 under \u00a7 1782 by authorizing discovery from the Miami banks that \u201cgoes far beyond the scope\u201d of the request from the Brazilian Court. Specifically, Husband claims that the District Court misapplied the first of the <em>Intel </em>factors and granted overly broad relief by ordering bank account documents from Delta National Bank and Safra National Bank, even though Judge de Castro\u2019s letter only requested \u201cinformation\u201d (and not, specifically, bank records) and failed to mention Safra National Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\"><em>Intel </em>states that in exercising its discretion to consider a \u00a7 1782 request, a district court should consider the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgR\">First, when the person from whom discovery is being sought is a participant in the foreign proceeding ... the need for \u00a7 1782(a) aid is generally not as apparent as it ordinarily is when evidence is sought from a nonparticipant in the matter arising abroad. A foreign tribunal has jurisdiction over those appearing before it, and can itself order them to produce evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-8\">Second, as the 1964 Senate report suggests, a court presented with a \u00a7 1782(a) request may take into account the nature of the foreign tribunal, the character of the proceedings underway abroad, and the receptivity of the foreign government or the court or agency abroad to U.S. federal-court judicial assistance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ahs\"><em>Intel, </em>542 U.S. at 264, 124 S.Ct. at 2483 (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">Husband claims that the first <em>Intel </em>factor should be read against Wife because Husband is a \u201cparticipant in the foreign proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The District Court found that this reading would render the introductory clause of the first factor \u2014 \u201cthe person from whom discovery is sought\u201d \u2014 a nullity, and would therefore be incompatible with a proper reading of the statute as a whole. The District Court concluded that \u201cthe entities from whom the discovery is sought are the banks, not the husband.\u201d We agree. The text of <em>Intel </em>supports this reading by noting that a foreign tribunal \u201chas jurisdiction over those appearing before it, and can itself order them to produce evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That phrase from <em>Intel </em>makes clear that the \u201cperson from whom discovery is sought\u201d must therefore be a person or entity outside of the jurisdiction of the foreign tribunal, which the Miami banks in this case clearly are. More importantly, Husband is well within the jurisdiction of the foreign tribunal, since his divorce proceeding is currently before the Brazilian Court. The only logical reading of <em>Intel </em>points to the bank (or banks) as the \u201cperson from whom discovery is sought,\u201d and the District Court\u2019s application of the <em>Intel </em>factors was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">We likewise reject Husband\u2019s contention that a combined reading of Judge de Castro\u2019s letter and \u00a7 1782 makes the relief granted by the District Court overly broad. Husband reads the letter from the Brazilian Court requesting \u201cinformation\u201d as incompatible with an order compelling the production of bank records; under this reading, an order compelling documenta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>tion is outside of the scope of a request for information. Essentially, Husband is arguing that bank records do not qualify as \u201cinformation.\u201d We find this reading unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">Finally, Husband contends that even if the District Court properly interpreted \u00a7 1782 and exercised its discretion in response to Judge de Castro\u2019s letter, it erred in granting Wife\u2019s request to compel documents from Safra National Bank, which was not explicitly included as one of the entities from whom information was requested in the letter from the Brazilian Court. As Wife points out in her brief, Judge de Castro\u2019s order pursuant to which the Delta National Bank letter was written stated that the Brazilian Court was seeking the \u201creal truth\u201d about the parties\u2019 assets in order to reach a fair result. The District Court\u2019s order compelling records from Safra National Bank was consistent with this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Nor is there any indication from the text of \u00a7 1782 or <em>Intel </em>that the District Court is limited to compelling information from those parties specifically mentioned in the request letter issued by the foreign tribunal. The statute says only that the \u201corder may be made pursuant to a ... request made, by a foreign or international tribunal or upon the application of any interested person.\u201d Further, <em>Intel </em>notes legislative history that \u201cleaves issuance of an appropriate order to the discretion of the court.\u201d <em>Intel, </em>542 U.S. at 260, 124 S.Ct. at 2481. We conclude that it was within the discretion of the District Court to include Safra National Bank in its order compelling information in this case pursuant to \u00a7 1782.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">The District Court properly interpreted \u00a7 1782 and the factors from <em>Intel </em>in issuing its order. Finding no abuse of discretion we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b904-5\">.

The order may be made pursuant to a letter rogatory issued, or request made, by a foreign or international tribunal or upon the application of any interested person and may direct that the testimony or statement be given, or the document or other thing be produced, before a person appointed by the court. By virtue of his</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-11\">appointment, the person appointed has power to administer any necessary oath and take the testimony or statement. The order may prescribe the practice and procedure, which may be in whole or part the practice and procedure of the foreign country or the international tribunal, for taking the testimony or statement or producing the document or other thing. To the extent that the order does not prescribe otherwise, the testimony or statement shall be taken, and the document or other thing produced, in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-12\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
