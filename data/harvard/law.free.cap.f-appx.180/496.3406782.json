Dennington argues on appeal that his sentence is invalid because it was based on facts that were neither admitted by him nor found by a jury. He also contends that the district court erred in enunciating an alternate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-18\">Dennington\u2019s assertion of sentencing error is meritorious. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He preserved this error by raising an objection to his sentence grounded in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). <em>See United States v. Garza, </em>429 F.3d 165, (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1444, 164 L.Ed.2d 143 (2006). When, as is the case here, a <em>Booker </em>error has been preserved in the district court, we \u201cwill ordinarily vacate the sentence and remand, unless [this court] can say the error is harmless under Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 284 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Government has not met its \u201carduous\u201d burden of demonstrating \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that the Sixth Amendment <em>Booker </em>error did not affect the sentence that [Dennington] received.\u201d <em>Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d at 285, 287. Further, it would not be appropriate for us to impose the alternate sentence articulated by the district court. <em>See United States v. Adair, </em>436 F.3d 520, 524, 527-29 (5th Cir.2006). Consequently, Dennington\u2019s sentence is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED FOR RESEN-TENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b525-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
