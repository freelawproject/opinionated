Defendant argues that the district court should have applied Sentencing Guidelines Amendment 668 retroactively to his sentence because it is a clarifying amendment. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Amendment 668 is not listed as a retroactively-applicable amendment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c): Maldonado cannot use this amendment to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d 905, 907 (11th Cir. 2003). And even if Amendment 668 could be applied retroactively, it is not applicable because Maldonado did not receive a mitigating-role adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Further, regardless of whether Amendment 668 is a clarifying amendment, clarifying amendments may be applied retroactively only on direct appeal of a sentence or under a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate sentence. <em>See Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d at 908-09. Amendment 668 provides no legitimate basis by which Maldonado may reduce his sentence in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Maldonado contends that the district court misinterpreted the arguments in his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as challenging the court\u2019s imposition of a role enhancement and the court\u2019s rejection of an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction when Maldonado was sentenced in March 2001. To the extent the district court may have misinterpreted Maldonado\u2019s arguments, this matter does not affect our resolution of this case. <em>See Cochran v. U.S. Health Care Fin. Admin., </em>291 F.3d 775, 778 n. 3 (11th Cir.2002) (\u201cwe may affirm for any reason supported by the record, even if not relied on by the district court\u201d). The district court did not err in denying Maldonado\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b144-7\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v.

Amendment 668 modified U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1 (a)(3) to provide a graduated reduction for offenders whose drug quantity level resulted in a base offense level greater than 30 and who received a mitigating role adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2.
