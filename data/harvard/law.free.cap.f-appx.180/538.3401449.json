He now appeals the 109 month term of imprisonment imposed for that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-22\">Mack argues that the district court improperly imposed a three-point increase in his base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(5)(B)(2002). Section 2Dl.l(b)(5)(B)(2002) calls for a three-point increase if an offense involved the manufacture of methamphetamine and created a substantial risk of harm to the environment or to human life. Considering Mack\u2019s underlying offense conduct, as defined in \u00a7 lB1.3(a) and considered by the district court in light of the factors set forth in application note 20(A) to \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(5)(B), the district court did not err in applying \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(5)(B) in Mack\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-24\">Mack also argues for the first time on appeal that his sentence is unconstitutional in light <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court\u2019s error in enhancing Mack\u2019s sentence under the mandatory sentencing regime in effect at the time, after finding facts neither admitted by Mack nor proved to a jury beyond reasonable doubt, does not rise to the level of plain error. Nothing in the record indicates that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory sentencing regime rather than a mandatory one. <em>See United States v. Infante, </em>404 F.3d 376, 394-95 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-21 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b566-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
