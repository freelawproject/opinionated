The district court sentenced appellant to a concurrent 78-month term of imprisonment\u2014 at the low end of the Guidelines sentence range \u2014 on each count. He now appeals his sentences, claiming that they are unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-16\">Appellant contends that the district court failed appropriately to consider the sentencing factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in fashioning his sentences. He also claims that the sentence range prescribed by the Guidelines overstated his personal involvement in the offenses and failed to consider his remorse, that he did not personally cause the victim\u2019s injury, and that he had led a law-abiding life and enjoyed a professional career prior to his involvement in the criminal activity in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-18\">In reviewing sentences for reasonableness under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we \u201cdetermine whether the sentence imposed by the district court was reasonable in the context of the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotations and citation omitted). Before undertaking this task, though, we determine whether the district court consulted the Guidelines, took them into account, and correctly calculated the Guidelines sentence range, <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005) (emphasis omitted), before it turned to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-19\">Appellant concedes that the district court correctly arrived at the Guidelines sentence range in his case. Although the court did not on the record discuss one-by-one the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a), it did so implicitly in the context of considering appellant\u2019s arguments in mitigation and his claim that, given the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, the prescribed sentence range overstated the need for his imprisonment for at least 78 months. The court concluded that concurrent sentences of 78 months were reasonable in the circumstances presented. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
