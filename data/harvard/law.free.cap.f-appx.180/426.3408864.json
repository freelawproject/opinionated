The district court sentenced Thompson to concurrent terms of fifty-two months in prison on each offense. Thompson timely appeals his sentence, contending that the district court erred by denying his request for a two-level downward adjustment under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(USSG) \u00a7 3E1.1 (2004) for acceptance of responsibility. We affirm Thompson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-21\">The district court determined that a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility was not warranted because Thompson tested positive for marijuana use while he was on release pending sentencing. We find no clear error in this ruling. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. (n.l(b)); <em>United States v. Rise, </em>369 F.3d 766, 771 (4th Cir.2004) (providing standard); <em>United States v. Ceccarani, </em>98 F.3d 126, 130-31 (3d Cir.1996) (upholding denial of acceptance of responsibility reduction based on new unrelated criminal conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-22\">Accordingly, we affirm Thompson\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
