Garcia challenges that constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be alleged in the indictment and found by a jury, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Garcia\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Garcia contends that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule it in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. ---, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2000). Garcia properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed, but he raises it here to preserve for further review. Accordingly, Garcia\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-27\">Garcia also contends that his sentence must be vacated and his case remanded for resentencing because the district court erred by sentencing him under a mandatory Sentencing Guidelines regime, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Garcia preserved this contention at the district court; thus, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would have imposed the same sentence had the Guidelines been advisory. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463-64 (5th Cir.2005). Here, the sentencing transcript is silent with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>gard to whether the district court would have imposed the same sentence had the Guidelines been advisory. As such, the government cannot show that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Accordingly, we REMAND to the district court to allow the district court to resentence Garcia-Sanchez if, in its discretion under the now-advisory Guidelines, it chooses to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b572-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
