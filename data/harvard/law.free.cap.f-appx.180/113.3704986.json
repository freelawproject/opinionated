The bankruptcy court found that Byerly and FLMI are not creditors of Recomm International Display, Ltd. (\u201cRecomm\u201d), the debtor, and therefore cannot be bound by the Confirmed Plan of Reorganization and the Confirmation Order. The district court disagreed, finding that FLMI potentially had two claims against Recomm: (1) fraud, and (2) breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"ABq\">After carefully reviewing the record on appeal and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that Byerly and FLMI were not creditors of Recomm because they did not have a \u201cclaim\u201d as that term is defined in 11</p>\n<p id=\"b982-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 101(5). The appellants have never sought any claim against Recomm, in state or federal court, and have never filed a proof of claim with Recomm. The bankruptcy court\u2019s finding that the appellants returned the leased equipment and deemed Recomm\u2019s debt satisfied before Recomm filed for bankruptcy are not clearly erroneous. Therefore, we reverse the district court\u2019s order dated September 30, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
