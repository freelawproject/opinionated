To appeal an order denying a Rule 60(b) motion in a postconviction proceeding, Melton must establish his entitlement to a certificate of appealability. <em>Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 369 (4th Cir.2004). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of his constitutional claims is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, 252 </em>F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Melton has not made the requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">To the extent that Melton\u2019s notice of appeal and informal brief can be construed as a motion for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 <em>2255 </em>motion, we deny such authorization. <em>See United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 208 (4th Cir.2003). Accordingly, we deny Melton\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
