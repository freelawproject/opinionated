After review, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Valderrama, a native and citizen of Colombia, entered the United States in April 2000 as a non-immigrant visitor with authorization to remain until October 2000. In October 2000, Valderrama, on behalf of herself and her husband Edgar Fernando Reyes Acevedo, filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal and CAT relief. Valderrama sought asylum based on her membership in the Conservative Party and her work with the poor in Roldanillo, Colombia for a non-profit agency known as \u201cAssociation of Professionals of Roldanillo\u201d (\u201cASPROR\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">In her application, Valderrama stated that she and her husband were singled out by the guerrilla group known as the National Liberation Army (\u201cELN\u201d). The ELN made telephone threats at Valderrama\u2019s home and the business she shared with her husband, sent insulting notes to their home, painted a threatening message on their house, watched their house and came to their home with a list of names. Valderrama and her husband also were told by a restaurant owner that the ELN intended to kill them.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">The application also stated that Valderrama and Acevedo were intercepted on the road by a van containing ELN members. The ELN members overtook them by force, tied them up and drove them to an isolated area where there were other prisoners. Valderrama claimed that she was \u201cput with a group of women,\u201d and raped by an ELN member. The rapist informed her that the action was taken so that she would not \u201cbother them anymore,\u201d and to set an example. The ELN members then left, and the petitioners escaped at dawn and walked to town, where they asked for and received help.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">At a hearing before the IJ, Valderrama and Acevedo both testified regarding the actions taken by the ELN against them, including the kidnapping, rape and escape. In addition, Valderrama submitted the following exhibits: (1) a police report filed by Valderrama and Acevedo in Roldanillo on October 25, 1999, stating that the ELN had \u201cmentally and physically tortured\u201d them through phone calls, death threats to employees on their ranch, spray painting their house in August 1999, learning that they were on a hit list in September 1999 and, on October 22, 1999, kidnapping them and raping Valderrama; (2) a letter from the public prosecutor\u2019s office in Roldanillo, stating that Valderrama and Acevedo were the victims of \u201cExtortion, Carnal Violation, Personal Injuries and Torture\u201d at the hands of the ELN; (3) a document from \u201cSan Antonio Hospital\u201d stating that Valderrama had been treated on October 25 and 26, 1999 for bruises, headache, insomnia anxiety and depression, but making no mention of sexual assault or rape; (4) letters from the Conservative Party affirming the participation of Valderrama and Acevedo in the organization; (5) a letter from the City of Roldanillo stating that Valderrama and Acevedo were registered with the city\u2019s \u201ccommunity action board\u201d; and (6) copies of photo-identification ASPROR membership cards for Valderrama and Acevedo and a document stating they were both members.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">In an oral decision, the IJ denied asylum, withholding of removal and CAT re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>lief and ordered Valderrama and Acevedo removed. The IJ found the testimony of Valderrama and Acevedo not to be credible, citing \u201cgross inconsistencies between both of their testimonies\u201d and concluding that the documents submitted as exhibits were \u201cfraudulent or not authentic____\u201d The IJ specified the following as some of the \u201cmany\u201d evidentiary inconsistencies leading to an adverse credibility determination: (1) the date and time of the alleged kidnapping and rape; (2) the number of men in the van; (3) the type of weapons used; (4) the manner in which the petitioners were tied up; (5) the existence of light and electricity inside the house to which they were taken and the natural light outside of the house; (6) the number and dates of the trips to the hospital following the alleged kidnapping; (7) the number of days spent at Valderrama\u2019s aunt\u2019s house after the kidnapping; and (8) the month the petitioners were notified they were on the hit list.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The IJ found in particular that the medical report and prosecutor\u2019s report were \u201cclearly not valid\u201d in light of the discrepancy between the petitioners\u2019 testimonies as to the dates the documents were executed and the dates listed on the reports. The IJ noted that the medical report did not mention a sexual assault, that some of the letters appeared to have been printed on the same machine, and that Valderrama and Acevedo contradicted each other as to whether the entities who sent the letters were housed in the same building and thus could share the same printer. The IJ also noted that the letter indicating that Acevedo was a member of the community action board was inconsistent with his testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The IJ denied asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection based upon his finding that the kidnapping and rape \u201cnever happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">Valderrama appealed to the BIA, arguing that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was based on misinterpretations of the evidence, inadequate questioning during the hearing and \u201cminor\u201d inconsistencies. The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, stating that all of the inconsistencies noted by the IJ were \u201cpresent and material,\u201d except the type of weapons carried by the men in the van, which the BIA determined was \u201cnot a clear inconsistency.\u201d The BIA noted that the inconsistencies were numerous and \u201cnot just between the two witnesses, but also with the asylum application.\u201d The BIA also noted that Valderrama\u2019s explanations for the inconsistencies did not address the problem with her documents. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">A. Asylum and Adverse Credibility</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). A \u201crefugee\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-13\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-14\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>See Al Najjar v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number><em>Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">To carry this burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish either (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">An alien\u2019s testimony, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof for asylum. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). \u201cConversely, an adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). Nevertheless, the IJ must still consider all of the evidence submitted by the applicant, including documentation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">\u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When the IJ enumerates an applicant\u2019s inconsistencies and is supported by the record, we \u201cwill not substitute our judgment for that of the IJ with respect to its credibility findings.\u201d <em>DMuhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 819 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">B. Valderrama\u2019s Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">On appeal, Valderrama argues that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence. Upon review of the record, however, we disagree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-14\">The IJ specifically enumerated the inconsistencies upon which he based his adverse credibility determination and these inconsistencies are supported by the record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Notably, Valderrama does not dispute that these inconsistencies appear in the record. Rather, Valderrama argues that they do not constitute substantial evidence because they are \u201cminor\u201d and do not \u201cgo to the heart\u201d of her asylum claim or because they can be explained by the fact that the events took place five years earlier and under traumatic circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-15\">Although we have not directly addressed the issue, the Third Circuit and the Ninth Circuit have indicated that an adverse credibility determination based on inconsistencies must involve inconsistencies re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>lating to the basis of the alleged fear of persecution (i.e., \u201cthe heart of the asylum claim\u201d) and that minor inconsistencies about collateral matters or unimportant facts will not support an adverse credibility finding. <em>See Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir.2002); <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, neither of these circuits cite any statute or regulation for this demarcation in credibility determinations or for the proposition that inconsistencies must relate to the heart of the asylum claim. In other non-immigration cases, this Circuit has not required a witness\u2019s inconsistent testimony to relate to the heart of the claim before the factfinder can disbelieve that witness. <em>See, e.g., Conroy v. Abraham Chevrolet-Tampa, Inc., </em>375 F.3d 1228, 1231 (11th Cir.2004). However, we need not resolve this issue because the numerous inconsistencies identified by the IJ do indeed relate to the events giving rise to Valderrama\u2019s fear of persecution and thus go to the heart of Valderrama\u2019s asylum claim. Specifically, the IJ identified inconsistencies relating to the key incidents that form the basis of Valderrama\u2019s asylum claim \u2014 the kidnapping, rape, and escape \u2014 that led the IJ to conclude that those events never happened. Therefore, the inconsistencies are material rather than minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Given the above-mentioned inconsistencies and the doubt they cast upon the authenticity of some of Valderrama\u2019s supporting documents, the record does not compel reversal of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Further, the documentary evidence does not compel the conclusion that Valderrama is eligible for relief. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. As the IJ noted, the documents are of questionable authenticity and do not show how Valderrama was singled out on account of a statutory factor. Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Valderrama failed to establish eligibility for asylum.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">Based upon the foregoing, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-7\">. Although the IJ did not note this, the documentation indicated that Acevedo was also a member of ASPROR, which is also inconsistent with Acevedo\u2019s hearing testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b153-9\">. We review the BIA's decision, \u201cexcept to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ's opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. \"Insofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, because the BIA\u2019s opinion adopted the IJ\u2019s opinion, we review both opinions. In doing so, we review legal determinations <em>de novo. D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 817. We review factual determinations, including credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence test. Id. at 817-18. \u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s factual findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b153-10\">. Our review of the record indicates that all of the inconsistencies identified by the IJ have support in the record with one exception. The IJ found that the prosecutor\u2019s report was dated one day before the medical report such that it contradicted Valderrama\u2019s testimony that the petitioners retrieved the medical report before filing a report with the prosecutor. However, the record reveals that the report from the prosecutor\u2019s office was dated October 26, 1999. The police report stated that Valderrama was admitted to the hospital on October 25, 1999, and was filed on that day as well. This one incorrectly identified inconsistency does not compel reversal in light of the numerous additional inconsistencies correctly identified between the application, the testimony, and documentary evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b154-5\">. Congress recently overrode these circuits\u2019 precedent by enacting the REAL ID Act of 2005, which, among other things, amended the law regarding credibility determinations to permit an adverse credibility finding based on inconsistencies \"without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim....\u201d <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 109-13, \u00a7 101(a)(3), 119 Stat. 230, 303 (codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii)). Because Valderrama\u2019s asylum application was filed before May 11, 2005, the date the REAL ID Act was enacted, however, these new provisions do not apply to her claim. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 101(h)(2), 119 Stat. 230, 305.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b154-22\">. Because Valderrama did not present credible evidence that she is eligible for asylum, she likewise failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal or CAT relief. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
