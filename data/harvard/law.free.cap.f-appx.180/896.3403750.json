We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">We review a denial of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 de novo. <em>Skinner v. Wiley, </em>355 F.3d 1293, 1294 (11th Cir.2004). Jimenez contends that the Bureau of Prisons has incorrectly interpreted 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b)(1), which sets forth guidelines for awarding service of sentence credits for good behavior. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-14\">[A] prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year other than a term of imprisonment for the duration of the prisoner\u2019s life, may receive credit toward the service of the prisoner\u2019s sentence, beyond the time served, of up to 54 days at the end of each year of the prisoner\u2019s <em>term of imprisonment, </em>beginning at the end of the first year of the term, subject to determination by the Bureau of Prisons that, during that year, the prisoner has displayed exemplary compliance with institutional disciplinary regulations....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-16\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-17\">According to the BOP\u2019s interpretation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b)(1), \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d means time actually served. Therefore, an inmate may earn good conduct time (GCT) credits based only on the time actually served and not on the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-18\">In <em>Brown v. McFadden, </em>416 F.3d 1271 (11th Cir.2005), we considered precisely the same argument that Jimenez makes here. <em>Id. Brown </em>involved a prisoner\u2019s challenge to the BOP\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 3624 based on the argument that GCT should be calculated based on the length of the sentence imposed. <em>Id. </em>Although we noted that the district court was \u201carguably correct\u201d in finding that the plain language of \u00a7 3624 supported the BOP\u2019s interpretation, we elected to follow the decisions of other circuits. <em>Id. </em>at 1273. Those decisions held that the language of \u00a7 3624 is ambiguous, but the BOP\u2019s interpretation is reasonable. <em>Id. </em>These were our holdings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-19\">(1) 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b)(1) is ambiguous and does not unambiguously support either argument; that a federal prisoner should get good time credit of 54 days for each year he is sentenced to imprisonment, <em>or </em>that a federal prisoner should get good time credit of 54 days for each year he actually serves in prison;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-20\">(2) Even though the statute is ambiguous, the BOP\u2019s interpretation of the statute that a federal prisoner should get <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>good time credit of 54 days for each year he actually serves in prison is reasonable and therefore is due to be affirmed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-4\">(3) The rule of lenity is inapplicable because of the BOP\u2019s reasonable interpretation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b)(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-5\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">Jimenez contends that we should reconsider <em>Brown </em>in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Clark v. Martinez, </em>543 U.S. 371, 125 S.Ct. 716, 160 L.Ed.2d 734,(2005), and <em>Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004). \u201cUnder the prior panel rule, we are bound by the holdings of earlier panels unless and until they are clearly overruled en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Swann v. S. Health Partners, Inc., </em>388 F.3d 834, 837 (11th Cir.2004). The prior panel rule applies here because <em>Brown </em>has not been overruled by an <em>en banc </em>panel or by the Supreme Court. <em>See id. Clark </em>and <em>Leo-cal </em>were decided before <em>Brown </em>and cannot overrule it.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">Also, <em>Clark </em>and <em>Leocal </em>do not specifically address the issues raised by this appeal. <em>See Leocal, </em>543 U.S. at 12 n. 8, 8-13, 125 S.Ct. at 384; <em>Clark, </em>543 U.S. at 380, 125 S.Ct. at 724. Therefore, <em>Brown </em>controls, and we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
