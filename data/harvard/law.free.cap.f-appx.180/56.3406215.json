We previously affirmed Jernigan\u2019s conviction and sentence on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273 (11th Cir.2003). In his motion to vacate, Jernigan asserted <em>twelve </em>claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. We issued a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to consider the issue of whether the district court erred under <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en banc), </em>by failing to address all of Jernigan\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Based on our review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>of the record, including a comparison of the issues raised in the <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2255 motion, which we have construed liberally, and the district court\u2019s order, as well as the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d), we vacate and remand for proceedings consistent with <em>Clisby.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">In his \u00a7 2255 motion, Jernigan asserted that his trial counsel had been ineffective on ten grounds and his appellate counsel had been ineffective on two grounds. The government was not directed to file, and did not file, a response to Jernigan\u2019s motion. In its order denying Jernigan\u2019s motion, the district court stated that it had \u201cfully considered\u201d Jernigan\u2019s motion and adopted the R <em>&amp; </em>R. The R &amp; R, in turn, addressed only <em>two </em>of the <em>twelve </em>claims presented in Jernigan\u2019s motion. Moreover, the magistrate judge\u2019s resolution of one of the two claims that <em>were </em>addressed \u2014 Jernigan\u2019s Bruton-based ineffectiveness claim \u2014 consists solely of a block-quotation from our opinion in Jernigan\u2019s direct appeal and, based thereon, the magistrate judge\u2019s conclusion that the <em>Bruton</em>based ineffectiveness claim was only a recasting of the substantive <em>Bruton </em>claim we rejected in Jernigan\u2019s direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">In <em>Clisby, </em>we directed district courts to \u201cresolve all constitutional claims presented in a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 before granting or denying relief.\u201d 960 F.2d at 934. We expressed \u201cour deep concern over the piecemeal litigation of federal habeas petitions filed by state prisoners, as exemplified by the district court\u2019s failure to resolve all claims in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 935. When a district court does not address all claims raised, we \u201cwill vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims whenever the district court has not resolved all such claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Even though we have never had the occasion to apply <em>Clisby </em>to a \u00a7 2255 case, we have held that \u201cthe principles developed in [\u00a7 2254] habeas cases also apply to \u00a7 2255 motions.\u201d <em>Gay v. United States, </em>816 F.2d 614, 616 n. 1 (11th Cir.1987); <em>see also Broadwater v. United States, </em>292 F.3d 1302, 1303 (11th Cir.2002) (vacating and remanding district court\u2019s summary, one-sentence denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion so that the district court \u201ccan provide further explanation of its ruling in order to provide this court with a sufficient basis for review\u201d and stating that a district court may summarily dismiss a \u00a7 2255 motion \u201c[i]f it plainly appears from the face of the motion and any annexed exhibits and the prior proceedings in the case that the movant is not entitled to relief\u2019). An adequate appellate review requires that the district court provide \u201cmore than a mere summary denial of the \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1304.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">Jernigan\u2019s \u00a7 2255 petition raised twelve ineffective-assistance claims. The district court\u2019s statement that it \u201cfully considered\u201d Jernigan\u2019s motion, without more, is insufficient for us to conduct a meaningful review. Moreover, the R &amp; R adopted by the district court provides us with little additional guidance, specifically addressing only two of the twelve claims. And of the two claims addressed, the magistrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>judge\u2019s resolution of the <em>Bruton-based </em>ineffectiveness claim by referencing our analysis of the underlying <em>Bruton </em>issue in the direct appeal does not provide a sufficient basis for us resolve that claim, let alone the others. We observe that our task is further complicated because we have no response from the government, as none was ordered by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Given the number of unresolved issues, we vacate the district court\u2019s order without prejudice and the COA, and we remand the case to the district court to resolve all of Jernigan\u2019s claims, regardless of whether relief is granted or denied, as well as to provide an explanation for its ruling such that we have a sufficient basis for review. <em>See Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 938 (providing that upon district court\u2019s failure to address issues raised in habeas petition, we \u201cwill vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims whenever the district court has not resolved all such claims\u201d). After ruling on the merits of Jernigan\u2019s claims, the district court shall also determine on which, if any, of Jernigan\u2019s claims to grant a COA. <em>Callahan, </em>396 F.3d at 1289. We retain jurisdiction over the appeal, pending the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>(after vacating without prejudice and remanding case to district court for full consideration of issues raised in habeas petition, retaining jurisdiction over appeal, pending district court\u2019s resolution of outstanding issues).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-8\">. Jernigan argued that trial counsel had been ineffective on ten grounds: (1) failing to file a motion to suppress the gun where the initial traffic stop leading to the gun\u2019s discovery was conducted without reasonable suspicion; (2) stipulating to the admission of statements made by his codefendant, Wendell Nelson, a passenger in his vehicle, that implicated Jernigan, in violation of <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968); (3) failing to call two exculpatory witnesses who would have testified that passenger Nelson said the gun belonged to him; (4) failing to adequately argue the motion for severance of the trials where Jernigan\u2019s and Nelson's defenses were mutually antagonistic; (5) failing to move to suppress Jemigan\u2019s statement to the police in which he gave them a false name because it was not preceded by <em>Miranda </em>warnings; (6) failing to move to exclude the government\u2019s introduction of Jemigan\u2019s previous convictions; (7) failing to object to the use of Jernigan's prior convictions to impose a sentence enhancement pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), when the convictions were obtained without counsel; (8) inadequately arguing Jernigan\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal; (9) failing to object to improper statements made by the prosecutor during closing arguments; and (10) failing to argue at sentencing that prior convictions for possession of a firearm and state convictions occurring before October 1984 could not be used to enhance his sentence. Jernigan also argued that his appellate counsel had been ineffective for: (11) failing to raise the issue of the government\u2019s improper introduction of prior and subsequent bad acts, which exceeded the scope of Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), and (12) failing to raise the issue that the prior convictions in his indictment were obtained illegally.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>We also granted a COA to consider the ineffective-assistance claim as to issues (1) and (2). In light of our disposition on the <em>Clisby </em>issue, we do not reach the other issues encompassed by the COA. <em>Cf. Callahan v. Campbell, </em>396 F.3d 1287, 1289 (11th Cir. 2005) (vacating and remanding habeas case based on <em>Clisby </em>without addressing the non<em>Clisby </em>issues stated in the COA, and directing the district court, after ruling on the merits of all of the petitioner's claims, to \"determine on which, if any, of petitioner's claims to grant a certificate of appealability\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
