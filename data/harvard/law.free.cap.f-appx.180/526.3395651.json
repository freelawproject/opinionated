The BIA determined that Ogelsby was removable from the United States because he was an alien who had committed an aggravated felony. Ogelsby maintains that the Immigration and Nationalization Service (INS) was equitably estopped from denying him citizenship because the actions of an INS clerk prevented him from obtaining citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that an alien is deportable because he has committed an aggravated felony. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). Ogelsby does not dispute the BIA\u2019s determination that he has committed an aggravated felony, and his equitable estoppel claim attacking the BIA\u2019s finding that he is an alien fails. <em>See Moosa v. INS, </em>171 F.3d 994, 1003 (5th Cir.1999). Consequently, Ogelsby\u2019s petition for review is DIS-</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">MISSED FOR WANT OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b555-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
