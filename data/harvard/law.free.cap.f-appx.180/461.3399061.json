Taylor appeals his conviction and 110-month sentence pursuant to his guilty plea for aiding and abetting the possession with intent to distribute more than five grams of cocaine base, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (2000) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-21\">Counsel for Taylor has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he states there are no meritorious issues for review, but presenting the issue of whether the district court erred in its calculation of Taylor\u2019s criminal history score. Although informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, Taylor has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-22\">Taylor\u2019s plea agreement included a provision by which he agreed to waive his right to appeal any prison sentence under 125 months. Taylor knowingly and voluntarily agreed to this provision. We conclude that the appeal waiver is valid and enforceable. Because Taylor received a sentence shorter than 125 months, he has waived his right to appeal. <em>See United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-23\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Taylor\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel <em>inform </em>Taylor, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Taylor requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Taylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-24\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>quately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
