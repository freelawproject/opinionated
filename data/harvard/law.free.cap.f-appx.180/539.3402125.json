Resendiz challenges the constitutionality of the felony and aggravated felony provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) and the district court\u2019s order that he cooperate with the probation officer in the collection of DNA as a condition of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-24\">Although, in a written plea agreement, Resendiz waived the right to appeal his sentence except for upward departures and a sentence exceeding the statutory maximum, the Government does not seek enforcement of the waiver. Accordingly, the waiver does not bar this appeal. <em>See United States v. Story, </em>439 F.3d 226, 230-31 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-25\">Resendiz\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>AlmendarezTorres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Resendiz contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Resendiz properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-28\">Resendiz also argues that the district court erred by ordering him to cooperate in the collection of a DNA sample as a condition of supervised release. This claim is not ripe for review on direct ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>peal. <em>See United States v. Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100, 1101-02 (5th Cir. 2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Jan. 9, 2006) (No. 05-8662). The claim is dismissed. <em>See id. </em>at 1102.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b567-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
