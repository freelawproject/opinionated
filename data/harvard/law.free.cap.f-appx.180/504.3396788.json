He presents two claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-30\">First, he maintains the district court\u2019s loss calculation violated the Sixth Amendment rule of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>L.Ed.2d 621 (2005): any fact other than the existence of a prior conviction that increases a defendant\u2019s sentence beyond the maximum established by his guilty plea must either be admitted by him or proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Orisakwe preserved this issue by objecting under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004); therefore, we review for harmless error, which requires the Government to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would have imposed the same sentence under advisory guidelines. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 284 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">In the light of <em>Booker, </em>the loss calculation constitutes error that was <em>not </em>harmless. <em>See id. </em>at 286. The court\u2019s sentencing Orisakwe to the maximum sentence within the guidelines range is insufficient to satisfy the Government\u2019s burden. <em>See United States v. Woods, </em>440 F.3d 255, 258-59 (5th Cir.2006). Its contention that the court <em>could </em>have imposed the same sentence likewise fails to show it <em>would </em>have done so but for the <em>Booker </em>error. Accordingly, we vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Orisakwe also contends his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to due process and to confront adverse witnesses were violated when, in assessing Orisakwe\u2019s guideline sentence, the district court relied on out-of-court testimonial statements. Citing, among other cases, <em>United States v. Navarro, </em>169 F.3d 228, 236 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 845, 120 S.Ct. 117, 145 L.Ed.2d 99 (1999), Orisakwe acknowledges this court has \u201cheld that a defendant\u2019s right to confrontation at sentencing is severely restricted\u201d. Nevertheless, he suggests this precedent is suspect in the light of, <em>inter alia, Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). To the extent the issue is deemed foreclosed, Orisakwe seeks to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">\u201c[Tjhere is no Confrontation Clause right at sentencing\u201d. <em>Navarro, </em>169 F.3d at 236. Nothing in <em>Crawford </em>provides its holding is applicable to sentencing proceedings. Accordingly, this Crawford\u2014 based contention is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">\n<em>CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b532-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
