Tabrizian submitted a motion, with supporting documentation, to continue the proceedings because he had a pending labor certification, and he was the beneficiary of an 1-130 petition, which was filed by his U.S. citizen brother.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>multiple continuances of the removal hearing, in February 2004, the IJ denied Tabrizian\u2019s motion for a continuance for additional attorney preparation time and found Tabrizian removable. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">On appeal, Tabrizian argues that we should re-examine our decision in <em>Zafar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>426 F.3d 1330, 1334-35 (11th Cir.2005). <em>Zafar </em>held that because the petitioners were not statutorily eligible for adjustment to resident status, having failed to show immediate visa availability, there was no abuse of discretion in denying a continuance. Tabrizian notes that we did not address a Seventh Circuit opinion, <em>Subhan v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 591 (7th Cir.2004), which reversed a removal order in which the IJ did not give sound reasons for denying a motion for a continuance in similar circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">We review the IJ\u2019s decision in this case, not the BIA\u2019s, because the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, thereby making the IJ\u2019s decision the final agency determination. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4); <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1284 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">An IJ has discretion to grant a continuance in an immigration proceeding \u201cfor good cause shown.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29. We have jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s discretionary decision to deny Tabrizian\u2019s motion for a continuance for an abuse of discretion. <em>Zafar, </em>426 F.3d at 1334-35. As we explained in <em>Zafar:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">Section 245\u00ae of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(l), permits a certain class of aliens who were otherwise <em>ineligible </em>to adjust their temporary resident status in the United States to pay a penalty fee for adjusting their status to that of a \u201cpermanent resident\u201d and be considered \u201cgrandfathered\u201d into the United States, if he is the \u201cbeneficiary\u201d of an application for labor certification that was properly filed by April 30, 2001, and was \u201capprovable when filed.\u201d INA \u00a7 245(i)(l), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.10(a)(l)(i)(B). \u201cApprovable when filed means that, as of the date of the filing,\u201d the application for labor certification was \u201cproperly filed, meritorious in fact, and non-frivolous.... \u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.10(a)(3). Once the Attorney General receives the application for adjustment of status and the appropriate fee, he \u201cmay\u201d adjust the status if the alien \u201cis eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible,\u201d and \u201can immigrant visa is immediately available to the alien at the time the application is filed.\u201d INA 245(i)(2), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(2). An immigrant visa cannot, however, be issued to the alien until the labor certification is approved. INA \u00a7 203(b)(3)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(5).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 1335-36. We held that an IJ does not abuse his discretion by denying a continuance to petitioners who can show only a \u201cspeculative possibility that ... they may receive\u201d a labor certification in the future because such a showing does not fulfill the \u201cimmediately available\u201d visa petition requirement for adjustment of status under INA \u00a7 245(i); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\u00ae. <em>Id. </em>at 1336.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-14\">The facts in this case are identical in relevant respects to the facts in <em>Zafar. </em>426 F.3d at 1332-33. Like the petitioners in <em>Zafar, </em>Tabrizian\u2019s labor certification is currently under review by the U.S. Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d). <em>Zafar\u2019&amp; </em>holding, that there is no abuse of discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>tion for an IJ to deny a continuance based on a pending labor certification, mirrors this IJ\u2019s decision not to continue the proceedings pending an approval that may or may not happen. <em>See Zafar, </em>426 F.3d at 1335-36. In fact, Tabrizian admits that <em>Zafar </em>is controlling law, arguing only that <em>Zafar </em>should be reconsidered in light of the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Subhan. </em>Nevertheless, \u201c[our] law ... is emphatic that only the Supreme Court or [our] court sitting <em>en banc </em>can judicially overrule a prior panel decision.\u201d <em>Walker v. Southern Co. Servs., Inc., </em>279 F.3d 1289, 1293 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation omitted). But even if one panel could overrule another, the panel that decided <em>Zafar </em>clearly was aware of <em>Subhan </em>because that case is cited in <em>Zafar, </em>even though it was not addressed at length. <em>Zafar, </em>426 F.3d at 1335.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Furthermore, the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Subhan </em>is distinguishable. In <em>Subhan, </em>the IJ granted the non-citizen two continuances in an attempt to allow the pending labor certification to be processed by the DOL, but after the second continuance expired, the IJ summarily denied a request for a third. <em>Subhan, </em>383 F.3d at 593. The Seventh Circuit held that because the IJ gave no reason for the denial, it was erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 595. Here, however, the IJ gave a reason for denying Tabrizian\u2019s motion for a continuance by stating that the \u201capproval of a labor certification is the net equivalent of a certificate of marriage between a [non-citizen] and a U.S. citizen,\u201d but \u201cthe absence of either eliminates any basis for continuance.\u201d As the <em>Subhan </em>court noted, had the IJ given almost any reason for the denial of Subhan\u2019s request, the denial would have satisfied the law. <em>Subhan, </em>383 F.3d at 593-94. Here, the IJ gave a reason based on his understanding of the state of the law regarding continuances and thus satisfied <em>Subhan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b158-18\">. Tabrizian notes that the 1-130 petition filed on his behalf by his U.S. citizen brother acts to grandfather him under INA \u00a7 245(i). However, he has abandoned any arguments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>that he may have raised below regarding any error the IJ made by not continuing his removal proceedings based on the pending I-130 petition itself because he only argues on appeal that the continuance should have been granted due to his pending labor certification. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1286 n. 3 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
