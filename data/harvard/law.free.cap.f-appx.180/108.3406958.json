No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-26\">Williams was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1997 for a drug conspiracy offense. We affirmed his conviction and sentence on direct appeal. In September 2000, Williams filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate sentence; that motion was denied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Williams filed the instant motion requesting grand jury transcripts pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500 (the Jencks Act)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e)(3)(E).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Williams stated that he needed the requested grand jury testimony of certain named government witnesses so that he could \u201cfile a second/successive [\u00a7 2255 motion], and/or a [Fed.R.Civ.P.] 60(b) motion, which [would] allow [him] to move forward in his litigation.\u201d According to Williams, these witnesses presented false testimony before the grand jury and at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The general rule is that grand jury proceedings are to be kept secret. <em>See United States v. Aisenberg, </em>358 F.3d 1327, 1346 (11th Cir.2004). Limited exception to the general rule may apply when the grand jury matter is sought \u201cpreliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e)(3)(E)(i). A party seeking grand jury transcripts bears the burden of showing that (1) the material sought is needed to avoid a possible injustice in another judicial proceeding; (2) the need for disclosure outweighs the need for continued secrecy; and (3) the request is structured to embrace only necessary material. <em>Douglas Oil Co. of Cal. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, </em>441 U.S. 211, 99 S.Ct. 1667, 1674, 60 L.Ed.2d 156 (1979); <em>United Kingdom v. United States, </em>238 F.3d 1312, 1320-21 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting the <em>Douglas Oil Co. </em>standard). \u201cThese same demanding standards apply even after the grand jury has concluded its operations.\u201d <em>Aisenberg, </em>358 F.3d at 1348. The defendant seeking grand jury material must show a \u201cparticularized need;\u201d generalized allegations will not suffice. <em>United States v. Burke, </em>856 F.2d 1492, 1496 (11th Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">The district court concluded that Williams\u2019s motion satisfied his burden on none of the criteria applicable to his request. We agree. We need only address the first: whether the materials sought were needed to avoid injustice in another judicial proceeding. As the district court noted, Williams is involved in no other judicial proceeding. And, even accepting that Williams claims to need these materials to seek post-conviction relief, Williams fails to show how the requested information supports the availability of such relief. To file a second or successive habeas petition, authorization is required from the Court of Appeals, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3), and such authorization may only be granted upon a showing of (i) newly discovered evidence sufficient to establish that no reasonable jury would have convicted Defendant; or (ii) a new rule of constitutional law made retroactively applicable on collateral review. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Williams made no showing that the grand jury materials \u2014 which involved no newly discovered evidence<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and implicate no new rule of constitutional law \u2014 could make available to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>him permission to file a second or successive habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Williams\u2019s reliance on Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) also is unavailing. \u201cRule 60(b) simply does not provide for relief from judgment in a criminal case.\u201d <em>United States v. Fair, </em>326 F.3d 1317, 1318 (11th Cir.2003) (internal quotations and citation omitted). Williams misapprehends <em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005), when he argues that, in <em>Gonzalez, </em>the Supreme Court reaffirmed the availability of Rule 60(b) relief from a criminal judgment. Instead, under very limited circumstances, <em>Gonzalez </em>recognizes the availability of Rule 60(b) to challenge a civil judgment in a habeas case. Williams proposes to use the requested grand jury transcripts to challenge his underlying criminal conviction; Rule 60(b) has no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b136-17\">. A claim raised in Williams\u2019s section 2255 motion asserted ineffective assistance of counsel based on his trial counsel's failure to cross-examine and impeach witnesses who, according to Williams, presented false testimony. The section 2255 motion was denied: the district court concluded that trial counsel\u2019s decision was a permissible tactical decision. We refused to issue Williams a certificate of appealability in his habeas proceeding. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>The grand jury transcripts sought by Williams in the instant motion is for witness testimony that Williams focused upon in his unsuccessful section 2255 ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b137-7\">. Williams\u2019s reliance on the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500, is misplaced. The Jencks Act governs demands for production of witness statements and reports in a criminal proceeding. The purpose of the Jencks Act is to enable the defense in a criminal proceeding to impeach a government witness during cross-examination. <em>See United States v. Prieto, </em>505 F.2d 8, 11 (5th Cir. 1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b137-13\">. Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e)(3)(E) authorizes disclosure of grand jury matters under narrowly prescribed circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b137-14\">. The government represents that copies of the grand jury transcripts were supplied to Williams's trial counsel in 1997 as part of the government\u2019s discovery disclosures; the transcripts are not \"newly discovered\u201d evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
