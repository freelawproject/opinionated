He raises three issues in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-27\">First, Delgado-Castillo argues that his sentence is unconstitutional under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because it was imposed pursuant to a mandatory application of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. He thus alleges a \u201cFanfan\u201d error. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005). <em>Fanfan </em>error is not a structural error. <em>Id. </em>However, the Government concedes that the <em>Fanfan </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>error was preserved, so we review for harmless error. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">A sentence at the top of the guideline range alone is insufficient to establish that the Fanfan error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Woods, </em>440 F.3d 255, 258-59 (5th Cir.2006). The record fails to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would have imposed the same sentence under the <em>post-Booker </em>advisory sentencing regime. <em>See Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 464. We therefore vacate Delgado-Castillo\u2019s sentence and remand for re-sentencing in accordance with <em>Booker. See id. </em>at 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Second, Delgado-Castillo argues that his base offense level was erroneously enhanced eight levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). He contends that the enhancement was improper because his state felony conviction for simple possession of cocaine was a misdemeanor under federal law, not an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d Delgado-Castillo acknowledges that this court\u2019s decisions in <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>265 F.3d 310, 312-13 (5th Cir.2001), and <em>United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 693-94 (5th Cir.1997), mandate the result reached by the district court; however, he contends that these holdings are contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jerome v. United States, </em>318 U.S. 101, 104-07, 63 S.Ct. 483, 87 L.Ed. 640 (1943). Having preceded <em>Hinojosa-Lopez, Jerome </em>is not \u201can intervening Supreme Court case explicitly or implicitly overruling that prior precedent.\u201d <em>See United States v. Short, </em>181 F.3d 620, 624 (5th Cir.1999). Delgado-Castillo has not shown that the district court erred by classifying his possession conviction as an aggravated felony for purposes of the eight-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Third, Delgado-Castillo argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Delgado-Castillo\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Delgado-Castillo contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Delgado-Castillo properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b528-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
