ORS 813.010; ORS 807.620; ORS 811.182. He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence. We review for errors of law, ORS 138.220, and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The facts are not in dispute. Salem police officer Leeder, the sole witness at the suppression hearing, testified that, at approximately 11:19 p.m. on April 21,1992, he received a dispatch that a caller had reported an \u201cintoxicated driver operating a small red vehicle with four subjects in it. The vehicle was driving erratically all over the road.\u201d The caller also gave the car\u2019s license plate number. However, the caller did not give his or her location, the location of the car, the direction it was traveling or a description of any of the occupants. The caller also did not disclose his or her name or telephone number, stating only that the caller is a member of \u201cSalem REACT.\u201d More than an hour later, at approximately 12:40 a.m. on April 22, Leeder saw a small red vehicle with four occupants driving south on Portland Road. He followed it and, after about four or five blocks, the car pulled into a motel parking lot. Leeder did not observe any traffic infractions. He followed the car into the parking lot, saw defendant getting out, and at that time noticed that the license plate number of the car matched the one he had received from the dispatcher. He turned on his emergency lights, approached defendant and asked him for his driver\u2019s license. Leeder testified that he stopped defendant solely because of the tip the dispatcher had received from the unnamed caller. He arrested defendant for driving under the influence of intoxicants, giving false information to a police officer and driving with a suspended license.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Before trial, defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence. The trial court denied the motion, and defendant was convicted following a stipulated facts trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. He contends that Leeder lacked reasonable suspicion to justify the stop, because the informant was anonymous and not sufficiently reliable. ORS 131.615(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>\u201cA peace officer who reasonably suspects that a person has committed a crime may stop the person and, after informing the person that the peace officer is a peace officer, make a reasonable inquiry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Reasonable suspicion requires a belief \u201cthat is reasonable under the totality of the circumstances existing at the time and place the peace officer acts.\u201d ORS 131.605(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">When reasonable suspicion is based solely on a citizen informant\u2019s report, that report must contain some indicia of reliability. <em>State v. Shumway, </em>124 Or App 131, 133, 861 P2d 384 (1993), <em>rev den </em>318 Or 459 (1994). In <em>State v. Black, </em>80 Or App 12, 721 P2d 842 (1986), we identified three factors that are important in determining the reliability of a citizen informant\u2019s report. One is whether the informant is exposed to possible criminal and civil prosecution if the report is false. That factor is satisfied if the informant gives his or her name to law enforcement authorities or if the informant delivers the information to the officer in person. <em>State v. Bybee, </em>131 Or App 492, 884 P2d 906 (1994); <em>State v. Koester, </em>117 Or App 139, 843 P2d 968 (1992), <em>rev den </em>315 Or 644 (1993). The second factor is whether the report is based on the personal observations of the informant. An officer may infer that the information is based on the informant\u2019s personal observations if the information contains sufficient detail that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">\u201cit is apparent that the informant had not been fabricating [the] report out of whole cloth * * * [and] the report [is] of the sort which in common experience may be recognized as having been obtained in a reliable way * * *.\u201d <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 US 410, 417-18, 89 S Ct 584, 21 L Ed 2d 637 (1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-7\"><em>See also State v. Shumway, supra, </em>124 Or App at 136. The final factor is whether the officer\u2019s own observations corroborated the informant\u2019s information. The officer may corroborate the tip either by observing the illegal activity or by finding the person, the vehicle and the location substantially as described by the informant. <em>State v. Vanness, </em>99 Or App 120, 124, 781 P2d 391 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">The facts in this case are similar to those in <em>State v. Black, supra. </em>In <em>Black, </em>the Oregon State Police received an anonymous telephone call from a woman in Selma, stating that a brown Ford Escort, traveling north on Highway 199, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>was speeding and weaving. About 11 minutes later, a state trooper spotted a brown Ford Escort driving north on Highway 199, approximately eight miles from Selma. He did not notice any erratic driving but stopped the car based on the anonymous tip. He arrested the defendant for DUII. We said that a tip must have some indicia of reliability and identified the three factors described above for the court to consider in determining if the officer had reasonable suspicion to make a stop. We concluded that, because the caller (fid not identify herself, she did not expose herself to possible criminal and civil prosecution if her report was false. We also noted that we could not infer \u2018 \u2018from the meager record that she personally observed what she reported.\u201d 80 Or App at 19. Finally, we said that the officer\u2019s personal observations did not corroborate the tip, because he did not see any erratic driving or speeding. We determined that a \u201creasonable officer under the totality of the circumstances could not reasonably have concluded that defendant had committed or was committing a crime\u201d and held that the stop was illegal. 80 Or App at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">In this case, the caller did not give the police dispatcher his or her name or telephone number.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The caller indicated only that he or she was a member of \u201cSalem REACT.\u201d The state argues that this identification is sufficient to subject the caller to possible civil and criminal liability for making a false report, because the call could be traced back to the caller. However, the state fails to explain how that could occur.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Leeder stated that he believes that \u201cSalem REACT\u201d is a local citizens band radio club, a \u2018 \u2018kind of citizens watchdog group\u2019 \u2019 that is concerned with problems in the community and whose members call the police if they see something, but he does not know what the letters \u201cREACT\u201d standfor. He stated that he had not had any personal contact with \u201cSalem REACT,\u201d but that he had handled about 10 calls said to have originated from it and that each call had led to an arrest. The record contains no other information about \u201cSalem REACT,\u201d its members, or how a call made by one of its members could be traced back to the caller.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Nonetheless, argues the state, we have \u201cnot found that it is necessary for informants to leave their names in order for their reports to be rehable.\u201d It cites <em>State v. Shumway, supra, </em>124 Or App at 135, and <em>State v. Koester, supra, </em>117 Or App at 143, to support that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">In <em>State v. Shumway, </em>an unnamed citizen informant and a woman approached a police officer in a park and reported that a man driving a green truck was very drunk, had driven erratically, had angrily confronted other people in the park and had left the park to get more beer. The officer saw the defendant driving back into the park and stopped him. Although the officer did not observe any erratic driving, he arrested the defendant for DUII. The defendant argued that the officer did not have reasonable suspicion to justify a stop, because the informant was not sufficiently reliable. In holding that the officer did have reasonable suspicion, we said that, although the informant did not give his name to the officer, by speaking to the officer in person he potentially exposed himself to civil and criminal liability if the information was false.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 124 Or App at 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">In <em>State v. Koester, </em>two state police officers were involved in a traffic stop on Interstate 5, south of Salem. Another motorist stopped and reported to them that a person driving a silver-grey Honda had pointed a pistol at him just north of Salem. He described the driver, gave the officers the license plate number and estimated that the car was then about three miles further south. He told the officers he would follow them and stop to identify the driver if they found the car. The motorist did not identify himself, and the officers did not note the license plate number of his car. The officers relayed the motorist\u2019s information to their dispatcher and learned that the registered owner lived in Corvallis. Approximately 34 minutes later, a Benton County deputy sheriff stopped the defendant\u2019s car as he was driving away from his Corvallis residence. The officer arrested the defendant for unlawful possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>We agreed with the trial court\u2019s finding that, although the informant did not identify himself, he nonetheless \u201cknowingly subjected himself to being identified.\u201d 117 Or App at 143. We concluded that the informant\u2019s report was based on his personal observations because of the detailed description of the driver, the car, the incident, the time and the location. Both the defendant and his car matched the descriptions given by the informant, and the car was found at a time and location that were consistent with his report. We held that, considering the totality of the circumstances, the officers had reasonable suspicion to stop the defendant\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Unlike the informants in <em>Shumway </em>and Koester, the caller in this case delivered his or her report anonymously over the telephone, claiming only to be a member of \u201cSalem REACT.\u201d The record before us contains virtually no information about that group, its membership, or how a call from an alleged member could be traced back to that person. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the caller was exposed to possible civil and criminal liability if the report was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Finally, the state contends that the informant\u2019s tip was reliable, because Leeder\u2019s personal observations corroborated the report: He saw a small red car with four occupants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Notably, the caller did not give a description of the defendant or any of the car\u2019s occupants and did not give the location of the car or an indication of its direction at the time of the call. Leeder stopped defendant well over an hour after the report was received by the police dispatcher. In contrast to both <em>Shumway </em>and <em>Koester, </em>we cannot say that defendant and his car were found at a time and location consistent with their location at the time of the report. Consequently, we cannot say that Leeder corroborated the report when he saw a small red car driving south on Portland Road 80 minutes later.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">We conclude that, because the anonymous informant was not exposed to civil and criminal liability if the report proved false, and because Leeder did not corroborate the informant\u2019s report, the tip was not reliable. <em>State v. Black, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number><em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Leeder, therefore, did not have reasonable suspicion to stop defendant\u2019s car. The trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Reversed and remanded for new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Av\"> At the suppression hearing, Leeder was not able to testify whether the caller was male or female.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AYn\"> The tape of the 911 call and the dispatch of the caller\u2019s information to Leeder were not introduced into evidence at the suppression hearing, the dispatcher was not examined, and no member of \u201cSalem REACT\u201d testified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b153-6\"> We also said that the officer partially corroborated the information, because he had seen the defendant\u2019s truck in the park earlier and saw the defendant return to the park in a manner consistent with the informant\u2019s report. The degree of detail in the informant\u2019s report allowed us to infer that it was based on his personal observations. <em>State v. Shumway, supra, </em>124 Or App at 136.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b154-7\"><em> </em>Leeder testified that he did not notice the car\u2019s license plate number until after the car had entered the motel parking lot, defendant had gotten out of the car, and he had stopped his patrol car behind defendant\u2019s car.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b155-8\"> The dissent claims that we are creating a <em>\u201cper se\u201d </em>rule that, in the absence of the three factors, any stop will be deemed not reasonable. 132 Or App at 120. We note that the dissent joined in our opinion in <em>State v. Bybee, supra, </em>in which we articulated and applied these same factors in concluding there that the officer did have reasonable suspicion to stop the defendant. The dissent is correct that, in <em>State v. Vanness, supra, </em>99 Or App at 123, we said that \u201cthere is no set formula to determine when an unidentified informant\u2019s tip gives rise to a reasonable suspicion that a person has committed a crime.\u201d However, in each of the relevant cases since <em>Vanness, </em>this court has consistently applied the factors first articulated in <em>State v. Black </em>in determining whether the officers had reasonable suspicion to stop the defendants. <em>See State v. Shumway, supra; State v. Koester, supra; State v. Girard, </em>106 Or App 463, 808 P2d 1017 (1991); <em>State v. Mesenbrink, </em>106 Or App 306, 807 P2d 319, <em>rev den </em>312 Or 235 (1991); <em>State v. Walsh, </em>103 Or App 517, 798 P2d 262 (1990), <em>rev den </em>311 Or 60 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b155-5\">ROSSMAN, P. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"APl\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The critical facts in this case are that a person identifying him or herself as a member of \u201cSalem REACT\u201d called the police, reported having seen a drunk driver on the road, described the vehicle\u2019s color, size and number of occupants, and provided the vehicle\u2019s license plate number. An officer saw the car, stopped and talked to the driver \u2014 who was already standing outside his car \u2014 and ascertained that the driver was indeed intoxicated. The driver (defendant) was arrested for and ultimately convicted of DUII.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The majority holds that defendant\u2019s conviction must be reversed because the caller did not provide his or her name and phone number and did not specify the location of defendant\u2019s car or the direction that it was traveling, and because the officer who arrested defendant did not observe any traffic infractions. To reach that conclusion, the majority relies on the legal principle that a \u201cstop\u201d is not supported by reasonable suspicion unless the informant\u2019s report, which gave rise to the stop, contained \u201csome indicia of reliability.\u201d 132 Or App at 115, citing <em>State v. Shumway, </em>124 Or App 131, 133, 861 P2d 384 (1993), <em>rev den </em>318 Or 459 (1994). The majority then proceeds to explain how the three factors that are \u201cimportant in determining the reliability of a citizen informant\u2019s report\u201d were not present in this case. 132 Or App at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Although I agree that the three factors discussed by the majority <em>are </em>\u201cimportant\u201d in determining whether an informant\u2019s report was rehable enough to be relied on by a police officer, I would distinguish between \u201cimportant\u201d and \u201cdispositive\u201d factors. The majority opinion inadvertently establishes a <em>per se </em>rule that, in the absence of those three factors, any stop will be deemed \u201cnot reasonable.\u201d That, however, is not the law. Factors are just that \u2014 factors\u2014and as such, they should be viewed as no more than components that we may <em>consider </em>in reaching a decision. The \u201cfactors\u201d identified by the majority are not essential ingredients. That is, they do not determine the outcome that we must reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Having considered whether the informant\u2019s report in this case contained \u201cindicia of reliability,\u201d and having contemplated the meaning of the statement that \u201cthere is no set formula to determine when an unidentified informant\u2019s tip gives rise to a reasonable suspicion that a person has committed a crime,\u201d <em>State v. Vanness, </em>99 Or App 120, 123, 781 P2d 391 (1989), I would hold that there <em>were </em>indicia of reliability in this case. First, I believe that it should be of no consequence that the informant failed to specify the location of defendant\u2019s car or the direction in which it was traveling. Although that type of information will assist officers in apprehending suspects, it says little about the reliability of an informant\u2019s report that the suspect has committed a crime. Also, it is the type of information that is too susceptible to change to serve as a firm basis for ascertaining the informant\u2019s credibility. After all, the suspect could stop traveling north on 1-5 and could begin traveling east on Highway 405. It is sufficient that the police dispatcher in this case could infer, from the call\u00e9r\u2019s reference to his or her membership in \u2018 \u2018 Salem REACT, \u2019 \u2019 that the caller saw defendant driving in the city of Salem. Second, the caller\u2019s failure to provide his or her name should not be deemed a fatal flaw, in light of the fact that the officer understood \u201cSalem REACT\u201d to be a community watchdog group which, in the officer\u2019s experience, had made a number of reports that <em>in each case </em>had led to an arrest. Third, the fact that the officer observed no traffic infractions being committed by defendant is of little import, because the officer\u2019s first contact with defendant took place after defendant had already left his car, an act which did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>take place at the behest of the officer. At that time, the officer noticed that defendant was intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">I would hold that the informant\u2019s report in this case was reliable and provided a sufficient basis for the officer to make contact with defendant to ascertain whether he was drunk. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
