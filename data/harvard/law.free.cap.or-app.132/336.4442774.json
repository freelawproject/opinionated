In the first action, the trial court entered summary judgment for defendants on plaintiffs claims for a declaration of coverage under the UM policy and dismissed plaintiffs claims for breach of contract and tortious interference with economic relations for failure to state a claim. ORCP 21A(8). In the second, subsequent action, the court dismissed plaintiffs claim that defendants fraudulently misrepresented the UM policy limit. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Plaintiff is the father and personal representative of the estate of William Fox (Fox).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This litigation arises from Fox\u2019s death during a staged auto accident in Coos County in August 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">During the summer of 1990, Tim Vincent, one of Fox\u2019s close friends and a high school classmate, decided to intentionally wreck his Nissan pickup so that he could collect the insurance proceeds and purchase a Toyota pickup. Fox and Vincent discussed Vincent\u2019s plans, and Fox agreed to participate, initially, as a look-out for oncoming traffic. On the night of August 27, 1990, Vincent, with Fox as a passenger, not a look-out, intentionally drove his Nissan off Seven Devils Road near Bandon. Vincent survived the wreck, but Fox did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">At the time of the wreck, Vincent was a named insured under a $500,000 automobile liability policy from North Pacific Insurance Co. Fox was a named insured under his family\u2019s UM coverage, which defendants issued with a limit of $500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">For more than a year following the wreck, Vincent falsely maintained that he accidentally drove off the road because he was blinded by the headlights of a \u201cphantom\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>oncoming car as he came around a sharp curve. However, in December 1991, Vincent finally confessed to intentionally causing the wreck to collect insurance proceeds and subsequently pleaded no contest to criminally negligent homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">In January 1992, plaintiff sued Vincent for wrongful death. Because plaintiff feared that Vincent\u2019s insurer, North Pacific, might deny coverage, based on Vincent\u2019s intentional and fraudulent conduct, he contacted defendants\u2019 agent, Jack Waters, to ask about his family\u2019s UM coverage at the time of the wreck. Waters erroneously told plaintiff that the policy limit was $100,000, not $500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">In April 1992, North Pacific filed an action against Vincent, seeking a declaration that it had no duty to defend or indemnify him because of his intentional and fraudulent conduct. Despite the pendency of that action, North Pacific and plaintiff began negotiating a settlement of the wrongful death action. In June 1992, plaintiff wrote to defendants, giving them notice of North Pacific\u2019s declaratory judgment action, advising them of a potential settlement with North Pacific, and demanding arbitration to determine coverage under the UM policy. Defendants did not reply. Thereafter, and without receiving defendants\u2019 consent,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> plaintiff accepted $150,000 from North Pacific in settlement of the wrongful death action against Vincent. In July 1992, North Pacific dismissed without prejudice its declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">In August 1992, plaintiff brought a product liability suit against Nissan, alleging that the truck had a defective seat belt system. Nissan, in turn, impleaded Vincent causing North Pacific to revive its declaratoiy judgment action. On August 13, 1993, the court entered a judgment declaring Vincent\u2019s liability policy void because of his intentional and fraudulent conduct. <em>North Pacific Ins. Co. v. Vincent and Nissan Corp., </em>Coos County Circuit Court Case No. 92CV-1026. That judgment was never appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>In November 1992, while North Pacific\u2019s revived action was pending, defendants informed plaintiff that the UM policy limit at the time of Fox\u2019s death was $500,000, not $100,000. Plaintiff then sued defendants, seeking a declaration of coverage under the UM policy and asserting further claims of breach of contract for nonpayment of UM benefits, and tortious interference with plaintiffs settlement with North Pacific.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court dismissed the breach of contract and tortious interference claims under ORCP 21A(8) and entered summary judgment against plaintiff on the declaratory judgment claim. Plaintiff then moved to set the judgment aside so that he could amend his complaint to allege fraud. When the court denied that motion, plaintiff filed a second action against defendants alleging fraud. The court dismissed that action as barred by <em>res judicata. </em>Plaintiff appeals the judgments in both actions, which are consolidated for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Plaintiff first assigns error to the entry of summary judgment against his claim for declaratory relief. In moving for summary judgment, defendants argued that the UM policy did not cover claims arising from Fox\u2019s death for three separate, alternative reasons. First, Fox\u2019s death was not \u201ccaused by an accident.\u201d Second, the Vincent vehicle was neither uninsured nor underinsured. Third, even if Fox\u2019s death were otherwise covered, plaintiffs settlement without defendants\u2019 consent barred recovery under the UM policy. The trial court\u2019s judgment did not specify its grounds for granting summary judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because we affirm on defendants\u2019 first ground, we do not reach the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Plaintiffs uninsured motorist policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">\u201cIf you have paid for this coverage* * *, we will pay damages which an insured is legally entitled to recover from an owner or operator of an uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>because of bodily injury sustained by an insured and <em>caused by an </em>accident.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Neither the policy nor the uninsured motorist insurance statutes, ORS 742.500 <em>et seq, </em>define when an injury is \u201ccaused by accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Defendants argue that they are entitled to prevail on either of two grounds: (1) Plaintiffs are precluded<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> from asserting that Fox\u2019s death was caused by an accident, because of the court\u2019s prior determination in <em>North Pacific Ins. Co. v. Vincent and Nissan Corp., supra, </em>that Vincent intentionally caused the wreck. (2) In any event, Fox\u2019s death did not result from an accident because uncontroverted evidence establishes that Fox intended to participate in the event, rendering the Seven Devils Road wreck non-accidental with respect to, Fox. We conclude that the <em>North Pacific </em>judgment was not preclusive in this context, because the determination of whether the wreck was \u201caccidental\u201d for purposes of Vincent\u2019s liability coverage turned on a qualitatively different analysis than that required here. Summary judgment was, nonetheless, proper because Fox\u2019s voluntary participation in the wreck as established by uncontroverted evidence rendered the wreck non-accidental for purposes of UM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">We turn first to issue preclusion. In <em>Davis v. State Farm Mut. Ins., </em>264 Or 547, 507 P2d 9 (1973), the Oregon Supreme Court, applying Michigan law, held that for the purposes of uninsured motorist insurance, a court must determine whether an incident constitutes an \u201caccident\u201d from the perspective of the insured <em>(i.e., </em>injured) party. There, the tortfeasor intentionally injured the plaintiff by hitting him with his car, and the tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurer subsequently denied coverage for its insured\u2019s intentional conduct. When the plaintiff attempted to collect under his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>own uninsured motorist policy, the UM insurer denied coverage on the ground that the plaintiffs injuries were not \u201ccaused by accident.\u201d The trial court held that the plaintiff was entitled to recover under the UM policy, and the Supreme Court affirmed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\">\u201cWhether the occurrence is accidental depends entirely upon the point from which the question is viewed. If the occurrence is looked at from the point of view of the person who inflicts the harm or of his liability insurer, it is intentional. On the other hand, if it is looked at from the victim\u2019s standpoint, it is unforeseen, unintended, unexpected, and has every aspect of an accident as long as the occurrence was not provoked. Therefore, it is necessary to decide which point of view is the proper one from which to solve the present question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">\u201cThe third party who inflicted the harm and his insurer are not parties to the policy upon which this action is brought. The money which will reimburse the plaintiff (if he is successful here) will not come from them. Defendant, if required to pay plaintiff, will be subrogated to any rights plaintiff has against the third party. The liability of the third party will be unaffected by the outcome of this case and no public policy will be offended because he will receive no protection from the consequences of his unlawful act. Certainly, there is no reason to consider the matter from the viewpoint of the third party and of his insurer. They are unconcerned and unaffected by the present litigation. The proper points of view are those of plaintiff and defendant. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">\u201cThe primary purpose of [uninsured motorist] coverage, in the absence of statutory declaration or of a provision of the policy indicating otherwise, is to protect innocent victims who have been injured by financially irresponsible motorists. The purpose of the coverage is not protection from liability. This portion of the policy, therefore, resembles an accident policy for the victim of the uninsured motorist.\u201d 264 Or at 550-51.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">Although <em>Davis </em>concerned Michigan law, its reasoning is equally persuasive under Oregon law. The intent of Oregon\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage, like Michigan\u2019s, is to protect innocent victims of financially irresponsible motorists. <em>See General Acc. Fire and Life v. Shasky, </em>266 Or 312, 318-19, 512 P2d 987 (1973). To an injured party, a motorist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>with ineffective liability insurance is just as financially irresponsible as a motorist with no liability insurance at all. 266 Or at 319 (\u201cThe distinction between not having insurance and not having effective insurance is nebulous.\u201d). Consequently, for purposes of UM coverage, the question of whether an injury is caused by an accident must be viewed, and resolved, from the insured\u2019s perspective.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">Given that perspective, defendants\u2019 \u201ccollateral estoppel\u201d argument fails. Issue preclusion requires that the issue decided in the prior adjudication be identical to the one presented in the subsequent adjudication. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. v. Reuter, </em>299 Or 155, 158, 700 P2d 236. In <em>North Pacific Ins. Co. v. Vincent and Nissan Corp., supra, </em>the court focused on <em>Vincent\u2019s </em>fraudulent intent and conduct in determining that the Seven Devils wreck was not an \u201caccident\u201d for purposes of Vincent\u2019s liability coverage. Thus, because Fox\u2019s participation was neither expressly nor implicitly adjudicated, issue preclusion does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The inquiry thus reduces to whether, viewed from Fox\u2019s perspective, the Seven Devils wreck was an \u201caccident.\u201d Our disposition of that issue turns on the resolution of two subsidiary issues. First, what is the definition of \u201caccident\u201d for UM purposes? Second, applying that definition, were there disputed issues of material fact concerning Fox\u2019s intent to participate in the wreck, which should have precluded summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Defendants contend that an injury-producing event is not an \u201caccident\u201d under a UM policy if the insured intended to participate in that act. As support for that proposition, defendants rely on <em>St. Paul Fire v. McCormick &amp; Baxter Creosoting, </em>126 Or App 689, 870 P2d 260, <em>mod </em>128 Or App 234, 875 P2d 537 (1994), which cited the following rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">\u2018 \u2018Where an unusual or unexpected result occurs by reason of the doing by insured of an intentional act, where no mischance, slip, or mishap occurs in doing the act itself, the ensuing injury or death is not caused through accidental means; that it must appear that the means used was accidental, and it is not enough that the result may be unusual, unexpected, or unforeseen.\u201d 126 Or App at 705</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Applying that test, defendants argue that, because Fox intended to ride in the truck when Vincent drove it off the road, his death was not the result of an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Plaintiff contends that the appropriate test is not whether the UM insured intended to participate in the act, but whether the injury was intended. Plaintiff relies on cases construing exclusions for intentionally caused injuries in liability insurance policies.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Those cases hold that such exclusions apply only where the insured tortfeasor intended to injure the victim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">\u201cIt is not sufficient that the insured\u2019s intentional, albeit unlawful, acts have resulted in unintended harm; the acts must have been committed for the purpose of inflicting the injury and harm before either a policy provision excluding intentional harm applies or the public policy against insurability attaches.\u201d <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Stone, supra </em>n 7, 319 Or at 278.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Thus, plaintiff argues that Fox\u2019s death was caused by an accident, because there is no evidence that Vincent intended to injure Fox.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Neither plaintiff nor defendant cite the correct test for \u201caccident.\u201d Plaintiffs reliance on the \u201cintended injury\u201d test is misplaced because that test improperly views the event from Vincent\u2019s, not Fox\u2019s perspective. Defendant\u2019s test for \u201caccident\u201d is closer to the mark, but not entirely correct. The test cited with approval in <em>St. Paul Fire v. McCormick &amp; Baxter Creosoting, supra, </em>makes a distinction between \u201cacts\u201d and \u201cresults.\u201d However, 16 years earlier, <em>in Botts v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co., </em>284 Or 95, 585 P2d 657 (1978), the court disapproved that distinction and substituted a new methodology:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\">\u201cQuestions relating to the continued vitality of the means-result distinction need not be resolved in the present case because, as noted, the policy we are construing does not contain an accidental means or cause requirement. However, as seen in the briefs in this case, the distinction keeps rising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>to the surface and creating unnecessary confusion; consequently, we shall lay the distinction to rest at this seemingly opportune time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-4\">\u201cHowever, the abolishment of the above-discussed distinction does not end our inquiry, for it is still necessary that we determine whether the death of the decedent was \u2018accidental.\u2019 * * * The insurance company may, of course, insert in its policy any definition of \u2018accident\u2019 it chooses but, in the absence of doing so, it must accept the common understanding of the term by the ordinary member of the purchasing public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">(($ \u2021 \u2021 \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">\u201cIn situations in which \u2018accident\u2019 or \u2018accidental\u2019 are not defined in the policy, it is for the court to decide the definition which is properly applicable to the particular factual situation, taking into consideration what we believe to be the popular non-technical understanding of the term. If the evidence discloses that no reasonable jury could find that a view of the facts most favorable to plaintiff is within the definition established by the court, a verdict should be directed by the court for the defendant. If the undisputed facts clearly come within the definition, a judgment should be directed for plaintiff. If the facts are disputed, or if varying legitimate inferences can be drawn from established facts, the question is one for the jury.\u201d 284 Or at 100-04.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-7\"> Because defendants have not defined \u201caccident\u201d in the UM policy, we must formulate the correct definition \u201ctaking into consideration what we believe to be the popular non-technical understanding of the term.\u201d 284 Or at 103. <em>Botts, </em>itself, did not explicitly adopt a definition of \u201caccident\u201d or \u201caccidental.\u201d However, in post-Boiis cases, we have applied a definition implicitly endorsed in <em>Botts: </em>An accident is an event that, from the UM insured\u2019s perspective, is \u201cunforeseen, unexpected, unintended or the like.\u201d <em>See Botts v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co., supra, </em>284 Or at 101 n 3; <em>Albertson\u2019s Inc. v. Great Southwest Fire Ins. Co., </em>83 Or App 527, 531, 732 P2d 916, <em>rev den </em>303 Or 332 (1987); <em>Safeco Ins. v. House, </em>80 Or App 89, 96, 721 P2d 862, <em>rev den </em>302 Or 86 (1986).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That definition is practical and eminently and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>\u201cnon-technically\u201d sensible. We note, moreover, that it imports, at least in part, a subjective element. Even if an objectively reasonable passenger would not intend or foresee that a car would be driven off a cliff, such an event would still be non-\u201caccidental\u201d for UM coverage purposes if a particular UM insured passenger intended to participate in the event. Thus, we must determine whether genuine issues of fact exist as to whether Fox intended or expected to ride off Seven Devils Road in Vincent\u2019s truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">In their motion for summary judgment, defendants relied on Vincent\u2019s deposition to support their assertion that Fox intended to ride along when Vincent intentionally wrecked the truck.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Vincent testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">\u2018 \u2018A. We were talking about doing it and up to this point, Billy had never \u2014 he always said he was going to be in the truck when I did it but I always was telling him that he was not going to be, that he was going to stand out near the spot where I wanted to go down so I could decide, I could find the spot to go down, and he told me that he wanted to go, that he would feel bad if I went down there and got hurt. He would feel real guilty if one of us got hurt and I told him that I don\u2019t know what I [sic] do if he got hurt. * * * Now, that was the only time \u2014 that was the only time we kind of second guessed it, feeling we\u2019re not doing the right thing, and he said, well, I\u2019m not getting out. I\u2019m going with you all the way. He said if we wear our seat belts, we\u2019ll be safe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">\u201cQ. That was [sic] his words?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">\u201cA. Yeah, and so I said, yeah, I think you\u2019re right. We remembered [a] high school assembly where [a] State trooper had told us that he had never pulled a dead body out of a seat belt and so we were confident that none of us would get hurt so we drove up to, to near the wreck, near the spot, stopped about a hundred yards and made sure, you know, like you sure about this, you know, and, yeah, so I went ahead and got up to about 35 miles an hour and went down the spot that we had previously planned on going, going down when we went up Seven Devils Road.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">To rebut that evidence, plaintiff relied on the deposition of Ron Hunt, a friend of Vincent and Fox, whom Vincent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>had repeatedly asked to participate in his scheme as a lookout. Hunt testified as to a conversation he had with Vincent and Fox on the morning of the day of the fatal wreck:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\">\u201cQ. And it was your understanding that you would get out of the vehicle, go around the corner and kind of watch to see that other people wouldn\u2019t be coming onto the scene?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">\u201cA. That\u2019s what I thought.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">\u201cQ. And that means while Tim would roll the truck over the edge of the cliff but wouldn\u2019t go over the cliff with the truck?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">\u201cA. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">\u201cQ. And Billy was present and he heard that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">\u201cA. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-10\">\u201cQ. And it was your understanding from what was being said that Billy was going to he participating as a witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-11\">\u201cA. That\u2019s what it seemed like.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-12\">\u201cQ. And that\u2019s because of what Billy told you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-13\">\u201cA. Well, that\u2019s from being there when Tim was asking me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-14\">\u201cQ. And you asked Billy what are you going to be doing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-15\">\u201cA. I asked him, I mean when Tim was saying he was going to jump out of the truck, I looked at Billy and I said Billy, are you going to jump out of the truck and he said no, I\u2019m going to be waiting around the corner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-17\">Even viewing Hunt\u2019s testimony in the light most favorable to plaintiff, giving him the benefit of all reasonable inferences of fact, <em>Raethke v. Oregon Health Sciences Univ., </em>115 Or App 195, 198, 837 P2d 977 (1992), <em>rev den </em>315 Or 442 (1993), we conclude that no reasonable trier of fact could conclude that Fox did not intend or expect to ride off Seven Devils Road in Vincent\u2019s truck. This is so for two reasons. First, Hunt\u2019s testimony does not controvert Vincent\u2019s. At most, it shows that, earlier on the day of the wreck, Fox and Vincent agreed that Fox would act as a look out. Vincent\u2019s testimony explains that Fox later changed his mind. Second, plaintiff has adduced no evidence controverting Vincent\u2019s credibility with respect to the quoted testimony. Although Vincent\u2019s general credibility is hardly impeccable given that he lied for a year about staging the wreck, plaintiff points to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>no plausible motive for him to lie regarding Fox\u2019s intent on the night of the wreck.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Ultimately, plaintiff\u2019s position reduces to the proposition that Vincent, for unknown reasons, intentionally drove his close friend off Seven Devils Road over his protests or without his knowledge. That unsubstantiated proposition was insufficient to controvert Vincent\u2019s testimony. Consequently, the court properly entered summary judgment against plaintiffs first claim for a declaration of UM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Because of our disposition of plaintiffs first assignment of error, his second, which disputes the dismissal of plaintiffs ancillary breach of contract claim, also fails. Plaintiffs remaining assignments of error are without merit and warrant no further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-9\"> As amplified below, most of our analysis pertains to the summary judgment against plaintiffs breach of contract claim. For those purposes, the record is viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the party opposing summary judgment, even with respect to those issues upon which the opposing party would have the burden at trial. <em>Seeborg v.

House, supra, </em>turned on the specific language of general liability insurance policies rather than on an insured\u2019s intent with respect to uninsured motorist insurance policies. Nonetheless, we find those cases instructive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b394-10\"> On appeal, plaintiff contends that Vincent\u2019s deposition is hearsay. Because plaintiff failed to raise this issue in the trial court, we decline to address it. See ORAP 5.45(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b396-6\"> At the time Vincent gave his deposition testimony, he had already pleaded no contest to criminally negligent homicide, and, thus, did not face the prospect of future criminal liability. Moreover, as plaintiff acknowledged, Vincent was effectively judgment-proof, so he had no pecuniary motive to lie.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
