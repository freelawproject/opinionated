Because we answer that question in the affirmative, we reverse in the first appeal and affirm in the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">In 1983, plaintiff Linda Bird was injured in the course of her employment when the car she was driving collided with a car driven by Donald Moreland, who was in the course of his employment with Norpac Foods, Inc. Bird filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim based on her injuries and collected $84,607.84 in benefits from her employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer, American Motorists Insurance Company (AMIC). She also filed an uninsured motorist claim against her own motor vehicle insurer, Farmer\u2019s Insurance Company of Oregon, and ultimately collected $5,664.49 on that claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Bird also filed a personal injury claim against More-land and Norpac. At the time of the accident, Norpac and Moreland, as its agent, were insured by Mission Insurance Company. Mission was later declared insolvent, and OIGA assumed its rights and responsibilities vis-a-vis Moreland and Norpac, including the defense of Bird\u2019s action, pursuant to ORS 734.570(1) and (2). A jury awarded Bird damages of $104,742.26, including $94,742.26 in economic damages and $10,000 in non-economic damages; the trial court entered judgment against Norpac and Moreland, jointly and severally, in that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Norpac and Moreland, at OIGA\u2019s instigation, filed a motion for an order directing satisfaction of the judgment. In that motion, they argued that, because OIGA had assumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>the responsibilities of their insolvent insurer and was ultimately responsible for payingthe judgment against them, the judgment was subject to ORS 734.640. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-4\">\u201c(1) Any person who has a claim under an insurance policy against an insurer other than an insolvent insurer which would also be a covered claim against an insolvent insurer must first exhaust the remedies under such policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">\u00a3&lt;$ * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">\u201c(3) Any recovery under ORS 734.510 to 734.710 from [OIGA] shall be reduced by the amount of any recovery pursuant to subsection (1) * * * of this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Under that provision, they argued, Bird\u2019s judgment must be offset and deemed satisfied to the extent of her workers\u2019 compensation and uninsured motorist recoveries.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Bird opposed the motion, arguing, among other things, that her claim did not qualify as a \u201ccovered claim\u201d and that her workers\u2019 compensation recovery did not qualify as \u201ca claim under an insurance policy,\u201d as those terms are used in ORS 734.640(1). The trial court denied the motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">\u201cORS 734.640 is a claim priority matter and has nothing to do with the plaintiff in this matter. It talks about \u2018any recovery under 734.514 to 734.710\u2019 and I do not believe that \u2018covered claim under 734.510(4)(a)\u2019 has anything to do with the plaintiff in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">Norpac appealed that denial. ORS 19.010(c). That appeal (CA A65075) is the first of the consolidated appeals before us. In filing the appeal, Moreland was not named as an appellant. Because the limitations period for appealing that decision has long since elapsed, the trial court\u2019s decision is final and unappealable with respect to Moreland.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">While Norpac\u2019s appeal was pending, OIGA filed a complaint against Bird, AMIC and Farmer\u2019s in its own name, as well as Norpac\u2019s and Moreland\u2019s, seeking a declaratory judgment that OIGA, Norpac, and Moreland had no duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>pay Bird\u2019s judgment. As its insureds had argued in their motion to direct satisfaction, OIGA alleged that, under the OIGA statutes, and ORS 734.640 in particular, Bird\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation and uninsured motorist recoveries must be offset against the judgment in her personal injuiy action.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Bird moved to dismiss, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that another action involving the same claim was pending (i.e., Norpac\u2019s appeal) and that the present action was barred under principles of <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. Bird also moved for summary judgment, asserting the same substantive arguments that had prevailed against Norpac\u2019s and Moreland\u2019s motion to direct satisfaction. OIGA filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The trial court denied Bird\u2019s motions, granted OIGA\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment, and entered a judgment declaring that Bird\u2019s $104,742.26 judgment against Norpac and Moreland should be offset by the $90,272.33 she had recovered from AMIC and Farmer\u2019s. Bird appeals that judgment in CA A68732.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">We first address Norpac\u2019s appeal. Norpac argues that the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion to satisfy is contrary to ORS 734.640(3) and, in particular, to the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of that provision in <em>Carrier v. Hicks, </em>316 Or 341, 851 P2d 851 (1993). Bird counters that the denial of satisfaction was proper for a number of reasons. She argues, variously, that: (1) <em>Carrier v. Hicks, supra, </em>is inapplicable to her workers\u2019 compensation recovery; (2) Norpac failed to establish that Bird\u2019s personal injury claim was a \u201ccovered claim\u201d under the OIGA statutes; and (3) the satisfaction procedure invoked by Norpac was not available under the circumstances. We consider, and reject, each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The relevant statutes, which are set out at ORS 734.510 to ORS 734.710, provide a scheme for guaranteeing payment on claims falling within the coverage of insurance policies issued by insurers that are later declared insolvent. Under those statutes, OIGA, an association of insurers doing business in Oregon, collects funds from its members, and uses those funds to pay certain insurance claims, <em>i.e., </em>\u201ccovered claims,\u201d filed against insurers that have been declared insolvent. OIGA is required to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>\u201c(1) * * * pay <em>covered claims </em>existing at the time of determination of insolvency of an insurer or arising within 30 days after the determination of insolvency * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-4\">\u201c(2) Be the insurer to the extent of the association\u2019s obligation on the <em>covered claims </em>and to such extent have all the rights, duties and obligations of the insolvent insurer as if the insurer had not become insolvent.\u201d ORS 734.570. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">A \u201ccovered claim\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">\u201can unpaid claim * * * that arises out of and is within the coverage and limits of an insurance policy to which ORS 734.510 to 734.710 apply and which is in force at the time of the occurrence giving rise to the unpaid claim, made by a person insured under such policy or by a person suffering injury or damage for which a person insured under such policy is legally liable * * ORS 734.510(4)(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">The term \u201ccovered claim\u201d does not include any amount owed to an insurer \u201cas subrogated recoveries or otherwise.\u201d ORS 734.510(4)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\"> The statutory scheme recognizes that a person who has a claim under a policy issued by an insolvent insurer might also have claims, based on the same accident or occurrence, against insurance policies issued by solvent insurers. Thus, ORS 734.640 ensures that, in those situations, OIGA funds will not be used \u201cuntil all other available insurance sources of payment have been used up.\u201d <em>Carrier v. Hicks, supra, </em>316 Or at 348. In particular, under ORS 734.640(1), claimants are required to exhaust their remedies under policies issued by solvent insurers, by filing any available \u201cclaim[s] under an insurer policy * * * which would also be a covered claim,\u201d before they turn to OIGA for payment. In addition, any recovery from OIGA must be reduced by the amount recovered as a result of those claims. ORS 734.640(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Norpac argues, and Bird does not dispute that, under the analysis of <em>Carrier v. Hicks, supra, </em>Bird\u2019s uninsured motorist recovery was obtained pursuant to a \u201cclaim under an insurance policy * * * which would also be a covered claim.\u201d Thus, subject to our disposition of Bird\u2019s alternative arguments, ORS 734.640(3) operates to reduce her judgment to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Whether her workers\u2019 compensation recovery was obtained pursuant to a \u201cclaim under an insurance policy\u201d is a closer and more difficult question. The text of ORS 734.640 is unenhghtening. Neither that section, nor the OIGA statutes generally, defines \u201cinsurance.\u201d Nor, obviously, does the statutory text refer expressly to workers\u2019 compensation coverage. <em>See PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 859 P2d 1143 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Resort to context is more useful. The OIGA statutes expressly treat claims under workers\u2019 compensation policies as \u201cclaims arising out of \u2018insurance policies\u2019 \u201d for some purposes. ORS 734.570(1) places a $300,000 cap on OIGA\u2019s liability for covered claims \u201c[e]xcept for covered claims arising out of workers\u2019 compensation policies.\u201d In addition, we have assumed that workers\u2019 compensation claims are \u201cclaims arising out of an insurance policy\u201d for purposes of ORS 734.510(4)(b)(B) and ORS 734.695.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Corvallis Aero Service v. Villalobos, </em>81 Or App 137, 724 P2d 880 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\"> We are loath to hold that a workers\u2019 compensation policy is an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d for purposes of some provisions of the Guaranty Association Act, but not for others, specifically ORS 734.640(1). When a term is used in various parts of the same statute, we must presume, absent clear indications to the contrary, that the legislature intended the same meaning throughout. <em>Pense v. McCall, 243 Or </em>383, 389, 413 P2d 722 (1966); <em>Cherry Growers v. Emp. Div., </em>25 Or App 645, 649, 550 P2d 1250 (1976). We find no clear evidence of a contrary intent in the OIGA statutes or their legislative history, and, therefore, conclude that workers\u2019 compensation benefits, including those received by Bird in this case, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>recoveries obtained pursuant to \u201cclaims under insurance policies\u201d under ORS 734.640.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">We acknowledge, as Bird emphasizes, that our holding may, in particular cases, frustrate a stated purpose of the OIGA statutes: \u201cto avoid financial loss to claimants or policyholders because of the insolvency of the insurer.\u201d ORS 734.520.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under normal <em>circumstances </em>\u2014 i.e., if Moreland\u2019s and Norpac\u2019s insurer, Mission, had remained solvent \u2014 Bird would have been entitled to retain a portion of the third-party judgment, even if that portion effectively duplicated her workers\u2019 compensation benefits, her counsel would have been compensated from that judgment, and the compensation carrier would have had a hen on the balance. ORS 656.593-(l)(a), (b) and (d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> By requiring a reduction \u201cby the amount of any recovery\u201d from other insurance, ORS 734.640(3) unambiguously requires a reduction by the <em>full </em>amount of such recovery, precluding such apportionment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>We appreciate that our construction of ORS 734.640 to encompass workers\u2019 compensation benefits means that plaintiffs in Bird\u2019s position may recover less because of an insurer\u2019s insolvency. However, given the text and context of the statute, we are unable to read it in a manner that avoids that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Bird next argues that, even if both her uninsured motorist and workers\u2019 compensation recoveries were obtained pursuant to \u201cclaims under an insurance policy,\u201d the judgment in her personal injury action was not a \u201ccovered claim\u201d subject to ORS 734.640 because Moreland and Norpac were insured by insurers other than the insolvent Mission and they failed to exhaust that coverage. Bird asserts that ORS 734.640(1) requires such exhaustion of other coverage before OIGA can treat a judgment as a \u201ccovered claim\u201d and invoke the statutorily prescribed offset.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Bird indiscriminately and improperly conflates two unrelated statutes. ORS 734.510(4) clearly and comprehensively defines \u201ccovered claims.\u201d Conversely, ORS 734.640(1) is a priority statute, limiting OIGA\u2019s obligation to pay \u201ccovered claims.\u201d That statute requires persons who have such claims to exhaust their remedies against other insurers before they seek a remedy from OIGA; it does not, however, impose any obligations on OIGA, including, for example, any obligation to investigate other insurance before processing a claim. Because Bird\u2019s claim fell squarely within ORS 734.510(4)\u2019s definition of \u201ccovered claims,\u201d OIGA was entitled to treat it as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Bird next argues that, regardless of the operation of ORS 734.640, O\u00cdGA waived any right it may have had to an offset because it failed to request the offset <em>before </em>the entry of final judgment. She relies on ORS 18.580, which allows a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>court to deduct certain collateral benefits received by a party awarded damages in a personal injury action \u201cbefore the entry of final judgment.\u201d This argument fails because OIGA\u2019s entitlement to offset derives from ORS 734.640, and not, generieally, from ORS 18.580. <em>Hallford v. Smith, </em>120 Or App 57, 64, 852 P2d 249 (1993); <em>State v. Vandepoll, </em>118 Or App 193, 198, 846 P2d 1174 (1993). Although OIGA can employ the procedures described at ORS 18.580 to effect its right, it is not obliged to employ those procedures as the exclusive means for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">In a related sense, Bird argues that OIGA cannot formalize its right to a reduction through the procedure it <em>did </em>choose to employ, <em>i.e., </em>satisfaction of judgment pursuant to ORS 18.410. She interprets ORS 18.410(2)(a)(C), which requires persons moving for a satisfaction of judgment to specify \u201cthe date or dates and amounts of any payments <em>on the </em>judgment,\u201d as an indication that a judgment may be satisfied only if the plaintiff has received payments on the judgment. She argues that, because her uninsured motorist and workers\u2019 compensation recoveries were not payments \u201con the judgment\u201d in her personal injury action, those recoveries cannot be deemed to satisfy her judgment against Norpac and Moreland.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">We disagree. ORS 18.410 provides a procedure for \u201cobtain[ing] a satisfaction * * * when any [judgment debtor] is unable to obtain a satisfaction.\u201d Under ORS 18.400, a satisfaction results \u201cwhen any judgment is paid <em>or </em>satisfied.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) The use of the disjunctive indicates that a judgment may be satisfied by means other than direct payment. Here, because ORS 734.640 allows OIGA to reduce Bird\u2019s judgment against Norpac and Moreland by her uninsured motorist and workers\u2019 compensation recoveries, the judgment may be deemed satisfied to the extent of those recoveries.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">In sum, with respect to Norpac\u2019s appeal, we conclude that the trial court erred in denying Norpac\u2019s motion to direct satisfaction. Accordingly, we reverse that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>That disposition largely disposes of Bird\u2019s appeal of OIGA\u2019s declaratory judgment action. In adjudicating Norpac\u2019s appeal, we considered and rejected every substantive argument Bird advances against the subsequent judgment. In addition to her substantive arguments, Bird contends that OIGA\u2019s claim for declaratory relief was barred either by <em>res judicata </em>(claim preclusion) or collateral estoppel (issue preclusion), deriving from the court\u2019s prior denial of Norpac\u2019s and Moreland\u2019s motion to direct satisfaction. Our disposition of Norpac\u2019s appeal deprives the prior adjudication of preclusive effect as to Norpac. <em>See Community Bank v. Vassil, </em>280 Or 139, 143-44, 570 P2d 66 (1977). Thus, even if we were to assume, as plaintiff argues, that OIGA and Norpac were in privity so that OIGA should have been bound by the prior denial, the trial court\u2019s rejection of Bird\u2019s issue preclusion and claim preclusion defenses was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">A different analysis applies to Moreland. As noted, Moreland did not file a timely appeal from the trial court\u2019s order denying satisfaction. Accordingly, notwithstanding our reversal on Norpac\u2019s appeal, that order was, and is, final and preclusive as to Moreland.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Nonetheless, we do not address plaintiffs preclusion arguments with respect to Moreland because any decision we might render would not \u201chave a practical effect on or concerning the rights of the parties.\u201d <em>Brumnett v. PSRB, </em>315 Or 402, 406, 848 P2d 1194 (1993). This is so because, as amatter of law, our holding that the judgment has been properly satisfied as to Norpac in the amount of $90.272.33 also operates to satisfy the joint and several judgment against Moreland to the same.extent. <em>See Starr v. Heckathorne, </em>270 Or 238, 527 P2d 401 (1974); <em>Savelich Logging v. Preston Mill Co., </em>265 Or 456, 509 P2d 1179 (1973). Accordingly, plaintiffs claim and issue preclusion arguments with respect to Moreland, while justiciable, are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Order denying Norpac Foods, Inc., and Donald More-land\u2019s motion to direct satisfaction in CA A65075 is reversed and remanded; the judgment in CA A68732 is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-8\"> Moreland qualified as an uninsured motorist under Bird\u2019s policy because his motor vehicle insurer had been declared insolvent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b401-12\"> In their motion for an order directing satisfaction, Norpac and Moreland alleged that AMIC and Farmers had paid Bird more than $103,000.

To avoid confusion over amounts that are not in dispute, OIGA, Norpac, and Moreland have since paid the undisputed portion of the judgment, $15,014.33, to Bird, leaving only the $90,272.33 at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b404-6\"> ORS 734.510(4)(b)(B) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-7\">\u201c(b) \u2018Covered claim\u2019 does not include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">&lt;&lt;* # * \u2021 #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-9\">\u201c(B) Any amount due any reinsurer, insurer, insurance pool or underwriting association as subrogated recoveries or otherwise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">ORS 734.695 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-11\">\u201cThe insured of an insolvent insurer shall not be personally liable for amounts due any reinsurer, insurer, insurance pool or underwriting association as subrogation recoveries or otherwise up to the applicable limits of liability provided by the insurance policy issued by the insolvent insurer.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b405-5\"> <em>Accord Carrier v.
