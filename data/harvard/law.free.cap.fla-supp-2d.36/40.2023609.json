In <em>Thomas, </em>the Supreme Court of Florida ruled tht the issue of whether a daughter was guilty of \u201ca species of conversion or theft\u201d in taking the car keys and driving the car to the grocery store, as well as the issue of whether the father was negligent in leaving the keys on the dresser, arising under the dangerous instrumentality doctrine, were issues of fact to be resolved by the jury, thus precluding the entry of summary judgment. Following a non-jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>trial, the Court below, sitting as the trier of fact, resolved similar issues in Appellee\u2019s favor. The Court\u2019s findings and judgment are supported by competent, substantial evidence, and we are not prepared to disturb them. <em>Marrone v Miami National Bank, </em>507 So.2d 652 (Fla. 3d DCA 1987); <em>Randy International Ltd. v American Excess Corp., </em>501 So.2d 667 (Fla. 3d DCA 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
