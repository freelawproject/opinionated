The district court enhanced Millender\u2019s sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), because it found he had four qualifying predicate convictions. Mil-lender argues that in applying the ACCA, the district court erred by counting his 1992 conviction on two counts of aggravated battery as two separate prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination of whether two crimes constitute a single criminal episode or two separate felonies for purposes of section 924(e).\u201d <em>United States v. Spears, </em>443 F.3d 1358, 1360 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">\u201cUnder the ACCA, a defendant convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) is subject to \u00a7 924(e)(l)\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years if the defendant has \u2018three previous convictions ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Sneed, </em>600 F.3d 1326, 1329 (11th Cir.2010) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1)). While Millender argues the district court erred in counting the 1992 conviction as two separate prior convictions, both he and the Government recognize that Millender would have three qualifying predicate offenses under the ACCA, even if the district court had not committed the purported counting error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, the alleged error would have had no impact on Millender\u2019s substantive rights or the outcome of his sentencing proceedings. Accordingly, we conclude that any error in applying the ACCA was harmless and affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b818-10\">. Millender claims that one of the other predicate convictions is invalid but does not appear to have challenged that conviction here or in any other court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
