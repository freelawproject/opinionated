No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-22\">In his section 2254 petition, Coughlin argued, among other things, that his convictions for attempted first degree murder and attempted felony murder violated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause. The district court rejected this claim as barred by an independent and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>adequate state procedural default rule. We granted a certif\u00edcate of appealability on \u201c[wjhether the district court erred by finding that the state court\u2019s denial of Coughlin\u2019s double jeopardy claim rested on independent and adequate state procedural grounds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">Coughlin raised his double jeopardy claim for the first time in his motion to correct an illegal sentence, filed pursuant to Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.800(a). The first state court denied Coughlin\u2019s motion and the state appellate court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The appellate court affirmed the denial of Coughlin\u2019s Rule 3.800(a) motion <em>en banc; </em>the appellate court acted <em>en banc </em>expressly to recede from an earlier case, <em>Ross v. State, </em>760 So.2d 214 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2000), which had permitted a double jeopardy challenge to a conviction under Rule 3.800. <em>See Coughlin v. State, </em>932 So.2d 1224 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2006). As explained by the appellate court, Ross involved the misapplication of the holding of another case and directly conflicted with the established rule that challenges to convictions \u2014 as opposed to challenges to sentences \u2014 are not cognizable under Rule 3.800(a). <em>Coughlin, </em>932 So.2d at 1225-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Double jeopardy challenges to <em>convictions </em>are cognizable under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850; Rule 3.800 is limited to correction of illegal <em>sentences. Id. </em>at 1226. Again as explained by the appellate court <em>en banc, </em>to allow defendants to attack their convictions under Rule 3.800 \u2014 which attack can be made \u201cat any time\u201d \u2014 would allow defendants to circumvent the two-year time limitation for filing post-conviction motions under Rule 3.850. A double jeopardy claim is dependent on a challenge to the underlying conviction and is raised properly in a timely Rule 3.850 motion; but a Rule 3.850 motion by Coughlin would be proeedurally time-barred. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>a determination that a habeas claim was proeedurally defaulted. <em>Brownlee v. Haley, </em>306 F.3d 1043, 1058 (11th Cir.2002). For a state procedural ruling to preclude federal habeas review of a petitioner\u2019s claim, the state court\u2019s ruling must rest upon \u201cindependent and adequate\u201d state grounds. <em>Judd v. Haley, </em>250 F.3d 1308, 1313 (11th Cir.2001). In this case, that the state court\u2019s judgment was based on a procedural bar and that the state law ground was independent of the federal question is undisputed. Thus, the only issue on appeal is whether the state court\u2019s procedural bar provided an \u201cadequate\u201d state ground for denying relief. <em>See id. </em>A state procedural rule constitutes an adequate state ground when it is \u201cfirmly established and regularly followed\u201d and not \u201capplied in an arbitrary or unprecedented fashion.\u201d <em>Siebert v. Allen, </em>455 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Judd, </em>250 F.3d at 1313.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">Florida courts have routinely concluded that double jeopardy claims such as Coughlin\u2019s \u2014 where a defendant argues that he was subjected to multiple convictions for the same conduct \u2014 are not cognizable under Rule 3.800. See, e.g., <em>Henry v. State, </em>920 So.2d 1204, 1205 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2006); <em>Safrany v. State, </em>895 So.2d 1145, 1147 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2005); <em>Smith v. State, </em>886 So.2d 336, 337 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2004); <em>State v. Williams, </em>854 So.2d 215, 217 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2003); <em>Wiley v. State, </em>604 So.2d 6, 7 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1992); <em>Ferenc v. State, </em>563 So.2d 707, <em>707-08 </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1990). That the appellate court had issued a contrary decision in the Ross case does not significantly undermine a conclusion that the rule is firmly established. <em>See Dugger v. Adams, </em>489 U.S. 401, 109 S.Ct. 1211, 1217 n. 6, 103 L.Ed.2d 435 (1989) (concluding that a state procedural rule was applied \u201cconsistently and regularly\u201d when the state supreme court had applied the rule in \u201cthe vast majority of cases\u201d and when the few cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>petitioner cited were distinguishable). Nothing arbitrary has been shown here. As a result, because the state procedural rule constituted an adequate state ground for denying relief, Coughlin\u2019s double jeopardy claim was proeedurally defaulted. <em>See Siebert, </em>455 F.3d at 1271.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">To overcome procedural default, a petitioner must show adequate cause for and actual prejudice arising from the default, or that the failure to consider the claim would result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice. <em>Bailey v. Nagle, </em>172 F.3d 1299, 1306 (11th Cir.1999). Because Coughlin could have raised his double jeopardy claim in either his direct appeal or his Rule 3.850 motion \u2014 but did not \u2014 he failed to show cause for the default.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Nor has he made the \u201ccolorable showing of actual innocence\u201d required to establish a \u201cfundamental miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b814-15\"> Because no cause has been shown, we need not determine whether Coughlin was actually prejudiced by the default. See <em>Harmon v. Barton, </em>894 F.2d 1268, 1276 n. 14 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
