We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">The district court did not err when it denied Wilbur\u2019s motion to suppress. Because Deputy Russell Martin noticed that Wilbur\u2019s vehicle had \u201cextremely dark tinted windows,\u201d Martin was entitled to stop Wilbur to determine if his windows were darker than permitted under Florida law, Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 316.2953, 316.2954. <em>See United States v. Simmons, </em>172 F.3d 775, 778 (11th Cir.1999). After Martin stopped his vehicle, Wilbur appeared to be nervous and \u201coverly apologetic\u201d about the windows. Martin determined that the windows were too dark and requested Wilbur\u2019s driver\u2019s license to prepare a warning citation. When Deputy Gene Tolbert arrived as a backup officer, he recognized Wilbur\u2019s name as that of a local drug dealer. Without consulting Martin, Tolbert requested that a canine unit be sent to the scene. Wilbur argues that the officers prolonged the stop unreasonably, but the evidence established that the canine unit arrived within ten to fifteen minutes while Martin was completing a background search and writing the citation. <em>See Illinois v. Caballes, </em>543 U.S. 405, 409, 125 S.Ct. 834, 838, 160 L.Ed.2d 842 (2005); <em>see also United States v. Holloman, </em>113 F.3d 192, 196 (11th Cir.1997). The drug dog alerted to the presence of drugs in Wilbur\u2019s vehicle, which gave the officers probable cause to search the vehicle without a warrant, <em>United States v. Banks, </em>3 F.3d 399, 402 (11th Cir.1993), where they discovered in the center console of the vehicle a prescription bottle containing what appeared to be crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion when it denied Wilbur\u2019s request for a mistrial. Agent Ryan Johnson of the Drug Enforcement Administration, an expert witness regarding video enhancement and analysis, testified on cross-examination that a video recording of a undercover drug purchase made by a confidential informant that depicted a distinctive mark on the seller\u2019s arm and shoulder had the same shape and form as a tattoo depicted in a photograph of Wilbur taken after his arrest. Johnson\u2019s testimony was not \u201cso highly prejudicial as to be incurable.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez, </em>30 F.3d 1407, 1410 (11th Cir.1994). The district court twice instructed the jury to disregard Johnson\u2019s testimony, and we presume that the jury followed those instructions. <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>649 F.3d 1222, 1237 (11th Cir.2011). Our decision is \u201cfurther bolstered\u201d by the \u201csignificant evidence\u201d that identified Wilbur as the seller. <em>Perez, </em>30 F.3d at 1411. The confidential informant identified Wilbur unequivocally as the individual who sold the cocaine base, and the confidential informant testified that Wilbur stored the drugs inside a pill bottle that he kept in the center console of his car. Detective John Brush, who testified that he had known Wilbur for about 18 years, also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>identified Wilbur\u2019s voice on an audio recording of the drug sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">We AFFIRM Wilbur\u2019s convictions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
