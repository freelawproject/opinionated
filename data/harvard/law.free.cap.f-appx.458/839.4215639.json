No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-24\">The Mickens\u2019 section 1983 suit arose from a dispute over the title to real prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>erty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Miekens purchased an undeveloped piece of land and contracted with Allen Damron Construction Company (\u201cDamron Construction\u201d) to build a house on the property. As part of the process of obtaining a construction loan, the Miekens deeded the land temporarily to Damron Construction with the understanding that Damron Construction would transfer the house and the land back to them once the construction was complete. Stewart Title of Polk County, Inc. (\u201cStewart Title\u201d), Stewart Title Guaranty Company (\u201cStewart Guaranty\u201d), Edith Rewis, and Elaine Canady were responsible for preparing the quitclaim deed used to transfer the property and for conducting the loan closing. The Miekens later refused to close on the completed house because of disagreements over the quality and cost of the construction. These events led to three state court proceedings in which the state court ruled against the Miekens, including one in which the property was foreclosed upon.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">In their section 1988 complaint, the Miekens named these twelve defendants: the Tenth Judicial Circuit of Florida, the Florida District Court of Appeals, Allen Damron, Debra Damron, Damron Construction, Canady, Rewis, Stewart Title, Stewart Guaranty, the Polk County State Attorney, the Polk County Sheriff, and the Polk County Appraiser (\u201cDefendants\u201d). They alleged that Defendants conspired to deprive fraudulently the Miekens of their property, conspired to commit fraud upon the court, and conspired to deprive them of due process, equal protection, and freedom of speech. The Miekens sought to have their property returned, to be awarded money damages, and to have the state court proceedings declared a violation of their federal constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">The district court granted Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss and dismissed the Miekens\u2019 complaint with prejudice pursuant to the <em>Roolcer-Feldman </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court also concluded that the Polk County State Attorney and the judges of the Tenth Judicial Circuit of Florida and the Florida District Court of Appeals were entitled to absolute immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">On appeal, the Miekens repeat their substantive allegations against Defendants and argue that the <em>Roolcer-Feldman </em>doctrine is inapplicable to their case. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over a plaintiffs claim in the light of the <em>Roolcer-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>Nicholson v. Shafe, </em>558 F.3d 1266, 1270 (11th Cir.2009). In addition, we construe liberally <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">The <em>Roolcer-Feldman </em>doctrine precludes federal courts \u2014 other than the United States Supreme Court \u2014 from reviewing final judgments of state courts. <em>Casale v. Tillman, </em>558 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2009) (explaining that the doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>trine applies to federal claims previously raised and ruled on by a state court and to those claims \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with a state court\u2019s judgment). <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>bars lower federal-court jurisdiction in \u201ccases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1261 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">We conclude, as did the district court, that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>criteria are satisfied. The Mickens were state-court losers in all three state court proceedings. The state court judgments formed the basis of or were intertwined with the injuries complained of in the Mickens\u2019 instant complaint: that their loss of ownership and possession of their property, monetary damages, and emotional suffering were the result of fraudulent proceedings. And the state court proceedings had ended before the Mickens instituted the present federal lawsuit in the district court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Mickens also sought, in effect, to have the district court \u201creview and reject\u201d the state court proceedings because they wanted a declaration that the state court proceedings violated their federal constitutional rights. <em>See Casale, </em>558 F.3d at 1261.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Although the Mickens do not dispute that the state court proceedings ended before they filed their section 1983 complaint, they argue that the state court proceedings were based on \u201cfraud upon the court\u201d and, thus, that the judgments were not final for purposes of the <em>Rooker-Feld-man </em>doctrine. We reject this argument: nothing evidences that the state court judgments were the product of \u201cfraud upon the court.\u201d In fact, the only allegedly fraudulent act the Mickens identify in support of their argument is that the state court consolidated the three related lawsuits but issued three separate judgments against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">Because we agree with the district court that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine barred the Mickens\u2019 present claims, we need not address their remaining arguments about the district court\u2019s alternative grounds for dismissal. <em>See Casale, </em>558 F.3d at 1259 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b866-5\">.

Tenth Judicial Circuit, </em>181 Fed.Appx. 865 (11th Cir.2006) (dismissing an earlier, almost identical, complaint filed by the Miekens as barred in part by the <em>Roolcer-Feldman </em>doctrine).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b866-6\">.

In Case No.l998CA-002977, Stewart Guaranty successfully initiated a foreclosure action. In Case No.l998CA-001152, the Miekens sued Stewart Title, Canady, and Rewis, challenging the closing procedures of the construction loan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b866-12\"><em>.D.C.
