Petitioner appealed his convictions and sentences, but withdrew the appeal. On three occasions thereafter he attempted, but failed, to gain relief from his convictions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. After that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>he attempted to gain such relief via a petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. In his petition, he claimed that he is innocent of the crimes of which he was convicted \u2014 because of this court\u2019s decisions in <em>United States v. Salum, </em>257 Fed.Appx. 225 (11th Cir.2007), and <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>628 F.3d 1258 (11th Cir.2010) \u2014 and that he was entitled to use \u00a7 2255\u2019s \u201csavings clause\u201d to proceed under \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">The district court referred the petition to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation. The magistrate judge recommended that the district court deny the petition on the ground that Petitioner had not demonstrated eligibility for invoking the savings clause; specifically, he had not cited a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision supporting his claim. Record, Vol. 1, Tab 9 at 3. Petitioner objected to the magistrate\u2019s recommendation on the ground that our decision in <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236 (11th Cir.1999), authorized his invocation of the savings clause. The district court overruled his objection and, adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, denied relief. Record, Vol. 2, Tab 14 at 2. Petitioner moved the court to reconsider, and the court denied his motion. <em>Id. </em>Tab 19 at 2. Proceeding <em>pro se, </em>Petitioner now appeals the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Ordinarily, a federal prisoner must bring any collateral attack on his conviction or sentence under 28 U.S.C \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). However, under limited circumstances set forth in \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause, a federal prisoner may instead file a habeas petition under \u00a7 2241. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(a), 2255(e). This savings clause provides that relief under \u00a7 2241 is only available if the prisoner affirmatively shows that a \u00a7 2255 proceeding is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>McGhee v. Hanberry, </em>604 F.2d 9, 10 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">Where, as here, a prisoner has previously filed an unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his conviction, he generally may not file a second or successive motion unless and until we grant him authorization. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h); <em>United States v. Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d 1310, 1316 (11th Cir.2002). This restriction, standing alone, cannot render \u00a7 2255\u2019s remedy inadequate or ineffective under the savings clause in \u00a7 2255(e). <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1308 (11th Cir.2011) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1001, 181 L.Ed.2d 743 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">Rather, a prisoner meets this burden only where he shows that: (1) his current claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that decision established that the prisoner was convicted of a nonexistent offense; and (3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised at the prisoner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244; <em>but see Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d at 1319 (clarifying that the <em>Wofford </em>test was dicta). A prisoner must satisfy all three prongs of this test before we will consider the merits of his claim. <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-12\">Here, Petitioner failed to establish that the savings clause applies, in that he did not identify a relevant retroactively Supreme Court decision or show that this circuit\u2019s law squarely foreclosed his claim. Furthermore, he cannot use \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause merely to avoid the successive motion ban of \u00a7 2255(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-13\">The district court\u2019s decision is, accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b905-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
