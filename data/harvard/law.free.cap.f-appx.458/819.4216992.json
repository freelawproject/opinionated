The court denied their motion, concluding that the evidence, considered in the light most favorable to Gatling, established that the conduct Roland and Mincey engaged in violated clearly established Fourth Amendment rights of which a reasonable person would have known. <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Roland and Mincey now appeal the district court\u2019s qualified immunity ruling. We affirm. The court correctly held that the evidence considered in the light most favorable to Gatling<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> demonstrated that Roland and Mincey\u2019s conduct violated clearly established Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b846-12\">. The Fourth Amendment is applicable to the States under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b846-23\">. In considering the evidence in the light most favorable to Gatling, the <em>district </em>court properly eliminated, for summary judgment purposes, all factual disputes.'</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
