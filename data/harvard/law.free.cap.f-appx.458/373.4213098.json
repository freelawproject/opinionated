In the sole issue raised in this direct appeal, Martinez-Ran-gel challenges his sentence as being inappropriately imposed pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), which provides a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for offenses involving between 50 and 99 kilograms of marijuana, rather than \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D), which provides a maximum sentence of five years for offenses involving less than 50 kilograms of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Because this argument was not presented to the district court, it is reviewed for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Mondragoi'o-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). Martinez-Rangel has not met this standard. The jury, pursuant to the instructions provided at trial, found that Martinez-Rangel\u2019s offense involved more than 50 kilograms of marijuana. Consequently, the district court did not err by sentencing him under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>596 F.3d 236, 244 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2126, 176 L.Ed.2d 748 (2010). Insofar as Martinez-Rangel argues evidentiary sufficiency, or lack thereof, in his reply brief, we decline to consider this claim because it was not raised in his opening brief. <em>See United States v. Jimenez, </em>509 F.3d 682, 693 n. 10 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b400-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
