Pritchard raises six issues on appeal, arguing that the district court erred in: (1) denying his motion to suppress the firearm officers discovered during an unconstitutional traffic stop; (2) denying his motions for acquittal, even though \u00a7 922(g) was unconstitutional as applied to his conduct; (3) sentencing him as an armed career criminal under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e); (4) enhancing his sentence pursuant to the ACCA based on prior convictions that were neither alleged in the indictment nor found beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury; (5) sentencing him beyond the ACCA\u2019s 15-year minimum term of imprisonment; and (6) imposing a sentence that is substantively unreasonable. After review, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-13\">Pritchard claims the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the firearm discovered after Officer Robert McGinley of the West Palm Beach Police Department initiated a traffic stop of a car in which Pritchard was a passenger. During the stop, McGinley and a second officer, Micki Allen, asked Pritchard and the driver to exit the vehicle. Shortly thereafter, McGinley ordered Allen to search Pritchard, but before the search could take place, Pritchard dropped a gun from his waistband onto the ground. Pritchard argues the district court should have suppressed evidence of the gun because (1) McGinley lacked probable cause to stop the car, and (2) the officers searched Pritchard without having the requisite reasonable suspicion that he was armed and dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-14\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress as a mixed question of law and fact. <em>United States v. Spoerke, </em>568 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.2009). Rulings of law are reviewed <em>de novo, </em>while the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. <em>Id. </em>Factual findings are reviewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party in the district court. <em>Id. </em>We accord considerable deference to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations and accept its understanding of the facts, \u201cunless it is contrary to the laws of nature, or is so inconsistent or improbable on its face that no reasonable factfinder could accept it.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>389 F.3d 1359, 1366 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">The district court did not err in rejecting Pritchard\u2019s claim that the initial traffic stop was unconstitutional. Under the Fourth Amendment, a traffic stop is reasonable, and therefore constitutional, if the officer conducting the stop has probable cause to believe a traffic violation has occurred. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>526 F.3d 1334, 1337 (11th Cir.2008). In this case, after reviewing the evidence, the district court found credible McGinley\u2019s testimony that he initiated the traffic stop after observing the car run a stop sign. As a result, the district court ruled that the traffic stop was constitutional. Pritchard challenges only the district court\u2019s credibility determination, arguing that the totality of the circumstances casts some doubt on McGinley\u2019s account of the events.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Even if we were to accept Pritchard\u2019s characterization of the totality of the circumstances, however, Pritchard fails to argue, much less establish, that a reasonable factfinder could not accept McGinley\u2019s testimony as true based on the record. Accordingly, we accept the district court\u2019s credibility determination and find that the district court did not err in finding that McGinley had probable cause for the traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">Pritchard next argues that regardless of the constitutionality of the initial stop, the \u201cwarrantless search of [ JPritch-ard was in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Pritchard\u2019s argument, however, does not directly challenge any relevant factual or legal finding of the district court. In denying Pritchard\u2019s motion to suppress, the district court found that the officers \u201cacted reasonably in ordering the passenger to step out of the car and preparing to conduct a search of the \u2014 or at least the pat-down search of the passenger. It never came to that point because the gun \u2014 the defendant voluntarily dropped the gun in an effort to avoid detection.\u201d Stated differently, the district court found that Pritchard voluntarily dropped the gun before the officers reached the point of conducting a pat-down search of Pritchard. On appeal, Pritchard does not directly challenge this conclusion, apparently ignoring the district court\u2019s stated grounds for denying the motion to suppress. He instead argues only that the pat-down search, which undisputedly never occurred, was unconstitutional. Because Pritchard\u2019s position does not challenge any relevant district court finding, we find his argument unavailing and affirm the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">Pritchard argues that \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional as applied because his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>criminal conduct did not substantially affect interstate commerce. A constitutional challenge to \u00a7 922(g) is a question of law reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Scott, </em>263 F.3d 1270, 1271 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">We have held that \u00a7 922(g) is not unconstitutional as applied to a defendant, where the \u201cgovernment demonstrated that the firearm in question had traveled in interstate commerce.\u201d <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>635 F.3d 1181, 1189 (11th Cir.2011) (quotation omitted). Here, Pritch-ard concedes that the Government presented evidence that the firearm at issue had traveled in interstate commerce and acknowledges that his argument is at odds with this Court\u2019s binding precedent. Accordingly, we find the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 922(g) was not unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Pritchard argues the district court committed four reversible errors in imposing his 240-month sentence. He first contends that the district court erred in sentencing him as an armed career criminal under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) because his two prior convictions for resisting arrest with violence, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01, do not qualify as predicate violent felony offenses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Our precedent, however, forecloses this argument. <em>See United States v. Nix, </em>628 F.3d 1341, 1342 (11th Cir.2010) (holding that a conviction for a violating Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01 constitutes a violent felony under the ACCA). We reject Pritchard\u2019s argument that the law of this Circuit is inconsistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">Pritchard also argues that the district court improperly relied on prior convictions&amp;emdash;that were neither alleged in the indictment nor found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt&amp;emdash;to enhance his sentence pursuant to the ACCA. The Supreme Court has held that prior convictions \u201crelevant only to the sentencing of an offender found guilty of the charged crime\u201d do not need to be charged in an indictment or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 228-35, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Accordingly, the district court did not err in enhancing Pritchard\u2019s sentence based on the prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">Pritchard next argues that because \u00a7 924(e) does not provide for a maximum penalty, he cannot be sentenced beyond the 15-year minimum term of imprisonment provided by the statute. This Court, however, has explicitly rejected this argument and has held that \u201cthe maximum penalty, for convictions covered by the \u00a7 924(e) sentencing enhancement []is life imprisonment.\u201d <em>United States v. Rozier, </em>598 F.3d 768, 772 (11th Cir.2010) (citation omitted). Pritchard\u2019s contention thus fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-12\">Finally, Pritchard argues that his 240-month term of imprisonment is substantively unreasonable because (1) the district court simply presumed, without considering relevant sentencing factors, that a sentence within the guidelines range was appropriate<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (2) the sentence im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>posed is greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Pritchard\u2019s argument that the district court impermissibly assumed that a sentence within the guidelines range would be reasonable is based entirely on the fact that during sentencing, the district court judge stated, \u201cI do think a sentence within the advisory guidelines is adequate and reasonable.\u201d This statement, even removed from its context, does not establish that the district court failed to consider \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s sentencing factors. Moreover, the record shows that as part of the same colloquy, the district court explicitly referred to, and considered, \u201cthe seriousness of the crime, the characteristics of the offender, and the need to protect the public from further crime.\u201d As a result, we find that the district court did not imper-missibly assume the reasonableness of the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\">Pritchard\u2019s argument that the district court imposed a substantively unreasonable sentence also fails. A sentence is substantively unreasonable if, based on the totality of the circumstances, the district court committed a \u201cclear error of judgment\u201d in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189-90 (11th Cir.2010). The party challenging the sentence has the burden of establishing that the sentence was unreasonable. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010). Although we do not automatically presume the reasonableness of a sentence, \u201cwe ordinarily ... expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). Here, the 240-month sentence represented the low end of the guideline range, and Pritchard presents nothing in the record indicating that the district court committed a \u201cclear error of judgment.\u201d We thus find that the district court did not impose a substantively unreasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b875-6\">. Pritchard cites the following facts as discrediting McGinley\u2019s testimony: (1) the traffic stop took place in an area McGinley described as known for high crime and gun violence; (2) the two individuals in the car were African-American males; (3) McGinley was unsure of exactly where \u2014 in relation to the stop sign at the particular intersection \u2014 the car transporting Pritchard should have come to a full stop under Florida law; (4) McGinley and Allen did not cite the driver for failing to stop.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b876-7\">.Whether a prior conviction is a violent felony for purposes of the ACCA is a question of law reviewed <em>de novo.
