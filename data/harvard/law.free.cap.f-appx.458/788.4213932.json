IV. Within the limitations im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>posed by the Fourth Amendment, a police officer \u201cmay stop a vehicle when there is probable cause to believe that the driver is violating [an] applicable traffic [or] equipment regulation[ ] relating to the operation of motor vehicles.\u201d <em>United States v. Spoerke, </em>568 F.3d 1236, 1248 (11th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Here, Smalls contends that McNamara lacked probable cause to stop him for a violation of the statute because there was no specific testimony at the suppression hearing that Officer McNamara was located more than one-hundred feet away when he heard the sound emitted from Smalls\u2019 vehicle. However, even if Officer McNamara was positioned more than one-hundred feet away, \u201c[a] traffic stop based on an officer\u2019s incorrect but reasonable assessment of facts does not violate the Fourth Amendment\u201d provided that the \u201cmistake of fact was reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Chanthasouxat, </em>342 F.3d 1271, 1276 (11th Cir.2003). Officer McNamara testified at the suppression hearing that he heard a loud \u201cthumping\u201d sound coming from the radio in Smalls\u2019 automobile when Officer McNamara was located one block away from Smalls, and that he heard the automobile before he saw it. A reasonable officer in Officer McNamara\u2019s position could have believed that the music was audible more than one-hundred feet away on the basis of these observations. Because any mistake of fact by Officer McNamara in evaluating his distance from Smalls\u2019 car was thus a reasonable one, he did not violate the Fourth Amendment when he stopped Smalls for violation of the noise statute. <em>See Illinois v. Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. 177, 185, 110 S.Ct. 2793, 111 L.Ed.2d 148 (1990) (\u201cWhat is generally demanded of the many factual determinations that must regularly be made by agents of the government ... is not that they always be correct, but that they always be reasonable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">In challenging his sentence, Smalls argues that the district court erred in applying a four-level enhancement for use or possession of a firearm \u201cin connection with another felony offense,\u201d <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) (2010), based upon its finding that, at the time of his arrest, Smalls was involved in committing the felony offense of possessing marijuana with intent to distribute it, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1)-(b)(1)(D).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Smalls argues this was erroneous because, he asserts, the evidence was more consistent with personal use of marijuana than with distribution of it. We review the district court\u2019s findings for clear error, <em>see United States v. Bias, </em>360 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2004), and we may reverse only if \u201cafter reviewing all of the evidence,\u201d we are left with \u201ca definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>363 F.3d 1134, 1137 (11th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). Having reviewed all of the evidence to which the parties refer us,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we find no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>clear error in the district court\u2019s determination that Smalls was engaged in distributing marijuana at the time of his possession of the handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Finally, Smalls contends that the district court erred in denying him credit for acceptance of responsibility in computing his offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) (2010). \u201cThe district court\u2019s determination of whether a defendant is entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility is a finding of fact that is entitled to great deference on appeal and will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Caraballo, </em>595 F.3d 1214, 1233 (11th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the district court denied Smalls a reduction for acceptance of responsibility because Smalls tested positive for cocaine usage during his pre-trial release. <em>See United States v. Pace, </em>17 F.3d 341, 343 (11th Cir.1994) (affirming district court\u2019s finding that defendant\u2019s illegal drug use while on pre-trial release was inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility). Although Smalls produced the results of a drug test administered by a private lab in which he tested negative, the district court credited the government\u2019s test because it was conducted by a lab that is certified by the government and that takes precautions to prevent a false positive result. The district court\u2019s decision to credit the positive test result was not clearly erroneous on its face, and Smalls points us to no additional evidence that calls the district court\u2019s finding into question.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b815-9\">. Officer McNamara testified that he stopped Smalls to enforce both the statute and a local ordinance prohibiting loud music from a motor vehicle, however, because the government relies on the statute and does not specify what ordinance McNamara was enforcing, we address McNamara's authority to effectuate the stop for a violation of the statute only.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b816-5\">. This finding does not give rise to an <em>Appren-di </em>violation because the sentence imposed was within the ten-year statutory maximum punishment for violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), to which Smalls pled guilty. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2); <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 303, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) (\"[T]he \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b816-9\">. The district court\u2019s finding was based on testimony at the sentencing hearing and information in Smalls' presentencing report which showed that, at the time of his offense, Smalls was in possession of seventy-one grams of marijuana, drug paraphernalia, and numerous small baggies that the court found are typically used to distribute marijuana, and that Smalls had a prior record of conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>for a drug-distribution offense. Although Smalls argues that some of this evidence was consistent with personal use, that Smalls may have used some of the marijuana himself does not necessarily negate that he also distributed it, and therefore this assertion alone does not render the district court's finding clearly erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
