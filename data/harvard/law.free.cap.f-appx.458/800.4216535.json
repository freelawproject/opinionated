Tambi filed her second motion to reopen,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seeking the reopening of her prior application for asylum on the basis of changed country conditions and on the basis that she received ineffective assistance of counsel. This motion was filed with the BIA over ten years after the original IJ decision denying her asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">Generally, an alien may file only one motion to reopen before the BIA and such motion must be filed within ninety days of the final removal order. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). It is not disputed that Tambi\u2019s second motion to reopen fails to meet either of these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-15\">There are, however, several exceptions to the one motion and ninety days time limit. <em>See generally </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C), (c)(7)(C); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a), (c)(3). Pertinent to this appeal, an alien may seek reopening at any time and without regard to any prior motions to reopen, if she can demonstrate \u201cchanged country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); <em>see also </em>8 <em>G.F.R. \u00a7 </em>1003.2(e)(3)(ii). Tambi sought reopening of her previous asylum application claiming that the conditions in her home country of Cameroon had worsened. She also sought reopening on the basis of her previous attorney\u2019s ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-16\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005); <em>see also Kucana v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014 - \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 827, 838-39, 175 L.Ed.2d 694 (2010). When reviewing the denial of discretionary relief, we consider whether there has been an exercise of discretion and whether that exercise was \u201carbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Abdi, </em>430 F.3d at 1149.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-19\">The BIA provided several reasons for denying reopening, which Tambi challenges in this petition for review as follows. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>Tambi first argues that the BIA improperly penalized her for not filing a subsequent asylum application with her second motion to reopen. Although the BIA mentioned that Tambi failed to submit a new asylum application with her motion to reopen, this was not the BIA\u2019s basis for denying her motion to reopen. Instead the BIA listed all of the evidence that Tambi submitted and determined that it either had been available at the time of her first hearing or did not demonstrate that conditions in Cameroon had materially worsened since her original hearing. Tambi does not challenge any of these conclusions of the BIA in this petition. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the BIA\u2019s mention that Tambi did not submit a new asylum application with her second motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Next, Tambi argues that the BIA gave undue weight to the IJ\u2019s adverse-credibility decision made during her original asylum proceedings. As already mentioned, in denying Tambi\u2019s second motion to reopen, the BIA discussed Tambi\u2019s evidence regarding changed country conditions and concluded that Tambi failed to establish that conditions in Cameroon were worse than when she first sought asylum nearly ten years earlier. Although the BIA took into consideration the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination at the earlier hearing, the BIA ultimately denied the motion to reopen based on the lack of evidence to support changed country conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">Third, Tambi argues that due process requires reopening of her asylum application because her previous attorneys provided ineffective assistance of counsel. The BIA declined to reopen her application on this basis, concluding that she failed to meet the threshold requirements for such a claim as established in <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Tambi does not challenge the BIA\u2019s conclusion regarding her failure to meet the requirements of <em>Matter of Lozada </em>and we cannot say that the BIA abused its discretion in refusing to reopen her asylum application on this basis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>Finally, Tambi asserts that she has a strong case for the exercise of prosecuto-rial discretion under guidelines established by a new a working group of the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice. Tambi has provided no authority, nor are we aware of any, that would permit a court of appeals to grant such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b828-11\">. Tambi filed her first motion to reopen several years earlier on the basis of her marriage to a United States citizen, which was eventually denied by the BIA, and is not at issue in this petition for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b829-6\">. Although the governing regulations provide that an application for relief must accompany the motion to the extent that the motion to reopen is seeking to submit an application for relief, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1), the statute only requires that the motion to reopen be supported by affidavits and other evidence, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(B). Here, we would be inclined to agree with Tambi that because the purpose of her motion to reopen was to supplement an existing asylum application based on changed country conditions, she would not be required to submit an entirely new asylum application. The BIA, however, did not deny her request to reopen because she did not include a new asylum application with her motion, but instead because it concluded that she failed to meet the requirements for reopening based on changed country conditions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b829-7\">. When filing a motion based on ineffective assistance, the BIA has established the following procedural requirements: (1) the claim should be supported by an affidavit that sets forth in detail the agreement with counsel regarding the actions to be taken, and any representations made by counsel with regard to those actions; (2) former counsel must be informed of the allegations and permitted an opportunity to respond; and (3) the motion should reflect whether a grievance was filed against counsel, and if not, why not. <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 639. Our circuit has held that the <em>Lozada </em>procedural requirements are reasonable, and that, at a minimum, \"substantial, if not exact, compliance\u201d with <em>Lozada </em>is required. <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>371 F.3d 771, 775 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b829-11\">.Tambi urges us to reconsider our decision in <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149-50 (11th Cir.2005), to the extent that we stated that the ninety day motion to reopen period is \"mandatory and jurisdictional,\u201d and thus not subject to equitable tolling. Although the BIA cited to <em>Abdi </em>in denying Tam-bi\u2019s request to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the BIA primarily and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>properly noted that Tambi failed to comply with the requirements of <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>which we cannot say is an abuse of discretion. We, therefore, need not address whether the statement in <em>Abdi </em>that the ninety day motion to reopen is \"mandatory and jurisdictional\u201d is dicta or binding circuit precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
