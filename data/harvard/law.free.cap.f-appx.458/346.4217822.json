He asserts that the underlying removal order was defective because his waiver of counsel during the removal proceeding was unknowing and involuntary, he was denied the right to appointed counsel, his waiver of appeal was unknowing and involuntary, and the immigration judge failed to rule on his request for pre-conclusion voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-21\">Requena Vasquez fails to show a reasonable likelihood that, but for the alleged defects in the removal proceeding, he would not have been removed. <em>See United States v. Estrada-Trochez, </em>66 F.3d 733, 735 (5th Cir.1995); <em>see also United States v. Villanueva-Diaz, </em>634 F.3d 844, 852 (5th Cir.2011) (stating that speculation that an alien would not have been removed is not sufficient). Because he does not establish the required element of prejudice, Reque-na Vasquez\u2019s challenge to the indictment fails. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Ortiz, </em>313 F.3d 225, 229 (5th Cir.2002); \u00a7 1326(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-23\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b372-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
