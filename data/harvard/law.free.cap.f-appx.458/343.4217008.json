Day, federal prisoner #43134-018, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenging his conviction and sentence for conspiracy to commit mail fraud and mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371 and 1341. Day contends that his \u00a7 2241 petition falls within the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-22\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition de novo. <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000). \u201cA section 2241 petition that seeks to challenge the validity of a federal sentence must either be dismissed or construed as a section 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452. \u201cSection 2255 contains a \u2018savings clause,\u2019 which acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>as a limited exception to this general rule.\u201d <em>Id.-, </em>\u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Day contends that the district court increased his sentence based on conduct that was not charged in the indictment nor found beyond a reasonable doubt such as the actual loss amount and number of victims. Because Day sought to attack the manner in which his sentence was initially determined, he had to meet the requirements of the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) to raise his claims in a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000). Day had to show that his claims were \u201c(i) \u2022 \u2022. based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that [he] ... may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in [his] ... trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Day\u2019s argument that the savings clause applies in light of <em>DePierre v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2225, 180 L.Ed.2d 114 (2011), and <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2169, 176 L.Ed.2d 979 (2010), is raised for the first time on appeal and will not be considered. <em>See Wilson v. Roy, </em>643 F.3d 433, 435 n. 1 (5th Cir.2011). Even if we considered this argument, neither of these cases decriminalized any of the conduct for which he was convicted. <em>See DePierre, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2237 (holding that the term \u201ccocaine base\u201d in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1) refers to cocaine in its chemically basic form, which includes but is not limited to \u201ccrack cocaine\u201d); <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2180 (holding that whether a firearm is a machinegun is an element of the offense in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(B)(ii)). Therefore, the savings clause was not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b369-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
