Wilkinson was the attorney for the Madison family in a Texas state court suit, in which the jury found Williamson negligent for having molested Megan Madison.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury awarded the Madisons approximately $4.75 million. Wilkinson, as as-signee of the right, title, and interest of Williamson and of judgment creditors of Williamson, then sued State Farm for its alleged failure to indemnify Williamson, seeking to use the negligence judgment as offensive collateral estoppel against State Farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The relevant portions of Williamson\u2019s State Farm policy (\u201cthe Policy\u201d) state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">If a claim is made or a suit is brought against an insured [Williamson] for damages because of bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence to which this coverage applies, we [State Farm] will:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">1. Pay up to our limit of liability for the damages for which the insured is legally liable. Damages include prejudgment interest awarded against the insured; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">2. Provide a defense at our expense by counsel of our choice even if the suit is groundless, false or fraudulent. We may investigate and settle any claim or suit that we decide is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">The Policy defines \u201cbodily injury\u201d as meaning \u201cbodily harm, sickness or disease. This includes required care, loss of services and death that results.\u201d It defines \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201can accident, including exposure to conditions, which results in bodily injury or property damage during the policy period.\u201d The \u201cExclusions\u201d section of the Policy states: \u201cCoverage C (Personal Liability) and Coverage D (Medical Payments to Others) do not apply to ... [b]odily injury or property damage which is caused intentionally by or at the direction of the insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">The district court granted summary judgment for State Farm. It held that molestation could not be covered under the Policy as it is an intentional act. The second basis that Wilkinson argued that justified indemnity was Williamson\u2019s \u201cstreet driving.\u201d As a part of Williamson\u2019s <em>nolo contendere </em>plea in his associated criminal case, Williamson was not allowed to drive on Megan\u2019s street, but he did so often in order to get to his former house on the same street. The district court held that \u201cstreet driving\u201d was also not covered by the Policy because it was (1) intentional and (2) did not cause \u201cbodily injury,\u201d only psychoemotional injury. On appeal, Wilkinson is only arguing that the decision with respect to the \u201cstreet driving\u201d was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, taking the facts in the light most favorable to the non-movant. <em>Hernandez v. Yellow Transp., Inc., </em>641 F.3d 118, 124 (5th Cir.2011). We can affirm a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on any basis established by the record. <em>Id. </em>at 130. Under Texas law, \u201cthe duty to indemnify is determined from the actual underlying facts which result in liability of the insured.\u201d <em>J.E.M. v. Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number><em>N.Y., </em>928 S.W.2d 668, 673 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1996, no writ); <em>see also D.R. Horton-Tex., Ltd. v. Market Int'l Ins. Co., Ltd., </em>300 S.W.3d 740, 743 (Tex.2009). In interpreting insurance policies, Texas courts give the terms used \u201ctheir plain, ordinary meaning unless the policy itself shows that the parties intended the terms to have a different, technical meaning.\u201d <em>Am. Nat\u2019l Gen. Ins. Co. v. Ryan, </em>274 F.3d 319, 323 (5th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Puckett v. U.S. Fire Ins. Co., </em>678 S.W.2d 936, 938 (Tex.1984)). When a term is defined in the policy, that definition controls. <em>Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Knott, </em>128 S.W.3d 211, 219 (Tex.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The Policy states that it only covers damages caused by \u201can occurrence,\u201d which it defines as \u201can accident.\u201d The plain meaning of the term \u201caccident\u201d does not encompass Williamson\u2019s conduct here. Texas caselaw confirms this. \u201cAn accident is generally understood to be a fortuitous, unexpected and unintended event,\u201d occurring \u201cas the culmination of forces working without design, coordination, or plan.\u201d <em>Lamar Homes, Inc. v. Mid-Continent Cas. Co., </em>242 S.W.3d 1, 8 (Tex.2007) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The record reveals that Williamson deliberately chose to drive down the street past Megan\u2019s house. A deliberate act can be an accident if the effect is unexpected. <em>Id. </em>at 8. Harm to a molester\u2019s victim when he deliberately chooses to be present in a place where he has agreed, by the terms of his plea, not to be is \u201cthe natural and expected result ... that is, [harm to Megan] was highly probable whether the insured was negligent or not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9. This was not \u201can accident\u201d and therefore, was not \u201can occurrence.\u201d Thus, Williamson was not covered, and Wilkinson cannot collect. Summary judgment was appropriately granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
