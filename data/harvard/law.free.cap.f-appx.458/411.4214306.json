Strother, </em>387 Fed.Appx. 508 (5th Cir.2010) (affirming conviction). Strother has appealed the district court\u2019s order dismissing his application for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, in which Strother contended that the trial court in his criminal case lacked jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-22\">Strother has moved for leave to file a supplemental brief. The motion is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-23\">Strother has failed to brief the district court\u2019s principal holding that his jurisdictional challenge could not be asserted in a \u00a7 2241 application. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987) (appellant\u2019s failure to challenge the district court\u2019s legal analysis or its application in his case, \u201c[i]n practical effect, ... is the same as if he had not appealed that judgment.\u201d); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993) (issues not briefed adequately are waived); <em>see also Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877-78 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-24\">The appeal is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. We CAUTION Strother that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>filing of frivolous appeals and other pleadings will invite the imposition of a sanction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b437-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
