United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2896, 2907, 177 L.Ed.2d 619 (2010). The district court dismissed the petition on grounds that Bell failed to satisfy the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-25\">Under \u00a7 2241, we review factual findings for clear error and conclusions of law de novo. <em>Christopher v. Miles, </em>342 F.3d 378, 381 (5th Cir.2003). This court may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on any basis supported by the record. <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-26\">A \u00a7 2241 petition that attacks custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence may be entertained under the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255 if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of his detention. <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 878 (5th Cir.2000); <em>see also Christopher v. Miles, </em>342 F.3d 378, 381-82 (5th Cir.2003). The savings clause is applicable only to a claim that (i) \u201cis based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and that (ii) \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). The petitioner bears the \u201cstringent\u201d bur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>den of affirmatively showing that the \u00a7 2255 remedy is inadequate or ineffective and that she is entitled to avail herself of the \u201climited exception\u201d found in the savings clause. <em>Christopher, </em>342 F.3d at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Bell has not made such a showing. She attempts to establish that <em>Skilling </em>renders her actually innocent of her conviction for health care fraud because it was predicated on a scheme to deprive Medicare and Medicaid of the right to honest services, as compared to money. However, the trial court did not find, as Bell claims, that the Government failed to prove any economic loss. To the contrary, the trial court explicitly found that \u201cthere [was] a monetary loss in this case.\u201d <em>See United States v. Bell, </em>282 Fed.Appx. 184, 187 (3d Cir.2008) (rejecting Bell\u2019s sufficiency of the evidence challenge and observing that records were falsified to maintain the \u201cflow of government money\u201d). Additionally, even if the reference to honest services in the jury instructions is constitutional error after <em>Skilling, </em>the indictment contained sufficient charges for which Bell could have been convicted of \u201cobtaining], by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, ... money,\u201d as she was charged with health care fraud in executing and attempting to execute both a scheme or artifice to defraud Medicare and Medicaid and a scheme or artifice to obtain money under the control of Medicare and Medicaid. <em>See Christopher, </em>342 F.3d at 383; \u00a7 1347; <em>see also United States v. Skilling, </em>638 F.3d 480, 481 (5th Cir.2011) (on remand) (\u201c[A]n alternative-theory error ... is subject to harmless-error analysis so long as the error at issue does not categorically vitiate <em>all </em>the jury\u2019s findings.\u201d) (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citation omitted), <em>pet. for cert. filed </em>(Nov. 28, 2011) (No. 11-674). <em>Skilling </em>does not establish that Bell\u2019s convictions are for nonexistent offenses. Consequently, we do need reach the questions whether <em>Skilling </em>is retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review or whether Bell\u2019s purported claim was previously foreclosed by circuit precedent because Bell cannot meet her burden regardless. <em>See Christopher, </em>342 F.3d at 382; <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b387-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
