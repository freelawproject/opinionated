Dunn was sentenced to 76 months\u2019 imprisonment for each of Counts One and Three, to be served concurrently, and 84 months\u2019 imprisonment for Count Two, to be served consecutively.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-20\">We evaluate the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We first examine whether the district court committed a significant procedural error, such as calculating improperly the guidelines range, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>sentencing factors, basing the sentence on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to explain adequately the sentence. <em>Id. </em>After we have determined that a sentence is procedurally sound, we review the sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>A sentence substantively is unreasonable if it \u201cfails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 8553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both the record and the section 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>Under section 3553(a), a district court should consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for the sentence to provide adequate deterrence, respect for the law, and protection of the public, provision for the medical and educational needs of the defendant, policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">We conclude that Dunn\u2019s sentences were procedurally reasonable. The district court calculated properly the guideline range and based the sentences on undisputed facts set forth in the Presen-tence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d). The record also shows that the district court considered Dunn\u2019s motion for a downward variance based on his mental retardation and depression. The court found these arguments unpersuasive, given Dunn\u2019s extensive criminal history and the need to protect the public. After considering Dunn\u2019s arguments, the court expressly stated that it considered the advisory sentencing guidelines and the section 3553(a) factors in determining Dunn\u2019s sentences. This explanation was sufficient to satisfy the procedural requirements. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">Dunn\u2019s sentences were also substantively reasonable. His 76-month sentences were within the applicable guidelines range of 70 to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment, and we ordinarily expect such sentences to be reasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 788. The sentences were also well below the statutory maximum sentences of 15-years\u2019 and 10-years\u2019 imprisonment for Counts One and Three, respectively. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(a)(2), 2119; <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (concluding that a sentence was reasonable in part because it was well below the statutory maximum).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">The sentences also met the goals encompassed within section 3553(a). According to the PSI, Dunn\u2019s first encounter with law enforcement was at the age of 9-years old and, by the time he turned 23, he had 10 juvenile convictions (for trespass, grand theft, and criminal mischief) and 7 adult convictions (for grand theft, petit theft, robbery, battery on a law enforcement officer, and resisting arrest with and without violence). He also had 23 other arrests. Given Dunn\u2019s extensive criminal record, sentences within the guideline range seem needed to promote respect for the law, to provide just punishment, to deter him from further criminal activity, and to protect the public from future crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">Dunn argues that the PSI exaggerated the extent of his criminal history by listing each count as a separate paragraph instead of grouping counts by criminal episode. Because Dunn did not object to this alleged error in district court, we review this issue only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Even when Dunn\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>counts are grouped together, however, the PSI still demonstrates that he had 11 distinct criminal proceedings \u2014 7 as a juvenile and 4 as an adult \u2014 and 14 other arrests. Thus, we are unconvinced that the district court plainly erred in describing Dunn\u2019s criminal history as extensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Dunn also argues that the district court erred in failing to recognize the causal link between his mental retardation and his criminal past and in placing disproportionate weight on the need to protect the public.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The weight to be given a particular section 3553(a) factor is left to the sound discretion of the district court. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008). We will not reverse unless we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">We are not convinced that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the relevant statutory factors. The district court considered expressly Dunn\u2019s arguments about his mental and psychological health and indicated that \u2014 but for Dunn\u2019s mental condition\u2014 the court would have sentenced Dunn to the maximum punishment. It was within the district court\u2019s discretion to weigh Dunn\u2019s mitigating evidence against other factors, such as his criminal history and the need to protect the public from future crimes. Because the court did not \u201cfocus single-mindedly\u201d on one section 3553(a) factor to the detriment of the other factors, we see no abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Crisp, </em>454 F.3d 1285, 1292 (11th Cir.2006) (concluding that a sentence was unreasonable when the district court \u201cfocused single-mindedly on the goal of restitution to the detriment of all of the other sentencing factors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b832-6\">.

On appeal, Dunn fails to specify which portion of his sentence he is challenging. Because he concedes that his 84-month sentence for Count Two represents the mandatory statutory minimum sentence for his offense, we will assume that Dunn\u2019s appeal challenges only the concurrent 76-month sentences for Counts One and Three. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>his substantial rights, and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b833-24\">.
