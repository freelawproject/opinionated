He challenges his 360-month sentence, which the district court imposed following a limited remand from this Court. Irey contends that, despite this Court\u2019s limited remand directing the district court to impose a 360-month sentence, the district court was required to consider evidence of his conduct since he has been in prison. He appeals the district court\u2019s judgment imposing the sentence and its order denying his motion to vacate that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">The facts underlying Irey\u2019s criminal conduct are detailed in <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.Bd 1160, 1166-68 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc), </em>which summed up those facts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-6\">It is difficult to find a case involving sexual abuse of children that compares to this one. The number of Irey\u2019s victims (at least 50), the very young age (four, five, and six years old) of some of them, the extreme nature of the abuse and torture that he inflicted on them, the number of years it went on (four or five), and the massive amount of graphic child pornography that he single-hand-edly produced and distributed (at least 1,200 photographs or videos showing Irey himself sexually abusing the children) combine to make his criminal behavior the worst of the worst.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1219-20. The district court initially sentenced Irey to 210 months, which was a substantial downward deviation from the 360-month sentence recommended by the sentencing guidelines. <em>See id. </em>at 1180. The government appealed and this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>held that the downward variance was substantively unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 1222. We concluded that no downward variance would be reasonable in Irey\u2019s case, and \u201c[n]othing less than the advisory guidelines sentence of 30 years, which is the maximum available, will serve the sentencing purposes set out in [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-8\">We explained:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-9\">This is one of those unusual cases where the top and bottom of the guidelines range are the same; both are 30 years. There can be no upward variance because the statutory maximum is also 30 years. As a result, our holding that no downward variance is reasonable under the totality of the facts and circumstances of this case means that on remand the sentence must be 30 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AmN\"><em>Id. </em>at 1224. Accordingly, we issued a very limited remand: \u201cBecause we have determined that a downward deviation from the guidelines range in this case is unreasonable, it follows that the only action on remand that will be consistent with this opinion is resentencing within the guidelines range, which necessarily means a sentence of 30 years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1224-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">The Supreme Court denied Irey\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. <em>Irey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011). After that the district court issued a judgment that followed this Court\u2019s limited mandate and resentenced Irey to 360 months (30 years). Irey then moved the district court to vacate that judgment, arguing that it should have permitted him to present evidence of his post-sentencing rehabilitation based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pepper v. United States, </em>562 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1229, 179 L.Ed.2d 196 (2011), which was issued after our <em>en banc </em>decision in this case. The district court denied Irey\u2019s motion, finding that <em>Pepper </em>did not apply because our mandate limited the remand to having that court impose a 30-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-15\">Irey appealed, raising one issue: whether the district court erred by resentencing him to 30 years of imprisonment without considering evidence of his post-sentencing conduct. The crux of his argument is that <em>Pepper </em>was an intervening change in controlling law that required the district court to consider his post-sentencing conduct notwithstanding our limited mandate that only a 30-year sentence would be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-17\">A district court acting on remand cannot vary or examine our mandate \u201cfor any other purpose than execution; or give any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>other or further relief; or review it, even for apparent error, upon a matter decided on appeal; or intermeddle with it, further than to settle so much as has been remanded.\u201d <em>United States v. Tamayo, </em>80 F.3d 1514, 1520 (11th Cir.1996) (quotation marks omitted). When we issue a limited mandate, \u201cthe trial court is restricted in the range of issues it may consider on remand.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>329 F.3d 1250, 1252 (11th Cir.2003). Ruling on matters outside of the scope of a limited mandate constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>Tamayo, </em>80 F.3d at 1520.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">The mandate rule has three exceptions: (1) a later trial produces substantially new evidence; (2) there is a change in controlling legal authority; or (3) a clear error in the earlier appellate decision would work manifest injustice. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 830 (11th Cir.2007). Irey argues that the second exception to the mandate rule applies here. The Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Pepper </em>decision, however, was not an intervening change in controlling law that required or permitted the district court to deviate from this Court\u2019s mandate in order to consider Irey\u2019s post-conviction conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\"><em>Pepper </em>held that when a defendant\u2019s sentence has been set aside on appeal, a district court <em>\u201cmay </em>consider evidence of a defendant\u2019s post-sentencing rehabilitation at resentencing and such evidence <em>may, </em>in appropriate cases, support a downward variance from the advisory Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Pepper, </em>562 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 1249 (emphasis added). The Court expressly stated, however, that it did not \u201cmean to preclude courts of appeals from issuing limited remand orders, in appropriate cases, that may render evidence of post-sentencing rehabilitation irrelevant in light of the narrow purposes of the remand proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1249 n. 17. Irey\u2019s case is one of those for which our limited remand order rendered evidence of post-sentencing rehabilitation irrelevant in light of the narrow purposes of the remand proceeding. The district court followed our limited remand order as it was required to do.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b882-8\">. We do not mean to imply that the ultimate sentence imposed on Irey might have been lower as a result of <em>Pepper </em>if our remand had not been limited. Given the extraordinary facts of his crime, which were discussed at length in our opinion, <em>see Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1166-68, 1176-77, 1206-09, 1219-25, no sentence less than 30 years would be reasonable regardless of his post-sentencing rehabilitation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
