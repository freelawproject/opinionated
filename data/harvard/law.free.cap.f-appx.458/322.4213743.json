Luckey (\u201cLuckey\u201d) appeals the denial of social se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>curity disability benefits by the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration (\u201cCommissioner\u201d)- Luckey sought review of the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). The district court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s final administrative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Because we find that the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) applied the correct legal standards and issued an opinion supported by substantial evidence of record, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Luckey worked as an outside machinist/millwright in the petrochemical industry for almost 31 years. He was first hired in October 1967, the year he graduated from high school, and he worked at the same job until August 1, 1998. Based on his work history, Luckey was insured until December 31, 2008, his date last insured for purposes of social security disability benefits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Luckey filed his current application for benefits on September 8, 2004. He claimed that his disability due to high blood pressure, diabetes, degenerative bone disease, and herniated discs began on October 1, 2002. He later amended his disability onset date to January 23, 2003. His application was denied at the initial and reconsideration levels, after which Luckey sought a hearing before an ALJ. The ALJ issued an unfavorable decision on July 28, 2006, and Luckey filed for judicial review of the ALJ\u2019s decision pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">\u25a0 The district court remanded the case to the ALJ on July 30, 2008, directing that the ALJ properly evaluate the opinion of Luckey\u2019s treating physician, Alfredo J. Nodarse, M.D. (\u201cDr. Nodarse\u201d). The ALJ conducted a new hearing on November 19, 2008, after which he issued a second unfavorable decision on February 19, 2009. Once again, Luckey filed a civil action for judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision. The district court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits, and it granted summary judgment in the Commissioner\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Luckey filed a Notice of Appeal with this Court on February 17, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">\u201cIn the Fifth Circuit, appellate review [of a Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits] is limited to (1) whether the Commissioner applied the proper legal standard; and (2) whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Waters v. Barnhart, </em>276 F.3d 716, 718 (5th Cir.2002); <em>see also Carey v. Apfel, </em>230 F.3d 131, 135 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Selders v. Sullivan, </em>914 F.2d 614, 617 (5th Cir.1990); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). As long as substantial evidence exists to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision, it must be affirmed. <em>Newton v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is defined as \u201cmore than a scintilla and less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>Falco v. Shalala, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>27 F.3d 160, 162 (5th Cir.1994) (citing <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)). It is \u201cthat which is relevant and sufficient for a reasonable mind to accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Spellman v. Shalala, </em>1 F.3d 357, 360 (5th Cir.1993). This Court may not reweigh the evidence, try the case <em>de novo, </em>or substitute its judgment for that of the Commissioner, \u201ceven if the evidence preponderates against the [Commissioner\u2019s] decision.\u201d <em>Brown v. Apfel, </em>192 F.3d 492, 496 (5th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Johnson v. Bowen, </em>864 F.2d 340, 343 (5th Cir.1988)). \u201cConflicts in the evidence are for the [Commissioner] and not the courts to resolve.\u201d <em>Selders, </em>914 F.2d at 617 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo </em>and applies the same standard as the district court. <em>Holt v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>627 F.3d 188, 191 (5th Cir.2010). Under that standard, summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the mov-ant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). When reviewing a motion for summary judgment, the Court construes all the evidence and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Amazing Spaces, Inc. v. Metro Mini Storage, </em>608 F.3d 225, 234 (5th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Xtreme Lashes, LLC v. Xtended Beauty, Inc., </em>576 F.3d 221, 226 (5th Cir.2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Luckey raises two issues on appeal. First, he argues that the ALJ employed improper legal standards by not giving \u201ccontrolling weight\u201d to the opinion of Luckey\u2019s longtime physician, Dr. Nodarse. Second, he claims that the ALJ should have consulted a medical advisor to assist in determining Luckey\u2019s disability onset date.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Under the Social Security Act, \u201cdisability\u201d is defined as the \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). A five-step analysis is used to determine whether a claimant is disabled. <em>Carey v. Apfel, </em>230 F.3d 131, 135 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-9\">\u201cFirst, the claimant must not be presently working. Second, a claimant must establish that he has an impairment or combination of impairments which significantly limit [his] physical or mental ability to do basic work activities. Third, to secure a finding of disability without consideration of age, education, and work experience, a claimant must establish that his impairment meets or equals an impairment in the appendix to the regulations. Fourth, a claimant must establish that his impairment prevents him from doing past relevant work. Finally, the burden shifts to the [Commissioner] to establish that the claimant can perform the relevant work. If the [Commissioner] meets this burden, the claimant must then prove that he cannot in fact perform the work suggested.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-10\"><em>Waters, </em>276 F.3d at 718 (quotation marks and citation omitted). Thus, \u201cthe claimant bears the burden of proof with respect to the first four steps of the analysis, with the burden shifting to the Commissioner for the final step.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Brown, </em>192 F.3d at 498; <em>Bowen, </em>864 F.2d at 348. \u201cA finding that the claimant is disabled or not disabled at any point in the five-step process is conclusive and terminates the Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>retary\u2019s analysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 344 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Here, the ALJ set out the above five-step process, and then analyzed Luckey\u2019s claim accordingly. He found that under step three, Luckey did not have an impairment or combination thereof equal to one of the listed impairments in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1525-26. He also found that while Luckey could not perform his past work as a millwright, which is classified as heavy work, he had the residual functional capacity to perform light work, as defined by 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567(b). In making these findings, the ALJ considered Luckey\u2019s symptoms, as well as the objective medical evidence and other evidence provided. He found that Luckey\u2019s statements regarding his symptoms were not consistent with the ALJ\u2019s assessment of his residual functional capacity, because Luckey\u2019s hypertension and diabetes were well-controlled by medication, and during the relevant period his back pain responded to conservative treatment, and did not worsen until after his date last insured. The ALJ also specifically addressed Dr. Nodarse\u2019s opinion that Luckey\u2019s disability had begun before his date last insured, and he found that the opinion was not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Luckey argues correctly that a treating physician\u2019s opinion, such as that of Dr. Nodarse, often is given \u201ccontrolling weight.\u201d The ALJ addressed this contention, however, noting that under the Social Security regulations, a treating physician\u2019s opinion on the nature and severity of a claimant\u2019s impairment receives \u201ccontrolling weight\u201d only where it \u201cis well-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in [the] case record.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2). The ALJ found that Dr. Nodarse\u2019s opinion was inconsistent with the remainder of the record, including Dr. Nodarse\u2019s own treatment notes, the conservative treatment he recommended for Luckey, the improvement of Luckey\u2019s back pain with chiropractic treatment, and the fact that Dr. Nodarse did not refer Luckey to an orthopedist until the summer of 2004, six months after his date last insured. Therefore, the ALJ did not give Dr. No-darse\u2019s opinion \u201ccontrolling weight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Luckey argues in the alternative that, even if Dr. Nodarse\u2019s opinion was not given controlling weight, it should have been accorded great weight. He claims that the ALJ failed \u201cto clearly set forth specific reasons for the weight given, or not given, to [Dr. Nodarse\u2019s] treating opinion.\u201d Plaintiff-Appellant\u2019s Br. at 35. However, a review of the ALJ\u2019s decision shows that he very clearly set out the reasons that he felt Dr. Nodarse\u2019s opinion was \u201centitled to little weight.\u201d ALJ Opinion at 6. The ALJ listed the factors he was required to apply, including \u201c(1) the length of the treatment relationship and the frequency of examination; (2) the nature and extent of the treatment relationship; (3) the relevant evidence supporting the opinion; (4) the consistency of the opinion with the record as a whole; (5) whether the opinion is of a specialist; and (6) any other factors which tend to support or contradict the opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(l)-(6)). The ALJ then discussed facts that pertained to each factor, including objective medical evidence from the record, before discounting Dr. No-darse\u2019s opinion. <em>See Loza, </em>219 F.3d at 395 (\u201cThe ALJ cannot reject a medical opinion without an explanation.\u201d); <em>Newton, </em>209 F.3d at 456 (stating that \u201can ALJ is required to consider each of the \u00a7 404.1527(d) factors before declining to give any weight to the opinions of the claimant\u2019s treating specialist.\u201d). Luckey is therefore plainly incorrect that the ALJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>failed to support his position as to the weight due Dr. Nodarse\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">It is true that \u201cordinarily the opinions, diagnoses, and medical evidence of a treating physician who is familiar with the claimant\u2019s injuries, treatments, and responses should be accorded considerable weight in determining disability.\u201d <em>Scott v. Heckler, </em>770 F.2d 482, 485 (5th Cir.1985). However, \u201c[f]or good cause shown, the ALJ may discount, or even disregard entirely, the opinion of the treating physician.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>192 F.3d at 500 (internal citation omitted); <em>see also Newton, </em>209 F.3d at 456. As in <em>Brown, </em>the ALJ here had good cause to reject Dr. Nodarse\u2019s opinion regarding Luckey\u2019s disabled status because that opinion was unsupported by the record. <em>Id. </em>It is the Commissioner who must ultimately determine whether a claimant is disabled, and not the claimant\u2019s physician. <em>Spellman, </em>1 F.3d at 364. Furthermore, the ALJ, and not this Court, must decide what weight to give the proffered medical evidence. <em>Bowen, </em>864 F.2d at 343. Luckey seeks to have this Court reweigh the evidence and substitute our judgment for that of the Commissioner, but that is neither our place nor our prerogative. <em>Brown, </em>192 F.3d at 496. We find that the ALJ applied the proper legal standards in evaluating Dr. Nodarse\u2019s opinion, and that the ALJ\u2019s decision that Dr. Nodarse\u2019s opinion was entitled to little weight was supported by substantial evidence. Thus, the decision must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Luckey\u2019s second argument \u2014 that the ALJ should have consulted a medical advisor in determining the onset of Luck-ey\u2019s disability \u2014 is equally unavailing. Luckey bases this argument on cases where the medical evidence regarding onset date is ambiguous. <em>See, e.g., Spellman, </em>1 F.3d at 362. However, the ALJ here found that there was substantial evidence indicating the onset of Luckey\u2019s disability occurred in 2004, after his date last insured of December 31, 2003. Outside of a retrospective opinion by Dr. Nodarse that Luckey\u2019s back condition constituted a disability in 2003, the ALJ found that there was no medical evidence that Luckey suffered from a disability during that time period. <em>See Id. </em>at 361 (stating that \u201cthe medical evidence is the primary element in the determination of onset of disability.\u201d). Thus, Luckey\u2019s disability onset date was not ambiguous, such that the ALJ needed to consult a medical advisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Luckey also argues that the ALJ incorrectly discounted medical evidence from the period after Luckey\u2019s date last insured in determining his disability onset date. Subsequent medical evidence is relevant \u201cbecause it may bear upon the severity of the claimant\u2019s condition before the expiration of his or her insured status.\u201d <em>Loza, </em>219 F.3d at 394 (quotation marks and citation omitted). Luckey had an MRI of his lumbar spine in June 2004 that showed lumbosacral spondylosis with degenerative disc disease, L5-S1 disc herniation, bilateral hip arthritis, and bilateral knee arthritis. In a letter written in 2006, Dr. No-darse stated that the conditions diagnosed with the MRI predated the test, and that based on the results, Luckey would have been capable of no more than sedentary work in 2003. However, Luckey presented no evidence outside of his own testimony and Dr. Nodarse\u2019s retrospective opinion to support a finding that he was disabled prior to his date last insured. The ALJ cited notes from Luckey\u2019s chiropractor\u2014 wherein Luckey stated that his pain had greatly improved with treatment between August and December 2003 \u2014 that contradicted Luckey\u2019s testimony at the hearing regarding the onset of his disability. <em>See Scott, </em>770 F.2d at 485 (stating that it is the ALJ\u2019s place to determine the credibility of medical and lay witnesses). And while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>retrospective medical diagnoses may constitute relevant evidence of the onset of disability, they must at least be \u201ccorroborated by lay evidence relating back to the claimed period of disability.\u201d <em>Likes v. Callahan, </em>112 F.3d 189, 191 (5th Cir.1997) (per curiam). Here, the only evidence corroborating Dr. Nodarse\u2019s retrospective medical opinion regarding the MRI results was Luckey\u2019s testimony at the hearing; Luckey presented no other evidence, medical or lay, supporting Dr. Nodarse\u2019s opinion that the onset of his disability occurred in January 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The ALJ\u2019s opinion that Luckey was not disabled on his date last insured is supported by substantial evidence. There is no requirement that the ALJ consult an additional medical advisor where, as here, the onset date of the claimant\u2019s disability is not ambiguous. Furthermore, the ALJ gave subsequent medical evidence its due weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b348-17\"> Pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-10\">. The Social Security Administration regulations contain a formula for calculating a claimant's insured status. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.130. A claimant must establish disability on or before the date last insured in order to be entitled to a period of disability or disability insurance benefits. <em>See 20 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 404.131; <em>Loza v. Apfel, </em>219 F.3d 378, 393 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b349-16\">.
