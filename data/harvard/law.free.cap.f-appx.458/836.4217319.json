We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-21\">In November 2010, Owens filed a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. According to the petition, schedules, and creditor filings, Owens\u2019s outstanding debts included a real estate loan secured by a home in Fayette-ville, Georgia, and held by GMAC Mortgage, LLC. After receiving a deficiency notice, Owens applied to pay her filing fee in installments, which the bankruptcy court granted, and she eventually paid the fee in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-22\">After Owens filed a proposed repayment plan, GMAC and the Trustee objected to the confirmation of her proposed plan. GMAC argued that the plan was not feasi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>ble. The Trustee contended that Owens\u2019s schedules were inaccurate or incomplete, her plan payments were delinquent, the proposed period for the plan was too long, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322(d), and Owens had failed to disclose her bankruptcy petitions filed in 2007, 2008, and 2010, all of which were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">The bankruptcy court dismissed Owens\u2019s petition and refused to confirm her proposed plan. Owens filed motions for reconsideration and reimposition of the automatic stay. The bankruptcy court denied both motions, and Owens filed an appeal to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Owens failed to pay the filing fees for her appeal in either the bankruptcy court or the district court. After Owens filed her notice of appeal, the bankruptcy court sent her a document entitled \u201cNotification of Appeal Requirements,\u201d which described those parts of the record that had to be sent to the district court. The docket sheet of the bankruptcy court, which Owens sent to the district court as part of the record on appeal, stated in several places that Owens had not paid the required fees for her appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">The district court dismissed Owens\u2019s appeal on the ground that she had failed either to pay the required filing fee or to file an application to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>Owens later moved the district court to reconsider the dismissal and allow her to pay the fees, but Owens still failed to tender the fees. The district court denied Owens\u2019s motion, and she filed a notice of appeal <em>pro se </em>to this Court and paid the required filing fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">We review a dismissal for failure to comply with the rules of the court for abuse of discretion. <em>Betty K Agencies, Ltd. v. M/V Monada, </em>432 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir.2005). District courts have jurisdiction to hear appeals from final judgments and orders of a bankruptcy court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a). To appeal an order of the bankruptcy court, the debtor must pay a filing fee of $298 to the bankruptcy court. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1930; 2011 Bankruptcy Court Misc. Fee Schedule, provision 14. The debtor must also pay a filing fee of $350 to the district court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1914(a). As an alternative to paying the filing fee, the debtor may file an affidavit establishing that she is unable to pay. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1915(a); <em>Martinez v. Kristi Kleaners, Inc., </em>364 F.3d 1305, 1306 n. 1 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">\u201cThe right of access to the courts \u2018is neither absolute nor unconditional.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller v. Donald, </em>541 F.3d 1091, 1096 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Cofield v. Ala. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>936 F.2d 512, 516 (11th Cir.1991)). Conditions on access are necessary to preserve judicial resources for all persons. <em>Id. </em>at 1096. \u201cAs the Supreme Court has noted, filing fees in theory discourage frivolous law suits and thus help allocate judicial resources to more meritorious cases.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed Owens\u2019s appeal. The record supports the finding that Owens failed to pay the filing fees or submit an application to proceed <em>informa pauper-is. </em>Owens was repeatedly warned about the insufficiency of her petition and her proposed repayment plan, neither of which she corrected. Owens paid the initial filing fee only after the bankruptcy court sent her a deficiency notice that her case would be dismissed if she failed to pay the fee. After the district court dismissed Owens\u2019s appeal, she failed to tender the fees for her appeal either before or after filing a motion for reconsideration, and she failed to file an application to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>We affirm the dismissal of Owens\u2019s appeal to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
