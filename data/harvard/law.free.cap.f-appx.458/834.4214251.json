United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008). The district court granted a certificate of ap-pealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the following two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-23\">(1) Whether Johnson is actually innocent of being a career offender, because his prior conviction for manslaughter does not constitute a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the career offender guideline; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-24\">(2) Whether Johnson should have been permitted to amend his petition to include a challenge to his prior drug conviction based on the actual innocence doctrine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>With respect to the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, we review findings of fact for clear error and questions of law <em>de novo. McKay v. United States, </em>657 F.3d 1190, 1195 (11th Cir.2011). We review the denial of a request for leave to amend a \u00a7 2255 motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Farris v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1211, 1214 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Although the scope of our review is limited to the issues enumerated in the COA, we must consider first any issue of procedural default. <em>Id. </em>A claim is procedurally defaulted if the defendant failed to advance a challenge on direct appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 1196. Procedural default may be excused, based on one of two exceptions: (1) on a showing of cause for failing to raise the claim on direct appeal and actual prejudice from the error; or (2) for a miscarriage of justice or actual innocence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Under the actual innocence exception, the procedural default is excused if the prisoner can show that he is actually innocent of the crime of conviction, or in the capital sentencing context, of the sentence itself. <em>Id. </em>at 1196-97. In <em>McKay, </em>we declined to extend the actual innocence exception to the procedural default rule to the prisoner\u2019s claim that he was erroneously sentenced as a career offender because one of his prior convictions did not legally qualify as a crime of violence. <em>Id. </em>at 1198. We reasoned that such a claim is \u201cone of legal, rather than factual, innocence and thus fails to fall within the actual innocence exception\u2019s purview.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">Johnson\u2019s claim that his manslaughter conviction does not qualify as a crime of violence is subject to procedural default, because he failed to raise the issue on direct appeal. Under <em>McKay, </em>Johnson cannot excuse this default by asserting actual innocence of being a career offender based solely on the argument that his manslaughter conviction does not satisfy the legal requirements for a crime of violence. <em>See id. </em>at 1198. In fact, he acknowledges that his claims are foreclosed by <em>McKay </em>in his reply brief filed with this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">Similarly, Johnson\u2019s argument that his prior drug conviction does not qualify as a controlled substance offense is procedurally defaulted and cannot be excused based on a claim of legal innocence of being a career offender. Because Johnson\u2019s claim is procedurally barred, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Johnson\u2019s request to amend his \u00a7 2255 motion to challenge his prior drug conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
