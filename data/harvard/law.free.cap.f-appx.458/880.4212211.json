Umerah appeals the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of John Hancock Life Insurance Company (USA) (John Hancock) and against Umerah on her claim for benefits arising out of her deceased husband\u2019s life insurance policy. On appeal, Umerah contends the district court erred by concluding the language of the insurance policy was unambiguous, such that actual receipt of the notice of. termination was unnecessary. After careful review, we affirm the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-23\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b906-24\">John Hancock issued a Flexible Premium Adjustable Life Insurance Policy (Policy) to Umerah\u2019s late husband, Gabriel Umerah (Mr. Umerah), effective November 4, 2005. Mr. Umerah provided a Har-pers Glen Court address, his residence at the time, on his Policy application. In May 2006, the Umerahs moved a few miles away, but retained ownership of the Har-pers Glen Court property. John Hancock was not notified of a change of address.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-25\">From November 2005 through August 2008, premium payments in the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>$1,283.50 were automatically withdrawn from Mr. Umerah\u2019s checking account on a monthly basis. On September 3, 2008, however, Mr. Umerah executed a document revoking John Hancock\u2019s authorization for automatic withdrawal of the premium payments. The Umerahs did not make any more premium payments for the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">On April 6, 2009, John Hancock\u2019s records indicate it generated a \u201cTermination Warning Notice,\u201d notifying Mr. Umerah that the premium payments to date were insufficient to maintain coverage beyond April 4, 2009. The notice stated a minimum payment of $2,922.97 was due by June 4, 2009, to keep the Policy in force. A \u201cTermination Warning Notice Reminder\u201d dated May 4, 2009, contained essentially the same information. John Hancock\u2019s records also indicate a \u201cLapse Termination Notice\u201d was generated on June 15, 2009, indicating that as of June 4, 2009, Mr. Umerah\u2019s policy was terminated due to insufficient payments. All three notices were addressed to Mr. Umerah\u2019s \u201clast known address\u201d at Harpers Glen Court. Although there is nothing in Mr. Umerah\u2019s file indicating the notices were returned as undeliverable, Umerah denies receiving these notices.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Mr. Umerah died suddenly on September 30, 2009, and a statement of claim for death benefits was subsequently filed under the Policy. In correspondence dated November 11, 2009, John Hancock denied the claim due to nonpayment of the premiums, which had resulted in termination of the Policy effective June 4, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">On appeal, Umerah contends the district court erred in concluding the provision \u201csend a notice to your last known address\u201d was unambiguous. Rather, Umerah claims the language is ambiguous, such that actual receipt of the notice of cancellation was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">The insurer bears the burden of proving the insurance contract was cancelled in accordance with the terms of the policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Auvil v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>222 So.2d 46, 48 n. 1 (Fla. 3d DCA 1969). If a policy provides for a written cancellation notice, \u201cbut does not specify the m[e]thod of giving the written notice, and the notice is given by mail, the effective date of cancellation generally is to be determined based on the date of receipt of the notice by the insured.\u201d <em>Aetna Ins. Co. v. Settembrino, </em>324 So.2d 113, 114 (Fla. 3d DCA 1975). If, however, the policy states that mailing notice is sufficient, Florida courts deem the notice \u201cto be complete upon mailing, even if the insured does not actually receive the notice.\u201d <em>Best Meridian Ins. Co. v. Tuaty, </em>752 So.2d 733, 735 (Fla. 3d DCA 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-13\">The Policy provided that 30 days prior to termination of coverage, John Hancock would \u201csend a notice to your last known address, specifying the amount you must pay to bring the policy out of default.\u201d This language is distinguishable from the Florida cases requiring actual notice of cancellation when the insurance companies merely state that they will \u201cgive\u201d notice, but do not specify the means by which they will provide the notice. <em>See, e.g., Nunley v. Fla. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., </em>494 So.2d 306, 307 (Fla. 1st DCA 1986). Rather, this language is more analogous to the Florida \u201cmail\u201d cases, where the destination \u2014 here, the \u201clast known address\u201d \u2014 is specified. <em>See Best Meridian, </em>752 So.2d at 735 (providing that notices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>would be mailed to the \u201clast known address as contained in [the insurer\u2019s] records\u201d); <em>see also Burgos v. Indep. Fire. Ins. Co., </em>371 So.2d 539, 541 (Fla. 3d DCA 1979) (noting \u201c[t]he well established principle of law with regard to the issue of cancellation is that proof of mailing a notice of cancellation to a named insured at the address stated in the policy is sufficient compliance with the policy provision requiring notice to the insured\u201d). Here, John Hancock complied with the Policy by \u201csending] a notice to [the] last known address,\u201d language that shifted the risk of delivery to the insured. Under the facts and circumstances of this case, the district court did not err in concluding that the Policy\u2019s termination provision was unambiguous, and that John Hancock complied with the terms of the policy, resulting in termination of the Policy before the insured\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b906-16\">.
