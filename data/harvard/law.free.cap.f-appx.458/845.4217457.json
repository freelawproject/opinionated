Plaintiff Chris Turner, as the personal representative of Tracy Turner\u2019s estate, brought this action under the Florida Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act. Following a bench trial, the district court concluded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number><em>inter alia, </em>that the five aircraft transferred to the Ramo Company were not encumbered by a valid lien and set aside the' transfer as a fraudulent conveyance. After losing in the bench trial, the Defendant Ramo Company appeals the district court\u2019s final judgment entered in favor of Plaintiff Turner.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">On appeal, the Ramo Company argues only that the district court erred in denying its pretrial motion for summary judgment. It is well-settled that we \u201cwill not review the pretrial denial of a motion for summary judgment after a full trial and judgment on the merits.\u201d <em>Lind v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 254 F.3d 1281, 1286 </em>(11th Cir.2001); <em>see also Ortiz v. Jordan, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 884, 889, 178 L.Ed.2d 703 (2011) (resolving circuit split by concluding that a party may not \u201cappeal an order denying summary judgment after a full trial on the merits\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we do not review the district court\u2019s February 7, 2011 order denying summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">The Ramo Company\u2019s appellate brief does not raise any error with respect to the bench trial or any reviewable order, including the Ramo Company\u2019s Rule 52(b) motion for judgment on partial findings or the district court\u2019s August 4, 2011 post-trial order making findings of fact and conclusions of law. Thus, the Ramo Company has abandoned any issue with respect to these rulings. <em>See Carmichael v. Kellogg, Brown &amp; Root Servs., Inc., </em>572 F.3d 1271, 1293 (11th Cir.2009) (explaining that a legal claim or argument not raised in the appeal brief is deemed abandoned).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b872-8\">. We need not address the Ramo Company\u2019s argument that a pretrial denial of summary judgment that raises purely legal questions is appealable. The issue the district court resolved at summary judgment \u2014 whether there was sufficient evidence from which a factfin-der could reasonably infer that the aircraft transferred to the Ramo Company were not encumbered by a bona fide loan \u2014 did not present a pure question of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AiU\">. Appellant\u2019s motion to take judicial notice is denied. Appellee\u2019s motion for sanctions is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
