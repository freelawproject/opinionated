Glen Anderson has filed a motion to proceed as a sanctioned litigant and requests leave to proceed in forma pauper-is (IFP) in his appeal from the denial of his motion to file a second 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) motion and from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-25\">We previously imposed a $200 sanction after we dismissed as frivolous Anderson\u2019s appeal from the denial of relief based on his argument that he was entitled to a reduction in his sentence under Amendment 478 to the Guidelines. We warned Anderson that filing any future frivolous or repetitive challenges to his conviction or sentence in this court or any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction would subject him to additional sanctions. Anderson has paid the sanction. Accordingly, Anderson\u2019s motion to proceed as a sanctioned litigant is DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Only Anderson\u2019s motion to proceed IFP is before the court. When a district court certifies that an appeal is not taken in good faith, a prisoner may either pay the filing fee or challenge the district court\u2019s certification decision by moving for IFP in this court. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, 117 F.3d 197, </em>202 (5th Cir.1997). This court\u2019s inquiry into the prisoner\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. King, 707 </em>F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">A district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and its decision to deny a motion for reconsideration are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. O\u2019Keefe, </em>128 F.3d 885, 892 (5th Cir.1997). Anderson\u2019s motion to file a second \u00a7 3582(c) motion, is repetitive, as he has twice before sought relief based on Amendment 478. This court has twice determined that Anderson\u2019s appeals from the denial of relief based on Amendment 478 were frivolous. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>257 Fed.Appx. 796 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>102 Fed.Appx. 390 (5th Cir.2004). Anderson\u2019s appeal from the denial of the instant motion is, therefore, frivolous. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20. His motion to proceed IFP is DENIED. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Anderson\u2019s filings indicate that he has ignored this court\u2019s warning that filing any future frivolous or repetitive challenges to his conviction or sentence in this court or any court subject to this court's jurisdiction would subject him to additional sanctions. Therefore, IT IS ORDERED Anderson pay a monetary sanction of $300.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the clerk of this court and the clerks of all federal district courts within this circuit are directed to refuse to file any challenge to Anderson\u2019s 1991 conviction, or appeal from such challenge, unless Anderson submits proof of satisfaction of the $300 sanction. If Anderson attempts to file any further notices of appeal or original proceedings in this court without such proof the clerk will docket them for administrative purposes only. Any other submissions which do not show proof that the sanction has been paid will neither be addressed nor acknowledged.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Anderson is WARNED that, even if he pays the instant $300 sanction, the filing of any future frivolous or repetitive challenges to his conviction or sentence in this court or any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction will subject him to progressively more severe sanctions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b433-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
