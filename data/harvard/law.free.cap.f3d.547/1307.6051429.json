McNeese argues that the government did not have the authority to limit the Rule 35(b) motion to one count and the district court retained authority to reduce the sentence as to both counts of conviction. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-28\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-29\">A federal grand jury returned a four-count indictment naming three codefen-dants and charging McNeese with (1) conspiracy to import heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 963 (\u201cCount 1\u201d); and (2) importing heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952 (\u201cCount 3\u201d). A jury found McNeese guilty of both charges. The district court sentenced McNeese to life imprisonment as to Count 1 and 240 months\u2019 imprisonment as to Count 3, with these terms to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>The government submitted a \u201cMotion for Reduction in Sentence as to Count One of the Judgment,\u201d pursuant to Rule 35(b). The government explained that McNeese had rendered substantial assistance to authorities in the Northern District of Iowa. The government recommended that the district court reduce McNeese\u2019s life sentence as to Count 1 to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-4\">At a hearing on the government\u2019s Rule 35(b) motion, the district court noted that the government had limited its motion to Count 1. McNeese argued that specifying the term to which its Rule 35(b) motion should apply was beyond the scope of the government\u2019s discretion. McNeese likewise argued that the district court retained authority to reduce the terms of imprisonment imposed for both Counts 1 and 3, as \u201conce the Rule 35[ (b) ] motion is made[,] the door is open for the Court to impose whatever sentence it wants in connection with that particular case.\u201d The government responded that, because the discretion to file a Rule 35(b) motion rested with the government, \u201c[it could] make the motion as [it saw] fit.\u201d The government also responded that it had found no case law to the contrary. The government explained that it directed the motion to a specific count because \u201c[it felt] that the defendant\u2019s cooperation deserve[d] something less than a life sentence,\u201d but \u201c[didn\u2019t] feel it deserve[d] something less than a 20 year sentence.\u201d The district court asked the parties to brief the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-5\">In its memorandum, the government argued that the district court\u2019s discretion to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence for his provision of substantial assistance arose only upon motion by the government and that the government\u2019s decision not to file such a motion was reviewable only when based on unconstitutional motives not at issue here. In his memorandum, McNeese acknowledged that it appeared that we had yet to consider whether the government could specify to which term its Rule 35(b) should apply. McNeese argued, however, that the government\u2019s motivation, namely controlling McNeese\u2019s ultimate sentence, was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-7\">The district court granted the government\u2019s Rule 35(b) motion in part, reducing the sentence for Count 1 to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, but rejected McNeese\u2019s argument that the motion applied to both terms of imprisonment. To the latter end, the district court reasoned that the government had the authority to select the sentence to which its motion should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-9\">Pursuant to Rule 35(b), \u201c[u]pon the government\u2019s motion made within one year of sentencing, the court may reduce a sentence if the defendant, after sentencing, provided substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b)(1). The Supreme Court has held that this statute gives the government \u201ca power, not a duty, to file a motion when a defendant has substantially assisted.\u201d <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 1843, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992) (considering motions filed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1). Indeed, the Supreme Court held that the government\u2019s discretion is such that federal district courts may review the government\u2019s refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion only if the defendant first makes a \u201csubstantial threshold showing\u201d that the refusal was based upon an unconstitutional motive, such as the defendant\u2019s race or religion. <em>Id. </em>at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. at 1843-44. We have held that arguments that the government had motivations beyond the defendant\u2019s provision of substantial assistance do not satisfy the Supreme Court\u2019s unconstitutional-motive standard for review. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number><em>See United States v. Nealy, </em>232 F.3d 825, 831 (11th Cir.2000).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, a defendant argued that the government could not refuse to file a substantial-assistance motion for \u201creasons other than the nature of [defendant\u2019s] substantial assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held that this contention was not supported by the Supreme Court\u2019s aforementioned ruling and \u201c[was] contrary to the broad grant of prosecutorial discretion recognized by this [C]ourt.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1281-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-5\">The government did not overstep its discretion by specifying the term to which its Rule 35(b) motion should apply, and the district court did not err in acting in accordance with this specification. The Supreme Court and this Court long have recognized that the government discretion to seek a substantial-assistance reduction is vast. <em>See Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185, 112 S.Ct. at 1843. There is no reason to believe that this discretion should not extend to deciding to which term the Rule 35(b) should be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-6\">To the extent that the instant issue is whether the government erred in declining to file a Rule 35(b) motion with regard to Count 3 also, we lack jurisdiction to review that choice because McNeese has not shown that the government had unconstitutional motives. <em>See id. </em>at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. at 1843-44. The government\u2019s desire to retain some control over McNeese\u2019s sentence is not of the same ilk as those unconstitutional motives described by the Supreme Court, namely the defendant\u2019s race or religion. <em>See id. </em>Also, we specifically have rejected the contention that all reasons beside the defendant\u2019s provision of substantial assistance are unconstitutional. <em>See Nealy, </em>232 F.3d at 831. Accordingly, because the government had the discretion to direct the Rule 35(b) motion to a specific count and did not have unconstitutional motives in doing so, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1281-7\">. McNeese offers <em>United States v. Chavarria-Herrara, </em>15 F.3d 1033 (11th Cir.1994), for the contrary holding that the government cannot consider anything other than the defendant's provision of substantial assistance. In that case, however, we considered an argument that the <em>district court </em>considered other factors in determining the <em>extent </em>of the reduction, rather than that the government considered other factors in determining whether to request the reduction, and held that this was error. <em>Id. </em>at 1037. McNeese has not challenged the district court\u2019s motivations. Accordingly, this case is inapplicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
