J. S. A. </em>18A: 16-6; for liability incurred in that employment. The statute mandates that such indemnification protection shall be provided whenever any civil action is brought against \u201cany person holding any office, position or employment under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>the jurisdiction of any board of education, including any student teacher, for any act or omission arising out of and in the course of the performance of the duties as such office, position, employment or student teaching * *</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The trial court held that this provision did not extend indemnity protection to the employees of a company furnishing school bus transportation under independent contract \u25a0with the board. We agree and affirm the declaratory judgment in favor of the board essentially for the reasons expressed by Judge Eulop in his opinion reported at 106 <em>N. J. Super. </em>187 (Law Div. 1969).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
