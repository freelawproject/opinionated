This was excepted to and requires a reversal. The disclosure of the trustee, though filed in the case, was no part of the evidence, and reference to its contents was wholly unwarranted. <em>Blaisdell </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>72 Vt. 295, 48 Atl. 14; <em>Drown </em>v. <em>Oderkirk, </em>89 Vt. 484, 96 Atl. 11. A reference to a defendant\u2019s financial condition is one naturally prejudicial to his case, and we have no doubt that it had this effect in the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
