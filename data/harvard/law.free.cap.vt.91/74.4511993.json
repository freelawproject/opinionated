S., as amended by No. 72 of the Laws of 1908; that no notice was given by the probate court of the pendency of such petition to the appellant either personally or as administrator; that the probate court renewed the commission and the commissioners thereupon notified the appellant that on a given day a hearing would be had before them upon the claim of Lizzie A.

This section was amended by No. 72, Acts of 1908, in several respects; but the only change material to the matters before us, was the dropping out of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>statute the words, \u201cfor cause shown,\u201d and inserting in lieu thereof the words, \u201cafter due hearing had thereon,\u201d that is, on the petition. So the controlling question in this ease is: \"What is the meaning of the words \u201cdue hearing,\u201d as used in the amendment?</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Those words as there used, mean a judicial examination according to the requirements of law and justice, whereof all persons interested have notice and an opportunity to be heard. See <em>In re Allen, </em>82 Vt. 365, 73 Atl. 1078, 26 L. R. A. (N. S.) 232; <em>Corliss </em>v. <em>Corliss, </em>8 Vt. 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">In the case at bar the appellee\u2019s petition to the probate court for a renewal of the commission, was granted by that court without any notice of the pendency of the petition to the administrator of the estate, or to any other person interested so far as appears. This was granting the petition without \u201cdue hearing\u201d thereon, within the meaning of the statute, and the act of the probate court (it being a court of special and limited jurisdiction having statutory authority only) in this respect was without authority of law and void. Consequently the whole proceedings had before the commission under such unauthorized renewal, were <em>coram non judice, </em>and void. <em>Walbridge </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>3 Vt. 114; <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Crane, </em>16 Vt. 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">It is contended by the appellee that the order renewing the commission was strictly interlocutory, from which no appeal lies. This question was expressly considered, and determined in <em>Timothy </em>v. <em>Farr, </em>42 Vt. 43. It is enough to say that, according to the ruling there made, the question of the validity of the order was properly brought before the county court by the appeal from the report of the commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed. To be certified to the probate court.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
