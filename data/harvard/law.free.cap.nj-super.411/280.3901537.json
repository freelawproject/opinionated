Defendant was previously convicted of DWI in 1979 and of refusing to take a breathalyzer test in 2006, but the Law Division discounted those convictions under the holding of <em>State v. DiSomma, </em>262 <em>N.J.Super. </em>375, 621 A.2d 55 (App.Div.1993). We agree with the State that defendant\u2019s prior convictions required that she be sentenced as a third-time offender. We reverse and re-impose the original sentence of the municipal court for a third offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">The police stopped defendant for traffic offenses in May 2008. Breathalyzer testing showed a blood alcohol concentration of 0.17%. In September 2008, defendant pleaded guilty to DWI, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50. The municipal court sentenced her as a third-time offender to six months in jail, a fine of $1,006, ten-year loss of driver\u2019s license and vehicle registration, twelve hours at an Intoxicated Driver Resource Center (IDRC), and other fees and surcharges as provided by statute. The municipal court stayed execution of the sentence pending defendant\u2019s appeal to the Law Division of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">On de novo review, the Law Division applied the holding of <em>DiSomma, supra, </em>262 <em>N.J.Super. </em>375, 621 A.2d 55, and concluded that the 2006 refusal conviction could not be considered the same as a prior DWI violation. Because the 1979 DWI conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>occurred more than ten years earlier, the Law Division held that defendant should be sentenced as a first-time offender in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50. Defendant was sentenced to thirty days in jail, a fine of $500, twelve months\u2019 driver\u2019s license revocation, twelve hours at IDRC, and fees and surcharges as provided by statute. Defendant has served the thirty-day jail sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The primary issue before us is virtually the same one we framed seventeen years ago in <em>DiSomma, supra, </em>262 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 378, 621 A.2d 55: \u201ccan a defendant with a prior \u2018conviction\u2019 for refusing to take a breathalyzer be sentenced as a second offender pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50(a)(2) following a subsequent driving under the influence conviction?\u201d We answered that question no in <em>DiSomma. Id. </em>at 383, 621 A.2d 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The relevant language of the DWI statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC1\">[AJ person who operates a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor ... shall be subject:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-9\">(1) <em>For the first offense:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-10\">(i) if the person\u2019s blood alcohol concentration is 0.08% or higher but less than 0.10% ... to a f\u00edne of not less than $250 nor more than $400 ... and, in the discretion of the court, a term of imprisonment of not more than 30 days and shall forthwith forfeit his right to operate a motor vehicle over the highways of this State for a period of three months; <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-11\">(ii) if the person\u2019s blood alcohol concentration is 0.10% or higher ... to a fine of not less than $300 nor more than .$500 .. and, in the discretion of the court, a term of imprisonment of not more than 30 days and shall forthwith forfeit his right to operate a motor vehicle over the highways of this State for a period of not less than seven months nor more than one year;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-12\">(2) <em>For a second violation, </em>a person shall be subject to a fine of not less than $500.00 nor more than $1,000.00, ... and shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than 48 consecutive hours, ... nor more than 90 days, and shall forfeit his right to operate a motor vehicle over the highways of this State for a period of two years upon conviction. ..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>(3) <em>For a third, or subsequent violation, </em>a person shall be subject to a fine of $1,000.00, and shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than 180 days ... and shall thereafter forfeit his right to operate a motor vehicle over the highways of this State for 10 years____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-5\">[I]f <em>the second offense </em>occurs more than 10 years after <em>the first offense, </em>the court shall treat the second conviction as a first offense for sentencing purposes and if <em>a third offense </em>occurs more than 10 years after <em>the second offense, </em>the court shall treat the third conviction as a second offense for sentencing purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50(a) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">In the emphasized phrases, the statute uses the words \u201cviolation\u201d and \u201coffense\u201d in referring to the defendant\u2019s prior record and resultant sentencing exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">The statute applicable to refusing a breathalyzer test does not authorize a sentence of incarceration, but the applicable fine and the period of license revocation vary depending on whether the defendant has prior convictions. The relevant language of the refusal statute states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\">[T]he municipal court shall revoke the right to operate a motor vehicle of any operator who, after being arrested for [DWI] shall refuse to submit to a test provided for in [N.J.S.A. 39:4-50.2] when requested to do so, for not less than seven months or more than one year unless the refusal was in connection with <em>a second offense under this section, </em>in which case the revocation period shall be for two years or unless the refusal was in connection with <em>a third or subsequent offense under this section </em>in which case the revocation shall be for ten years____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-11\">The municipal court shall determine by a preponderance of the evidence ... [the] elements of the violation ... the municipal court shall fine a person convicted under this section, a fine of <em>not </em>less than $300 or <em>more </em>than $500 for <em>a first offense; </em>a fine of not less than $500 or more than $1,000 for <em>a second offense; </em>and a fine of $1,000 for <em>a third or subsequent offense.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-12\">[N.J.S.A. 39:4-50.4a(a) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-13\">As shown in the emphasized language, the refusal statute includes the phrase \u201cunder this section\u201d after the word \u201coffense\u201d in the first paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-14\">In <em>DiSomma, supra, </em>262 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 382, 621 A.2d 55, we held that the DWI and refusal statutes do not establish \u201cthe same or interchangeable violations.\u201d A prior refusal conviction does not count toward the number of prior DWI convictions that determine the sentence under the DWI statute. <em>Id. </em>at 383, 621 A.2d 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>In the intervening years since <em>DiSomma, </em>the two statutes have been amended several times, but not with respect to the language relevant to determining the number of prior convictions. The cases interpreting that language, however, have almost uniformly come to conclusions that are inconsistent with our holding in <em>DiSomma. </em>We now depart from the holding of <em>DiSomma </em>and conclude that a prior refusal conviction has the same effect as a prior DWI conviction for determining the number of prior violations under the DWI statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">In <em>DiSomma, supra, </em>we gave four reasons for reaching the opposite conclusion: (1) the refusal violation was deemed to be \u201ccivil in character\u201d because it required only \u201cproof by a preponderance of the evidence,\u201d 262 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 380-81, 621 A.2d 55; (2) \u201c[ujnder usual principles of statutory construction,\u201d the language in the refusal statute making \u201creference to \u2018a subsequent offense under this section\u2019 is and must be just to the section of the refusal statute,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 381, 621 A.2d 55; (3) the DWI and refusal statutes were enacted as separate sections of the New Jersey Statutes although compiled within the same Title and Chapter, <em>id. </em>at 382, 621 A.2d 55; and (4) as a penal measure, the DWI statute should be strictly construed, <em>id. </em>at 383, 621 A.2d 55. None of these reasons has stood the test of time and analysis in other decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The first, that refusal violations are civil in nature, was rejected by the Supreme Court in <em>State v. Cummings, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>84, 95-96, 875 A.2d 906 (2005). <em>See also State v. Widmaier, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>475, 500, 724 A.2d 241 (1999) (double jeopardy protections are applicable to a charge under the refusal statute). In <em>Cummings, supra, </em>the Court acknowledged both that the refusal statute by its terms requires proof only by the preponderance of the evidence standard and that historically the statute had been treated as a civil rather than penal remedy. 184 <em>N.J. </em>at 93-95, 875 A.2d 906 (citing <em>State v. Wright, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>488, 503, 527 A.2d 379 (1987); <em>State v. Todaro, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>177, 179, 576 A.2d 307 (App.Div.1990); <em>State v. Fahrer, </em>212 <em>N.J.Super. </em>571, 577, 515 A.2d 1240 (App.Div.1986)). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>The Court nevertheless held that a violation of the refusal statute, like other traffic offenses, is quasi-criminal in nature and therefore requires proof by the higher reasonable doubt standard. <em>Id. </em>at 95-96, 875 A.2d 906 (citing <em>State v. Dively, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>573, 585, 458 <em>A.</em>2d 502 (1983)). Refusal convictions are no longer deemed civil in character.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Our other reasons for declining to treat refusal and DWI violations as interchangeable prior convictions have been weakened by virtually every other decision that considered the relationship of the statutes, both before and after we decided <em>DiSomma </em>in 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Beginning with <em>In re Bergwall, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>382, 427 A.2d 65 (1981), <em>rev\u2019g on dissent, </em>173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>431, 436, 439, 414 A.2d 584 (App.Div.1980), judicial decisions that have considered the converse of the issue in this case have invariably held that a prior DWI conviction must be treated as a prior offense under the refusal statute. See <em>State v. Grant, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>470, 479-81, 483 A.2d 411 (App.Div.1984); <em>State v. Wilhalme, </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>359, 362-63, 502 A.2d 1159 (App.Div.1985), <em>certif. denied, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>398, 517 A.2d 401 (1986); <em>Fahrer, supra, </em>212 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 578, 515 A.2d 1240; <em>State v. Tekel, </em>281 <em>N.J.Super. </em>502, 505, 658 A.2d 1281 (App.Div.1995); <em>State v. Fielding, </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>191, 193, 675 A.2d 653 (App.Div.1996); <em>State v. Lucci, </em>310 <em>N.J.Super. </em>58, 60, 707 A.2d 1370 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>386, 718 A.2d 1215 (1998). These eases have reached conclusions inconsistent with <em>DiSomma </em>despite the more restrictive language of the refusal statute that includes the phrase \u201cunder this section.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>In <em>Bergwall, supra, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>382, 427 A.2d 65, the Supreme Court approved this court\u2019s dissenting opinion, which reasoned that undue emphasis should not be placed on the phrase \u201cunder this section\u201d because the focus of the refusal statute was on DWI offenses, not just refusal violations. <em>Bergwall, </em>173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 438, 414 A.2d 584. Also, the legislative history of the two statutes strongly suggested that a prior DWI conviction should result in lengthier revocation of driving privileges upon a subsequent refusal conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 438-39, 414 A.2d 584; <em>see Wilhalme, supra, </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 361-63, 502 A.2d 1159.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">In this case, the relevant language of the DWI statute provides even better reason to treat a prior refusal conviction the same as a prior DWI conviction. The DWI statute does not use the phrase \u201cunder this section\u201d in describing a defendant\u2019s prior record. It refers to \u201ca second violation\u201d and \u201ca third or subsequent violation,\u201d or just to \u201coffense.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50(a). We have less justification to restrict the general references to \u201cviolation\u201d and \u201coffense\u201d to DWI convictions alone than the cited decisions had to restrict the phrase \u201coffense under this section\u201d to refusal convictions alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">In order to read the two offenses as interchangeable for purposes of determining a defendant\u2019s prior record, the cited cases relied upon several principles of statutory construction, including elevating the essential purpose and design of a statute over a contrary literal reading, discerning the intent of the Legislature, and avoiding \u201cabsurd or unreasonable\u201d or \u201canomalous\u201d results. <em>See Tekel, supra, </em>281 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 506, 658 A.2d 1281 (quoting <em>534 Hawthorne Ave. Corp. v. Barnes, </em>204 <em>N.J.Super. </em>144, 148, 497 A.2d 1265 (App.Div.1985); <em>Union Cty. Bd. of Freeholders v. Union Cty. Park Comm., </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>333, 341, 196 A.2d 781 (1964)); <em>Grant, supra, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 481, 483 A.2d 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Because the two statutes contain parallel provisions establishing fines and periods of license revocation, it is unlikely that the Legislature intended to impose a lesser fine or period of license revocation on one convicted of DWI after an earlier refusal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>conviction than one convicted of refusal after an earlier DWI conviction. <em>Cf. State v. Eckert, </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>389, 399, 982 A.2d 469 (App.Div.2009) (declining to read the statutes to permit an \u201canomalous\u201d or \u201cirrational result\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">In sum, the reasons we found in <em>DiSomma </em>for treating DWI and refusal offenses as distinct prior violations have been rejected in our decisions and the Supreme Court\u2019s earlier decision in <em>Bergwall, supra, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>382, 427 A.2d 65. We now conclude that a prior conviction for refusing a breathalyzer test is a prior \u201cviolation\u201d or \u201coffense\u201d for purposes of the DWI statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Therefore, in this case, defendant\u2019s 2008 conviction should have been deemed her third, not her first, violation or offense. In that regard, the sentence imposed originally by the municipal court was correct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">Defendant contends that the double jeopardy clauses of the federal and State constitutions prohibit re-sentencing her as a third-time offender.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> She argues that her right against double jeopardy prohibits increasing her sentence above that imposed by the Law Division, especially because she has already served the sentence of incarceration, thirty days in jail. <em>See State v. Ryan, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>1, 10, 429 A.2d 332, cert. <em>denied, </em>454 <em>U.S. </em>880, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>363, 70 L.Ed.2d 190 (1981). The State responds that an illegal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>sentence may be corrected on appeal, even if defendant has already served part of the sentence. <em>Monge v. California, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>721, 730, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>2246, 2251, 141 L.Ed.2d 615, 625 (1998); <em>State v. Baker, </em>270 <em>N.J.Super. </em>55, 72, 636 A.2d 553 (App.Div.), <em>aff'd </em>o.b. 138 <em>N.J. </em>89, 648 A.2d 1127 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The guarantee against double jeopardy \u201cprotects against multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>United States v. DiFrancesco, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>117, 129, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>426, 433, 66 L.Ed.2d 328, 340 (1980); <em>accord North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 <em>U.S. </em>711, 717, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>2072, 2076, 23 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>656, 665 (1969). It does not permit a defendant to retain a lesser sentence mistakenly imposed contrary to law. <em>See Baker, supra, </em>270 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 71-77, 636 A.2d 553. A defendant\u2019s double jeopardy rights are not violated by imposition of a more severe sentence upon the State\u2019s successful appeal where the sentence was illegal or the State otherwise was granted the right to appeal a lenient sentence. <em>State v. Kirk, </em>243 <em>N.J.Super. </em>636, 643, 581 A.2d 115 (App.Div.1990); <em>State v. McCourt, </em>131 <em>N.J.Super. </em>283, 288, 329 A.2d 577 (App.Div.1974); <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1f(2); <em>State v. Sanders, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>609, 621, 527 A.2d 442 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">We agree with defendant, however, that the sentence imposed by the Law Division was not an illegal sentence. It conformed to our holding in <em>DiSomma, supra, </em>262 <em>N.J.Super. </em>375, 621 A.2d 55. <em>Cf. Eckert, supra, </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 408, 982 A.2d 469 (unauthorized merger of refusal conviction into DWI conviction resulted in \u201csentencing error,\u201d not illegal sentence); <em>State v. Burford, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>16, 21 n. 2, 746 A. 2d 998 (2000) (failure of sentencing court to find a sentencing predicate does not make the sentence illegal). We need not address whether double jeopardy rights would have barred the State from appealing defendant\u2019s sentence as a first-time offender if it had been the only sentence imposed. Defendant\u2019s right to be protected against double jeopardy is not violated by re-imposition of a sentence imposed originally and then mistakenly decreased. <em>See State v. Pomo, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>13, 468 A.2d 428 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>In applying double jeopardy principles to sentences, we look to the defendant\u2019s \u201clegitimate expectation of finality\u201d in the sentence imposed. <em>Ryan, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 10, 429 A.2d 332; <em>see DiFrancesco, supra, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>at 136, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 437, 66 L.Ed.2d at 345. In <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>263, 270, 478 A.2d 408 (1984), the Supreme Court said, <em>\u201cRyan </em>can be understood to hold that the commencement of sentence coupled with the defendant\u2019s expectation of finality in his original underlying conviction and sentence combined to raise a constitutional bar against an increase in that sentence.\u201d After <em>Rodriguez, </em>\u201cthe critical inquiry in assessing whether principles of due process and double jeopardy bar imposition of a sentence greater than one initially imposed is whether the defendant maintains a \u2018legitimate expectation of finality1 with respect to the sentence.\u201d <em>State v. Haliski, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>1, 21, 656 A.2d 1246 (1995) (quoting <em>DiFrancesco, supra, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>at 136, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 437, 66 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 345).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Here, defendant could not have a reasonable expectation of finality in the Law Division\u2019s sentence. Defendant\u2019s appeal to the Law Division challenged the legality of the municipal court\u2019s original sentence on the ground that defendant must be sentenced as a first-time offender. When the Law Division agreed with defendant\u2019s position and imposed the lesser sentence, it was not making any factual determination regarding defendant\u2019s guilt or punishment. Nor was it determining appropriate punishment as a matter of judicial discretion. <em>See Kirk, supra, </em>243 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 642, 581 A.2d 115. It was making a legal determination about application of the DWI statute, just as any intermediate appellate court might do in reviewing a sentence. <em>See State v.
