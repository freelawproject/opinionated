The judge concluded that plaintiffs claims could not be resolved without excessive entanglement by the court and jury in issues of religious doctrine and practice. Plaintiff asserts that because the Law Division focused on numerous factual issues that were irrelevant to the resolution of his defamation complaint, the judge erroneously concluded that his claim could not be resolved by applying neutral principles of law. We reject plaintiffs contention that when a cause of action is secular in nature, and the defendants are not religious figures, there can be no excessive entanglement. Where, as here, a jury cannot evaluate plaintiffs cause of action without developing a keen understanding of religious doctrine, and without applying such religious doctrine to the facts presented, the excessive entanglement that the First Amendment seeks to avoid is squarely presented. Thus, we conclude that neither the secular nature of the cause of action nor the secular professions of the defendants serve as a per se bar to a finding of a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Plaintiff is a physician specializing in high risk obstetrics, whose patients are, almost without exception, women of the Orthodox Jewish faith. Plaintiff is a practicing Orthodox Jew and was raised as such by his parents. Plaintiffs father was an ordained Orthodox rabbi.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">In August 2004, defendant Tito, who was plaintiffs wife, instituted divorce proceedings and informed him that she would seek custody of their two daughters and did not intend to honor her earlier promise to raise the children as Orthodox Jews. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Tito had renounced the tenets of Orthodox Judaism, she nonetheless demanded that plaintiff provide her with a <em>Get, </em>which is a religious divorce granted by a husband to a wife. Unless granted a <em>Get, </em>an observant Orthodox Jewish woman is not free to marry again; a civil divorce is not sufficient. Moreover, children born of any subsequent marriage are deemed to have been born out of wedlock and bear a considerable stigma among Orthodox Jews. Based on advice and counsel purportedly issued to plaintiff by his spiritual adviser, Rabbi Rudinsky, plaintiff took the position that so long as Tito continued to refuse to raise their children in the Orthodox tradition, he was not obliged to grant her a <em>Get.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">While the divorce proceedings were pending in the Family Part, plaintiffs and Tito\u2019s rabbi, Aharon Ciment, of Congregation Arzei Darom in Teaneck, provided testimony at a deposition that was favorable to Tito. Rabbi Ciment\u2019s deposition testimony caused a deep schism in the congregation, with some congregants supporting him and others, including plaintiff, insisting that Ciment\u2019s contract not be renewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Defendants Rivkin and Seharlat became ardent supporters of Ciment. At a meeting of several members of the congregation that Rivkin hosted, he and Seharlat vowed to \u201cdestroy [plaintiff] socially and professionally\u201d unless plaintiff ceased his criticism of Ciment. Rivkin also commented he would see to it that plaintiff would never be able to remarry, promising to send letters to the Orthodox community stating that plaintiff was unworthy and attacking his character. Rivkin\u2019s and Scharlat\u2019s antipathy to plaintiff grew so intense that the Temple\u2019s board of directors was forced to convene a special meeting in December 2005 to \u201cformulate the Board\u2019s response to a campaign that is going on to slander [plaintiff].\u201d Ultimately, the Board requested Rivkin to cease \u201chis methodical campaign of <em>lashon </em>harah<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against [plaintiff].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Rather than refrain from further activity, as the Board had requested, Rivkin, as well as Seharlat, intensified their involve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>ment in the dispute between plaintiff and defendant Tito over whether plaintiff would provide her with a <em>Get </em>absent her agreement to raise their children as Orthodox Jews. On January 12, 2006, they presented the Board with a \u201cConfidential Memorandum\u201d requesting that the Board discuss \u201cthe continuing refusal by [plaintiff] to give a <em>Get </em>to his wife ... despite her repeated requests.\u201d Defendants Rivkin and Seharlat further asked the Board to \u201cconsider the implications of this continuing refusal ... in connection with [plaintiffs] continuing rights and status as a member of this congregation.\u201d Defendant Rivkin also initiated a conversation with defendant Tito\u2019s divorce attorney, in which he discussed possible witnesses. For his part, defendant Seharlat contacted Rabbi Rudinsky in an attempt to verify whether the Rabbi had, as plaintiff claimed, advised plaintiff that defendant Tito\u2019s repudiation of Orthodox Judaism justified plaintiffs refusal to provide a <em>Get.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">As a result of plaintiffs resistance to providing defendant Tito a <em>Get, </em>she instituted a proceeding before the <em>Bais Din</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>of America (BDA). By its ruling of July 28, 2006, the BDA ordered plaintiff to \u201cgive a <em>Get </em>immediately\u201d and \u201cwithout delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Shortly thereafter, defendant Tito contacted <em>The Jewish Press, </em>a newspaper that bills itself as the \u201clargest independent weekly Jewish newspaper in the United States.\u201d <em>The Jewish Press </em>champions the cause of women whose husbands refuse to provide a <em>Get </em>by listing such men\u2019s names on its <em>Seruv </em>list.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <em>Seruv </em>list is designed to publicly shame such recalcitrant husbands into providing the requested <em>Get.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Upon being notified by defendant Tito that plaintiff was in contempt of the <em>Bais Din </em>for his refusal to provide her a <em>Get, The Jewish Press </em>contacted the BDA to verify Tito\u2019s claim. Rather than seek written confirmation from the BDA, <em>The Jewish Press </em>telephoned the BDA and spoke to an unnamed staff member who confirmed, erroneously, that a <em>Seruv </em>order of contempt had been issued, when in fact the BDA had merely directed plaintiff to provide the <em>Get </em>immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Upon receiving the supposed confirmation that a <em>Seruv </em>had been issued, <em>The Jewish Press, </em>in its September 6, 2006 print edition, listed plaintiffs name in its regular column entitled <em>\u201cSeruv </em>Listing.\u201d Specifically, the <em>\u201cSeruv </em>Listing\u201d falsely stated that a <em>Seruv </em>had been issued by the BDA against \u201cDr. Yaakov Abdelhak, of Teaneck, N.J.\u201d in August 2006. Of the ten individuals listed in the September 6, 2006 <em>Seruv </em>Listing in <em>The Jewish Press, </em>plaintiff was the only person whose professional title was included, even though one other doctor and a lawyer were also on the list.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Three days later, plaintiff was advised by Rabbi Rudinsky, for the first time, that he should provide defendant Tito with a <em>Get. </em>The next day, September 10,2006, plaintiff did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">On September 15, 2006, after plaintiff notified <em>The Jewish Press </em>of its error and advised the newspaper that no <em>Seruv </em>had been issued against him, <em>The Jewish Press </em>issued a retraction in its print version on September 15, 2006, blaming the error on misinformation provided by the BDA. The retraction notice added that \u201cwe also note that on Sunday, September 10, 2006, Dr. Abdelhak gave his wife a <em>Get.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>On November 29, 2006, plaintiff filed a nine-count complaint in the Law Division against <em>The Jewish Press, </em>Rivkin, Scharlat and Tito alleging defamation, invasion of privacy, and intentional infliction of emotional distress arising from their roles in the false <em>Seruv </em>Listing published by <em>The Jewish Press </em>on September 6, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">As a result of plaintiff filing a complaint and seeking a remedy in a secular court, a different <em>Bais Din, </em>the Mech\u00f3n L\u2019Hoyroa (MLH), issued a <em>Seruv </em>against plaintiff on March 13, 2008 for refusing to resolve his grievance against Scharlat, an Orthodox Jew, in the <em>Bais Din </em>\u201cafter [receiving] several summonses\u201d issued on Scharlat\u2019s behalf by that religious body. The <em>Seruv </em>labeled plaintiff a \u201cMesarev Lavo L\u2019Din\u201d because his \u201cconduct violate[ed] Jewish law\u201d by \u201cwillfully declinin[g] to appear in front of Jewish courts.\u201d The <em>Seruv </em>document commanded the Orthodox Jewish community to \u201ctreat[ ] [plaintiff] in the manner specified by Rabbi Moshe Isserless (Rama) in Shulchan Aruch Choshen Mishpat 26:1.\u201d The March 13, 2008 <em>Seruv </em>has never been rescinded or withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">In October 2008, all defendants filed motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, asserting that the resolution of plaintiffs complaint would entail excessive entanglement of the court into religious affairs and practices. On November 7, 2008, after oral argument, Judge Miller rendered a lengthy decision, supplemented by a written opinion, granting defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss. A confirming order was issued the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">In particular, the judge observed that the proofs to be presented by plaintiff at trial must be examined to determine whether the jury\u2019s task</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-9\">would require excessive procedural or substantive interference with church operations. If the answer to either of these inquiries is in the affirmative, then the dispute is truly of a religious nature, rather than theoretically and tangentially touching upon religion, and the claim is barred from secular court review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">Judge Miller found that adjudication of plaintiffs claims would require the court and jury to make no less than eleven determinations regarding questions grounded in religious doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>1. the nature of a Seruv</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">2. whether [plaintiffs] indifference to the MLH Seruv indicates that it does not hurt his reputation in the eyes of Jews.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">3. the difference in the alleged damage to [plaintiffs] reputation being called a Mesarev Ledin by the MLH as compared to the BDA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">4. the effect of being classified as a Mesarev Ledin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-8\">5. whether the publication of [plaintiffs] name in the Seruv Listing made the followers of Orthodox Judaism in his community shun him socially and professionally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-9\">6. whether Jewish women are not comfortable using a male obstetrician who is not married.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-10\">7. the significance of a husband with-holding or giving a Get.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-11\">8. was the plaintiff justified in with-holding a Get from defendant Ms. Tito.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-12\">9. whether Scharlat was justified in forwarding the Beth Din of America\u2019s July 28, 2006 letter decision to the Jewish Press.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-13\">10. whether plaintiff withholding and later giving the Get involves a matter of legitimate interest within the Orthodox Jewish community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-14\">11. would a reasonable observant Orthodox Jew experience extreme emotional distress as a result of his name being included in a Seruv.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-15\">The judge reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-16\">[Although plaintiff has purportedly asserted claims secular in nature, the adjudication of such claims would require this [c]ourt to determine issues of religious doctrine in violation of the Establishment Clause____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-17\">Specifically, for the defamation claims, the [c]ourt would be required to ascertain the difference between the MLH <em>Seruv </em>and the initial Jewish Press <em>Seruv </em>listing and how such are considered within the Orthodox Jewish community____ [T]he case is similar to <em>Klagsbrun [v. Va'ad Harabonim of Greater Monsey, </em>53 F.Supp.2d 732 (D.N.J.1999), <em>aff'd, </em>263 F.3d 158 (3d Cir.2001) ], in that plaintiffs claims ... are all rooted in claims of plaintiff that deal with religious shunning as a result of a <em>Seruv. ... </em>The Orthodox Jewish community is a closed community and claims and remedies are rooted on pronouncements within that community as reflected by the Bais Din, and grounded in religious doctrine and having a defined meaning only within the Orthodox Jewish faith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-20\">Likewise, the invasion of privacy claims would also require this Court to engage in an analysis of how a <em>Seruv </em>listing is viewed within the Jewish faith and whether it would be considered \u201chighly offensive to a reasonable person,\u201d here members of the Orthodox Jewish community, to be accused of withholding a <em>Get.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-21\">While there are no shortage of Rabbis for a Court and jury, the need for such shows the excessive entanglement of the \u201ccore ecclesiastical issues\u201d in this case which requires the Court to dismiss under the Establishment Clause. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>the court also notes that a determination of why the plaintiffs medical practice allegedly was damaged may rest not only on the issue of the Seruv listing, but also the fact that plaintiff is an unmarried man, with an exclusive clientele for Orthodox \u2022Jewish women, from an Orthodox Jewish community, and their mores.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">Consequently, only through excessive entanglement with the Jewish faith, doctrine and practice would such a determination be possible. Such a determination is inherently religious, and while there may be some secular ramifications in this ecclesiastical matter, as there are in most ecclesiastical matters, the \u201cheart\u201d or core of plaintiffs dispute is inherently religious in nature. The <em>\u201cget \u201d </em>and the rationale of withholding such on religious grounds, even the consequences of the purported \u201clegitimate second <em>Seruv,\" </em>as well as the claims and remedies are all inextricably meshed in the Jewish faith, doctrine and practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">[ (internal citations omitted) (paragraph breaks added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">On appeal, plaintiff maintains that the Law Division\u2019s dismissal of his complaint was error because, contrary to Judge Miller\u2019s conclusions, plaintiffs cause of action can be adjudicated by applying neutral principles of law and without excessive entanglement in religious doctrine and practices. In particular, he argues the Law Division\u2019s opinion focuses on issues \u201cirrelevant to the resolution of [his] claims.\u201d He maintains that the judge wrongly focused on the issue of the \u201c\u2018significance of a husband withholding or giving a <em>Get\u2019 </em>and the nature of a <em>Seruv.\u201d </em>He argues that by focusing on such issues, the judge \u201cbought into the defendants\u2019 attempt to confuse the issues and create new irrelevant issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">He also observes that because <em>The Jewish Press </em>has conceded that a <em>Seruv </em>was never issued against him, the listing was therefore false, and thus the only issue that requires resolution in relation to his claim for damages is whether \u201csuch inclusion was defamatory.\u201d Such factual determination, he argues, does not require the court to consult or become entangled in religious doctrine because his claims \u201care not predicated on a religious institution\u2019s procedures and decisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">The Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution \u201cprohibits states from promoting religion or becoming too entangled in religious affairs.\u201d <em>McKelvey v. Pierce, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>26, 40, 800 A.2d 840 (2002). \u201c[T]he threshold inquiry is whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>underlying dispute is a secular one, capable of review by a civil court, or an ecclesiastical one about \u2018discipline, faith, internal organization, or ecclesiastical rule, custom or law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 45, 800 A.2d 840 (quoting <em>Bell v. Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), </em>126 F.3d 328, 331 (4th Cir.1997)). When adjudicating the merits of a claim requires a court to interpret any one of these religious tenets, the court must abstain for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 52, 800 A.2d 840.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\u201cIf, however, the dispute can be resolved by the application of purely neutral principles of law and without impermissible government intrusion ..., there is no First Amendment shield to litigation.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Neutral principles \u201care wholly secular legal rules whose application to religious parties or disputes does not entail theological or doctrinal evaluations.\u201d <em>Elmora Hebrew Ctr., Inc. v. Fishman, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>404, 414-15, 593 A.2d 725 (1991). Under the neutral principles approach, the judiciary may resolve civil disputes between a religious body and its members if those disputes involve purely secular issues and can be resolved without the judiciary becoming enmeshed in matters of faith or doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at 415-16, 593 A.2d 725.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">As the Court observed in <em>McKelvey, </em>relying on United States Supreme Court precedent, \u201c \u2018[n]ot all entanglements ... have the effect of advancing or inhibiting religion. Interaction between church and state is inevitable, ... and we have always tolerated some level of involvement between the two. Entanglement must be \u2018excessive\u2019 before it runs afoul of the Establishment Clause.\u2019 \u201d <em>McKelvey, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 43, 800 A.2d 840 (quoting <em>Agostini v. Felton, </em>521 <em>U.S. </em>203, 233, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>1997, 2015, 138 L.Ed.2d 391, 420 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">In <em>McKelvey, </em>the Court was presented with the Law Division\u2019s dismissal of the complaint filed by a former Roman Catholic seminarian who had sued the Diocese of Camden and a number of its priests, in contract and tort, claiming that he had been subjected to unwanted homosexual advances during his seminary training. <em>Id. </em>at 32, 800 A.2d 840. The Law Division had dismissed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>plaintiffs complaint on the ground that adjudicating it would require intrusion into church \u201cpolity and administration,\u201d thereby excessively entangling church and state. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The Court reversed the dismissal of the plaintiffs complaint, holding that \u201c[t]he First Amendment does not immunize every legal claim against a religious institution and its members. The analysis in each case is fact-sensitive and claim specific, requiring an assessment of every issue raised in terms of doctrinal and administrative intrusion and entanglement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32-33, 800 A.2d 840. Finding that the Law Division and Appellate Division had each \u201cfailed to engage in that kind of painstaking analysis\u201d and had \u201cpainted with too broad a brush when dismissing [the plaintiffs] case,\u201d the Court reversed and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 33, 800 A.2d 840.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The Court reasoned that the plaintiff could satisfy the elements of a breach of fiduciary duty without implicating ecclesiastical policy merely by demonstrating that his spiritual director at the seminary was a person to whom a seminarian, such as the plaintiff, would naturally be expected to turn for counseling and guidance and that, by his indifference to the plaintiffs complaints of homosexual advances, the spiritual advisor had violated the duty of trust implicit in that supervisory relationship. <em>Id. </em>at 57, 800 A.2d 840. The Court held that those claims of hierarchy and duty were not peculiar to church institutions or religious doctrine and therefore the dismissal of the plaintiffs complaint was error. <em>Id. </em>at 58, 800 A.2d 840. Plaintiff essentially makes the same claim here, maintaining that a jury need not concern itself with the nature of a <em>Seruv </em>or become excessively entangled in the consequences of the issuance of a <em>Seruv, </em>but need confine its findings of fact to whether the false publication of a <em>Seruv </em>in <em>The Jewish Press </em>had defamed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">To place plaintiffs arguments into a proper analytical perspective, we turn to a review of the applicable precedents and begin with opinions in which the court in question concluded that deciding the dispute would not result in excessive entanglement in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>religious affairs. Such opinions include <em>Agostini, supra, </em>521 <em>U.S. </em>at 233, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2015, 138 L.Ed.2d at 420 (program under which a public school sent public school teachers into parochial schools during regular school hours to provide remedial education not violative of the Establishment Clause); <em>Bowen v. Kendrick, </em>487 <em>U.S. </em>589, 615-17, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>2562, 2577-79, 101 L.Ed.2d 520, 544-46 (1988) (finding no excessive entanglement in religion resulted from the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 monitoring of federal grants to private organizations that provided counseling in the area of premarital adolescent sexual relations and pregnancy, even when the grantee was a religious organization, because the federal financial aid did not have the primary effect of advancing religion); <em>Roemer v. Bd. of Pub. Works of Md., </em>426 <em>U.S. </em>736, 764-65, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>2337, 2353-54, 49 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>179, 197-99 (1976) (finding no excessive entanglement in state oversight that was designed to ensure that categorical state grants to religious colleges are not used to teach religion); <em>Welter v.

Needle, </em>386 <em>N.J.Super. </em>100, 108-10, 899 A.2d 316 (App.Div.2006) (finding that Establishment Clause did not prevent court involvement in a contractual dispute between an Orthodox Jewish funeral home and the family of the deceased over the non-performance of promised religious funeral services because the dispute did not concern the manner in which such services were performed, but solely whether they were performed at all). As is evident from each of these opinions, abstention was not required because a court and jury would be able to resolve the disputed question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>without being required to understand tenets of religious doctrine or practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">In contrast, courts have not hesitated to invoke the doctrine of abstention where excessive entanglement would have resulted from maintaining the dispute in the courts. <em>See Serbian E.

We turn to an analysis of each of plaintiffs three causes of action, starting with his defamation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\u201cA defamatory statement is one that is false and \u2018injurious to the reputation of another\u2019 or exposes another person to \u2018hatred, contempt or ridicule\u2019 or subjects another person to \u2018a loss of the good will and confidence\u2019 in which he or she is held by others.\u201d <em>Romaine v. Kallinger, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>282, 289, 537 A.2d 284 (1988) (quoting <em>Leers v. Green, </em>24 <em>N.J. </em>239, 251, 131 A.2d 781 (1957)). To prevail on a defamation claim, a plaintiff must prove, in addition to damages, that the defendant made a false statement of fact about the plaintiff, while either knowing that the statement was false or failing to exercise due care to ascertain the truth or falsity of the statement; the defendant communicated the false statement to a person other than the plaintiff; and the statement at issue had the capacity to injure the plaintiffs reputation. <em>Feggans v. Billington, </em>291 <em>N.J.Super. </em>382, 391, 677 A.2d 771 (App.Div.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">As we understand the record, defendants do not, at least for the purposes of their motion to dismiss, seriously dispute plaintiffs claim that the <em>Seruv </em>Listing was false, that it was communicated to others, and that the exercise of due care would have established its falsity. They confine their arguments to the claim that the other prongs of a defamation claim cannot be resolved without excessive entanglement by a court and jury into issues of religious practice and doctrine. They maintain that a secular jury cannot possibly determine whether the false <em>Seruv </em>Listing casts plaintiff in an unfavorable light without probing deeply into the customs, traditions and rules of Orthodox Judaism.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Unquestionably, a statement that is false is not actionable unless it also injures the plaintiffs reputation. <em>Ibid. </em>Therefore, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>evaluate whether plaintiffs reputation suffered any injury, a jury would, of necessity, be required to determine how a <em>Seruv </em>Listing is viewed within the Orthodox Jewish community and whether an Orthodox Jew would be offended by another\u2019s refusal to provide a <em>Get. </em>To make that determination, a jury would be obliged to consider the intricacies of Jewish doctrine. Such consideration would require a jury to delve deeply into the importance of giving a <em>Get </em>and the disdain heaped on a man who refuses one. Each of the following matters is without analog in civil affairs, and cannot be understood by a jury without a deep understanding of Orthodox Jewish tradition: the consequences to a wife of a husband\u2019s refusal to give a <em>Get; </em>her inability to remarry in the Orthodox faith without a <em>Get; </em>the effect of a remarriage without a <em>Get </em>on any future children; whether Orthodox Jewish husbands are obliged to provide a <em>Get; </em>and whether being accused of withholding a <em>Get </em>exposes an Orthodox Jewish man, such as plaintiff, to ridicule, shame or opprobrium within the Orthodox community. Unless a jury evaluates these deeply religious questions\u2014that are limited to the practices and doctrine of the insular Orthodox Jewish community\u2014the jury would be unable to perform the threshold task of deciding whether the false <em>Seruv </em>Listing was even defamatory at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">We reject plaintiffs claim that because a jury need determine only whether the false <em>Seruv </em>Listing \u201cexposed him to hatred, contempt or ridicule or subjected him to a loss of good will and the confidence of others,\u201d the jury need make no inquiry into Jewish doctrine. No jury could possibly determine such questions without a deep understanding of the Orthodox Jewish practices and traditions to which we have just referred. Thus, the threshold issue of whether the statement was defamatory would entangle a jury excessively in religious questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Moreover, it is not merely whether the false <em>Seruv </em>Listing cast plaintiff in a shameful light that the jury will be required to determine. If that question were to be answered in the affirmative, the jury would be required to consider an award of damages. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>No doubt plaintiff will present evidence concerning the decline in his medical practice as an element of damages. That evidence, like the threshold issue of defamation, requires a deep understanding of Orthodox Jewish practices and traditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">As Judge Miller correctly observed, no jury could determine how much of the decline in plaintiffs income resulted from the defamatory <em>Seruv </em>Listing, and how much of the decline resulted from other factors, unless the jury immersed itself in Orthodox Jewish beliefs. In particular, to award damages, the jury would be required to differentiate between the income loss attributable to the false <em>Seruv </em>Listing and the income loss caused by any one of a number of other religiously-based causes: 1) the MHA <em>Seruv, </em>still in existence, issued for plaintiffs refusal to honor the MHA <em>Bais Din </em>summons; 2) the reluctance of Orthodox Jewish women to be examined and treated by an unmarried male; 3) plaintiffs disregard of the <em>Bais Din\u2019s </em>July 28, 2006 directive to provide the <em>Get </em>\u201cimmediately\u201d; and 4) his refusal until September 10, 2006 to provide the <em>Get </em>at all. To parse these alternative causes of plaintiffs drop in income, in a way that excludes these four other possible causes and focuses solely on the false <em>Seruv </em>Listing, would require the jury to determine what portion of plaintiffs monetary loss was attributable to the false <em>Seruv </em>Listing and what portion to the other four possible causes. Such conclusions could not be drawn unless, again, the jury were to develop a keen understanding of how an Orthodox Jew would view each such event. Such an undertaking exemplifies the excessive involvement in matters of \u201cfaith ... or ecclesiastical ... custom\u201d that the Court prohibited in <em>McKelvey. Supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 45, 800 A.2d 840 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">An award of damages would also, of necessity, require a jury to place a monetary value on the shame and ostracism experienced by a person named in a <em>Seruv </em>Listing. Again, lay jurors, ignorant of the culture, practices and tenets of Orthodox Judaism, have no background or experience that would enable them to measure the suffering of a person who is falsely east in the light of a <em>mesarev </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number><em>led,in, </em>a person disgraced in the eyes of his own community. Awarding damages for this type of injury could not be accomplished by the application of \u201cneutral principles of law,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 48, 800 A.2d 840, and would necessitate \u201cexcessive entanglement,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 43, 800 A.2d 840, in matters of doctrine and faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Indeed, these same considerations led the United States District Court in <em>Klagsbrun </em>to dismiss the plaintiffs complaint on excessive entanglement grounds, <em>supra, </em>53 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>at 741-42, and the Third Circuit to affirm, 263 F.3d 158. The facts there were strikingly similar. The plaintiff in <em>Klagsbrun </em>was a man of the Orthodox Jewish faith<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6accused by a board of Rabbis of refusing to give his wife a <em>Get </em>after being ordered to do so.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 53 F.Supp.2d at 735-36. To resolve the plaintiffs\u2019 defamation claims, the District Court was required to decide whether, as the male plaintiff claimed, he had received rabbinical permission to remarry, or whether as the defendants claimed, he had not, and was therefore a bigamist in the eyes of Orthodox Judaism. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Judge Ackerman held that determining the truth or falsity of the plaintiffs\u2019 defamation claim would require the court to \u201cdelve dangerously into questions of doctrine and faith,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 739, because the resolution of such claims would \u201crequire! ] evaluation of] whether failure to comply with an order of a rabbinical court or failure to submit to the jurisdiction of a rabbinical court are wrongs or sins within the Orthodox Jewish faith which lead to the imposition of the punishment of shunning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 741. Of additional concern was the need to \u201cinquire into the rules and customs governing rabbinical courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 741-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>In reaching the conclusion that the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201centire defamation claim ... is grounded upon religious doctrine,\u201d the court rejected their claim that \u201cthis court would not be required to resolve competing theological propositions\u201d because the court \u201cneed only resolve factual questions of (1) whether Seymour Klagsbrun engaged in bigamy; (2) whether a rabbinical court had ordered Seymour Klagsbrun to give [his ex-wife] a <em>[G]et; </em>and (3) whether Seymour Klagsbrun has refused to submit to the jurisdiction of a rabbinical court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Rejecting that line of reasoning as \u201cunpersuasive,\u201d Judge Ackerman reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">The important point here is that resolution of the factual disputes would require this court to inquire into religious doctrine and practice. Simply because, for example, the question of whether Seymour Klagsbrun actually engaged in bigamy is factual in nature, in no way diminishes the need for this court to delve into religious doctrine. As noted above, the issue, using just one example, is whether Seymour Klagsbrun engaged in bigamy <em>mthin the meaning of the Orthodox Jewish faith, </em>which by its very nature necessitates an inquiry into religious doctrine. Also unpersuasive is the apparent premise of the plaintiffs\u2019 argument, that there must be \u201ccompeting theological propositions\u201d before the First Amendment is implicated. Rather, the Establishment Clause is implicated whenever courts must interpret, evaluate, or apply underlying religious doctrine to resolve disputes involving religious organizations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">As in <em>Klagsbrun, </em>the resolution of plaintiffs defamation claim here would require a court and jury \u201cto delve into religious doctrine,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>because the jury would be faced with evaluating whether a claim that plaintiff had refused to provide his wife a <em>Get </em>would expose him to shame and condemnation within the Orthodox Jewish community. Apparently recognizing that the reasoning of <em>Klagsbrun, </em>if applied here, would be harmful to his position, plaintiff seeks to distinguish <em>Klagsbrun </em>on its facts. He contends that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\">First, ... there are no issues that require the lower court to inquire into the nature of the <em>Get </em>and under what circumstances it may or may not be given---Second, none of the defendants in this case are Rabbis. Third, unlike in <em>Klagsbmn, </em>the defamatory statement here was not a notice or decree from a Rabbi but a full newspaper article. Fourth, this case involves issues other than defamation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>such as invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress, which require their own separate First Amendment analysis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Addressing those contentions in that order, we have already rejected his first claim and need not discuss it further. As to the second, we do not view the profession of the defendants as central in any way to the court\u2019s analysis in <em>Klagsbrun, </em>because the court focused on the application of religious doctrine as the basis for abstention, not the profession of the defendants. As to plaintiffs third argument, we conclude that the forum in which the defamatory statement was issued is not a factor that requires a different result from that reached in <em>Klagsbrun, </em>because regardless of the forum, the dispute in question cannot be resolved without \u201cdelv[ing] dangerously into questions of doctrine and faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 739. As to plaintiffs fourth argument, we agree that each cause of action requires separate analysis, but this is not a basis for distinguishing <em>Klagsbrun. </em>It merely requires us to explore plaintiffs two other causes of action separately, which we proceed to do shortly.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Implicit in plaintiffs argument that he is entitled to reversal is a contention that when a cause of action is secular in nature, and the defendants are not religious figures, there can be no excessive entanglement. We disagree. Where, as here, a jury cannot evaluate plaintiffs defamation claim without developing a keen understanding of religious doctrine, and without applying such religious doctrine in a fact-sensitive and nuanced fashion, the excessive entanglement that the Founders sought to avoid is squarely presented. Thus, we conclude that neither the secular nature of the cause of action nor the secular professions of the defendants serve as a per se bar to a finding of a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">In sum, as to plaintiffs defamation claim, we conclude, for the same reasons expressed by Judge Miller in the Law Division, and by Judge Ackerman and the Third Circuit in <em>Klagsbrun, </em>that plaintiffs defamation claim cannot be resolved by the application of \u201cneutral principles\u201d of law but instead inevitably requires the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>application of religious doctrine, practices and belief that the First Amendment forbids.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The elements of a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress require a plaintiff to prove that the defendant acted intentionally or recklessly; the conduct was extreme and outrageous; the defendant\u2019s actions were a proximate cause of the plaintiffs emotional distress; and the emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff was \u201c \u2018so severe that no reasonable man could be expected to endure it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Buckley v. Trenton Sav. Fund Soc\u2019y, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>355, 366, 544 A.2d 857 (1988) (quoting <em>Restatement </em>(Second) of Torts, \u00a7 46 comment j).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The first and third elements of such cause of action are susceptible to resolution without the application of religious doctrine; however, we conclude that no jury could evaluate whether the conduct was \u201cextreme and outrageous,\u201d or whether the conduct caused plaintiff to suffer \u201csevere\u201d emotional distress, without understanding whether the accusation made in <em>The Jewish Press, </em>when it falsely included plaintiffs name in its <em>Seruv </em>Listing, would be viewed as \u201cextreme and outrageous,\u201d within the Orthodox Jewish community. Nor could a secular jury determine whether such a false <em>Seruv </em>Listing would cause a person of that faith to suffer \u201csevere\u201d <em>emotional </em>distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">So viewed, plaintiffs intentional infliction of emotional distress claim suffers from the same excessive entanglement obstacles as does his defamation claim. For that reason, we reject as meritless his contention that Judge Miller\u2019s dismissal of his intentional infliction of emotional distress claim was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">Last, we address plaintiffs claim that Judge Miller wrongly dismissed his cause of action for invasion of privacy/false light. To prevail on such claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>a defendant interfered with the plaintiffs right to be left alone, and did so by portraying him in a false light in the public eye. Such depiction of a plaintiff \u201cneed not be defamatory, but must be something that would be objectionable to the ordinary reasonable person.\u201d <em>Rumbauskas v. Cantor, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>173, 180, 649 A.2d 853 (1994). We need not tarry long on discussion of this claim because, like plaintiffs two other causes of action, a jury could not resolve this one without \u201cdelving dangerously\u201d into issues of religious doctrine. A jury could not determine whether the accusation of withholding a <em>Get </em>would be objectionable to a person of the Orthodox Jewish faith without analyzing tenets of Orthodox Jewish doctrine. For that reason, this claim, like the other two, was properly dismissed on abstention grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">In affirming the dismissal of all of plaintiffs claims, we are not unmindful of the consequences of such dismissal. The right to maintain one\u2019s \u201cgood name, unimpaired\u201d has its roots in \u201cthe essential dignity and worth of every human being-a concept at the root of any decent system of ordered liberty.\u201d <em>Senna v. Florimont, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>469, 479, 958 A.2d 427 (2008) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Thus, any order that prevents a plaintiff from pursuing what may well be a meritorious claim for the destruction of his good name imposes a harsh consequence on a plaintiff. However, as Judge Ackerman aptly observed in <em>Klagsbrun, </em>\u201cFirst Amendment jurisprudence has traditionally \u2018called for line drawing\u2019 by the courts to best effectuate its rather lofty goals.\u201d <em>Klagsbrun, supra, </em>53 F.Supp.2d at 737 (quoting <em>Lynch v. Donnelly, </em>465 <em>U.S. </em>668, 678, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>1355, 1362, 79 L.Ed.2d 604, 613 (1984)). We are forced here to set the boundary between the secular and the ecclesiastical and, in our view, because plaintiffs claims cannot be resolved without excessive entanglement into religious beliefs, we are left with no alternative other than the dismissal of plaintiffs claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-7\"> This Hebrew term translates as \"using insults.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b247-8\"> Also known as a <em>Beth Din </em>or a <em>Beit Din, </em>the <em>Bais Din </em>is a rabbinical court composed of a minimum of three rabbis who are authorised to pass upon questions of Jewish law and practice presented to them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b247-9\"> A <em>Seruv </em>is an order of contempt issued by a <em>Bais Din, </em>a rabbinical court, to a husband who refuses to comply with the order of the <em>Bais Din </em>to give his wife a <em>Get. </em>A person issued a <em>Seruv </em>is known as a <em>mesarev ledin. </em>Such person must be shunned by all Orthodox Jews.
