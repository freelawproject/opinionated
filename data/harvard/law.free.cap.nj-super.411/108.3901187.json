In particular, must a parent seeking modification of a court order regarding custody of her child bear the threshold burden of establishing \u201cchanged circumstances that affect the welfare of the child[,]\u201d <em>Hand v. Hand, </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>102, 105, 917 A.2d 269 (App.Div.2007), when the court-ordered parent of primary residence (PPR) is a member of the United States military about to be deployed for a year away from home? We conclude that the moving party is not entitled to a parental presumption that modification is warranted solely because of the PPR\u2019s military deployment. However, we also conclude that once an otherwise fit parent demonstrates that the PPR is facing deployment for a significant period of time, in our view, one year or more, she has demonstrated a prima facie case and is entitled to a plenary hearing as to disputed material facts regarding the child\u2019s best interests, and whether those best interests are served by modification of the existing custody order.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">We therefore reverse the order under review to the extent that it dismissed defendant\u2019s motion without prejudice, and remand the matter to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">Plaintiff and defendant were married on January 11, 1997, and divorced on December 11, 2001. Their union produced a son, Billy, who was born in 1997.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs subsequent application in 2002 to settle disputes over custody, parenting time and support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>resulted in an order setting the matter down for trial. While it is unclear whether a plenary hearing was conducted on all issues, the court entered a subsequent order, dated July 26, 2002 (the 2002 order), that provided in pertinent part: 1) \u201cjoint legal custody\u201d would continue; 2) plaintiff would be the PPR \u201cexcept [defendant would] be the [PPR] ... during school summer vacations\u201d; 3) \u201c[d]uring school summer vacations ... [defendant would] have custody ... approximately 70% of the summer vacation and [plaintiff] approximately 30% of the time\u201d; and 4) defendant would have \u201cthe child for [three] weekends each month as determined by the parties____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Plaintiff subsequently agreed to vacate defendant\u2019s child support obligations; in January 2008, however, he moved to reinstate them and sought reduction of defendant\u2019s parenting time as provided by the 2002 order. He also asked the court to prohibit \u201cany and all discussions with the minor ... pertaining to a change in primary residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Defendant opposed the motion and cross-moved seeking modification of the 2002 order herself. In general, she alleged that plaintiff had failed to comply with provisions that required counseling sessions for the entire family; that plaintiff was not sharing parenting information with her; and that plaintiff had adopted a \u201cmilitary approach to childrearing,\u201d which included corporal punishment. As a result, she claimed Billy had become fearful and anxious. Defendant also claimed that her son\u2019s medical needs were neglected. She sought a temporary transfer of custody while further information was gathered through a risk assessment and psychological evaluation of her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">The motion judge entered an order on February 1, 2008 that thoroughly addressed all the issues presented by both sides. He refused to reduce defendant\u2019s parenting time because plaintiff \u201cha[d] not pointed to any change in circumstances that would warrant a change____\u201d He ordered both parties not to \u201cdiscuss the litigation with the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>The judge also denied defendant\u2019s motion to be designated PPR \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d He noted that the issue essentially involved \u201cparenting time,\u201d and must be referred, in the first instance, to mediation. <em>See R. </em>5:8-1. As a result, he ordered both parties to \u201cparticipate in mediation to attempt to resolve their current dispute over custody and parenting time.\u201d Failing resolution, both parties were ordered to participate in a \u201cCustody Neutral Assessment\u201d (CNA), the costs of which were to be shared equally. The judge permitted either side to \u201cfile an appropriate motion\u201d if the matter was thereafter still unresolved. Significantly, the judge determined that \u201c[djefendant ha[d] not established a sufficient reason to transfer custody on a motion.\u201d Lastly, the judge granted defendant\u2019s request \u201cto arrange for counseling sessions for the child____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The CNA was completed on August 28, 2008 by Robert B. Haynes, Ph.D. Haynes interviewed plaintiff, who was employed by the Army, had now re-married for a third time, and lived in Burlington County with his new wife, Billy, and two stepsons. Plaintiff reported no major problems with Billy\u2019s health, no behavioral problems, and no educational problems, with the exception of Billy\u2019s poor grades in mathematics, his son\u2019s \u201cmost troubling subject.\u201d Billy had been in the same school system since kindergarten, and plaintiff arranged for tutoring and enrollment in \u201can early intervention program.... \u201d Plaintiff denied any excessive discipline or corporal punishment directed toward his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Haynes noted that routinely Billy would be alone when he returned home from school, but plaintiff reported that someone would arrive shortly thereafter. On one occasion, plaintiff recounted that the Division of Youth and Family Services \u201cwas contacted regarding [Billy] being left alone after school.\u201d The matter was investigated, and \u201cdropped without incident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Haynes interviewed defendant. At that time, she resided in a two-family home in Bergen County, approximately two hours from plaintiff, with her mother, brother and six-year old son from another relationship. She too reported that Billy suffered from no significant behavioral or health problems, but claimed he was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>\u201c \u2018horrible student.\u2019 \u201d Defendant felt it was inappropriate for Billy \u201cto be home by himself after school for any length of time.\u201d She wanted the judge to decide \u201cwhether [Billy\u2019s] being home alone [wa]s permissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Lastly, Haynes interviewed Billy, who told him that his parents\u2019 divorce \u201cha[d] been tough on him.\u201d He liked his father\u2019s new wife who \u201cencourage[d]\u201d him to be artistically creative, and \u201cstated that both parents ha[d] qualities that he like[d].\u201d The child genuinely appreciated both of his parents. Nonetheless, Haynes opined that Billy \u201cseemed sad,\u201d and expressed a desire to \u201c \u2018be more popular\u2019 \u201d during the upcoming school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Haynes recommended that Billy receive counseling, and he urged the parties to \u201copen[ ] up ... for appropriate, child-focused communication ... for [Billy\u2019s] sake.\u201d Expressing concern for Billy\u2019s \u201cgrades in sehool[,]\u201d Haynes believed the early intervention program and private tutoring were \u201ccrucial for [Billy\u2019s] success.\u201d He noted that it was \u201cmore difficult to change school systems after the school year\u201d began. Haynes made no other specific recommendations, finding that \u201cboth parents love their son and desire[d] to have him reside with them ____\u201d He believed that \u201cneither parent [wa]s trying to alienate their son from the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">In January 2009, defendant sought, by order to show cause, the immediate transfer of custody because of plaintiffs impending deployment as a military reservist, initially out of state, but thereafter, overseas.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The same judge that had considered the prior motion and cross-motion denied the application, finding no \u201cprobability of immediate and irreparable harm.... \u201d In a short written statement of his reasons, the judge noted that \u201cplaintiffs upcoming deployment ... [wa]s not a sudden development\u201d and \u201cwas known to the parties well in advance.\u201d He further noted that Billy was \u201ccurrently enrolled in school,\u201d and that defendant had made \u201cno showing that the child w[ould] be harmed in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>way if, pending the filing of a motion, the child eontinue[d] to live with plaintiffs spouse in the same house he ha[d] been living in.\u201d The judge also noted that \u201cdefendant\u2019s contention that this deployment will immediately and adversely affect [Billy] w[ould] need further development, most likely with the benefit of a custody expert analysis.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Defendant immediately moved to modify custody and parenting time, and also sought child support if she was awarded custody of Billy. Noting that \u201c[t]here [wa]s not much more to say ... since last February,\u201d i.e., the denial of her prior cross-motion, defendant characterized the reason for her current application as \u201csimple.\u201d She certified that plaintiff had recently informed her that he was about to be \u201cdeployed in Iraq for a year[,]\u201d that he was leaving at the end of January, and that \u201che expected his wife to care for [Billy] and ... have primary residential custody.\u201d Defendant claimed Billy \u201cshould ... live with [her] in the absence of his father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Defendant reiterated her ability to care for Billy. She noted that plaintiffs wife, who was also in the military, sometimes had to leave home during the work week, resulting in all three children being left in the care of plaintiffs parents. Defendant argued that she provided \u201cthe preferred living arrangement for [Billy] in his father\u2019s absence[,]\u201d and suggested that upon plaintiffs return from service, the parties \u201cc[ould] re-evaluate the child\u2019s needs____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Defendant further claimed that if Billy did not live with her during plaintiffs absence, \u201cit would negatively impact him emotionally,\u201d though she provided no details or support for that conclusion. She stated that she was \u201copen to reasonable visitation arrangements\u201d so her son could \u201ccontinue to see his step-family and his paternal family.\u201d In sum, defendant sought \u201cfull residential custody of [Billy]\u201d while plaintiff was deployed overseas, along with reasonable child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Plaintiff opposed the motion. He noted that he would be deployed in February 2009 \u201cfor one year or less.\u201d He claimed that Billy was \u201cextremely close\u201d to his step-siblings, and all three children \u201clive[d] and play[ed] together well.\u201d Before being deployed to Iraq, plaintiff was to spend the first three months of his active duty in the United States. He noted that he would be accorded one extended leave which would permit him to return home and see his son. He also explained that while stationed in Iraq, it would be difficult to contact home, and it would be even more difficult if he had to contact defendant to speak to his son. Plaintiff took the opportunity to add that defendant\u2019s house was a \u201cmess,\u201d that several people lived with her, and that Billy \u201coften ... d[id] not have a place to sleep\u201d when he stayed with her. Plaintiff agreed to \u201callow extra [parenting] time for ... defendant\u201d while he was deployed.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">In a reply certification, defendant alleged that plaintiffs wife \u201cstrongly believe[d] that [Billy] should move in\u201d with defendant while plaintiff was deployed. Defendant also alleged that plaintiffs wife told her that the couple was experiencing \u201csevere marital problems,\u201d and that plaintiffs parents were behind the opposition to any change in custody. She denied the allegations plaintiff made about the condition of her home and her care of Billy.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The same judge considered oral argument on the motion on February 13, 2009, and entered his order, along with a comprehensive written opinion, the same day. After reviewing the parties\u2019 contentions, he first noted that plaintiff was on active military duty, and thus was entitled to the protections afforded by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38:23C-4. The judge noted, however, that while that statute provided that \u201cno judgment or final order\u201d shall be entered against a litigant while on active military duty, he did not intend to enter a final order in the matter.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>The judge concluded that \u201cthere [wa]s no need [for] a change of custody [to] immediately occur.\u201d He noted that Billy was in the \u201csame school ... he ha[d] always attended[,]\u201d was near his friends, and was having his medical needs met. The child \u201cdid not report any problems with the care provided by plaintiffs wife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The judge also found that defendant did not view the change in custody request as \u201c \u2018temporary,\u2019 \u201d but rather suggested that the issue should be revisited when plaintiff returned from active duty. He noted that Billy was not residing with \u201ca distant family member or friend\u201d while his father was away, but rather would be in an \u201cintact family unit\u201d of which he had been a part since 2002.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge also considered the fact that a change in residential custody would disrupt Billy\u2019s school year which was more than half completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">In conclusion, the judge found that there was \u201cno competent evidence produced by defendant that the child w[ould] not be well-cared for by plaintiffs spouse. There [wa]s no evidence that the child\u2019s best interests w[ould] be served ... by an abrupt change of custody.\u201d The judge further rejected defendant\u2019s assertion that \u201ca child should always be with a biological parent[J\u201d noting that \u201c \u2018rule\u2019 \u201d could not be applied where a child was in the middle of the school year in a stable home. He denied defendant\u2019s motion for an immediate change of custody \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">However, the judge decided to increase defendant\u2019s parenting time to every weekend and all school holidays. He increased defendant\u2019s summer parenting time, ordering Billy to reside with her all summer, except for two weekends each month. The judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>also ordered a \u201ccustody evaluation\u201d after which he anticipated either party could apply again for modification of his order. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Defendant contends that it was \u201can error of law and an abuse of discretion for\u201d the judge to refuse to modify the 2002 order and award her residential custody of Billy while plaintiff was deployed. Ancillary to this core argument, she contends that the judge speculated regarding the impact plaintiffs deployment would have upon Billy instead of relying upon expert opinion; improperly granted a preference to a third-party instead of the child\u2019s biological mother; and improperly designated the child\u2019s stepmother as the primary caregiver by proxy for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Plaintiff contends that defendant failed to establish a prima facie case for modification of the 2002 order, and that the judge\u2019s decision in this regal\u2019d is entitled to our significant deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">We begin by stating some first principles that guide our review. The touchstone for all custody determinations has always been \u201cthe best interest[s] of the child.\u201d <em>Kinsella v. Kinsella, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>276, 317, 696 A.2d 556 (1997). \u201cCustody issues are resolved using a best interests analysis that gives weight to the factors set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-4(c).\u201d <em>Hand, supra, </em>391 N.J.Super. at 105, 917 A.2d 269. That statute permits a judge to make \u201c[a]ny ... custody arrangement ... in the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-4(e). The statute requires a judge to consider and weigh a myriad of factors before making any custodial determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-10\">In making an award of custody, the court shall consider but not be limited to the following factors: the parents\u2019 ability to agree, communicate and cooperate in matters relating to the child; the parents\u2019 willingness to accept custody and any history of unwillingness to allow parenting time not based on substantiated abuse; the interaction and relationship of the child with its parents and siblings; the history of domestic violence, if any; the safety of the child and the safety of either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>parent from physical abuse by the other parent; the preference of the child when of sufficient age and capacity to reason so as to form an intelligent decision; the needs of the child; the stability of the home environment offered; the qualify and continuity of the child\u2019s education; the fitness of the parents; the geographical proximity of the parents\u2019 homes; the extent and quality of the time spent with the child prior to or subsequent to the separation; the parents\u2019 employment responsibilities; and the age and number of the children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-5\">[Ibid.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Absent exigent circumstances, changes in custody should not be ordered without a full plenary hearing. <em>R. </em>5:8-6; <em>Entress v. Entress, </em>376 <em>N.J.Super. </em>125, 133, 869 A.2d 451 (App.Div.2005). That is so because, as we have noted in another context, even \u201ca temporary decision to change custody can take on a life of its own, creating a new status quo.\u201d <em>Peregoy v. Peregoy, </em>358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>179, 203, 817 A.2d 381 (App.Div.2003). The status quo ante is significant because \u201c[a] party seeking to modify custody must demonstrate changed circumstances that affect the welfare of the child[ j.\u201d <em>Hand, supra, </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 105, 917 A.2d 269; <em>Beck v. Beck, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>480, 496 n. 8, 432 A.2d 63 (1981); <em>see Todd v. Sheridan, </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>387, 398, 633 A.2d 1009 (App.Div.1993) (holding that a moving party must demonstrate \u201cchanged circumstances which would have an impact on the child\u2019s welfare\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">There exists, however, an equally weighty set of first principles that defendant is quick to bring to our attention. Our courts have recognized that \u201ca legal parent has a fundamental right to the care, custody and nurturance of his or her child.\u201d <em>V.C. v. M.J.B., </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>200, 218, 748 A.2d 539 (2000) (citing <em>Watkins v. Nelson, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>235, 245, 748 A.2d 558 (2000)), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 <em>U.S. </em>926, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>302, 148 L.Ed.2d 243 (2000); <em>Matter of </em>D.T., 200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>171, 176, 491 A.2d 7 (App.Div.1985). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-4 specifically provides that \u201c[i]n any proceeding involving the custody of a minor child, the rights of both parents shall be equal .... \u201d As a result, \u201cthe concept that a presumption of custody exists in favor of a parent, and that only a showing of unfitness, abandonment, gross misconduct, or \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 will overcome this presumption, is steeped in the history and common law of this State.\u201d <em>Watkins, supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 246, 748 A.2d 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Thus, \u201cwhen the dispute is between a fit parent and a third party, only the fit parent is presumed to be entitled to custody.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253, 748 A.2d 558. \u201c[T]he child\u2019s best interest is advanced by not awarding custody to the parent\u201d only if the presumption is rebutted by \u201capplication of the parental termination standard or a finding of \u2018exceptional circumstances[,]\u2019\u201d <em>ibid., </em>such as \u201cthe third party halving] become a psychological parent\u201d to the child. <em>Id. </em>at 254, 748 A.2d 558. As a result, \u201cthe best interest of the child cannot validly ground an award of custody to a third party over the objection of a fit parent without an initial court finding that the standard for termination of the rights of a non-consenting parent or the \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 prong has been satisfied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255, 748 A.2d 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">We now consider these basic principles and their application to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Defendant\u2019s argument may be distilled to an essential point. In seeking modification of the 2002 order, she need not demonstrate a change of circumstances that affect Billy\u2019s welfare, because, as between herself and plaintiffs current wife, defendant is presumed to be entitled to custody of her son. Since plaintiff did not rebut this presumption by demonstrating defendant was unfit, or that \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d existed, the judge erred in not awarding her immediate residential custody of Billy while plaintiff was deployed on active military duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Plaintiffs retort is that the dispute is not between defendant and a third-party, but, rather between two natural parents. Since he is the PPR, defendant bore the burden of demonstrating changed circumstances that affected Billy\u2019s welfare such that modification was warranted. Plaintiff contends defendant failed to do this, and the judge correctly determined not to alter the status quo.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">We recognize that defendant\u2019s argument is intuitively appealing. As a fit parent who has exercised significant and regular parenting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>time with her son, why should she not be granted immediate residential custody of Billy while his father is deployed overseas? However, a careful examination of the facts presented in <em>Watkins </em>serves to readily distinguish it from this matter. As a result, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that seeks to rigidly apply a presumption in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">In <em>Watkins, supra, </em>the Court was called upon to decide the appropriate standard to apply in a custody dispute between a child\u2019s father, the plaintiff, and her maternal grandparents, the defendants. 163 <em>N.J. </em>at 237, 748 A.2d 558. The child\u2019s mother had died shortly after giving birth, and the child had thereafter been raised by the defendants. <em>Ibid. </em>The defendants refused the father\u2019s request for custody and filed an action pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-5 seeking an order granting them custody of their granddaughter.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 238, 748 A.2d 558. The Court noted that even upon the death of the custodial parent, the statute \u201cprecludes the surviving non-custodial parent\u2019s automatic accession to custody of his or her child .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243, 748 A.2d 558. Instead, the Family Part is empowered to consider the custody issue during \u201cthe time period between the death of the custodial parent and the ultimate transfer of custody.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">In such disputes, the Court enunciated the analytic framework as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>[I]t is the relationship of the child to the person seeking custody that determines the standard to be used in deciding the custody dispute. When the dispute is between two fit parents, the best interest of the child standard controls because both parents are presumed to be equally entitled to custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">The child\u2019s best interest rebuts the presumption in favor of one of the fit parents. But, when the dispute is between a fit parent and a third party, only the fit parent is presumed to be entitled to custody. In that context, the child\u2019s welfare is protected because the presumption in favor of the fit parent is rebuttable. Once the presumption in favor of a fit parent is rebutted ..., the child\u2019s best interest is advanced by not awarding custody to the parent. Viewed in that context, in custody determinations between a fit parent and a third party, ... the child\u2019s best interests become a factor only after the parental termination standard has been met, rather than the determinative standard itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 253, 748 A.2d 558.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The Court announced this paradigm, however, in a factual context far different from the one presented here. In <em>Watkins, </em>the custodial parent had died. Therefore, an ultimate decision had to be made as between third-parties with de facto custody who were now seeking court approval, and a natural parent opposing their attempts and seeking custody himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">In this ease, plaintiffs current wife, who defendant argues is the analogous third-party in the <em>Watkins </em>framework, is not seeking custody of Billy. In our view, this distinction is critical. Unlike the father in <em>Watkins </em>who faced the denial of custody and a significant curtailment of his parental rights, defendant in this case faces no such consequences. Indeed, she continues to share legal custody of Billy with plaintiff, and the judge significantly increased her parenting time.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">There are other reasons why the parental presumption ought not to apply when the PPR is facing <em>temporary </em>military deployment. In <em>Watkins, </em>the custodial parent\u2019s death created an unalterable set of circumstances. The child in that case could never be reunited with the parent who previously had exercised primary, albeit short-lived, custody. That is clearly not the ease here. Instead, plaintiff will hopefully return from his deployment in good health and in a relatively short, finite period of time, after which he can resume his relationship with Billy as before.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Lastly, in <em>Watkins, </em>neither the deceased mother nor the plaintiff/father had ever sought a court order defining their custodial relationship with their child. As a result, the Court was affirming the basic tenet that as between a third-party and a natural parent, the parent need not bear the initial burden of proving that it was in the child\u2019s best interests to award him custody because he provided a better home than that provided by the interested third-party. <em>See Watkins, supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 252, 748 A.2d 558 (discussing the desire to \u201creduce or minimize judicial opportunity to engage in social engineering\u201d by not turning every custody conflict \u201cinto a \u2018fitness contest\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">In this case, however, the 2002 order defined the custodial relationship between Billy\u2019s parents, and it resulted from both parties submitting their initial dispute to the jurisdiction of the Family Part for resolution. As we have noted, \u201c[a] judgment, whether reached by consent or adjudication, embodies a best interests determination.\u201d <em>Todd, supra, </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 398, 633 A.2d 1009. Moreover, as the Court has noted in other contexts,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">[W]hen ... <em>both </em>parents have a fundamental right to the care and nurturing of their children and neither has a preeminent right over the other, their contest stands on different footing. It is not a third party or the State that seeks to intrude into the protected sphere of family autonomy. Rather, by submitting their dispute to the court, it is the parties themselves who essentially seek the impairment of each other\u2019s rights. In that circumstance, the State is thrust into the role of \u201cmediator by necessity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">Indeed, by seeking a divorce and invoking the jurisdiction of the Family Part, each party assented to the possibility that there will be some curtailment of what would otherwise be the ordinary rights concomitant to parenthood. For example, a party may be denied custody. Visitation may be circumscribed. Vacations may be shared or lost. One parent may be granted the right to move away with the child. All such orders impair to some extent one of the parties\u2019 parental rights, and the party participants are deemed to have consented to the possibility of such impairment when they submit, their disagreement to a court.. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-9\">In such cases, the sole benchmark is the best interests of the child. <em>[Sacharow v. Sacharow, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>62, 79-80, 826 A.2d 710 (2003) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">We might assume that the difficult questions posed by this appeal are being raised in courtrooms throughout the United States, and that decisional law from our sister jurisdictions could provide us with guidance. However, no reported decision was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>brought to our attention by either party, and our own independent research has disclosed few that discuss the issues in this context. However, those reported cases support our conclusion that the parental presumption does not apply to this dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">In one case, a father facing a second deployment to Iraq as an Air Force reservist sought modification of the existing parenting plan previously incorporated in the parties\u2019 divorce decree. <em>In re Marriage of DePalma, </em>176 P.3d 829, 831 (Colo.App.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>2008 WL 434613, 2008 Colo. LEXIS 149 (Colo. Feb. 19, 2008). He sought an increase of his parenting time so as \u201cto allow the children to spend equal time with each parent.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Additionally, he \u201crequested that the parenting time schedule remain in effect when he was stationed in Iraq.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The father asserted that his children\u2019s best interests would be served by having his new wife exercise his parenting time because bonds had been created between the children, their stepmother, and her son. <em>Ibid. </em>In opposing the motion, the mother contended that it was an attempt to \u201cimpermissibly ... establish parental rights for [the husband\u2019s] new wife that [she] could not have obtained in her own right, and that [the] mother should not be required to decrease her parenting time in favor of a nonparent.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>After conducting two plenary hearings, the trial \u201ccourt ordered that the children should be in the care of [the] stepmother during [the] father\u2019s parenting time as he had requested.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The mother appealed. Among other things, she argued \u201cthat the trial court erred in holding that [the] father could choose to delegate his parenting time to [the] stepmother while he is deployed or otherwise unavailable for extended periods of time[,]\u201d and \u201cthat the court failed to accord her the presumptions to which she was entitled as the children\u2019s natural mother .... \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The appellate court first noted that \u201c[i]n determining a custodial dispute between a parent and a nonparent, Colorado courts recognize a presumption that a biological parent has a first and prior right to the custody of his or her child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 832 (citation omitted). However, the court noted that \u201c[b]ecause the dispute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>was between mother and father, and not between mother and stepmother, the presumption that a parent has a \u2018first and prior\u2019 right to the custody of his or her child was not implicated____\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, \u201cwhen two fit parents disagree, the court must weigh the wishes of both to determine what is in the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The appellate court then rejected the mother\u2019s contention \u201cthat the trial court effectively granted parenting time to [the] stepmother\u201d or that it had \u201cextended] \u2018special rights\u2019 to [the] stepmother[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 833. The court affirmed the lower court\u2019s order because it did \u201cnot perceive that it was an abuse of discretion to modify the plan to accommodate the best interests of the children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">A case that provides less analysis of the issue is <em>Lebo v. Lebo, </em>886 So.2d 491, 493 (La.Ct.App.2004). There, a post-judgment order named the plaintiff/father as the \u201cdomiciliary parent\u201d of the parties\u2019 child and further set forth the terms of their custody arrangement. <em>Id. </em>at 492. Prior to his military deployment, the plaintiff executed a power of attorney in favor of his current wife, giving her authority to act on behalf of the child. <em>Ibid. </em>When the defendant/mother refused to return the child at the expiration of her parenting time, the stepmother \u201csought a civil warrant for the return of the child to her, which the Ltrial] court granted.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">On appeal, the mother argued that she should have \u201clegal custody of the minor child ... since the [stepmother] could not have custody in preference to her____\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Louisiana Court of Appeals rejected this argument, noting that as \u201cdomiciliary parent,\u201d the father had \u201cthe authority to make all decisions affecting the child unless otherwise provided in a custody implementation order.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court continued that \u201ca domiciliary parent\u2019s major decisions are presumed to be in the child\u2019s best interest, subject to review by the court upon motion of the other parent.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citation omitted). Thus, \u201c[the father] was acting within his authority in leaving his child in the care of his current wife.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>However, the court also noted that the father did not have authority \u201cto unilaterally change custody of a minor child as [he] apparently attempted to do in his power of attorney.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 492-93. It reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of the mother\u2019s motion for temporary custody, and remanded the matter for a hearing as to the child\u2019s best interests. <em>Id. </em>at 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Similarly, the Supreme Court of Kansas rejected application of the parental presumption to a custody dispute between a father, who was the custodial parent and about to be deployed to Korea for one year, and the children\u2019s mother, also in the military but soon to retire. <em>In re Marriage of Rayman, </em>273 <em>Kan. </em>996, 47 P.3d 413, 41 (2002). Noting the custody dispute was between two parents, the court determined \u201cthe parental preference doctrine [is] not applicable to the facts of [the] case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 416. Likening the facts presented to \u201ctemporary changes which relate to nonmilitary custodial relationships[,]\u201d the court affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision denying the mother\u2019s modification request, and maintaining primary custody with the father during his absence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 416-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">We are firmly convinced that the distinctions we have raised between the facts presented in <em>Watkins </em>and those presented here, and the limited jurisprudence from our sister states, require us to reject defendant\u2019s argument that the parental presumption applies to this dispute such that she was entitled to immediate residential custody of Billy solely because of plaintiffs military deployment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>In this regard, we conclude the motion judge appropriately denied defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Throughout the proceedings below, defendant\u2019s consistent position was that no hearing was required because she was presumptively entitled to residential custody of Billy. Thus, her motion never sought an investigation by the Family Division, <em>Rule </em>5:8-1, an investigation by a neutral expert appointed by the court, <em>Rule </em>5:3-3(e), additional discovery, or a plenary hearing. She simply sought an immediate change of residential custody based upon the parental presumption. To the extent defendant has not requested alternative relief from us, we could, perhaps, end our consideration of the issues presented at this point and affirm the motion judge\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">However, we conclude that \u201cour <em>parens patriae </em>responsibility to protect the welfare of children,\u201d Hand, <em>supra, </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 104, 917 A.2d 269, requires us to remand the matter, and for that reason, we need to address the following: if defendant is not presumptively entitled to immediate residential custody of Billy simply because of plaintiffs deployment, what standard should apply to her motion? Plaintiff contends that this situation is no different than any traditional custody dispute between two fit parents, and therefore requires analysis under the same framework. Plaintiff argues that his military deployment, standing alone, is insufficient to meet the burden of demonstrating changed circumstances that affect Billy\u2019s welfare. In part, he contends it would be \u201cagainst public policy\u201d to permit his deployment to \u201cnegatively affect [his] custody\u201d rights because our military personnel would be \u201cdiscouraged\u201d from service as a result. He further contends that without \u201cexpert or evaluator opinion on the matter,\u201d the judge properly denied defendant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">The issue, however, is two-fold and sequential. Defendant must first make \u201ca <em>prima facie </em>showing ... that a genuine issue of fact exists bearing upon a critical question such as the best interests of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>the child[ ] ....\u201d <em>Pfeiffer v. Ilson, </em>318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>13, 14, 722 A.2d 966 (App.Div.1999). Once a prima facie showing is made, defendant is entitled to a plenary hearing to resolve the disputed facts. <em>Hand, supra, </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 111, 917 A.2d 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">A plenary hearing must be conducted where \u201cthe custody of children is a genuine and substantial issue____\u201d <em>R. </em>5:8-6. \u201c[WJhen the submissions show there is a genuine and substantial factual dispute regarding the welfare of the children,\u201d the \u201cplenary hearing is necessary to resolve the factual dispute.\u201d <em>Hand, supra, </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 105, 917 A.2d 269 (citing <em>Shaw v. Shaw, </em>138 <em>N.J.Super. </em>436, 440, 351 A.2d 374 (App.Div.1976)). Frequently, the factual disputes are evident based upon the conflicting certifications of the parties, or based upon evaluative reports regarding the child\u2019s condition. <em>See, e.g. Mackowski v. Mackowski, </em>317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>8, 10, 721 A.2d 12 (App.Div.1998) (holding that certifications of parent and child regarding her desire to live with her father were sufficient to warrant a plenary hearing); <em>Dorfman v. Dorfman, </em>315 <em>N.J.Super. </em>511, 518, 719 A.2d 178 (App.Div.1998) (holding that a plenary hearing was necessary based upon mother\u2019s certification and school social worker\u2019s report of child\u2019s behavioral problems).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">We agree that but for plaintiffs impending deployment, defendant\u2019s conelusory certifications would have been insufficient to warrant a plenary hearing. She herself admitted that little had changed since the February 2008 order that denied her prior request for modification of the 2002 order. However, we also conclude that defendant met her burden of demonstrating a prima facie change of circumstances that affected Billy\u2019s welfare based solely upon plaintiffs impending deployment. As a result, she was entitled to a plenary hearing to resolve any disputes of material fact remaining after the custody evaluation ordered by the judge was completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">We are hard-pressed to see how defendant did not, in the first instance, establish that a significant change of circumstances in Billy\u2019s life was about to occur because of that plaintiff will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>physically separated from Billy for twelve months, with very little contact in the interim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He acknowledged in his certification that it would be difficult to contact his son. Thus, it is undisputed that plaintiff will not exercise traditional custody over Billy for a significant period of time. In this sense, the circumstances of Billy\u2019s day-to-day residential custody have clearly changed, albeit temporarily, since the entry of the 2002 order. <em>See Sheehan v. Sheehan, </em>51 <em>N.J.Super. </em>276, 288, 143 A.2d 874 (App.Div.) (recognizing court\u2019s obligation to examine the circumstances as they existed at the time the original order was entered), <em>certif. denied, </em>28 <em>N.J. </em>147, 145 A.2d 358 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Plaintiffs pending deployment for an entire year, in itself, was a circumstance of such magnitude, and likely to affect Billy\u2019s welfare, that defendant need not have awaited the passage of time and the consequences of plaintiffs absence vis-a-vis their son, to seek modification.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In other words, if legal or residential custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>is contested, a parent\u2019s military deployment and absence from the home for a significant period of time is sufficient for the Family Part to \u201corder an investigation of the [situation],\u201d in search of a \u201cmeaningful solution[] to serve the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>Dorfman, supra, </em>315 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 518, 719 A.2d 178. This is not to say that the non-deploying parent is necessarily entitled to modification; we only hold that defendant in this case established a prima facie case for modification and the matter should have been set down for a plenary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Undoubtedly, the judge agreed this was his obligation because he ordered a custody evaluation and denied defendant\u2019s motion <em>without </em>prejudice. Clearly, he viewed his decision as a temporary one based primarily upon the likely disruption caused to Billy if he was required to relocate in the middle of his school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">We cannot discern why the judge chose to deny the motion without prejudice rather than setting a date for a future hearing after receipt of the custody evaluation. Denying the motion triggered defendant\u2019s right to appeal. In our view, this short-circuited not only the process that the judge anticipated would occur\u2014defendant advised at oral argument no custody evaluation had taken place\u2014but also the evaluative process that is required in these circumstances. As a result, we must reverse the order of dismissal and remand the matter for further proceedings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Given the current state of our armed forces and the military commitments requiring the deployment and re-deployment of our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>nation\u2019s citizen-soldiers, the dilemma confronting divorced parents of young children as to how best advance the care of those children in the absence of one parent will undoubtedly recur.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Our nation\u2019s military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan has stirred several state legislatures into action.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">California, for example, now provides that \u201c[a] party\u2019s absence ... shall not, by itself, be sufficient to justify a modification of a custody ... order if the reason for the absence ... is the party\u2019s activation to military service and deployment out of state.\u201d <em>Cal.Fam.Code </em>\u00a7 3047 (West 2005).

We cannot alleviate the pain caused to our military families whenever one parent is deployed and sent into harm\u2019s way, though we seek to shield the children of those families from as much of that trauma as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">We fully recognize that the presumptively temporary nature of the deploying parent\u2019s absence from the home creates practical problems not present whenever a court tries to resolve a more typical custody dispute. By the time a plenary hearing is held, the concerns raised by the deployment may be moot, or they may have already had their effect upon the child, thus evading our well-intentioned attempts to promote his best interests. Moreover, we do not think it fair for the returning parent to now bear the burden of demonstrating another change of circumstance warranting modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">We do not intend that our words promote the shuffling of a child back-and-forth between his parents. A judge considering a contested matter under these circumstances is entitled to utilize \u201c \u2018a basic principle of family law\u2014that the parent having physical custody of the child is generally accorded broad responsi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>bility in making daily childrearing decisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ronan v. Adely, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>103, 108, 861 A.2d 822 (2004) (quoting <em>Gubernat v. Deremer, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>120, 142, 657 A.2d 856 (1995)). We stress that a temporary modification of the existing custody order is only warranted when the judge determines it is in the child\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">We also recognize that custody evaluations, when necessary, are time-consuming and costly. After a servieemember has been deployed, conducting one may become impractical. An evaluator may easily be able to consider the circumstances in the home the deploying servieemember left behind, but he or she will undoubtedly have difficulty in contacting the deployed parent and conducting the kind of interview that routinely occurs in such evaluations. Despite these concerns, we are convinced that when confronted with a dispute of this nature, \u201cthe courts of this State should not abdicate their <em>parens patriae </em>duty to decide a custody issue on the basis of the best interests of the children.\u201d <em>Nehra v. Uhlar, </em>168 <em>N.J.Super. </em>187, 193, 402 A.2d 264 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>413, 408 A.2d 807 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">In conclusion, we hold that the parental presumption does not apply when one parent seeks modification of a previously-entered court order regarding custody solely because of the other parent\u2019s impending military deployment. We further conclude that when the military deployment is likely to last a year or more and the application is contested, the parent seeking modification, having demonstrated a prima facie case of changed circumstances that affect the child\u2019s welfare, is entitled to a plenary hearing if material facts remain disputed.
