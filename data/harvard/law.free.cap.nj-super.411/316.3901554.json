Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995), are as follows. Seconds before 7:00 a.m. on May 5, 2004, plaintiffs decedent, Alexander Bernstein, was attacked and killed by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>fellow inmate, Hassan Doss, during breakfast in the inmate dining room (IDR) at East Jersey State Prison. Doss had been sitting at a table, when he suddenly ran to where Bernstein was standing and began the attack. Bernstein was beaten for approximately four-and-one-half minutes before an emergency response team ended the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">As soon as he saw Doss attack, Sergeant John Cunningham, one of several corrections officers observing the mess hall from protective cages suspended above the mess hall floor,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> immediately activated the riot bell, then used a bullhorn to direct Doss to end the attack. When Lieutenant James Mattia, the shift commander, heard the riot bell, he alerted the star sergeant as to the incident\u2019s location, and activated the riot alarm system. Video cameras were then directed at Doss. Upon hearing the riot bell, designated officers reported to the ready room.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Two emergency response teams, each manned by twelve officers and one supervisor, assembled and donned their protective equipment, which took less than one minute. Once the teams were ready, Lieutenant Cifelli gave Cunningham the order to open the gate. Sergeants Popowych and Mikulak led the first team in while the second team remained in stand-by.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>The first team secured Doss, and reached Bernstein at 7:05:18 a.m. The victim\u2019s dire condition was immediately apparent, and the shift commander was notified by radio to call for an ambulance. Medical personnel were sent in after the IDR was secured, placing Bernstein on a gurney at about 7:08:18 a.m., approximately eight minutes and thirty-five seconds after the attack began. The nurses escorted Bernstein to the institutional hospital, which is approximately fifteen feet from the IDR\u2019s exit, and CPR was initiated. At 7:24 a.m., the Woodbridge Township Ambulance Rescue Squad arrived. Treatment continued, and at 7:30 a.m., paramedics from JFK Hospital arrived. At 7:36 a.m., Bernstein was pronounced dead by Dr. Hershkowitz of Correctional Medical Services (CMS), the independent contractor that provided medical services for the DOC.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Doss had multiple incidents of \u201c[sjpecific assaultive behavior,\u201d while in prison, including one in 1994 resulting in the hospitalization of a corrections officer. Two of eight incidents in 1999 involved Doss cutting fellow inmates with a razor. In 2000, Doss pushed a corrections officer to the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Doss has a history of paranoia and hostility. He had been prescribed antipsychotic medication in September 2001, but from late December 2003, was taking the medication only sporadically, despite the intense efforts of CMS psychiatrist Donald Reeve and psychiatric social worker Valerie Yorker to get Doss on a regular routine, lest he become more irritable. Dr. Reeve, at first, did not seek emergency or forced medication because he found Doss had not \u201cbehaved in an aggressive, provocative, or paranoid manner in the last two months.\u201d However, on March 18, 2004, a DOC sergeant brought Doss to Dr. Reeve\u2019s office, because a \u201cwing officer note[d] that Mr. Doss [was] withdrawn and hostile and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>[did] not appear himself.\u201d Because of this shift in behavior, Doss was placed on suicide watch for a short while and then returned to his prison cell. On April 2, 2004, Dr. Reeve ordered that Doss be involuntarily injected with medication every two weeks for thirty days, beginning April 9, 2004, although he was not diagnosed as either suicidal or homicidal. Doss was injected again on April 23, 2004 and the next injection was scheduled for May 6, 2004, the day after he attacked Bernstein. On April 29, 2004, it was reported that Doss \u201cwas very clear in stating that he knows how to control his anger and he would never do anything to harm anyone here and he is not trying to intimidate staff, etc.\u201d In his meeting with Dr. Reeve the next day, Doss reiterated that he had \u201cno thoughts of hurting himself or anyone else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The corrections officers who were deposed testified that they did not have access to, or knowledge of, Doss\u2019 medical records, nor did they have information that would suggest that Doss was planning an attack. Terrance Moore, the prison\u2019s former administrator, denied any knowledge of Doss\u2019 violent history, and said he was never approached with concerns over Doss. He said that the March 18, 2004 incident where an officer brought Doss for psychological evaluation was not a rare occurrence, as \u201c[i]t\u2019s not out of the ordinary\u201d for an inmate to be brought to the mental health depai\u2019tment. According to Moore, CMS has an obligation to alert DOC when, in its opinion, an inmate may harm himself or others, and Moore was not aware of any such communication between CMS and prison staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Neither were Lieutenant James Mattia, the shift commander stationed in the center control room at the time of the attack, Lieutenant Cunningham, or Lieutenant Myron Popowych aware of any of Doss\u2019 psychological problems in the months leading up to the attack. In fact, Captain Thomas Kirk, the area lieutenant on second shift at the time of the attack, characterized Doss as a \u201c[leather quiet inmate [who] kept to himself for the most part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Plaintiff filed a sixteen-count complaint against the State, the DOC, East Jersey State Prison, as well as forty-three individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>defendants, including the DOC Commissioner, his assistant, the prison administrator, assistant superintendent, assistant chief, supervisors and numerous corrections officers, alleging state common law tort claims sounding in negligence (Counts I-IX), federal civil rights claims arising under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983 (Counts XXIII), derivative claims (Counts XIV-XV), and a claim for punitive damages. The basis of the complaint was that defendants\u2019 response to the attack was delayed by (1) a prison policy dictating supervision of the mess hall from protective cages above the floor rather than direct floor patrol and (2) a violation of a standing order by assembling two emergency response teams rather than one before interceding. Plaintiff alleged the consequent delay in treating Bernstein caused his death, and was the result of willful misconduct by the individual defendants. Plaintiff also sought to hold defendants liable for failing to remove inmate Doss from the prison\u2019s general population, as he suffered from psychological problems and had a history of violent behavior.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">In support of this theory, plaintiff presented the expert report of Thomas A. Rosazza, who found that \u201c[w]ith respect to the initiation of CPR, the response time was insufficient and below the standard of care of the American Correctional Association Standards which require a four minute response time when an inmate is in cardiac and/or respiratory arrest.\u201d The expert opined that \u201c[h]ad officers been posted in the IDR they would have been in position to begin CPR immediately after separating Mr. Doss from Mr. Bernstein.... \u201d In regards to the assembling of a second, stand-by team, Rosazza surmised that \u201c[t]o the extent that assembling the second team delayed the initiation of CPR beyond four minutes, such would be a violation of the standard of care for an emergency response.\u201d The expert further stated that \u201c[t]he policy of removing the officers from the floor may have addressed officer safety, but it disregarded inmate safety by denying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>inmates the most effective deterrent to inmate misbehavior, <em>i.e., </em>officer presence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Defendants answered the complaint and following discovery, fifteen individual defendants were dismissed by stipulation, and two successfully moved for summary judgment, which is not at issue here. Plaintiff also voluntarily dismissed with prejudice Counts I to V of his complaint against all defendants because of the immunities granted them in the New Jersey Tort Claims (TCA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:1-1 to 12-3. Additionally, plaintiff voluntarily dismissed with prejudice all remaining claims against the State, the DOC and East Jersey State Prison. The remaining twenty-two defendants, all prison corrections officers or supervisors, moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Following argument, the judge granted the motion, dismissing the complaint against the remaining defendants. Specifically, as to Counts VI through IX, which alleged negligence related to Doss\u2019 treatment,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the court found that since a public entity could not be held vicariously liable for the wrongful misconduct of an employee, under both <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-10 and <em>Hayes v. Pittsgrove Twp. Bd. of Educ., </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>449, 635 A.2d 998 (App.Div. 1994), the State, DOC, and the East Jersey State Prison were entitled to summaiy judgment. The court also found that since defendants, DOC Commissioner Devon Brown, his Chief of Staff Charles Ellis, and Prison Administrator Moore had no direct involvement in the incident, they could not have been acting outside the scope of their employment or with willful misconduct, and therefore they were protected by the TCA. As for the rest of the State defendants, the judge found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>The plaintiff correctly asserts that the State Defendants violated a standing order, that being post order 30.108____The plaintiff asserts that the violation was to prepare a second team as backup____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-8\">... [T]he assembly of the back up team did not prevent or hinder the . . first team from entering into the I.D.R. ... [NJo rational fact finder could conclude that it was wilful [sic] misconduct to take the extra step of preparing two teams in the face of a volatile potential in the mess hall where there were 300 unrestrained inmate[s] immediately after a brutal and unexpected attack, the genesis of which was unknown to the prison officials.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">Similarly, with respect to prison policy removing officers from the IDR floor to suspended cages, the judge found that \u201c[tjhis evidence would be relevant to negligence but no [rational] fact finder could reasonably conclude that the facility\u2019s choice to use cages was wilful [sic] misconduct. Instead [it] was a policy choice with which the plaintiffs disagree.\u201d And as for Doss\u2019 presence in the prison\u2019s general population, the court opined that \u201c[t]he treatment exception in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4, does not apply here because the plaintiffs are not claiming a malpractice in Bernstein\u2019s medical treatment. Instead their claim is precisely the kind of claim that [is] immunized.\u201d Accordingly, the court concluded that the State employees were immune under the TCA from the negligence claims in Counts VI through IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">Concerning Counts X through XIII, brought under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the judge, citing to <em>Will v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 <em>U.S. </em>58, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989), found that \u00a7 1983 liability does not apply to a State, state agency, or state official acting in his or her official capacity. For defendants Brown, Ellis, Moore, and Acting Director of Custody Operations Joseph Ring, the judge found that \u201cthe only acts complained of were purely of their official capacities as high level officials of the department of corrections. Thus, under the clear holding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number><em>[Will], </em>dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 claim[s] against these defendants under section 1983 is required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Additionally, the court noted that in order to establish a \u00a7 1983 claim, plaintiff needed to show that the individual defendants violated Bernstein\u2019s constitutional rights. Citing <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 <em>U.S. </em>825, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>1970, 128 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>811 (1994), the judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">Plaintiffs here cannot show that the decedent was incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm. There was no allegation or evidence that the decedent alerted prison officials that he was in danger. In fact, there was no allegation or evidence that the decedent [ever] had a single prior physical altercation with inmate [Doss].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">Moreover, there was also no allegation or evidence that prison officials were aware of inmate [Doss\u2019] intentions to cause harm to the decedent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">The judge therefore granted summary judgment on Counts X through XIII. The court also dismissed the decedent\u2019s parents\u2019 derivative claims under Counts XIV and XV for loss of companionship.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">Finally, as to Count XVI seeking punitive damages, the judge found that the TCA, specifically <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2c, bars the recovery of punitive damages against a public entity. As for the remaining individual State defendants, the court, citing <em>Smith v. Wade, </em>461 <em>U.S. </em>30, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>1625, 75 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>632 (1983), found that plaintiff had \u201cnot established any evidence of the wilful [sic] conduct necessary to demonstrate that the individual State defendants acted with a high degree of conscious disregard for the plaintiffs [safety] and therefore an award of punitive damages cannot be supported in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">Plaintiff challenges each of these rulings on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">Having abandoned his tort claims against the State, the DOC, and East Jersey State Prison because public entities have no vicarious liability for the willful misconduct of their employees under the TCA, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-10, plaintiff seeks to hold the individual State defendants accountable for their actions, which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>claims transcend ordinary negligence and therefore fall outside the scope of TCA immunity. In this regard, plaintiff argues that genuine issues of material fact exist whether segregating corrections officers assigned to the mess hall in protective cages, preparing two response teams instead of one in violation of a standing order, and allowing Doss to remain in the general prison population constitute willful misconduct so as to preclude the grant of summary judgment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The TCA is a comprehensive scheme that \u201cseeks to provide compensation to tort victims without unduly interfering with governmental functions and without imposing an excessive burden on taxpayers.\u201d <em>Greenway Dev. Co., Inc. v. Borough of Paramus, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>546, 552, 750 A.2d 764 (2000). Thus, \u201c[o]xcept as otherwise provided by this [A]ct, a public entity is not liable for an injury, whether such injury arises out of an act or omission of the public entity or a public employee or any other person.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-1(a) (footnote omitted). \u201cThis means that generally, immunity applies and \u2018liability is the exception.\u2019 \u201d <em>Greenway Dev. Co., supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 552, 750 A.2d 764 (quoting <em>Fleuhr v. City of Cape May, </em>159 <em>N.J. </em>532, 539, 732 A.2d 1035 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Pertinent to the matter at hand, the Legislature decided, as a matter of policy, that \u201cLn]either a public entity nor a public employee is liable for ... any injury caused by ... a prisoner to any other prisoner.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:5-2(b)(4). The 1972 Task Force Comment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:5-2 emphasizes that the immunity protects the uniquely governmental function of housing prisoners convicted of crimes, which comes with inherent risks, from tort liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">Subsection b(4) also recognizes the practical problems inherent in supervising prisoners and particularly in preventing injuries caused by one prisoner upon another. While it is necessary to provide supervision, the decision to do so for the purpose of preventing inter-prisoner injuries should not be threatened with tort liability nor should the actions of prison guards in reacting to situations which may give rise to such injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>59:5-2 cmt.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>To be sure, such immunity \u201cis subject to an outer limit\u201d and \u201cwillful misconduct\u201d by a public employee is \u201cexpressly excluded from the scope of the [TCA\u2019s] immunity.\u201d <em>Tice v. Cramer, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>347, 375, 627 A.2d 1090 (1993) (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-14a). Although the public entity remains immunized because it has no vicarious liability for such acts of its employees, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-10; <em>Hayes v. Pittsgrove Twp. Bd. of Educ., supra, </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>449, 635 A.2d 998, \u201ca public employee guilty of outrageous conduct cannot avail himself of the limitations as to liability and damages contained in this [A]et.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-14 cmt.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Willful misconduct \u201cis not immutably defined but takes its meaning from the context and purpose of its use.\u201d <em>Fielder v. Stonack, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>101, 124, 661 A.2d 231 (1995). In <em>Fielder, </em>the Court defined what constitutes \u201cwillful misconduct\u201d in a police pursuit context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">[W]illful misconduct is ordinarily limited to a knowing violation of a specific command by a superior, or a standing order, that would subject that officer to discipline.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 125, 661 A.2d 231].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">We later explained that a police officer may deviate from a directive without his or her actions amounting to willful misconduct so long as the officer was not subjectively aware of the procedure and did not intentionally violate it. <em>Kollar v. Lozier, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>462, 472, 669 A.2d 845 (App.Div.) (\u201cWithout a knowing violation of an unequivocal order there can be no willful misconduct.\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>373, 678 A.2d 714 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">For purposes of the TCA, willful misconduct has been defined as the \u201ccommission of a forbidden act with actual knowledge that the act is forbidden.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470, 669 A.2d 845 (citing <em>Marley v. Borough of Palmyra, </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>271, 294-95, 473 A.2d 554 (Law Div.1983)). It is conduct much more egregious than ordinary negligence. <em>Fielder, supra, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>at 123-27, 661 A.2d 231; <em>Kollar, supra, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 470, 669 A.2d 845.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">Here, after analyzing the facts, the motion judge concluded that there was an absence of willful misconduct given the lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>evidence that in assembling a two-response team emergency crew, defendants acted with actual knowledge they were violating an express, unequivocal order or command; that prison policy mandating use of elevated security cages unreasonably endangered the safety of inmates; or that defendants knew or had reason to know of Doss\u2019 mental health so as to have ordered his segregation from the general prison population. We concur in this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Without question, the summary judgment record established that in each of these instances, the individual State defendants were acting well within the scope of their employment and in full compliance with prison policies and procedures as they understood them to be. For instance, there was no proof that any State defendant knew that post order 30.108 called for only one team and intended to violate it by preparing a back-up crew. On the contrary, the deposed defendants all testified that it was their understanding that the two-response team approach was the prison\u2019s standard operating procedure in place at the time and, in fact, was officially adopted as policy shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Moreover, under the terms of the order then in effect, there is some question whether it was even violated, knowingly or otherwise. Post order 30.108 contains no express prohibition against assembling a back-up team. Nor does it declare, in our view, a specific, unambiguous command, without an explicit or implied exception, that only one response team be used. Even if it did, the undisputed proof is that this procedure had long been overruled. Thus, no rational factfinder could conclude that in assembling a back-up emergency response team, the State defendants acted in a wrongful manner, much less willfully, egregiously or outrageously.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Even more certainly, the State defendants supervising the mess hall were acting in full compliance with official prison policy requiring guards be stationed in elevated security cages above the IDR floor. We simply cannot envision how obedience to such lawful procedures constitutes willful conduct on the part of the eomplicit corrections officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>As for the administrator defendants responsible for its adoption and implementation, although plaintiffs expert opined that the cage enclosure policy was responsible for the delayed response, and therefore Bernstein\u2019s death, there is an absence of any proof either of the time of cardiac arrest, or, more significantly, that the use of protective cages to guard large groups of inmates deviates from a standard of care for correctional facilities. Indeed, we fail to discern how a jury could reasonably find liable for willful misconduct those individual defendants responsible for a policy that, on its face, accommodates the safety and security of both inmates and staff. In this regard, there has been no showing that the official decision to remove corrections officers from the IDR floor to suspended cages represents anything other than a reasonable attempt to balance concerns of officer security with those of inmate safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Similarly wanting is any proof of willful misconduct or deliberate indifference by allowing Doss in the general population. No evidence has been presented that any State defendant knew of Doss\u2019 mental condition or had access to his medical records. Notably, Doss\u2019 assaultive behavior ended in 2001 when he was given treatment and prescribed medication. In any event, CMS was responsible for the provision of psychiatric services to Doss. On this score, there is no proof either that CMS ever advised prison officials that it was dangerous for Doss to be in the general population, or that the applicable standard of care required his administrative confinement or segregation for mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Even if defendants\u2019 treatment or diagnosis of Doss were negligent, the TCA provides immunity for injuries caused by: (1) the State\u2019s failure to make an adequate physical or mental examination of a person for the purpose of determining whether that person has a mental condition that would constitute a hazard to himself or others, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-4; (2) failure to diagnosis a person with mental illness, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-5; and (3) a determination regarding \u201c(1) whether to confine a person for mental illness ... (2) the terms and conditions of confinement for mental illness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>... (3)[and] whether to parole, grant a leave of absence to, or release a person from confinement for mental illness.... \u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:6-6.
