The jury returned a verdict in plaintiffs favor, and the trial court entered a judgment in the aggregate amount of $2,331,536.27 against defendants Kevin Clark and his employer, United Parcel Service, Inc. (\u201cUPS\u201d). That sum included $1,500,000 for pain and suffering; the balance represented the jury\u2019s award for economic loss and amounts permissible under <em>Rule </em>4:58, offer of judgment. Defendants Clark and UPS have appealed from that judgment. Plaintiff has cross-appealed, challenging the trial court\u2019s post-trial ruling with respect to the validity of the collateral source statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-97. After reviewing the record in light of the contentions advanced on appeal, we reverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings; with respect to the cross-appeal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The underlying lawsuit was filed to recover damages following the death of Mark Cockerline on the evening of January 2, 2003. The circumstances immediately surrounding Mr. Cockerline\u2019s death were unclear as the only person who may have possessed direct knowledge, Brigitte Nguyen, did not testify at trial, and she was not deposed. Her answers to interrogatories were singularly uninformative. Ms. Nguyen had filed her own action for damages, which was consolidated with this lawsuit. It was dismissed, however, when she did not appear for her deposition. Certain statements she made immediately following the accident were admissible at trial as excited utterances. <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(2). That ruling is not challenged on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Ms. Nguyen was a passenger in Mr. Cockerline\u2019s car, a blue Audi, as they were driving north on the eastern spur of the Turnpike, toward Secaueus. There was testimony that it had drizzled during the day, but in the evening hours, the drizzle turned to freezing rain, making the roadway slick. At some point, in the vicinity of milepost 110, Cockerline pulled his vehicle onto the shoulder of the Turnpike, closely abutting the right-hand barrier. There was no direct testimony explaining what led Cockerline to pull his car off the roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Kevin Clark was employed as a tractor-trailer driver for UPS. He was working on January 2 and picked up his last load between 7:00 p.m. and 7:15 p.m. He testified that it was drizzling as he headed out to deliver his load to the UPS facility in Secaueus and was driving in the right lane of the Turnpike at fifty to fifty-five miles per hour. He said that shortly after he picked up that load, the precipitation had turned to freezing rain, and he reduced his speed to between thirty and forty miles per hour. Clark said he was heading up a hill toward milepost 110 on the Turnpike, in the right lane, with another tractor-trailer to his left. As he crested the hill, he saw the lights of another vehicle some distance ahead, and he said he applied his brakes to slow down. He said the driver of the tractor-trailer to his left did as well and that when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>the driver did so, that vehicle slid to its right, sideswiping the cab of Clark\u2019s UPS truck. Clark said he counter-steered to maintain control of his tractor-trailer and that the two trucks again came into contact. Clark said that because he needed both hands on the wheel to control his vehicle, he was not able to downshift. Despite his efforts, Clark was not able to stop his truck, and he hit the rear of the car he had been trying to avoid, a Honda, which was driven by Erika Menendez.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Ms. Menendez testified that she had been driving north on the Turnpike from Newark to Secaucus with her sister-in-law and her two young children, both of whom were in ear seats in the rear. She said she was driving approximately thirty miles per hour because of the freezing rain and that when she came over the crest of the hill, she saw a car some distance in front of her that was perpendicular to the roadway, in her lane. She also saw another car, a blue Audi, pulled off the road and next to the barrier on the side. She testified that she thought those two vehicles had been involved in an accident and she brought her vehicle to a stop to avoid hitting the car in her lane. She was then struck in the rear by the UPS truck and pushed forward into the car that had blocked her lane. Her car was so severely damaged in this accident that it could not be repaired.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Both the driver of the car that Ms. Menendez struck and the driver of the tractor-trailer that side-swiped Clark\u2019S UPS truck, departed the scene; they were never identified. Throughout the course of the proceedings, both vehicles were referred to as phantom vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">There was testimony that the UPS truck jackknifed, with its trailer going into the shoulder. Clark denied that his truck jackknifed. He said that the trailer swung to the right but did not jackknife. The trailer came to rest near Cockerline\u2019s Audi that was stopped on the shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Clark said he ran from his truck to check on the condition of the people in the Honda and that none appeared to be injured. At that point, Ms. Nguyen came up to Clark and to Joseph Fazio, a passing motorist who stopped to render assistance. Both Clark and Fazio said that Ms. Nguyen was crying and appeared distraught and that she asked them to help her find her boyfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Fazio testified that Nguyen said her boyfriend had jumped over the barrier. He looked over the barrier and saw what appeared to be the body of a man. Fazio called down and received no response. He said he did not tell Ms. Nguyen what he observed but put her in a nearby car to try to calm her down.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">At about that time, Trooper Michael Rohrman arrived, having been dispatched in response to a call of several accidents near Turnpike milepost 110. Rohrman also testified that he was approached by a distraught Ms. Nguyen. She told him that she and her boyfriend, Mark Cockerline, had been driving home in his blue Audi when they were involved in an accident and ended up on the shoulder of the road. Their car was so close to the barrier on the right side that she could not open the passenger door. She said that Cockerline got out of the car and was standing near the headlight on the driver\u2019s side when he began to yell at her to get out of the car. Rorhman testified that Ms. Nguyen told him that she saw Cockerline move toward the barrier and then jump over it. Plaintiff established that the bridge was approximately one hundred feet from the ground at that point. Rohrman looked over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>the barrier and saw Cockerline lying face up on soft, marshy ground directly below the Audi and the UPS truck. He immediately summoned an ambulance.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Rohrman examined the UPS truck, Cockerline\u2019s Audi and Menendez\u2019s Honda. He saw signs that Cockerline\u2019s Audi had been sideswiped on the driver\u2019s side and that it had been damaged on the passenger\u2019s side when it came in contact with the barrier. The UPS truck had damage to the left side of the cab, in the area in which Clark said he had been sideswiped by the other tractor-trailer. The UPS track also had damage to its front end from striking the Menendez car. The Menendez car had significant rear-end damage from being hit by the UPS track as well as damage on its right side. No part of the UPS tractor-trailer was touching the Cockerline ear, and Rohrman did not see any sign that the UPS tractor-trailer had struck the Cockerline ear.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Based upon his visual inspection of the vehicles, Rohrman concluded that Menendez had slid on the ice and struck the Cockerline car and that the accident between Menendez and Cockerline occurred before the accident between Menendez and Clark. He did not believe there was any contact between Clark\u2019s track and the Audi nor that there was any connection between Clark\u2019s truck and Cockerline\u2019s death. Because of the weather conditions, and the number of accidents at the scene, he did not take any measurements that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Plaintiff presented an expert on liability, Steven Schorr, a professional engineer. Although Schorr had experience in accident reconstruction, he did not qualify as an expert in that field in this case. Because of the lack of physical evidence, he was unable to reconstruct the circumstances of Cockerline\u2019s death. Schorr limited his testimony to Clark\u2019s sight distance as he approached the crest of the hill and the amount of time required for Clark to bring his truck to a halt after seeing the Menendez vehicle ahead of him. Schorr said Clark, at 100 feet from the crest of the incline, would have had a sight distance of 1,000 feet and that if he had been driving forty miles an hour, he should have been able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>stop the truck within 385 to 625 feet. He also testified that if Clark had been driving thirty miles an hour, he could have brought his truck to a stop within 283 to 389 feet. Schorr did not express an opinion directly on the question of whether Clark had been negligent in his operation of the tractor-trailer. Nor did he express any opinion on whether the extent of the damage to Menendez\u2019s vehicle, or the fact that its occupants evidently were not severely injured, was an indication of Clark\u2019s speed at the time of impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">An autopsy was performed on Cockerline. This revealed that he had multiple rib fractures, that both his femurs were broken, and that his aorta had been completely ruptured. While his skull was not damaged, there was a hematoma to one portion of the brain.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Plaintiff retained Haresh G. Mirchandani, M.D., as an expert in forensic pathology. Dr. Mirchandani reviewed the results of the autopsy and issued a report in which he stated his opinion that Cockerline\u2019s legs were broken when he was struck from behind by a vehicle as he was walking. He further stated that these fractures could not have occurred as a result of a fall from such a height.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">In his testimony, Dr. Mirchandani said the rupture to the aorta was caused by Coekerline\u2019s fall from such a height and that his death was the result of the internal bleeding from the ruptured aorta. He said Cockerline would survive ten to fifteen minutes before bleeding to death. He also explained that Cockerline\u2019s chest was crushed and that both his lungs were punctured, depriving him of the ability to breathe. He agreed that the resultant loss of oxygen would lead to death in a shorter time. Dr. Mirchandani explained that the femurs are the strongest bones in the body; this, combined with the fact that there were no fractures to Cockerline\u2019s ankles, shin bones or knees, led him to conclude that the fractures to the femurs were not the result of Cockerline\u2019s fall. He also testified that Cockerline, with two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>fractured femurs, would not have been able to move toward the barrier and jump over it.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">At the time of the accident, Coekerline was married to Virginia Coekerline, and they had two children who were thirteen and twelve years old when their father died. Coekerline was separated from his wife, and the two were engaged in divorce proceedings when the accident occurred. Plaintiffs claims for economic loss thus encompassed the alimony and child support she would have received if the divorce litigation had proceeded to its anticipated conclusion, as well as the children\u2019s claims for the loss of their father\u2019s services.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The tractor-trailer that Clark was driving was equipped with an \u201cin-vehicle information system\u201d or \u201cIVIS,\u201d which, among other things, recorded the vehicle\u2019s speed and brake applications. The UPS protocol called for that information to be stored on a UPS computer for thirty days unless the vehicle had been involved in a \u201cserious\u201d accident. In the case of a \u201cserious\u201d accident, the IVIS data was to be printed out and retained, and no repairs were to be made to the particular vehicle. Clark\u2019s truck was repaired several days after the accident and the IVIS data was purged after thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">After the accident, plaintiff notified Cockerline\u2019s insurance carrier, Clarendon, of a claim for uninsured motorists (UM) benefits based on the actions of the phantom vehicles on the evening of January 2. When plaintiff filed her suit, she included Erika Menendez as a defendant, as well as a number of John Doe defendants. She also included a claim for spoliation of evidence and fraudulent concealment, based upon UPS\u2019s failure to retain the IVIS data.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Clarendon was given leave to intervene in this action. At some point during the pendency of the litigation, plaintiff settled her claim against Menendez. She also settled with Clarendon for UM benefits of $185,000. As part of that settlement, Clarendon agreed to foi\u2019ego any reimbursement from whatever recovery plaintiff might achieve in the litigation. When the matter was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>finally submitted to the jury, neither Ms. Menendez nor the phantom vehicles were included on the verdict sheet. After deliberations, which spanned four days, the jury returned its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Defendants raise a number of issues on appeal, the first group of which deal with the instructions given to the jury. They contend that the trial court erred in three respects in its charge: its decision to include res ipsa loquitur; its refusal to include the question of the comparative negligence, if any, of the phantom vehicles and Menendez; and its decision to instruct the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from UPS\u2019s failure to preserve the IVIS data. For the following reasons we agree with defendants with respect to their first two contentions but not with respect to the third.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">To prevail on a claim of negligence, a plaintiff must establish that the \u201cdefendant breached a duty of reasonable care, which constituted a proximate cause of the plaintiffs injuries.\u201d <em>Brown v. Racquet Club of Bricktown, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>280, 288, 471 A.2d 25 (1984). \u201cOrdinarily, negligence is ... \u2018a fact which must be proved and which will never be presumed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Myrlak v. Port Auth. of N.Y. and N.J., </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>84, 95, 723 A.2d 45 (1999) (quoting <em>Meny v. Carlson, </em>6 <em>N.J. </em>82, 91, 77 A.2d 245 (1950)).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">The principle of res ipsa loquitur, however, creates \u201can allowable inference of the defendant\u2019s want of due care,\u201d with respect to an injury-producing occurrence, upon a showing that \u201c(a) the occurrence itself ordinarily bespeaks negligence; (b) the instrumentality [causing the injury] was within the defendant\u2019s exclusive control; and (c) there is no indication in the circumstances that the injury was the result of the plaintiffs own voluntary act or neglect.\u201d <em>Bornstein v. Metro. Bottling Co., </em>26 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number><em>N.J. </em>263, 269, 139 A.2d 404 (1958). \u201cThe effect of the doctrine is to establish a <em>prima facie </em>ease by permitting the jury to infer negligence.\u201d <em>Buckelew v. Grossbard, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>512, 526, 435 A.2d 1150 (1981). <em>\u201cRes ipsa loquitur </em>is not a theory of liability; rather, it is an evidentiary rule that governs the adequacy of evidence in some negligence cases.\u201d <em>Myrlak, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 95, 723 A.2d 45 (citing <em>Brown, supra, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>at 288, 471 A.2d 25).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The fact that there is no explanation for an accident does not, by itself, entitle a plaintiff to invoke res ipsa loquitur. <em>Jimenez v. GNOC Corp., </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>533, 545, 670 A.2d 24 (App. Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>374, 678 A.2d 714 (1996). \u201cRather, a plaintiff has the burden of producing evidence that reduces the likelihood of other causes so \u2018that the greater probability [of fault] lies at defendant\u2019s door.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Eaton v. Eaton, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>628, 640, 575 A.2d 858 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\"><em>\u201cRes ipsa loquitur </em>is grounded in probability and the sound procedural policy of placing the duty of producing evidence on the party who has superior knowledge or opportunity for explanation of the causative circumstances.\u201d <em>Buckelew, supra, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>at 526, 435 A.2d 1150 (citing <em>Bornstein, supra, 26 N.J. </em>at 269, 139 A.2d 404). This foundational premise for res ipsa loquitur rests upon one of the doctrine\u2019s elements, that the instrumentality causing the injury was within the defendant\u2019s exclusive control. <em>Jerista v. Murray, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>175, 192, 883 A.2d 350 (2005); <em>Myrlak, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 95, 723 A.2d 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">At the conclusion of plaintiffs case, defendants moved for a directed verdict, contending that plaintiff had not established a prima facie ease of negligence. Plaintiff opposed this motion and asserted that she had established five potential scenarios under which defendants would be liable: that Cockerline was so frightened by the UPS truck swerving toward him that he jumped over the barrier; that some portion of the UPS truck struck Cockerline directly and propelled him over the barrier; that some portion of the UPS truck hit Cockerline\u2019s Audi and pushed it into him, propelling him over the barrier; that some portion of the UPS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>truck hit Menendez\u2019s car and pushed it into Cockerline, propelling him over the barrier; or some portion of the UPS truck hit Menendez\u2019s car and pushed it into Cockerline\u2019s car which in turn struck him, propelling him over the barrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">During the course of the argument, the trial court ruled that there was no evidence that the UPS truck hit Cockerline or his car and it struck those theories of liability. It held that the only theories of liability supported by the evidence were that Cockerline had jumped out of fear or that the UPS truck hit Menendez\u2019s car and pushed it either into Cockerline or into his Audi. As the parties have framed the issues before us, we are not called upon to consider whether the trial court\u2019s action was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Further, during the argument, the trial court concluded that plaintiff was entitled to have the jury receive a res ipsa charge. Accordingly, at the end of the case, the trial court gave the following instruction to the jury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">Now with respect to that doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. In any case in which there is a claim that the defendant was negligent, it must be proven to you that the defendant breached the duty of reasonable care which was a proximate cause of the plaintiffs injuries. Generally, the mere fact that an accident happened with nothing more does not provide proof that the accident was a result of negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-9\">In a negligence case, the plaintiff must prove that there was some specific negligent act or omission by the defendant which proximately caused the accident. However, in certain circumstances the very happening of an accident may be an indication of negligence. Thus, the plaintiff may, by providing facts and circumstances, establish negligence by circumstantial evidence. If the instrumentality causing the injury was in the exclusive control of the defendant and if the circumstances surrounding the happening were of such a nature that in the ordinary course of events the incident would not have occurred if the person having control of the instrumentality had used reasonable care under the circumstances, the law permits but does not require the jury to infer negligence from the happening of the incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-10\">Plaintiffs voluntary act or negligente] contributing to the occurrence prevents the inference from being drawn____ The mere fact that Mark Cockerline was present, does not defeat the inference. Rather you must find that Mark Cockerline\u2019s action or negligence was a proximate cause of the occurrence to prevent an inference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-13\">In summary, if you find by the greater weight of the evidence that at the time of the incident the defendant had exclusive control of the instrumentality causing the occurrence, that the circumstances were such that in the ordinary course of events <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>the incident would not have occurred if the defendant had exercised reasonable care and that the plaintiffs voluntary act or negligence did not contribute to the occurrence, then you may infer that the defendant was negligent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-5\">If you do infer that the defendant was negligent, then you should consider the defendant\u2019s explanation of the accident. If the explanation causes you to believe that it is no longer reasonable to infer that the defendant was negligent, then the defendant is entitled to your verdict. But if giving fair weight to all of the worthwhile evidence you decide that it is more likely than not that the defendant was negligent, then your verdict should be for the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">We agree with defendant that under the evidence presented at trial, res ipsa loquitur was inapplicable because it is impossible to conclude that the instrumentality causing the injury was within defendant\u2019s exclusive control. Indeed, it is not even clear what was the instrumentality that caused the injury. Multiple factors were at work, not all of them human; a non-exclusive list includes, in addition to Clark\u2019s operation of the UPS truck: the weather; the phantom tractor-trailer that sideswiped the UPS truck, interfering with Clark\u2019s ability to bring it to a stop; and the phantom car stopped perpendicular to the flow of traffic which caused Menendez to stop in a lane of traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Further, not only is it unclear from this record what led to Cockerline going over the bamer, it is also unclear when he went over the bander. There is no evidence that he was still standing on the shoulder as Clark attempted to control his tractor-trailer and bring it to a stop. Ms. Nguyen\u2019s statements related during the trial did not include any mention of hearing or seeing a careening tractor-trailer before she saw Cockerline go over the barrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">Plaintiffs failure to establish this critical element of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is fatal to its application to her case. \u201c[B]efore the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>operates to shift the burden of persuasion to the defendant in a negligence case, the plaintiff first must meet all of the elements of the three-part <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>test, and ... a plaintiffs failure to prove any one of those elements by a preponderance of the evidence renders the doctrine and its concomitant burden-shifting unavailable to that plaintiff.\u201d <em>Szalontai v. Yazbo\u2019s Sports Caf\u00e9, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>386, 389-90, 874 A.2d 507 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>We are satisfied that in the context of this case, it was reversible error for the trial court to have given a charge on res ipsa loquitur. Our research has led us to two modern reported New Jersey cases in which a trial court gave a res ipsa loquitur charge in circumstances where none was warranted, and yet it was found not to be reversible error: <em>Stackenwalt v. Washburn, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>15, 198 A.2d 454 (1964), and <em>Plant v. River Road Service Co., </em>5 <em>N.J.Super. </em>290, 68 A.2d 876 (App.Div.1949).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In each case, the reviewing court concluded that it was necessary to view the charge in its entirety. 42 <em>N.J. </em>at 26-28, 198 A.2d 454, 5 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 293, 68 A.2d 876. Only after doing so, did it conclude that the error was not prejudicial. 42 <em>N.J. </em>at 28-30, 198 A.2d 454, 5 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 294, 68 A.2d 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Applying that standard to the record before us, we are unable to come to the same conclusion. The trial court instructed the jury three times with respect to the question of res ipsa loquitur. The first, as part of its overall charge, we have set forth earlier in this opinion, and it was unremarkable in its content. At the conclusion of that charge, there was a sidebar conference at which plaintiff excepted to the charge. At the conclusion of that sidebar conference, the trial court repeated its charge on res ipsa loquitur but concluded it with the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-7\">In summary, if you find by the greater weight of the evidence that at the time of the incident, the defendant had exclusive control of the instrumentality causing the occurrence and that the circumstances were such that in the ordinary course of events the incident would not have occurred if the defendant had exercised reasonable care and plaintiffs voluntary act or negligence did not contribute to the accident, then you may infer that the negligence of Kevin Clark was a proximate cause of the death of Mark Cockerline.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">This charge is incorrect. If res ipsa loquitur is applicable, it only permits the jury, if it deems it appropriate, to infer that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>defendant was negligent. Res ipsa loquitur does not permit an inference of proximate cause, which is a wholly separate issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Our research has not revealed a reported New Jersey case that links the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur to proximate cause.

We agree with defendants that the trial court erred when it deprived them of their statutory right to seek an apportionment of negligence from the \u201cJohn Doe\u201d defendants named in place of the drivers of the phantom car and phantom truck. Defendants also contend that the trial court erred when it did not permit them to seek such apportionment from the former co-defendant Menendez.

In pretrial motions, the trial court ruled that defendants were not entitled to have the jury apportion any fault to the phantom vehicle;, and they were not included on the verdict sheet or addressed in the court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Both parties find support for their respective positions in <em>Riccio v.

We agree with plaintiff that defendants are incorrect when they assert that Clarendon, by settling the UM claim, \u201cstepped into\u201d the shoes of the phantom vehicles. The <em>Riccio </em>Court specifically rejected such an analysis, noting that UM coverage is a matter of contract between the insured and his carrier. <em>Id. </em>at 498-99, 531 A.2d 717. In our judgment, however, plaintiff is incorrect when she urges that <em>Riccio </em>stands for the proposition that a tortfeasor is not entitled to benefit from UM coverage for which it paid no premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Rather, the <em>Riccio </em>Court noted that the law governing UM coverage and the law governing comparative negligence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>contribution among joint tortfeasors serve different goals and purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 503, 531 A.2d 717.

The trial court erred when it precluded the jury from making such an apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">One final aspect of defendants\u2019 argument must be noted. They contend that the trial court should also have included on the verdict sheet the question of what proportion of negligence, if any, should be attributed to Menendez. If that were the only question presented on appeal with respect to apportionment, we would decline to reverse because a fair reading of the transcript indicates a decision by defense counsel not to pursue that issue. We do not determine whether that decision would preclude a different analysis in a subsequent trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">We turn now to the question whether the trial court erred in the manner in which it dealt in its instructions with the defendants\u2019 failure to preserve the IVIS data.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court gave the following instruction to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>The intentional destruction of evidence relevant to proof of an issue at trial gives rise to an inference unfavorable to the party who destroyed or concealed the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">If you should find that the defendant, UPS, destroyed or concealed evidence, you may presume that the evidence destroyed or concealed would have been unfavorable to UPS.

Such a duty arises when there is pending or likely litigation between two parties, knowledge of this fact by the alleged spoliating party, evidence relevant to the litigation, and the foreseeability that the opposing party would be prejudiced by the destruction or disposal of this evidence. <em>Aetna Life, supra, </em>309 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 366, 707 A.2d 180 (citing <em>Hirsch, supra, </em>266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 250-51, 628 A.2d 1108).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Various civil remedies have been developed with the intent of making \u201cwhole, as nearly as possible, the litigant whose cause of action has been impaired by the absence of crucial evidence; ... punish[ing] the wrongdoer; and ... deter[ring] others from such conduct.\u201d <em>Rosenblit v.

An appropriate sanction is one that properly takes into account the spoliator\u2019s level of intent, and is adequate and effective, but not excessive. <em>Manorcare Health Servs. Inc., supra, </em>336 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 226, 230-31, 764 A.2d 475).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">\u201cThe spoliation inference permits the jury to infer that the evidence destroyed or concealed would not have been favorable to the spoliator.\u201d <em>Jerista, supra, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>at 202, 883 A.2d 350 (citing <em>Rosenblit, supra, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>at 401-02, 766 A.2d 749). If a plaintiff can make a threshold showing that a defendant\u2019s recklessness caused the loss of relevant evidence, the jury should be so instructed. <em>Jerista, supra, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>at 203, 883 A.2d 350. The jury is free, however, to accept or reject the inference. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cNeedless to say, if the jury were to accept defendant\u2019s account, the spoliation inference would be rejected.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">Defendants argue first that the trial judge erred in administering an adverse inference charge, rather than simply imposing a monetary sanction, where: (1) there was no evidence that IVIS data was destroyed with an intent to conceal, and (2) plaintiff was not prejudiced by the absence of the IVIS data.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Our review of the record does not indicate that defendants ever sought a lesser sanction. In any event, contrary to defendants\u2019 first representation, plaintiff presented evidence that UPS allowed the IVIS data to be purged even though it usually looked at the data even in the case of a minor accident. Menendez\u2019s car was totaled, UPS had some concerns about Clark\u2019s possible liability vis-a-vis decedent\u2019s death, and UPS was made aware of plaintiffs claims while Menendez\u2019s claim was still pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">We also cannot agree with defendants\u2019 further contention that proof of Clark\u2019s speed and braking was not crucial where: (1) plaintiff had almost no evidence from which to reconstruct this accident, (2) Clark\u2019s estimates of his speed varied, and (3) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>IVIS data might have undercut Clark\u2019s claims that he was unable to brake after being sideswiped by a phantom truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Next, defendants argue that the trial judge erred in \u201cpermit[ting] the plaintiff to explore what happened to the [IVIS] data in front of the jury.\u201d Contrary to defendants\u2019 representations, there was no way the jury could have assessed plaintiffs entitlement to the inference in a vacuum. Rather, as noted above, the jury had to pick between the parties\u2019 accounts of how and why the evidence was lost in deciding whether to accept or reject the spoliation inference. We reject defendants\u2019 contention that the lower court committed reversible error in administering an adverse inference charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Included in the remainder of defendants\u2019 arguments on appeal are challenges to various aspects of the damages awarded by the jury. In light of our determination that the matter must be retried, we do not address those contentions. Nor do we address defendants\u2019 argument that the trial court erred in precluding them from presenting two of their proposed experts. That is an issue that may be taken up with the trial court in the course of preparing for the second litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">We deem it necessary, however, to address one remaining argument by defendants, that the trial court, in settling the form of judgment, erred when it did not reduce plaintiffs award by the amounts of the social security survivor and death benefits and the PIP death benefit that she received. We are satisfied defendants are correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">Following decedent\u2019s death, plaintiff received approximately $128,295 in social security death and survivor benefits pursuant to 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 402(d) and (g). She also received $10,000 in death benefits from Clarendon pursuant to her PIP insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">In response to defendants\u2019 post-trial request for a set-off, plaintiffs counsel argued that plaintiffs receipt of these benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>did not require a reduction in her award pursuant to the collateral source statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-97. Specifically, plaintiffs counsel maintained that the availability of the social security benefits was not contingent on employment, and that these benefits were really akin to life insurance, which is exempted under the statute. Plaintiffs counsel also argued that the social security benefits did not duplicate any part of the award because the jury awarded alimony and child support, not lost income. Lastly, counsel argued that the PIP benefits were like life insurance because they were payable to plaintiff simply by virtue of decedent\u2019s death provided he was working. The trial court adopted this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-97:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">In any civil action brought for personal injury or death, ... if a plaintiff receives or is entitled to receive benefits for the injuries allegedly incurred from any other source other than a joint tortfeasor, the benefits, other than workers\u2019 compensation benefits or the proceeds from a life insurance policy, shall be disclosed to the court and the amount thereof which duplicates any benefits contained in the award shall be deducted from any award recovered by the plaintiff, less any premium paid to an insurer directly by the plaintiff or by any member of the plaintiffs family on behalf of the plaintiff for the policy period during which the benefits are payable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">The primary purpose of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-97, which abrogated the common law collateral source rule, is to \u201cdisallow double recovery to plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Perreira v. Rediger, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>399, 410, 778 A.2d 429 (2001), <em>overruled on other grounds by Levine v.

Benefits the Legislature intended to cover by the statute include \u201cthose \u2018from ... health insurance policies, from employment contracts, from statutes such as ... the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, from gratuities, from social legislation such as social security and welfare, and from pensions under special retirement acts.\u2019\u201d <em>Woodger v. Christ Hosp., </em>364 <em>N.J.Super. </em>144, 151, 834 A.2d 1047 (App.Div.2003) (quoting <em>Kiss v. Jacob, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>278, 282, 650 A.2d 336 (1994)). Social security <em>disability </em>payments are also included to the extent they are \u201cneither contingent nor speculative nor subject to change or modification.\u201d <em>Woodger, supra, </em>364 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 151, 834 A.2d 1047 (citing <em>Parker v.

We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The statute does not exempt death benefits that are \u201csimilar to\u201d life insurance. It exempts \u201cproceeds from a life insurance policy.\u201d Adopting plaintiffs construction would require us to ignore the clear language of the statute. This we cannot do.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Plaintiff relies upon the case of <em>Krum v. Green Island Constr. Co., </em>671 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>563 (App.Div.1998). However, in that case, the social security benefits received by the decedent\u2019s widow under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 402(e) and excluded under New York\u2019s collateral source statute as insurance, were expressly denominated by the Social Security Administration as \u201c\u2018Life Insurance\u2019 from Social Security.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564. Additionally, we cannot agree with plaintiff that it makes any difference that her award consisted of alimony and child support rather than the more \u201ctraditional\u201d award of the decedent\u2019s lost earnings, since both compensate for the loss of \u201cmonetary contributions which the decedent reasonably might have been expected to make to the survivors.\u201d <em>Curtis v. Finneran, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>563, 570, 417 A.2d 15 (1980); <em>see also Tash v. Tash, </em>353 <em>N.J.Super. </em>94, 103, 801 A.2d 436 (App.Div.2002) (social security death benefits are \u201cdesigned to replace monies which would or could have been earned\u201d by the deceased parent had he or she survived).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Defendants also argue that the lower court erred in failing to reduce plaintiffs award by the amount of the PIP death benefit she received because this benefit was also intended to replace lost income. In response, plaintiff acknowledges that the PIP benefit was intended to replace lost income, but insists only that \u201c[t]here is p no correspondence\u201d between this benefit and any item of damage awarded by the jury. In plaintiffs view, \u201c[t]he decedent\u2019s lost income was not recovered by anyone\u201d since the awards here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>were for alimony and child support. Plaintiff is drawing too f\u00edne a distinction. The support awards she received were based upon the income decedent would have earned had he not been killed. Any judgment entered should reflect this PIP benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">We turn now to plaintiffs cross-appeal, which also revolves around the relationship between <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-97 and federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">In her cross-appeal, plaintiff contends that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-97 is invalid under federal law. In accordance with <em>Rule </em>4:28-4, plaintiff notified the Attorney General of her challenge, and the State of New Jersey was permitted to intervene with respect to that issue. We question whether this is properly the subject of a cross-appeal, as opposed to the proffer of an additional basis upon which plaintiff contends we should affirm the decision of the trial court that the final judgment need not reflect the social security survivor and death benefits due to plaintiff as a consequence of Cockerline\u2019s death. We elect, in any event, to deal briefly with the substance of the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">The essence of plaintiffs argument is that our collateral source statute is invalid because it has been pre-empted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d) \u00a7 514, 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1144(a), and, alternatively, because it is prohibited by the anti-assignment clause of the Social Security Act \u00a7 207, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">In support of her first proposition, plaintiff relies upon <em>Levine v. United Healthcare Corp., supra, </em>402 F.3d at 156. In our judgment, <em>Levine </em>does not lead to the result plaintiff advocates.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">The plaintiffs in <em>Levine </em>had each suffered damages for which they brought third-party actions. <em>Id. </em>at 159. When those actions were settled, the plaintiffs reimbursed their health insurers for the amounts the insurers had paid toward the medical expenses plaintiffs had incurred because their health insurance policies had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>provisions calling for such reimbursement, in accordance with then-existing <em>N.J.A.C. </em>11:4-42.10. <em>Id. </em>at 159-60. Several years later, the New Jersey Supreme Court in <em>Perreira v. Rediger, supra, </em>invalidated that regulation. Based upon the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Perreira, </em>the plaintiffs in <em>Levine </em>brought suit to recover the sums they had earlier reimbursed the insurers. <em>Id. </em>at 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">As part of their defense to this action, the plaintiffs\u2019 insurers argued that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were preempted by ERISA. <em>Ibid. </em>The court went through a detailed analysis, eventually concluding that plaintiffs were suing for benefits due under health insurance plans governed by ERISA, that as a consequence their claims \u201crelated\u201d to ERISA-governed plans and were thus preempted by ERISA\u2019s provision barring such suits. The court ruled that to the extent <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-97 precluded reimbursement to health insurers for amounts paid pursuant to benefit plans governed by ERISA, it was preempted. The court remanded the matter to the District Court with instructions that plaintiffs\u2019 claims be dismissed. <em>Id. </em>at 166-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">We disagree with plaintiffs contention that the result of <em>Levine </em>was to invalidate <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-97 in its entirety. The premise of plaintiffs argument rests on the fact that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-97 does not contain a severability clause. None is needed, however. \u201cWhere the principal object of the statute is constitutional, and the objectionable provision can be excised without substantial impairment of the general purpose, the statute is operative____\u201d <em>Exxon Corp. v. Hunt, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>110, 117, 534 A.2d 1 (1987) (quoting <em>State ex rel. McLean v. Lanza, </em>27 <em>N.J. </em>516, 528, 143 A.2d 571 (1958)). Nothing within <em>Levine </em>affected the continued viability of the statute\u2019s dual purposes of precluding a plaintiff from receiving a double recovery and relieving economic pressure on liability carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">We also reject the second portion of plaintiffs argument, that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-97 is invalid because it conflicts with the anti-assignment clause of the federal social security law. This statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>The right of any person to any future payment under this title shall not be transferable or assignable, at law or in equity, and none of the moneys paid or payable or rights existing under this title shall be subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process, or to the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">[Social Security Act 5 207(a), 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 407(a).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">This anti-assignment provision is \u201cdirected at traditional types of assignments, whereby a recipient relinquished a portion of the federal benefits.\u201d <em>Lamb v. Conn. Gen. Life Ins. Co., </em>643 F.2d 108, 111 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 <em>U.S. </em>836, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>139, 70 L.Ed.2d 116 (1981) (citing <em>Hurd v. Ill. Bell Tel. Co., </em>136 <em>F.Supp. </em>125 (N.D.Ill.1955), <em>aff'd, </em>234 F.2d 942 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, sub nom. Seybold v. W. Elec. Co., </em>352 <em>U.S. </em>918, 77 <em>S.Ct. </em>216, 1 L.Ed.2d 124 (1956)).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">In <em>Thomas v. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Inc., </em>282 <em>N.J.Super. </em>569, 577, 660 A.2d 1236 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>574, 667 A.2d 191 (1995), the trial court molded the plaintiffs verdict in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-97 by allowing the defendant a set-off in the amount of the social security benefits plaintiff had received. On appeal, the <em>Thomas </em>court rejected the plaintiffs argument that the provisions of the Social Security Act preempted the State \u201cfrom reducing an injured person\u2019s social security benefits by a tort award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 589, 660 A.2d 1236. While the preemption argument in <em>Thomas </em>was specifically premised upon 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 424(a), the Act\u2019s \u201coffset\u201d provision, rather than section 407(a), the court\u2019s reasoning is equally applicable in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">The amount of social security benefits received by plaintiff has not been diminished by State law. Plaintiff has received and will continue to receive whatever social security benefits federal law and regulations permit. The State law under review, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-97, simply does not permit a plaintiff to duplicate those benefits through a tort award. Thus, there is no conflict between state and federal law. [Plaintiffs] social security benefits have not been set off or diminished by State actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-9\"><em>[Thomas, supra, 282 N.J.Super. </em>at 589, 660 A.2d 1236 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">Although, as we have earlier indicated, the trial court erred when it did not credit defendants with the social security benefits plaintiff received, it was correct when it rejected plaintiffs claim of preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">On defendants\u2019 appeal, the judgment under review is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. On plaintiffs cross-appeal, the trial court\u2019s ruling that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-97 is not preempted by federal law is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b634-6\"> The description Ms. Menendez gave at trial varied from the description she provided in her answers to plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories, which are included in the record before us.
