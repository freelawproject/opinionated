Smith (Docket No. 330390). The charges were brought under MCL 333.7410(3) for possession with intent to deliver drugs on or within 1,000 feet of school property. Based on its interpretation of MCL 333.7410(3), each trial court dismissed the charge, reasoning that although the prosecution presented evidence to establish that the respective defendant was arrested within 1,000 feet of school property while in possession of drugs, the prosecution failed to demonstrate that the defendant intended to deliver those drugs to a person on or within 1,000 feet of school property. I conclude that the trial courts properly construed MCL 333.7410(3) in accordance with the plain meaning of the statutory language, as demonstrated by its grammatical context, and this Court affirms the trial courts\u2019 dismissal of the MCL 333.7410(3) charges against defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">During a drug raid at the home of English, the police discovered about 14 grams of cocaine, marijuana, a digital scale, sandwich bags, and a handgun. Officers determined that English\u2019s property was within 1,000 feet of a high school. As a result, the charges against English included one count of possession with the intent to deliver less than 50 grams of cocaine within a school zone under \u00a7 7410(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Similarly, during a drug raid on the apartment and car of Smith, the police discovered 2.2 grams of heroin, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>baggies, a digital scale, rubber gloves, and a handgun. The officers determined that at the time of the raid, Smith\u2019s heroin was within 1,000 feet of a high school. Therefore, the charges against Smith included one count of possession with the intent to deliver less than 50 grams of heroin within a school zone under \u00a7 7410(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Following their respective preliminary hearings, English and Smith moved to dismiss the charges under \u00a7 7410(3). Both defendants contended that the statute required the prosecution to show that they had intended to deliver the drugs within the school zone. Defendants further contended that there was no such evidence. Accordingly, defendants argued, the trial courts were required to dismiss the charges against them under \u00a7 7410(3). In both cases, the trial courts agreed and dismissed the MCL 333.7410(3) charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The instant prosecutorial appeals ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">This Court reviews de novo the interpretation and application of statutes. <em>People v Williams, </em>475 Mich 245, 250; 716 NW2d 208 (2006). Among other things, the Public Health Code, MCL 333.1101 <em>et seq., </em>criminalizes a wide range of conduct involving controlled substances. The provision at issue here is \u00a7 7410(3), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">An individual 18 years of age or over who violates section 7401(2)(a)(iu)[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] <em>by possessing with intent to deliver to another person on or within 1,000 feet of school property or a library a controlled substance . </em>. . shall be pun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>ished ... by a term of imprisonment of not less than 2 years or more than twice that authorized by section 7401(2)(a)(\u00bfu). [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">On appeal, the parties offer three distinct interpretations of this language. The prosecution argues that \u00a7 7410(3) is ambiguous and should be construed in such a way that the phrase \u201con or within 1,000 feet of school property\u201d modifies the phrase \u201cpossessing with intent to deliver.\u201d Put differently, under the prosecution\u2019s interpretation, a defendant who <em>possesses </em>drugs in a school zone need not intend to <em>deliver </em>those drugs on school property or within 1,000 feet of a school to face an enhanced penalty under \u00a7 7410(3). By contrast, although English agrees that \u00a7 7410(3) is ambiguous, he contends that the phrase \u201con or within 1,000 feet of a school\u201d should be interpreted as modifying the phrase \u201cto another person.\u201d Under English\u2019s proffered interpretation, a defendant who possesses a controlled substance is not subject to an enhanced penalty unless he or she intended to deliver the controlled substance to a person on or within 1,000 feet of school property. On the other hand, Smith argues that \u00a7 7410(3) is wii ambiguous and that the plain statutory meaning requires the prosecution to show that the defendant intended to deliver a controlled substance to another person on school property or within a school zone. Under the interpretation argued by Smith, a defendant is subject to an enhanced penalty under \u00a7 7410(3) only if that defendant intended to deliver a controlled substance to a \u201cperson on or within 1,000 feet of school property or a library.\u201d I conclude that the interpretation of the statute asserted by Smith is correct.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>My conclusion hinges on the grammatical context of \u00a7 7410(3) and application of the last-antecedent rule.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-5\">Our primary purpose in construing statutes is to discern and give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent. We begin by examining the plain language of the statute; where that language is unambiguous, we presume that the Legislature intended the meaning clearly expressed\u2014no further judicial construction is required or permitted, and the statute must be enforced as written. [Williams, 475 Mich at 250 (quotation marks and citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">\u201cA statutory provision is ambiguous only if it irreconcilably conflicts with another provision, or when it is equally susceptible to more than a single meaning.\u201d <em>People v Fawaz, </em>299 Mich App 55, 63; 829 NW2d 259 (2012) (quotation marks and citation omitted). The Legislature is presumed to know the rules of grammar, <em>People v Henderson, </em>282 Mich App 307, 329; 765 NW2d 619 (2009), and therefore \u201cstatutory language must be read and understood in its grammatical context,\u201d <em>People v Houthoofd, </em>487 Mich 568, 580-581; 790 NW2d 315 (2010). See also <em>People v Beardsley, </em>263 Mich App 408, 412-413; 688 NW2d 304 (2004) (\u201cPunctuation is an important factor in determining legislative intent, and the Legislature is presumed to know the rules of grammar.\u201d); <em>In re MKK, </em>286 Mich App 546, 556; 781 NW2d 132 (2009) (\u201cThe Legislature is presumed to be familiar with the rules of statutory construction and, when promulgating new laws, to be aware of the consequences of its use or omission of statutory language . . . .\u201d). Under the last-antecedent rule, \u201ca modifying or restrictive word or clause contained in a statute is confined <em>solely </em>to the immediately preceding clause or last antecedent, unless something in the statute requires a different interpretation.\u201d <em>Stanton v Battle Creek, </em>466 Mich 611, 616; 647 NW2d 508 (2002) (emphasis added), citing <em>Sun Valley Foods Co v Ward, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>460 Mich 230, 237; 596 NW2d 119 (1999) (\u201cIt is a general rule of grammar and of statutory construction that a modifying word or clause is confined solely to the last antecedent, unless a contrary intention appears.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Absent application of the last-antecedent rule, \u00a7 7410(3) does appear equally susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation and, therefore, ambiguous. Such <em>potential </em>ambiguities in statutory language are, however, precisely what the last-antecedent rule is used to clarify. The \u201con or within 1,000 feet\u201d phrase in \u00a7 7410(3) is both modifying and restrictive, and its last antecedent\u2014i.e., \u201cthe last word, phrase, or clause that can be made an antecedent without impairing the meaning of the sentence,\u201d 2A Singer &amp; Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction (7th ed), \u00a7 47:33, pp 494-497\u2014is the word \u201cperson.\u201d (Quotation marks and citation omitted.) For this reason, unless something in the statute \u201crequires\u201d a different interpretation, <em>Stanton, </em>466 Mich at 616, it should be presumed that the Legislature intended the phrase \u201con or within 1,000 feet of school property or a library\u201d to modify the word \u201cperson.\u201d Under this construction, \u00a7 7410(3) is rendered unambiguous; it imposes criminal liability only if an offender specifically intended to deliver a controlled substance to a \u201cperson on or within 1,000 feet of school property or a library.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Notwithstanding the last-antecedent rule, the prosecution argues that this construction is contrary to apparent legislative intent. I disagree. I see nothing in the plain language of \u00a7 7410 itself that would require this Court to disregard the last-antecedent rule in this case. My construction of \u00a7 7410(3) under the last-antecedent rule is consistent with the remainder of \u00a7 7410. Indeed, arguably at least, it is the prosecution\u2019s proposed interpretation that would do violence to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>apparent legislative intent underlying \u00a7 7410(3). As was acknowledged by the prosecution during oral argument, under its interpretation, a drug dealer intending to deliver drugs to a drug house miles away from a school, but who happens to be arrested within 1,000 feet of school property while on his way to that drug house, faces the enhanced penalty of \u00a7 7410(3), whereas an enhanced penalty under \u00a7 7410(3) is impermissible for a drug dealer who <em>actually intends to deliver drugs to children on school property </em>but is arrested 1,010 feet from school property\u2014in other words, just outside the prohibited zone. In my judgment and that of my colleague Judge MURPHY (concurring), such a result is inconsistent with the legislative intent expressed by the entirety of \u00a7 7410 and the other pertinent sections of the Public Health Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Similarly, the dissent compares \u00a77410(3) with \u00a7 7410a(l)(b),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> another section of the Public Health Code, and reasons that our construction is contrary to apparent legislative intent. The dissent finds it significant that \u00a7 7410a(l)(b) uses the phrase \u201cwho is in a public park or private park\u201d to describe the individual to whom an offender intends to deliver a controlled substance, whereas \u00a7 7410(3) contains no such limiting language, because generally, when the Legislature includes language in a related statute that it omits in another, we assume that the omission was intentional. The dissent concludes that the language in \u00a7 7410a(l)(b) militates against reading \u00a7 7410(3) as requiring the defendant\u2019s intended deliveree to be on or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>within 1,000 feet of school property because, had the Legislature wanted such an interpretation, \u00a7 7410a(l)(b) demonstrates that the Legislature clearly knew how to demonstrate that intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">However, the rule of construction on which the dissent relies is only applicable when the \u201crelated statute\u201d is a prior enactment. As discussed in 2B Singer &amp; Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction (7th ed), \u00a7 51:2, pp 212-213, \u201c[generally, . . . courts presume a different intent when a legislature omits words used in a <em>prior </em>statute on a similar subject.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See also <em>People v Watkins, </em>491 Mich 450, 482; 818 NW2d 296 (2012) (\u201cIt is one thing to infer legislative intent through silence in a simultaneous or subsequent enactment, but quite another to infer legislative intent through silence in an earlier enactment, which is only \u2018silent\u2019 by virtue of the subsequent enactment.\u201d). The phrase \u201con or within 1,000 feet of school property or a library\u201d in \u00a7 7410(3) has not changed since 1994. See 1994 PA 174. By contrast, \u00a7 7410a(l)(b) was added by 1998 PA 261. Accordingly, \u00a7 7410a(l)(b) cannot rationally be used as a means of discerning the legislative intent underlying the phrase \u201con or within 1,000 feet\u201d as used in \u00a7 7410(3). When amending \u00a7 7410(3) to include that language, the Legislature did not \u201comit\u201d language it had previously used in \u00a7 7410a(l)(b); the latter provision did not exist at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">In conclusion, because the last-antecedent rule renders \u00a7 7410(3) unambiguous, I rely on the plain meaning of the statutory language and need not resort to less precise methods of reading \u201cthe tea leaves of legislative intent.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As the trial courts did, we construe \u00a7 7410(3) as requiring proof that the defendant specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>cally intended to deliver a controlled substance to a \u201cperson on or within 1,000 feet of school property or a library.\u201d In the cases now before us, it is undisputed that such evidence was lacking. For this reason, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-7\"> <em>People v English, </em>499 Mich 872 (2016); <em>People v Smith, </em>499 Mich 873 (2016).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b623-9\"> MCL 333.7401(2)(a)(iu) proscribes \u201cpossess[ing] with intent to . . . deliver\u201d less than 50 granas of a controlled substance that is a narcotic drug.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b624-7\"> Because I agree with Smith that \u00a7 7410(3) is unambiguous, I need not consider his alternative argument that this Court should declare \u00a7 7410(3) void as unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b627-6\"> MCL 333.7410a(l)(b) provides that a person who is 18 years of age or older may be sentenced to not more than two years of imprisonment if that person violates certain Public Health Code sections by \u201cpossessing with intent to deliver a controlled substance ... to a minor who is in a public or private park or within 1,000 feet of a public park or private park.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b628-6\"> <em>People v Maynor, 256 </em>Mich App 238, <em>261; 662 </em>NW2d <em>468 (2003) </em>(Whitbeck, C.J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b629-5\">MURPHY, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_u\">(concurring). Because I conclude that the Legislature intended MCL 333.7410(3) to apply when an offender possesses a controlled substance either inside or outside a school zone with the intent to deliver the controlled substance within a school zone, and not when a controlled substance is possessed inside a school zone with no intent to deliver the controlled substance within the school zone, I concur in the lead opinion. Ultimately, in my view, MCL 333.7410(3) is targeted at drug traffickers who intend to distribute controlled substances within a school zone and not at traffickers who may simply live in or be traveling through a school zone with controlled substances present in their home or vehicle or on their person. Accordingly, I agree with my colleague\u2019s position in the lead opinion that we should affirm the circuit courts\u2019 orders dismissing the charges under MCL 333.7410(3). Because I reach that conclusion partly on the basis of an analysis that contemplates the legislative history of MCL 333.7410(3), I write separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">In general, this Court reviews for an abuse of discretion a trial court\u2019s ruling with respect to a motion to dismiss criminal charges. <em>People v Adams, </em>232 Mich App 128, 132; 591 NW2d 44 (1998). We review de novo, however, the construction of a statute. <em>People v Williams, </em>475 Mich 245, 250; 716 NW2d 208 (2006). In <em>People v Peltola, </em>489 Mich 174, 181; 803 NW2d 140 (2011), our Supreme Court recited the well-established rules of statutory construction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Our overriding goal for interpreting a statute is to determine and give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent. The most reliable indicator of the Legislature\u2019s intent is the words in the statute. We interpret those words in light of their ordinary meaning and their context within the statute and read them harmoniously to give effect to the statute as a whole. Moreover, every word should be given meaning, and we should avoid a construction that would render any part of the statute surplusage or nugatory. If the statutory language is unambiguous, no further judicial construction is required or permitted because we presume the Legislature intended the meaning that it plainly expressed. [Citation and quotation marks omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">When a statute is ambiguous, judicial construction is proper in order to ascertain the statute\u2019s meaning. <em>In re MCI Telecom Complaint, </em>460 Mich 396, 411-412; 596 NW2d 164 (1999). When interpreting an ambiguous statute, \u201cwe should give effect to the interpretation that more faithfully advances the legislative purpose behind the statute.\u201d <em>People v Adair, </em>452 Mich 473, 479-480; 550 NW2d 505 (1996). A statute is ambiguous when an irreconcilable conflict exists between statutory provisions or when a statute is equally susceptible to more than one meaning. <em>People v Hall, </em>499 Mich 446, 454; 884 NW2d 561 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">MCL 333.7410(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\">An individual 18 years of age or over who violates section 7401(2)(a)(\u00bf\u00fc) [MCL 333.7401(2)(a)(\u00bfa)] by possessing with intent to deliver to another person on or within 1,000 feet of school property or a library a controlled substance described in schedule 1 or 2 that is either a narcotic drug or described in [MCL 333.7214(a)(ii0] shall be punished, subject to [MCL 333.7410(5)], by a term of imprisonment of not less than 2 years or more than twice that authorized by section 7401(2)(a)(\u00bfo) and, in addition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>may be punished by a fine of not more than 3 times that authorized by section 7401(2)(a)(ii;).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The issue in these consolidated cases is whether the statute demands proof of an intent to deliver a controlled substance \u201cto another person on or within 1,000 feet of school property\u201d (school zone), or whether it suffices to show an intent to deliver to another person <em>anywhere, </em>including outside a school zone, as long as the controlled substance was possessed within a school zone. Stated otherwise, the issue is whether the school-zone requirement pertains to the <em>possession </em>of controlled substances or to the <em>intended delivery destination </em>of controlled substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Our Supreme Court has observed that \u201c[i]t is a general rule of grammar and of statutory construction that a modifying word or clause is confined solely to the last antecedent. . . .\u201d <em>Sun Valley Foods Co v Ward, </em>460 Mich 230, 237; 596 NW2d 119 (1999); see also <em>Stanton v Battle Creek, </em>466 Mich 611, 616; 647 NW2d 508 (2002) (explaining the last-antecedent rule of statutory interpretation). The lead opinion relies on the last-antecedent rule to conclude that MCL 333.7410(3) is unambiguous and that defendants\u2019 construction of the statute is correct. I find the lead opinion to be fairly persuasive. My hesitancy in fully embracing the lead opinion is premised on the awareness and appreciation that the last-antecedent rule controls \u201cunless something in the statute requires a different interpretation,\u201d <em>Stanton, </em>466 Mich at 616, or \u201cunless a contrary intention appears,\u201d <em>Sun Valley, </em>460 Mich at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Subsection (2) of MCL 333.7410 enhances the punishment for delivering a controlled substance to another person within a school zone, and Subsection (4) enhances the punishment for possessing a controlled substance within a school zone. These provisions are concerned with the <em>actus reus </em>of the offenses, i.e., the location of the wrongful deeds that comprise the physical components of the crimes, <em>People v Likine, </em>492 Mich 367, 393 n 43; 823 NW2d 50 (2012), reflecting a legislative intent to punish more severely those drug crimes physically committed within a school zone. Interpreting the words in Subsection (3) of MCL 333.7410 in light of their context in the overall statute and reading them harmoniously with Subsections (2) and (4), <em>Peltola, </em>489 Mich at 181, there is a plausible argument that Subsection (3) should also be interpreted with a focus on the <em>actus reus </em>of the offense, which is possession of a controlled substance, not the intended destination of the substance\u2019s delivery. As pointed out by the dissent, federal courts have construed 21 USC 860(a)\u2014which contains language that gives rise to the same interpretation problems posed by MCL 333.7410(3)\u2014by applying this very logic, concluding that 21 USC 860(a) only requires proof of an intent to deliver drugs somewhere, as long as the drugs were possessed within a school zone. See, e.g., <em>United States v Harris, </em>313 F3d 1228, 1239-1240 (CA 10, 2002); <em>United States v Ortiz, </em>146 F3d 25, 28 (CA 1, 1998); <em>United States v McDonald, </em>301 US App DC 157, 160; 991 F2d 866 (1993); <em>United States v Rodriguez, </em>961 F2d 1089, 1092 (CA 3, 1992). In light of this authority, I am not unflinchingly confident that the last-antecedent rule governs, considering that the overall language of MCL 333.7410 arguably reveals a legislative intent that is contrary to that which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>deciphered when applying the last-antecedent rule of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">In my view, analysis under the last-antecedent rule should be supplemented with an examination of the legislative history of MCL 333.7410(3), given that the question regarding whether \u00a7 7410(3) is ambiguous is too close to call with any degree of certainty. The Michigan Supreme Court \u201chas recognized the benefit of using legislative history when a statute is ambiguous and construction of [the] ambiguous provision becomes necessary.\u201d <em>In re Certified Question from the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, </em>468 Mich 109, 115 n 5; 659 NW2d 597 (2003). The Court warned \u201cthat resort to legislative history of any form is proper <em>only </em>where a genuine ambiguity exists in the statute\u201d and that \u201c [legislative history cannot be used to create an ambiguity where one does not otherwise exist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Before the enactment of 1999 PA 188, which was made effective November 24, 1999, MCL 333.7410(3) enhanced criminal penalties for \u201cpossessing with intent to deliver to <em>a minor who is a student </em>on or within 1,000 feet of school property a controlled substance . . . .\u201d 1994 PA 174 (emphasis added). Although the phrasing still lacked absolute clarity, the reference to \u201ca minor who is a student\u201d plainly signaled the Legislature\u2019s intention that an offender had to have intended delivery within a school zone.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A minor student and a school zone go hand in hand. The question becomes whether 1999 PA 188, which replaced the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>phrase \u201ca minor who is a student\u201d with \u201canother person,\u201d revealed a legislative intent to expand the scope of the statute to encompass an intent to deliver anywhere, not just school zones, as long as the possession occurred within a school zone. The only information that I could locate speaking to the reason behind the amendment of MCL 333.7410 under 1999 PA 188 is found in Senate Legislative Analysis, SB 218, July 29, 1999, which provided as follows with respect to the argument supporting the amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-4\">Although the current law is well-meaning, apparently it is ineffective because an element of the offense is delivery to a student who is a minor. A successful prosecution requires the testimony of the student. A student, however, may be afraid of testifying against a drug dealer, reluctant to admit to receiving drugs, or otherwise unwilling to testily. If the enhanced penalties applied to delivery to anyone within a drug-free school zone, however, law enforcement agencies could place young-looking undercover officers in schools to pose as students. By making this change, the bill could have a big impact on combating drug-trafficking in and around schools. Reportedly, offenders in Florida are being prosecuted under a similar law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Accordingly, the 1999 amendment simply reflected a desire not to require the involvement of a minor student for purposes of a criminal prosecution, as opposed to an effort to abolish the need to prove an intent to deliver controlled substances within a school zone. I fully appreciate that \u201clegislative analyses should be accorded very little significance by courts when construing a statute.\u201d <em>In re Certified Question, </em>468 Mich at 115 n 5. But even if one disregards the quoted Senate analysis, the amendment of MCL 333.7410 under 1999 PA 188 clearly concerned only the identity of the <em>person </em>to whom a drug delivery was intended to be made, not the <em>location </em>of the intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>delivery. Given the legislative history of MCL 333.7410(3), I conclude that the Legislature intended the statutory provision to apply when an offender possesses a controlled substance either inside or outside a school zone with the intent to deliver the controlled substance within a school zone, and not when a controlled substance is possessed inside a school zone but with no intent to deliver the controlled substance within the school zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">In sum, while application of the last-antecedent rule brings me very close to a conclusive determination that the prosecution must establish an intent to deliver a controlled substance within a school zone for purposes of charges brought under MCL 333.7410(3), any lingering doubts I may have had on the matter are eliminated on consideration of the statute\u2019s legislative history, which reinforces the result produced when applying the last-antecedent rule of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">I respectfully concur with the lead opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-8\"> MCL 333.7401(2)(a)(\u00bfu) concerns the manufacture, creation, or delivery of a controlled substance, or the possession with intent to manufacture, create, or deliver a controlled substance, \u201cin an amount less than 50 grams,\u201d which offense constitutes \u201ca felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years or a fine of not more than $25,000.00, or both.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b633-7\"> Conceivably, the earlier language could be construed as concerning the possession of a controlled substance within a school zone with an intent to deliver the controlled substance to a student minor, regardless of the student minor\u2019s whereabouts. This would be a strained and wholly unreasonable interpretation of the earlier version of MCL 333.7410(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b635-7\">O\u2019CONNELL, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3q\">(dissenting). In these consolidated cases, the prosecution appeals by leave granted<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the trial courts\u2019 dismissal of charges under MCL 333.7410(3) against defendants, Lymance English (Docket No. 330389) and Brandon R. Smith (Docket No. 330390), for possessing with intent to deliver drugs within 1,000 feet of a school. The trial court in each case dismissed the charge against the respective defendant because the prosecution did not show that either English or Smith, who each possessed drugs within a school zone, intended to deliver those drugs within that school zone. Because I would conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>the enhanced penalty statute prohibits possessing drugs \u201cwithin 1,000 feet of a school,\u201d I would reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">During a drug raid at the home of English, police discovered about 14 grams of cocaine, marijuana, a digital scale, sandwich bags, and a handgun. Officers determined that English\u2019s property was within 1,000 feet of a high school. As a result, English\u2019s charges included one count of possession with the intent to deliver less than 50 grams of cocaine within a school zone under MCL 333.7410(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Similarly, during a drug raid on the apartment and car of Smith, police discovered 2.2 grams of heroin, baggies, a digital scale, rubber gloves, and a handgun. Officers also discovered a cell phone with messages ordering heroin. Officers determined that Smith\u2019s car and apartment were within 1,000 feet of a high school. Smith\u2019s charges included one count of possession with the intent to deliver less than 50 grams of heroin within a school zone under MCL 333.7410(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Following their respective preliminary hearings, English and Smith moved to dismiss the charges under MCL 333.7410(3). Both defendants contended that the trial court must dismiss their charges because the statute requires the prosecution to show that they intended to deliver the drugs within the school zone. According to English and Smith, there was no indication that either defendant delivered the drugs from their homes or that they intended to deliver the drugs within the school zone. In each case, the trial court agreed that MCL 333.7410(3) required the prosecution to show that the defendant intended to deliver the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>drugs within the school zone and dismissed the charge brought under MCL 333.7410(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">II.STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">This Court reviews de novo the interpretation and application of statutes. <em>People v Williams, </em>475 Mich 245, 250; 716 NW2d 208 (2006). This Court also reviews de novo the constitutionality of a statute. <em>People v Douglas, </em>295 Mich App 129, 134; 813 NW2d 337 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">III.STANDARDS OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">When interpreting a statute, our goal is to give effect to the intent of the Legislature. <em>Williams, </em>475 Mich at 250. The language of the statute itself is the best indication of the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Id. </em>We must read the statute as a whole and should not read statutory provisions in isolation. <em>People v Feezel, </em>486 Mich 184, 205; 783 NW2d 67 (2010) (opinion by CAVANAGH, J.). To promote harmony and consistency, we must read subsections of cohesive statutory provisions together. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">If the language of the statute is unambiguous, we must enforce the statute as written. <em>Id. </em>Instances of truly ambiguous language are rare. <em>People v Gardner, </em>482 Mich 41, 50 n 12; 753 NW2d 78 (2008). But if the statutory language is ambiguous, judicial construction is appropriate. <em>Feezel, </em>486 Mich at 205 (opinion by CAVANAGH, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">IV.ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">The Public Health Code prohibits a wide range of conduct concerning, among other things, controlled substances. MCL 333.1101 <em>et seq. </em>The statute at issue is MCL 333.7410(3), which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>An individual 18 years of age or over who violates section 7401(2)(a)(io)[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>1 <em>by possessing with intent to deliver to another person on or within 1,000 feet of school property or a library a controlled substance . </em>.. shall be punished ... by a term of imprisonment of not less than 2 years or more than twice that authorized by section 7401(2)(a)(io).... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">This statute, which provides that the sentence is \u201ctwice that authorized\u201d by its counterpart MCL 333.7401(2)(a)(\u00bfp), is an enhanced sentencing provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Because the only difference between MCL 333.7401(2)(a)(m), which in part prohibits the possession of controlled substances with intent to deliver, and MCL 333.7410(3) is the location in which the drugs are possessed, I would conclude that the Legislature intended it to apply to defendants who possessed drugs within the school zone, regardless of where they intended to deliver them. MCL 333.7410(3) applies when a defendant possesses with intent to deliver a controlled substance within 1,000 feet of a school or library, regardless of the location of the person to whom the defendant intends to deliver the substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">English contends that two of the possible meanings of MCL 333.7410(3) are consistent with the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the charges\u2014that the defendant intended to deliver to a person within 1,000 feet of a school or that the person to whom the defendant intended to deliver was within 1,000 feet of a school. The prosecution\u2019s construction is more reasonable to accomplish the purpose of the statute as an enhanced penalty provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>The Public Health Code is \u201cintended to be consistent with applicable federal and state law and shall be construed, when necessary, to achieve that consistency.\u201d MCL 333.1111. See also <em>Feezel, </em>486 Mich at 208 (opinion by CAVANAGH, J.). Federal law, under 21 USC 860(a), prohibits \u201cpossessing with intent to distribute ... a controlled substance in or on, or within one thousand feet of, the real property comprising a public or private elementary, vocational, or secondary school,\u201d and anyone who does so is guilty of a crime with an enhanced minimum sentence. This statute is analogous to MCL 333.7410(3). Both statutes provide enhanced sentencing provisions for persons who possess with the intent to distribute a drug within a school zone. While there are minor differences, such as the Michigan statute including requirements regarding the age of the offender, the types of conduct these statutes prohibit are substantially similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">I also find federal caselaw on this point persuasive. Under 21 USC 860(a), it is the location of the drugs, not the intended location of distribution, that is pertinent to the crime. <em>United States v Rodriguez, </em>961 F2d 1089, 1092 (CA 3, 1992); <em>United States v Harris, </em>313 F3d 1228, 1239-1240 (CA 10, 2002).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Construing MCL 333.7410(3) consistently with applicable federal law, the phrase \u201cwithin 1,000 feet of a school\u201d describes the location where the defendant possesses the drugs, not the location of the other person or where the defendant intends to deliver the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>Smith contends that this construction leads to supposedly absurd results because a defendant could be guilty under MCL 333.7410(3) for driving through a school zone while possessing a substance that he or she intends to deliver elsewhere. That a statute appears to be inconvenient or unwise is not a reason for this Court to avoid applying statutory language. <em>Johnson v Recca, </em>492 Mich 169, 187; 821 NW2d 520 (2012). The purpose of the statute is to attempt to protect children from exposure to drugs. <em>People v McCrady, </em>213 Mich App 474, 485; 540 NW2d 718 (1995). Given this purpose, requiring drug dealers to drive around school zones to avoid enhanced sentences appears consistent with the statute. I am less concerned with the resulting inconvenience to drug dealers than with interpreting the statute consistently with the Legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">I would conclude that MCL 333.7410(3) prohibits a defendant from possessing drugs within a school zone with intent to deliver them regardless of the intended location of delivery. Accordingly, I would reverse and remand for reinstatement of the charges.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-8\"> <em>People v English, </em>499 Mich 872 (2016); <em>People v Smith, </em>499 Mich 873 (2016).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b638-7\"> MCL 333.7401(2)(a)(ii&gt;) prohibits a person from \u201cpossessing] with intent to .. . deliver a controlled substance\u201d that is a narcotic drug in an amount less than 50 grams.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b639-6\"> This is consistent with unpublished cases from this Court that have determined the same and with cases in which we have upheld convictions without any discussion of the location of the defendant\u2019s intended delivery. However, at least one unpublished case has ruled insufficient a jury instruction, that did not specify that the defendant\u2019s intended deliveree was in the school zone.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
