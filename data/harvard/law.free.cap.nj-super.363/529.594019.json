The trial judge placed him on probation for eighteen months. On appeal, the most significant issue is whether the trial judge erred when he sequestered the juvenile\u2019s mother from the courtroom during the juvenile\u2019s adjudicatory hearing (trial). We conclude that excluding her from the trial was a manifest abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we reverse V.M.\u2019s adjudication of delinquency and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-14\">The facts are straightforward. V.M. was accused of throwing rocks at vehicles traveling on 1-676 in the area of Morgan Boulevard in Camden on August 24, 2001. Two of the victims whose cars had been struck saw V.M. running from the scene, chased him and caught him. V.M. denied being involved. He said, \u201cthey\u2019re always blaming me,\u201d and, \u201cit was them.\u201d He then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>started to cry. Multiple witnesses at the scene identified him as the offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">At trial, before witnesses were called, defense counsel advised the court that V.M.\u2019s mother \u201cmay be a witness,\u201d but asked, \u201cthat she nonetheless be allowed to sit in the courtroom.\u201d V.M.\u2019s mother was his only parent in attendance. The prosecutor objected, arguing that if V.M.\u2019s mother was going to be a witness, \u201cI would ask that she step out.\u201d The court responded, \u201cOkay. Like all other witnesses, I assume \u2014 \u201d After agreeing that the state trooper who was scheduled to testify should also be sequestered, the court stated, \u201cReciprocal order. All right. Mom, if you\u2019ll have a seat outside ... they will all be sequestered.\u201d Although she was sequestered, V.M.\u2019s mother was not called as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">During the trial, five witnesses whose cars were struck by rocks were called by the State. With one exception, each either identified V.M. as the rock-thrower or testified that rocks were thrown by an African-American juvenile with an \u201cAfro\u201d hairstyle, wearing a white t-shirt. V.M. matched that description.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">New Jersey State Trooper Kavanagh<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was dispatched to the area where the incident occurred. Upon his arrival, he observed the vehicles that had been struck by rocks were lined up on the shoulder of the road. He obtained statements from both passengers. and drivers of the vehicles. Four victims informed the trooper that \u201ca young male, black, with an Afro and white t-shirt had thrown rocks at their vehicles.\u201d After the two individuals who had chased V.M. brought him back to the scene, multiple victims identified V.M. to the trooper as the juvenile who had thrown rocks at their vehicles. V.M., again, denied the allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">During the course of the trial, the defense called three witnesses. Included was Norma Reyes, who was offered to testify as a character witness for V.M. The judge barred her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Testifying in his own defense, V.M. denied throwing rocks at the vehicles. He said he remembered seeing a group of \u201cblack kids with white t-shirts and Afros\u201d in the area where the incident took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">In adjudicating defendant delinquent, the judge said, \u201cfour of the five [witnesses] who testified clearly could articulate ... that it was [V.M.]____In my mind, that is compelling beyond a shadow of a doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">We now turn to the primary issue on appeal: whether the court erred when it sequestered V.M.\u2019s mother from the courtroom during the trial. Whether to sequester a witness is generally discretionary with the trial court. <em>State v. DiModica, </em>40 <em>N.J. </em>404, 413, 192 A.2d 825, 830 (1963). The use of sequestration prevents \u201cprospective witnesses from hearing what the other witnesses will detail in their evidence, \u2018for the less a witness hears of another\u2019s testimony the more likely is he to declare his own knowledge simply and unbiased.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Zellers, </em>7 <em>N.J.L. </em>220, 226 (Sup.Ct.1824)). \u201cOrdinarily, the sound exercise of [the trial court\u2019s] discretion requires granting a timely motion for sequestration.\u201d <em>Morton Bldgs., Inc. v. Rezultz, Inc., </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>227, 233, 603 A.2d 946, 949 (1992); <em>see also N.J.R.E. </em>615 (order sequestering witness may be entered at request of party or on court\u2019s own motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">These general principles, when applied to the vast majority of witnesses, are well founded. However, whether to sequester the parent of a juvenile in attendance at his or her child\u2019s adjudicatory hearing implicates additional considerations not applicable to other witnesses. Although our research has uncovered no New Jersey precedent directly on point, the importance of the presence of an accused juvenile\u2019s parents at critical stages of the juvenile delinquency process is firmly established. The New Jersey Code of Juvenile Justice, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-20 to -88 (Code), explicitly gives an accused juvenile\u2019s parent the right to participate in the juvenile\u2019s detention hearing, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-38, as well as the right to apply to the court to include public attendance during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>any court proceeding in the delinquency case. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-60i(1). Indeed, the law recognizes that a juvenile\u2019s family members need to be involved in both the adjudicatory and rehabilitative process. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-21; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">In the context of a police interrogation of a juvenile, the New Jersey Supreme Court has discussed the need for a juvenile to have a family member present. <em>See State v. Presha, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>304, 748 A.2d 1108 (2000). Justice Verniero, speaking for the Court, said: \u201cthe parent serves as advisor to the juvenile, someone who can offer a measure of support in the unfamiliar setting of the police station----Parents are in a position to assist juveniles in understanding their rights, acting intelligently in waiving those rights, and otherwise remaining calm in the face of an interrogation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314-15, 748 A.2d 1108. <em>See also State v. AG.D., </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>56, \u2014, 835 A.2d 291, \u2014 (2003) (juvenile\u2019s immaturity limits his ability to make knowing intelligent waiver of rights, requiring added layer of protection).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">We recognize that during an adjudicatory hearing the juvenile is represented by counsel, which is generally not the case when a juvenile is interrogated at a police station. Even so, the reasons for permitting a juvenile\u2019s parent to be present during the police interrogation are equally applicable at the juvenile\u2019s trial. In most cases, the juvenile\u2019s attorney is an assigned public defender \u2014 a stranger to the juvenile. The juvenile\u2019s parent provides a degree of comfort and support for the juvenile in an unfamiliar setting, as well as an added layer of protection, that the child\u2019s attorney does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">There exists yet another, and more concrete, reason to preclude the sequestration of the parent of a juvenile accused of delinquency. Rule 5:20-4 expressly provides that parents of the juvenile are necessary parties \u201cto every proceeding in all juvenile delinquency actions.\u201d This Rule implicitly, if not explicitly, affords the accused juvenile\u2019s parents the same right as the juvenile to remain in the courtroom during the juvenile\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>The Code provides a juvenile charged with an offense with the broad protections available to an adult charged with a crime, except for \u201c[t]he right to indictment, the right to trial by jury and the right to bail.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-40. Among the rights afforded to an adult, is the right to be present in court during his or her trial. <em>See Smillie v. Lerner, </em>10 <em>N.J. Misc. </em>484, 485, 159 <em>A. 808 </em>(Sup.Ct.1932) (\u201c[t]he right of a party to be present in court when a case in which he is interested is being tried seems too fundamental to admit of dispute. If a defendant may be excluded from a trial involving his right and privileges, his interest may be seriously jeopardized.\u201d); <em>see also </em>6 Wigmore, <em>Evidence, </em>\u00a7 1841(2) (Chadbourn rev. 1976) (noting that \u201cthe party\u2019s aid in the conduct of the cause may be indispensable, and his absence is in any case hardly consistent with his general right to protect his interest by watching the conduct of the trial.\u201d) This fundamental right of a party\u2014 to be present during trial \u2014 is equally applicable to a parent in a juvenile delinquency proceeding as a result of the adoption of Rule 5:20-4 by the New Jersey Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">This conclusion is further supported when we weigh the parent\u2019s right to be present in the courtroom against the acknowledged goals of sequestration. On balance, the right of the juvenile\u2019s parent to be present during the juvenile\u2019s trial is paramount.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">A judge, sitting without a jury in an adjudicatory hearing, is capable \u201cof sorting through admissible and inadmissible evidence without resultant detriment to the decision-making process____\u201d <em>State v. Kern, </em>325 <em>N.J.Super. </em>435, 444, 739 A.2d 969, 973 (App.Div. 1999). \u201cTrained judges have the ability \u2018to exclude from their consideration irrelevant or improper evidence and materials which have come to their attention.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Medina, </em>349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>108, 130, 793 A.2d 68, 80 (App.Div.) (quoting <em>State v. Kunz, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>128, 145, 259 A.2d 895, 904 (1969)), <em>certif. denied, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>193, 803 A.2d 1165 (2002). Yet, while a judge is in a position to make a reasoned evaluation of whether a witness\u2019s testimony may have been shaped by testimony the witness overheard in the courtroom, the benefits denied to a juvenile by the exclusion of a parent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>during the trial cannot be measured. Accordingly, we are loath to deny a juvenile the support and additional protection that may be supplied by a parent during the course of the juvenile\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Consequently, regardless of whether a juvenile\u2019s parent will be called as a witness, that parent has the right to remain in the courtroom during the juvenile\u2019s adjudicatory hearing. A sequestration order removing the parent from the courtroom is harmful error. <em>See D.C.A. v. State, </em>135 <em>Ga.App. </em>234, 217 S'.A.2d 470, 471-72 (1975) (under Georgia\u2019s juvenile code, parents of juveniles entitled to be present during delinquency adjudication); <em>but see Appling v. The State, </em>221 <em>Ga.App. </em>162, 470 S.E.2d 761 (1996) (sequestering juvenile\u2019s mother during trial not prejudicial and not grounds for reversal when juvenile tried as adult).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Furthermore, still another reason exists why the court\u2019s decision to exclude V.M.\u2019s mother from the delinquency adjudication hearing was a manifest abuse of discretion. Aside from her being a potential witness, the court was not told of the anticipated subject matter of her testimony. Without that information, the judge was not in a position to decide the sequestration request. <em>See Lopez v. House of Coffee, Inc., </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>364, 366, 753 A.2d 755, 756 (Ch.Div.1998) (proper exercise of discretion to sequester contemplates context in which request made and whether person to be sequestered is a party).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">The reason for separating opposing witnesses is explained by Dean Wigmore: \u201c[i]f the hearing of an <em>opposing witness </em>were permitted, the listening witness could thus ascertain the precise points of difference between their testimonies, and could shape his own testimony to better advantage for his cause.\u201d 6 Wigmore, <em>Evidence, supra, </em>\u00a7 1838(1). However, the corollary is also true. A witness testifying about different topics or events than the other witnesses would have no reason to modify his testimony. In other words, if V.M.\u2019s mother, who was not present during the rock-throwing incident, would have testified about another subject \u2014 for example as an alibi or character witness \u2014 she would have gained no advantage by hearing what the other witnesses said about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>underlying event, eliminating the need to sequester her. Yet, the court, without a proffer of her contemplated testimony, merely asked her to leave the courtroom, \u201clike all other witnesses.\u201d Thus, even in the absence of a blanket right of a parent of an accused juvenile to be present during the juvenile\u2019s trial, the record here did not support sequestration of V.M.\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">V.M. has raised three other points: 1) the court erred by permitting Trooper Kavanagh to testify to what was said at the scene of the incident by victims of the rock-throwing who were not called to testify at trial; 2) the court erroneously barred Norma Reyes from providing character testimony; and 3) the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. Each argument is moot in light of our decision to order a new trial. We comment briefly, however, on the first and second points.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Defendant claims the court improperly permitted Trooper Kavanagh to inject testimony of witnesses to the rock-throwing incident who did not testify at trial. Without identifying the witnesses, the trooper said: \u201cSeveral of the victims at the scene stated that [V-M.] was the juvenile who was throwing rocks at the vehicles.\u201d That statement was hearsay and inadmissible. <em>See N.J.R.E. </em>801(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Defendant\u2019s remaining argument is that the court improperly precluded Reyes from testifying about V.M.\u2019s character. We agree. A person charged with a criminal offense has a right to present evidence of his character to raise a reasonable doubt about whether he committed the offense. <em>State v. Siciliano, 21 N.J. </em>249, 260-61, 121 A.2d 490, 496-97 (1956); <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(a)(1); Biunno, <em>Current N.J. Rules of Evidence, </em>comment 3 on <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(a)(1) (2003). On retrial, Reyes may be permitted to testify to V.M.\u2019s character.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-9\"> Trooper Kavanagh\u2019s first name is not included in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
