The two summonses for failure to keep right and failure to signal were signed by the officer, but the third summons for DWI was not. Defendant moved in municipal court to dismiss the DWI charge on the ground that the summons was not signed by the officer. When that motion was denied, he pled guilty conditionally and appealed to the Superior Court. In a written decision dated March 17, 2003, Judge John Harper reversed the DWI conviction and found defendant not guilty, relying upon <em>State v. Brennan, </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>342, 349, 551 A.2d 560, 564 (App.Div.1988), and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:5-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">The State appeals under <em>R. </em>2:3-1b(1), arguing that <em>State v. Latorre, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>314, 549 A.2d 871 (App.Div.1988), supports affirmance of a conviction where an officer fails to sign the summons and there are no due process violations. The State contends that defendant was advised of his rights, had a court appearance within the thirty-day statute of limitations and was fully apprised of the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">In <em>Latorre, </em>we noted that \u201cthe issuance of a summons carries with it a constitutional imperative that a determination of probable cause be made by the issuing officer.\u201d <em>Latorre, supra, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 318, 549 A.2d at 873 (citing <em>State v. Ross, </em>189 <em>N.J.Super. </em>67, 74, 458 A.2d 1299, 1302-03 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>197, 470 A.2d 419 (1983)). We nevertheless allowed for a presumption of probable cause in cases where \u201cfundamental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>fairness has been satisfied or a defendant has [not] been truly prejudiced by the asserted omission in the summons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319, 549 A.2d at 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">In <em>Brennan, </em>we acknowledged that the officer\u2019s failure to sign the summons within the thirty-day limitation prescribed in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:5-3 was a \u201ctechnical omission.\u201d Nevertheless, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">that failure to sign the complaint within 30 days, and thereby certify that there are reasonable grounds to believe the offense has been committed by the defendant, would be a fatal defect within the intendment of N.J.S.A. 39:5-3. The process or summons \u201cissued\u201d ought not be sustained without a timely complaint as its basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\"><em>[Brennan, supra, </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 349, 551 A.2d at 564.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Subsequent to <em>Brennan </em>and <em>Latorre, </em>the Supreme Court held that a police officer is duty-bound to issue a citation only upon probable cause and by signing the summons, the officer so attests. <em>State v. Gonzalez, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>592, 601, 556 A.2d 323, 327 (1989). Moreover, <em>R. </em>7:2-1(b)(2) (formerly <em>R. </em>7:6-1) requires a summons to be signed by \u201ca law enforcement officer or the judge, municipal court administrator or deputy court administrator of the court having territorial jurisdiction.\u201d Absent the police officer\u2019s or a court officer\u2019s signature, the summons lacks an attestation of probable cause. <em>Gonzalez, supra, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>at 601, 556 A.2d at 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">Reviewing our decisions in <em>Brennan </em>and <em>Latorre </em>in conjunction with <em>Gonzalez </em>and <em>R. </em>7:2-1(b)(2), we find the reasoning in <em>Brennan </em>more compelling. We are satisfied that Judge Harper\u2019s analysis of the law is correct. Procedurally, however, the DWI charge should be dismissed. <em>R. </em>7:8-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of acquittal and remand to the Law Division for entry of an order dismissing summons BTN6436 charging DWI.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
