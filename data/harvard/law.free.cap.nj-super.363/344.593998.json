The September 27, 2002, order also granted summary judgment to plaintiff, John F. Dickson, against Selective. The appeal involves a claim for under-insured motorist (\u201cUIM\u201d) coverage by a shareholder of an insured corporation whose business vehicle was not involved in the accident occurring when the vehicle plaintiff was riding in was hit by a third party. Selective contends that the Law Division\u2019s \u201creconsideration of the summary judgment order that dismissed the action against Selective was erroneous and should be reversed and summary judgment in Selective\u2019s favor reinstated.\u201d We agree with Selective that plaintiff is not entitled to UIM protection under its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">The material facts are undisputed. According to the complaint, on May 17, 1998, plaintiff \u201cwas a rear seat passenger in a vehicle owned and operated by Douglas Campbell when said vehicle was struck hard from behind by a vehicle owned and operated by Aldo Caccianmani and propelled into another vehicle directly in front.\u201d As a result of the accident, plaintiff alleges that he sustained serious injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>After exhausting the available coverage under the Campbell and Caccianmani policies, plaintiff sought UIM coverage under the policy issued by Selective to Air Distribution Systems, Inc. (\u201cADS\u201d), a corporation of which plaintiff was one of four equal shareholders. The four ADS shareholders each drove vehicles that were listed on ADS\u2019 automobile insurance policy. The ADS-insured vehicle Mr. Dickson drove was \u201cpersonally\u201d leased by him for both his personal and business use, but the lease was paid by ADS. Mr. Dickson did not have any personally owned vehicle at the time of the accident. The ADS policy provides up to $1,000,000.00 of UIM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The insurance policy issued to ADS was purchased through defendant Moten Associates.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Prior to purchasing that policy, ADS shareholder Christopher Poyatt discussed with Moten representatives the insurance coverages it required. No other shareholders were involved in the discussions. At the time of contracting for insurance, Poyatt did not give Moten Associates any indication that any shareholder was to receive more coverage than any other shareholder. According to Moten\u2019s Stanley Szczurek, Poyatt did not indicate that plaintiff should be listed as a \u201cnamed insured\u201d or that plaintiff wanted individual UM-UIM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The insurance policy provided ADS with commercial insurance for the liability and property damage including automobile insurance for its business vehicles for the period from July 1, 1997 to July 1, 1998. The policy\u2019s \u201cCommon Declaration\u201d indicates that the named insured is \u201cAir Distribution Systems, Inc.,\u201d and notes that the insured is a \u201ccorporation.\u201d The policy\u2019s \u201cDeclaration Page\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> listed each of the owned vehicles driven by the sharehold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>ers as \u201ccovered autos.\u201d A fifth vehicle was also insured and used by the corporation \u201cfor delivery purposes.\u201d According to Susan Jones, an account manager with Moten Associates, Selective does not allow brokers \u201cto name people individually on [a corporate] policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Shortly after ADS obtained a quote for the insurance from Moten Associates, Poyatt sought additional personal coverage for his wife\u2019s personal vehicle. Poyatt explained that he was the only shareholder who needed coverage for a personal vehicle. Accordingly, a \u201cDrive Other Car Coverage\u201d endorsement which provides an individual with coverage where he or she does not have a personal automobile policy, was added with respect to Poyatt and his wife only. No other shareholders were given that coverage. Poyatt did not have a \u201cpersonal auto policy\u201d for the vehicle his wife drove, and he was unaware that the other shareholders were not fully covered under the policy. Poyatt stated in his deposition that at the time of contracting for insurance he had no knowledge of the laws regarding umnsured/underinsured motorist coverage or how they worked. Moreover, he stated that nobody from Moten or Selective Insurance \u201chas ever explained to me drive other car coverage or uninsured/underinsured motorists.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The policy issued to ADS contained the following provisions concerning UM and UIM coverage:</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">A. COVERAGE</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-9\">1. We will pay all sums the \u201cinsured\u201d is legally entitled to recover as compensatory damages from the owner or driver of an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d or an \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle.\u201d The damages must result from \u201cbodily injury\u201d sustained by the \u201cinsured,\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d caused by an \u201caccident.\u201d The owner\u2019s or driver\u2019s liability for these damages must result from the ownership, maintenance or use of an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d or an \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>2. Any judgment for damages arising out of a \u201csuit\u201d brought without our written consent is not binding on us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-4\">B.

Anyone for damages he or she is entitled to recover because of \"bodily injury\u201d sustained by another \u201cinsured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-9\">F. ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-10\">As used in this endorsement:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-11\">5. \u201cUnderinsured motor vehicle\u201d means the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-12\">a. With respect to an \u201cinsured\u201d who is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-13\">(1) is not the individual named insured under this policy; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-14\">(2) is an individual named insured under one or more other policies providing similar coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-15\">\u201cunderinsured motor vehicle\u201d means a land motor vehicle or trailer of any iype to which a liability bond or policy applies at the time of an \u201caccident\u201d but its limit of liability is less than the highest applicable limit of liability under any coverage form or policy providing coverage to that \u201cinsured\u201d as an individual named insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-16\">b. With respect to an \u201cinsured\u201d who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-17\">(1) is not the individual named insured under this policy or any other policy; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-18\">(2) is insured as a \u201cfamily member\u201d under one or more other policies providing similar coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-19\">\u201cunderinsured motor vehicle\u201d means a land motor vehicle or trailer or any type to which a liability bond or policy applies at the time of an \u201caccident\u201d but its limit for liability is less than the highest applicable limit of liability under any coverage form or policy providing coverage to that \u201cinsured\u201d as a \u201cfamily member.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-20\">c. With respect to any other \u201cinsured\u201d who is not described in Paragraph a. or b. above, \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle\u201d means a land motor vehicle or trailer of any type to which a liability bond or policy applies at the time of an \u201caccident\u201d but its limit of liability is less than the Limit of Insurance for this Coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-21\">However, an \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle\u201d does not include any vehicle:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-22\">(1) Owned or operated by a self-insurer under any applicable motor vehicle law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>(2) Owned by any governmental unit or agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">(3) Operated on rails or crawler treads;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">(4) Designed for use mainly off public roads while not on public roads; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">(5) While located for use as a residence or premises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">In ultimately granting summary judgment to plaintiff based on these facts, the motion judge concluded that \u201c[t]he fact that [plaintiff] had only one vehicle, that vehicle that he had for his company use and personal use was a listed vehicle on the policy, I find that there would be [UIM] coverage\u201d under the business auto policy. The judge added that he personally \u201cdisagree[d] with [his] decision\u201d but felt bound by the recent decisions of this court in <em>Araya v. Farm Family Casualty Ins. Co., 353 N.J.Super. </em>203, 801 A.2d 1194 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>77, 812 A.2d 1109 (2002), and <em>Macchi v. Connecticut Gen. Ins. Co., </em>354 <em>N.J.Super. </em>64, 804 A.2d 596 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>79, 812 A.2d 1111 (2002), on which plaintiff relied.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">Before us, Selective argues that it is not obligated to provide plaintiff with UIM coverage for the accident. It contends that the trial court\u2019s decision was erroneous because plaintiff was not in a covered vehicle at the time of the accident.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">We commence our analysis by referring to the oft-cited case of <em>Cook-Sauvageau v. PMA Group, </em>295 <em>N.J.Super. </em>620, 685 A.2d 978 (App.Div.1996), <em>certif. denied, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>29, 695 A.2d 671 (1997), in which we held that an employee injured while operating a business-owned vehicle during the course of his or her employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>was entitled to UIM coverage under the employer\u2019s business automobile insurance policy. As Judge Skillman wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-4\">[I]t would be manifestly inconsistent with the plain language of the UIM endorsement of [the defendant\u2019s] business automobile policy and with the reasonable expectations of both the employer and employee to deny the benefits of UIM coverage to an employee injured while operating one of the employer\u2019s vehicles during the course of employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">When as in this case a business automobile policy is issued to a corporate employer, the actual purchaser of the policy cannot itself suffer bodily injury and thus could not maintain a claim for UIM benefits except perhaps in the rather unusual situation where its collision coverage was insufficient to cover the full damages to its vehicle. On the other hand, if the UIM endorsement is construed to extend coverage to the business\u2019 employees, it provides a financial benefit not only to the employees but also to the employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 627-28, 685 A.2d 978.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">As in this case, the plaintiff in <em>Araya </em>sought UIM coverage under his employer\u2019s business automobile policy. We found \u201cthat the named insured ... was [the business entity]\u201d and applied our holding in <em>Cook-Sauvageau </em>\u201cto hold that [Araya] is entitled to UIM coverage under the employer\u2019s business auto policy.\u201d <em>Araya v. Farm Family Casualty Ins. Co., supra, </em>353 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 207, 801 A.2d 1194. Araya had been named as a covered driver, and the sole proprietor of his employer \u201ctestified that by naming [him and another one of his \u2018main guys\u2019] as covered drivers he intended to include both employees as insured under the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 208-09, 801 A.2d 1194. We noted the importance of the declaration page, \u201cthe one page of the policy tailored to the particular insured and not merely boilerplate, which must be deemed to define coverage and the insured\u2019s expectation of coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210, 801 A.2d 1194 (quoting <em>Lehrhoff v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>340, 346-47, 638 A.2d 889 (App.Div.1994)). <em>See also Botti v. CNA Insurance Co., </em>361 <em>N.J.Super. </em>217, 225-27, 824 A.2d 1120 (App.Div.2003) (relying on the declaration page to determine insureds and coverage). In <em>Araya </em>we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6d\">that when a business auto policy fails to designate the insured business entity\u2019s human agent or agents entitled to receive UIM benefits, we will look to the Declarations Page as the best indicator of the insured\u2019s reasonable expectations of coverage. Any ambiguity created by boilerplate provisions found elsewhere in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>policy will be resolved against the drafters of the policy and in favor of coverage. In this ease, the covered drivers listed in the Declarations Page provide the best indication of who is to receive UIM benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">There is no question under this analysis that plaintiff is entitled to UIM benefits as if he were a named insured. His rights derive from the issuing of the policy to a business entity and his designation as a covered driver. Therefore, plaintiff is entitled to recover UIM benefits under this policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\"><em>[Araya v. Farm Family Casualty Ins. Co., supra, </em>353 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 211, 801 A.2d 1194.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">In <em>Macchi v. Connecticut Gen. Ins. Co., </em>354 <em>N.J.Super. </em>64, 804 A.2d 596 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>79, 812 A.2d 1111 (2002), the plaintiff sought uninsured (\u201cUM\u201d) as well as UIM benefits under the policy of the employer of her estranged husband. She \u2018Vas operating, with permission, a vehicle owned by her estranged husband\u2019s business\u201d when she exited the car to give assistance to the driver of an overturned vehicle involved in an accident, which she observed. She was struck by a third vehicle \u201c[w]hile standing alongside the roadway, near the disabled vehicle.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68, 804 A.2d 596. The car which plaintiff was found to have been \u201coccupying,\u201d when she was struck and severely injured <em>(id. </em>at 71-72, 804 A.2d 596), was owned by the business of which her husband was \u201cthe principal owner,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 73, 804 A.2d 596, and insured under a business auto policy which covered four vehicles, including the one she was driving. Her husband was also a named insured in a separate \u201cpersonal auto policy\u201d which covered \u201canother vehicle owned personally\u201d by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">Applying the rationale of <em>Cook-Sauvageau, </em>plaintiff was found \u201cto be covered as a named insured\u201d of the business auto policy as \u201cthe designated primary user of the insured vehicle....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 75, 804 A.2d 596. She was therefore entitled to UIM coverage \u201cundiminished by the unmet conditions of the policy\u2019s \u2018step down\u2019 provisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 76, 804 A.2d 596. In so holding, we noted the importance of the declaration page of the policy, as developed in <em>Araya, supra, </em>and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-11\">Our experience suggests that it is not uncommon for businesses to include the personal vehicles of company principals and their families within the coverage of business auto insurance policies. Thus, it is fair to consider the carrier to be on sufficient notice to be required to express any limitations in coverage with greater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>precision than was employed here, especially where it is dear on the face of the policy that the vehicle at issue, here a Corvette, is a personal-use automobile and is garaged at a location other than the place where the other vehicles insured under the business auto insurance policy are kept. <em>Cf. Progressive Cas. Ins. Co. v. Hurley, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>260, 278-79, 765 A.2d 195 (2001).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-4\"><em>[Macchi v. Connecticut Gen. Ins. Co., supra, </em>354 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 75, 804 A.2d 596.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Subsequently, in <em>Botti v. CNA, supra, </em>we held that plaintiff who was injured while driving a jeep owned by his employer was an \u201cinsured,\u201d but not a \u201cnamed insured,\u201d under his employer\u2019s CNA policy even though he contributed to the cost of the insurance. 361 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 222, 824 A.2d 1120. He was also a named insured in a personal automobile policy. Thus, while entitled to uninsured (\u201cUM\u201d) coverage as insured under the employer\u2019s CNA business policy, the \u201cstep down\u201d provisions of that policy applied because he was not a \u201cnamed insured\u201d under the business policy. <em>Id. </em>at 223-24, 824 A.2d 1120. We rejected an argument that \u201cby not naming any individuals on the UM endorsement, [the employer] must have intended for all employees to be \u2018named insureds,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 223, 824 A.2d 1120, and concluded plaintiff was not a \u201cnamed insured\u201d because \u201cthe declaration page clearly indicates that the only \u2018named insureds\u2019 are [the corporation] and its two corporate affiliates,\u201d and no individuals were named, <em>id. </em>at 226, 824 A.2d 1120, although two other employees were added as \u201cadditional insureds\u201d under the PIP and \u201cdrive other car\u201d endorsements. In enforcing the \u201cstep down\u201d limitation against Botti, we recognized that \u201cour holding differ[ed] from\u201d the holdings in <em>Macchi </em>and <em>Araya. Id. </em>at 221, 824 A.2d 1120.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">We need not take issue with <em>Macchi </em>or <em>Araya </em>in reversing the judgment for plaintiff in this case because plaintiff was admittedly neither specifically named in the policy nor personally listed in any endorsement, although his co-shareholder was, and he was not riding in a business owned or covered vehicle. This case simply has no relation to the Selective policy or the business its policy insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">In contrast to shareholder Poyatt, plaintiff was not named in the \u201cdrive other\u201d endorsement, and plaintiff is not entitled to UIM <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>coverage even though he is a shareholder of the insured corporation and an authorized or principal driver of a covered vehicle. Plaintiff was riding in a vehicle neither owned by the insured corporation nor covered by the policy. Nor was he in the course of doing the insured\u2019s business at the time of the accident. Because he was neither a specifically named or covered driver, nor a person listed as insured or covered in the \u201cdrive other\u201d endorsement, he was not entitled to UIM protection under the employer\u2019s policy for an accident occurring in a vehicle not owned and insured by his employer, and having no relation to his business. <em>Araya </em>dealt with UIM for a named \u201ccovered driver\u201d listed on the declaration page of the insured corporation\u2019s policy, doing the insured\u2019s business, although plaintiff was not in the insured vehicle when the accident occurred, and the plaintiff in <em>Macchi </em>was found to be \u201coccupying\u201d or using a covered vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The judgment declaring coverage is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b374-6\"> In his deposition, Moten\u2019s Stanley Szczurek stated that Moten was acting as a broker. Although the matter remained pending against Moten at the time the September 27, 2002 order was entered, the action against Moten was subsequently dismissed without prejudice, thereby making this matter final for purposes of appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b374-7\"> The \"Declaration Page\u201d is not included within either party\u2019s appendix. However, the information contained therein is undisputed. According to plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>tiff's counsel at the September 27th hearing, \"[o]n the declaration sheet ... ADS is named as the insured, and the vehicles covered under the policy are listed beneath that on the declaration page. One of those vehicles is the truck that John Dickson used. It's the only vehicle he owned for both his business and his personal use.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b377-12\"> Defendant also argues that pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:49-2, the motion for reconsideration was untimely because it was filed well after the allowable twenty-day period. However, at the time the motion was initially denied the order was interlocutory as defendant Moten Associates remained in the case and a motion to amend or reconsider interlocutory orders may be made at any time until final judgment is entered. <em>See Johnson v. Cyklop Strapping Corp., </em>220 <em>N.J.Super. </em>250, 257, 531 A.2d 1078 (App.Div.1987); Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment on <em>R. </em>4:49-2 (2003). The court's inherent power \u201cdoes not prevent a trial court from granting relief from its interlocutory orders upon a change in the governing law [or in its discretion] before litigation ends.\u201d <em>Cyklop Strapping Corp., supra, </em>220 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 263, 531 A.2d 1078.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
