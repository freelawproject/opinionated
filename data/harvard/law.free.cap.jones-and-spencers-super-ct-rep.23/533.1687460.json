The case was therefore one for the jury, notwithstanding there was no evidence of any express waiver on the part of _ the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>defendant. No provision in a written contract can afford immunity to a party to the contract from the consequences of his own acts by which performance by the other party was rendered impossible. So, by failing to insist upon a forfeiture for non-completion within the time fixed by the agreement, and directing the prosecution of the work after the expiration of such time, the defendant became liable to pay, if the contract was thereafter performed, but he had a right to claim damages, if he sustained any, by reason of the non-completion within the time. Weeks <em>v. </em>Little, 89 N. <em>Y. </em>566 ; Heckmann <em>v. </em>Pinkney, 81 <em>Ib. </em>211; Stewart <em>v. </em>Keteltas, 36 <em>Ib. </em>388; Gallagher <em>v. </em>Nichols, 16 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S. </em>337. The facts of the case are very complicated and peculiar, and they present great confusion, but a careful examination of them has satisfied us that upon the whole case substantial justice has been done, and that none of defendant\u2019s exceptions should be sustained. True, there seems to be an inconsistency between certain instructions given to the jury, for at one time the learned judge who presided at the trial charged that there was no evidence of any waiver by the defendant, while subsequently he submitted to the jury the question of such waiver, together with the question of defendant\u2019s interference, and the question of defendant\u2019s damages. But the question of waiver was submitted pursuant to defendant\u2019s request, and consequently the defendant has no cause of complaint on that score.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b550-5\"><em>Guggenheimer &amp; Untermyer, </em>attorneys, and <em>Samuel Untermyer </em>of counsel, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b550-6\"><em>Anderson &amp; Man, </em>attorneys, and <em>E.
