The plaintiffs' obtained leave to withdraw a part. The effect was not to change, but to drop a cause of action. The complaint thereupon still contained a good and sufficient cause of action. The case of Ireland <em>v. </em>The Metropolitan Elevated Railway Co., recently decided by this court, is therefore not in point. In that case the object of the amendment sought was to substitute an equitable for a common law action and thus to avoid a dismissal of the complaint. The order should be affirmed with $10 costs and disbursements. Sedgwick, Ch. J., and Ingraham, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
