This point has been decided adversely to the views of the appellant by this court in the case of Ireland <em>v. </em>The Metropolitan El. R. R. Co., 52 <em>Super. Ct. </em>460, in which case it was held that damages may be awarded as compensation for injuries to easement caused by the noise resulting from the operation of the road; and as the court of appeals have not in any way modified this decision we are bound by it. The appellants also contend that the court erred in allowing evidence of the effect of the noise, and of the construction, maintenance and operation of the road upon the business carried on by the plaintiff in his premises. The true view of law in that respect was laid down by this court in this case on a former appeal, reported in 50 <em>Super. Ct. </em>311. The charge of the judge was in har<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>mony with the decision of this court in that case, and of the court of appeals in the case of Drucker <em>v. </em>The Manhattan Elevated Railway Co., 106 <em>N.
