Upon plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the judgment entered on that verdict, the judgment was reversed and a new trial ordered. (For the report of the case see 54 <em>Super. Ct. </em>262.) The plaintiff was injured, as appears by the report, by the vehicle in which he was riding being collided with by a train of defendant\u2019s, at a crossing. On this second trial it was conceded that there was no flagman at the crossing. Defendant\u2019s counsel requested the court to charge that defendants were not guilty of negligence in not keeping a flagman there. This the court refused; but charged: \u201cThey were not guilty of negligence in not keejD\u00cdng a flagman there at all times and under all conceivable circumstances. The jury must determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>whether at this particular time, or under these particular circumstances they were negligent in not having a flagman there.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel excepted to the refusal to charge as requested, and to the charge as given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-5\">The plaintiff had a verdict from the judgment entered, on which defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b67-6\"><em>Hamilton Odell, </em>attorney and of counsel for appellant, argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b67-7\">This charge was at right angles with the settled law of the state.
