The answer as it stands contains allegations which were relevant when the complaint contained two causes of action, but which are not properly a part of the answer when one of the causes of action is striken out. The defendant having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>twenty days in which to answer, and having appealed from the order granting leave to amend the complaint and which made the answer necessary, it was proper to extend the time to answer until that appeal could be heard and disposed of.
