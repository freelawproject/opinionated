The answer among other defenses, put in issue the employment by plaintiff of attorneys and counsel to defend said actions, and the payments alleged to have been made by plaintiff, and also set up two counterclaims; the first alleging that the agreement relied on in the complaint was obtained by fraud, and asking judgment that it be cancelled; the second re-alleging the ground of the first counterclaim, and demanding a money judgment for damages.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b169-5\"><em>Held, </em>it sufficiently appearing from the pleadings and the bill of particulars, that the examination of a long account will be involved in the trial, and it also appearing from the record that no difficult questions of law are presented,.\u2014a proper case for, a reference of the whole issues, including those made by the counterclaims.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b169-6\">Before Sedgwick, Ch.

There the action was for goods sold and delivered, and the bill of particulars showed that' there were twenty-six items of specified articles of merchandise, which were alleged to have been sold and delivered to the defendants, at specified prices. It was-held that actions on contract could be referred; that the nature of the action must be determined by the-complaint, and the answer could not change it. If the - action is a referable one, the answer could not make it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>non-referable; and that the number of items was sufficient to make a long account within the requirements-of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">What is said there will apply to this case, and it would be extremely inconvenient if not impracticable, for a jury to try each of the twenty-four issues, and determine which of them had been proved and which should be disallowed as unproven. The fact that an examination of an account will be involved in the trial of the issues, is apparent from the pleadings and the bill of particulars. It is not necessary that the fact that an examination of a long account is- involved, should be shown to the court in any particular manner; Avhere it does so appear, either by the pleadings or by affidavit, the court may refer.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The case of Camp <em>v. </em>Ingersoll, 86 <em>N. Y. </em>433, is not-in conflict with this decision. In that case the issues in the action did' not involve the examination of accounts. Such examination could only be necessary collaterally; the account was not the ground of the action, but it was-alleged that an examination of the accounts between a party to the action and a third party would prove that there was a defense to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">We think therefore that it did appear to the court below that a trial of the issue of fact in this action will require an examination of a long account, within the section of the Code referred to. The defendants, claim, however, that section 974 of the Code, requires that the counterclaims set up in the answer must be tried, either before the court or by a jury. That section provides that when the defendant interposes a counterclaim, the mode of trial of an issue of -fact arising-thereon, is the same as if it arose in the action brought by the defendant against the plaintiff, for the cause of action stated in the counterclaim, and demanding the same judgment. The first counterclaim set up in the answer alleges that the agreement set up in the complaint was obtained by fraud, and asks judgment that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>be cancelled and annulled. This would be an equitable cause of action and would be triable as directed in section 969, viz.: before the court, unless a reference is ordered. In this case as a reference has been ordered, the trial before a referee will not be in conflict with that section. The second counterclaim re-alleges the ground set up as a ground for the equitable relief asked for- in the first counterclaim, and demands judgment therefor for sixty thousand dollars. This counterclaim would under section 914, be triable as directed by section 968, that is, by a jury, unless a jury trial is waived, or a reference is directed, and as a reference has been directed, a trial before a referee would not be in\" conflict with that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">We have examined the record and can see no difficult questions of law presented. On the case as presented, therefore, we think the court had power to refer the action, and that such power was properly exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with ten \u25a0dollars costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Sedgwick, Ch. J., and Freedman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
