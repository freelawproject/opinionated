Specifically, the petitioner argues that his prior habeas appellate counsel was ineffective by failing to properly brief issues on appeal relating to: (1) alleged ineffectiveness by the petitioner's criminal trial counsel for not moving to sever the petitioner's trial from that of his codefendant; and (2) an alleged conflict of interest by criminal trial counsel resulting from his representation of another client that rendered his representation of the petitioner ineffective. We conclude that the habeas court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition for certification to appeal, and, accordingly, we dismiss the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts underlying the petitioner's conviction, as set forth by our Supreme Court in the petitioner's direct appeal, are pertinent to our resolution of these issues. \"On September 25, 1993, the victim, Norman Jones, a member of the Brotherhood street gang, was socializing at a party in Bridgeport. Antoin Pettway also was present at the party. At some point during the evening, the victim and Pettway left the party together and went to the Pequonnock housing project, where Pettway had an apartment. Upon arriving at the housing project, Pettway entered his apartment building. The victim, who did not live at Pequonnock, remained directly outside the building's front entrance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"Pettway encountered Robert Robertson, a member of the Bush Mob gang, in the building's lobby. Robertson\n   asked Pettway if the person outside the building's entrance was Jones, and Pettway responded affirmatively. Both men then left the lobby. Robertson entered the stairwell and went upstairs, while Pettway took the elevator to his apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"Shortly thereafter, Robertson and the [petitioner], who also was a member of the Bush Mob gang, entered the lobby from the stairwell. The two men, each of whom was armed with a handgun, then went to the building's front entrance and pointed their guns in the direction of the victim. Robertson diverted his aim from the victim and fired once into the air. The [petitioner], however, fired several rounds at the victim, stopping only when his gun had been emptied. As the [petitioner] and Robertson\n   then retreated through the lobby, Bernard Johnson, who had been in the lobby at that time, asked them why they had shot at the victim. One of the two men responded that they had done so to retaliate for the recent murder of a Bush Mob gang member.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"Within minutes, Bridgeport police officers arrived and found the victim lying on the ground a short distance away from the entrance of the building. He had been shot once in the back and was unconscious. He subsequently was transported to Saint Vincent's Medical Center in Bridgeport, where attempts to save his life proved unsuccessful.\" (Footnote omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

The petitioner was represented by Attorney Dante Gallucci, and Robertson was represented by Attorney Lawrence Hopkins. \"Prior to trial, the state moved to consolidate the trials of the [petitioner] and Robertson. Neither the [petitioner] nor\n   Robertson objected to that motion, and thereafter, the trial court granted it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Immediately before the start of the state's case-in-chief, however, Robertson moved to sever the trials on the ground that there was a\n   <em>\n    potential\n   </em>\n   for antagonism between his defense and the [petitioner's].\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although both the [petitioner] and Robertson planned to assert that they had not been present when the victim was shot, Robertson claimed that he\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   pursue a different strategy during the trial if, as anticipated, the state presented evidence from which the jury could infer that the [petitioner] had fired the shot that had killed the victim. Thereafter, the [petitioner] also moved for severance claiming that, if Robertson were to change his theory of defense during trial, there was a\n   <em>\n    potential\n   </em>\n   for antagonism between his defense and Robertson's. The trial court determined that, because at that time there was no conflict between the defenses of the [petitioner] and Robertson, the motions for severance on the basis of antagonistic defenses were premature. The court, therefore, denied those motions. In so doing, however, the court specifically stated that both the [petitioner] and Robertson could renew their severance motions if an actual conflict between their defenses arose during trial. Neither the [petitioner] nor\n   Robertson renewed his motion for severance on the basis of\n   <em>\n    antagonistic defenses\n   </em>\n   at any time thereafter.\" (Emphasis in original; footnotes altered.)\n   Id. at 426-27,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=735%20A.2d%20778\">\n    735 A.2d 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During the trial the state called as a witness Maria Caban, who testified that the petitioner told her that he had shot the victim and that Robertson was also present during the shooting. She also testified that the petitioner told her that Robertson did not fire at the victim. Instead, he indicated that Robertson \"punked out\" and fired a single shot into the air. She also stated that, subsequent to the shooting, a group of men came to her apartment to retrieve what she was told was the murder weapon, and that the petitioner, but not Robertson, was present at that time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   During cross-examination of Caban, Hopkins prompted her to reiterate those portions of her testimony that indicated that\n   Robertson did not fire the shot that killed the victim. During his closing argument on behalf of Robertson, Hopkins argued that both Johnson and Caban lacked credibility, but that even if the jury believed their suspect testimony, it was clear that the bullet that killed the victim had been fired by the petitioner. The jury convicted the petitioner of murder and conspiracy to commit murder,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the court,\n   <em>\n    Ford, J.\n   </em>\n   , imposed a total effective sentence of sixty years incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The petitioner, still represented by Gallucci, appealed his conviction to our Supreme Court, arguing, inter alia, that the trial court erred by denying his motion to sever his trial from that of Robertson. Our Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, concluding that the petitioner had failed to preserve the claim by failing to renew his severance motion on the basis of antagonistic defenses at any time during the trial as permitted by the court.\n   <em>\n    State v.

During the petitioner's first habeas trial, Gallucci testified as a witness for the respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, and stated that the petitioner's defense was one of general denial, although the petitioner did not have a supportable alibi. With regard to Robertson's defense, Gallucci explained: \"Well, the basic thrust of the defense, that he wasn't involved. I recall at some points, [Hopkins] was also trying to show ... not only was [Robertson] not there and [he] didn't do it, but virtually nobody said [he] did it. It was a little different than our defense, but basically, the defenses were consistent; that [they] weren't there. [They] didn't do it.\" The habeas court,\n   <em>\n    White, J.\n   </em>\n   (first habeas court), denied the petition, concluding that the petitioner had failed to show that Gallucci was deficient in his performance at trial or that the petitioner was prejudiced by such alleged deficiencies.

We do not find this argument persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. In the present appeal, the petitioner points to two instances in his criminal trial that are offered to show that he and Robertson pursued antagonistic defenses necessitating severance. The first instance is the cross-examination of Caban by Robertson's defense counsel, Hopkins, which transpired as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"[Attorney Hopkins]: Miss Caban, you indicated that at some point shortly after the shooting you had an opportunity to speak to Mr. Bush, correct?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"[The Witness]: Yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"[Attorney Hopkins]: Dion Bush. And he told you at that time that [Robertson], although he may have been present, fired one shot and he, as you say, punked out. Did he tell you that he fired that shot into the air? ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"[The Witness]: He-he-excuse me. He said he wasn't trying to shoot him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"[Attorney Hopkins]: Right. He shot-he wasn't trying to shoot him and that he himself, Mr. Bush, in fact, emptied his ... weapon into the victim, Norman Jones, correct? He admitted to you that he killed him?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"[The Witness]: Yeah.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"[Attorney Hopkins]: All right. Now, I think you indicated that somebody at some point in time came to your apartment to retrieve what you were told was the murder weapon; is that right?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"[The Witness]: Yeah. ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"[Attorney Hopkins]: Let me ask you this: Mr. Robertson was not there at that time; isn't that a fact?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"[The Witness]: No, I don't think he was.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"[Attorney Hopkins]: Okay. And, in fact, you had named four individuals who were present when you claimed that that weapon was removed; is that right? Do you recall that-that Dion Bush was present? Do you recall telling that to the police in 1996 when you gave that written statement? \"[The Witness]: I recall.\" The witness continued to identify those present when the gun was removed, none of whom was Robertson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The petitioner also points to Hopkins' closing argument, in which he argued, in part: \"Any inference that one might draw, that I don't think came out from the testimony, regarding those facts, which bullet killed [the victim], the [prosecution] asks you to disregard that. It doesn't make any difference. All the testimony that they put on, it is clear, even if you were to believe it, that clearly the bullet that killed [the victim] had to come from Dion Bush, both Maria Caban and [Johnson], from what he says about the circumstances, assuming he was there, and assuming you could believe him, both say through some means the only thing they either heard or observed,\n   in the case of Mr. Johnson, is Mr. Robertson firing one shot into the air, not attempting to hit the person who was the target .... Which bullet killed [the victim], as if it has no relevance whatsoever, it has a lot of relevance.\" According to the petitioner, this closing argument amounted to \"[e]ssentially ... prosecuting the petitioner.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In regard to the severance issue, the second habeas court concluded: \"The credible evidence presented in the prior habeas [trial] established that both the petitioner and Robertson pursued defenses of denial that they committed the offenses and, therefore, were not presenting antagonistic defenses. There was no evidence that the petitioner could have strengthened his own case or arguments in support of severance. [The first habeas court] relied on the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v.

[The first habeas court] also concluded that Attorney Gallucci, who testified about his tactical reasons for not seeking severance after the trial court had denied Robertson's motion for severance, utilized sound tactical judgment by not again requesting severance. ... [T]he petitioner has failed to show both deficient performance and the necessary prejudice.\" (Footnotes altered.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The petitioner's claim is not that Trainer failed to raise the severance issue on appeal, but rather that her appellate brief did not persuasively or sufficiently articulate the severance claim. More precisely, the petitioner claims that the second habeas court erred in concluding that Trainer was not ineffective because she \"failed to specifically document that (1) [Gallucci] had no tactical reason for failing to preserve the severance issue; (2) [the first habeas court's] finding that [our Supreme Court's] opinion in\n   <em>\n    State v.

In his testimony before the habeas courts, Gallucci advanced several tactical reasons why he chose not to move for severance, namely, that: (1) in his experience, joint criminal trials have the benefit of tending to sow reasonable doubt among jurors as to all\n   defendants where the evidence suggests that only one defendant-but it is unclear which one-committed the act; (2) he did not want to draw the ire of the judge and jury by moving to sever on the heels of one such motion by Robertson; and (3) he believed that severance would better enable the prosecution to strike a deal with Robertson in which he would testify against the petitioner in exchange for a lesser sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"[I]t is all too easy for a court ... to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable ...

The second habeas court looked favorably upon the findings of the first habeas court and adopted its reasoning. The first habeas court concluded that the petitioner's and Robertson's defenses were not antagonistic because they were not defenses of such a nature that in order for the jury to accept the defense of one defendant, it would have had to reject the defense of the other. It noted that the credible evidence established that both the petitioner and Robertson pursued defenses of denial and that both sought to attack the credibility of the state's witnesses, but did not succeed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   It further concluded that there was no basis for severance, and that even if Gallucci had renewed a motion for severance, it would have been denied. We observe that, before the jury could have begun to consider and determine which of the two defendants may have fired the fatal shot, it first would have had to reject their mutual, nonantagonistic defenses that they were not present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Nor can we conclude that, had the petitioner succeeded in severing the trials, there was \"a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different ....\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

We do not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The following additional facts, as set forth by the second habeas court, are relevant to this claim. \"This alleged conflict of interest, according to the petitioner, arose from [Gallucci] representing the petitioner and also representing another defendant, one Jamar McKnight .... The petitioner's posttrial brief argues that he wants to 'alert the court of a more larger conflict issue. During the testimony, the petitioner testified that he was upset that [Gallucci] represented him at the same time [Gallucci] represented ... McKnight. McKnight was a case that was up on appeal at the time [Gallucci] represented [the petitioner]. The only relevance to this case is that the gun used by McKnight [in the crime that he had been convicted of] was also the same gun used here to kill the victim of this shooting. From a review of the whole record, it is clear that although the prosecutor [who prosecuted the petitioner also] prosecuted [McKnight], and although ... [Gallucci] also represented [the petitioner], neither counsel brought this fact to the attention of [the criminal trial court]. The petitioner believes that this was a reason that [Gallucci] never pursued a third-party culpability defense, namely, that [the petitioner] did not do this crime, but McKnight did. This is relevant because the [first habeas court] put that responsibility of bringing\n   the conflict issue up to the trial court on the [petitioner], who was a juvenile when arrested, and in his early twenties when he went to trial. Neither attorney who tried this case brought this fact to the attention of the court, or [the criminal trial judge], so [the petitioner] could be asked whether he would waive any potential or actual conflict.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In addressing this claim, we apply the following standard of review pertaining to ineffective assistance of counsel claims based on an actual conflict of interest: \"The sixth amendment to the United States constitution as applied to the states through the fourteenth amendment, and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution, guarantee to a criminal defendant the right to effective assistance of counsel. ... As an adjunct to this right, a criminal defendant is entitled to be represented by an attorney free from conflicts of interest. ... Thus, [t]he underlying right to conflict free representation is effective assistance of counsel. ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \"In a case of a claimed conflict of interest ... in order to establish a violation of [his constitutional rights] the [petitioner] has a two-pronged task. He must establish (1) that counsel actively represented conflicting interests and (2) that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer's performance. ... Unlike other claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, where a petitioner claims that his counsel's performance was deficient because of an actual conflict of interest, prejudice does not need to be established. ... Instead, [w]here there is an actual conflict of interest, prejudice is presumed because counsel [has] breach[ed] the duty of loyalty, perhaps the most basic of counsel's duties.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Hedge v.

The petitioner cites to only one brief portion of Hopkins' closing argument that references Johnson's statement that Robertson shot into the air in support of the petitioner's claim that his and Robertson's defenses were antagonistic.

We also note that, although the issue of the tattoo was discussed in testimony during the second habeas trial, the second habeas court did not address the issue in its memorandum of decision.
