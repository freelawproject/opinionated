On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion in (1) failing to conduct an adequate investigation into alleged juror bias, and (2) limiting the defendant's cross-examination of the state's key witness. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On March 31, 2010, the defendant told Eric Brooks, a codefendant, that he wanted to rob \"somebody with money.\" On the night of April 2, 2010, the defendant and Eric Brooks met with Mary Pearson, their cousin, on the front porch of her aunt's home. Pearson was staying with her aunt, Mary Brooks, on the third floor of a three-story house, but another family lived on the first floor. The porch, which was in front of the first floor, was a small \"community porch\" where people from around the neighborhood gathered. On that night, there were \"other\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   people on the porch with the defendant, Eric Brooks, and Pearson. When Pearson went to meet the defendant, he was already on the porch\n   and had the victim, Kenneth Bagley, who was a known drug dealer, on his cell phone. In front of the \"other\" people, the defendant asked Pearson if she would talk to Bagley to buy drugs for him. An hour later, Bagley arrived in his car and parked a couple of houses down from her aunt's house, in full view of the people on the porch. As Pearson and Bagley began to engage in a drug transaction in Bagley's car, the defendant opened the front driver's door, grabbed Bagley by the neck, and put a gun to his head. As a struggle ensued, the defendant shot Bagley in the upper body, which later caused his death. After the defendant shot Bagley, the defendant and Eric Brooks took Bagley's drugs and jewelry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendant was charged with felony murder, robbery in the first degree, and criminal possession of a firearm. At trial, Pearson testified that she was unfamiliar with the family that lived on the first floor and with the \"other\" people on the front porch the night of the murder. During an extensive cross-examination about\n   the tenants who lived on the first floor and about the \"other\" people, defense counsel asked whether Pearson knew of \"\n   <em>\n    any disputes between the people on the first floor and\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    her\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    aunt\n   </em>\n   .\" The state objected to the question on the ground of relevancy. After arguments before the court, the court sustained the objection \"based on numerous claims.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 20, 2013, the jury found the defendant guilty on all counts. The defendant was sentenced to a total effective sentence of seventy-five years imprisonment. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   First, the defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to conduct an adequate investigation into alleged juror bias, which violated his right to an impartial jury guaranteed by the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution. The defendant asserts that his claim is preserved, but if this court determines that it is not preserved, it is nevertheless reviewable either pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566558\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/233/#p239\">\n    213 Conn. 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 239-40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n    567 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989), or under the plain error doctrine. The state argues that the defendant's claim is not reviewable because he waived his right to raise the claim on appeal. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. The jury began its deliberations on November 18, 2013. On November 20, 2013, the trial court was notified that juror R.A.'s wife\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   received a phone call the night before and that when R.A. took the phone from her, the caller asked R.A. about the case. R.A. reported the call to the court, telling the court that the caller told him that \"they\" understood that R.A. was a juror\n   on this case and that they needed information regarding the case. R.A. told the caller that he was prohibited from talking about the case, and he hung up the phone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   R.A. also told the court that he asked some of the other jurors earlier that morning whether any of them had received phone calls about the case. The court asked R.A. whether the phone call would prevent him from being a fair and impartial juror, and R.A. responded that it would not affect him. The court then gave both the state and the defense the opportunity to question R.A., but defense counsel declined to ask R.A. any\n   questions. Defense counsel did not ask the court to dismiss R.A. as a juror, and the court did not dismiss R.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After questioning R.A., the trial court, sua sponte, proposed that it conduct an individualized voir dire of the remaining eleven jurors. Defense counsel did not object to the procedure or suggest that any other action be taken. During the voir dire, one juror stated that she had heard that some \"people were nervous about [the call].\" All of the jurors, however, told the court that the phone call did not affect their ability to be fair and impartial. At the end of each voir dire, the trial court gave both the state and the defense the opportunity to question the juror. Defense counsel declined to question any of the jurors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After the court interviewed the last juror, it gave the state and the defense the opportunity to be heard on the record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defense counsel stated that he was \"concerned\" that some of the jurors were nervous, but he\n   acknowledged that he was \"not concerned\" about any jury bias. Defense counsel then stated, \"I don't know if there's any way that a very quick investigation could be done and that's just the only thought I had.\" When asked by the trial court, however, who should conduct the investigation, defense counsel admitted that he did not know. Defense counsel then stated that the jury should proceed with its deliberations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The court concluded that it was satisfied with the jurors' answers that each of them could be fair and impartial and that there was no indication that anything that had happened had \"endanger[ed] the fairness of the proceedings ....\" The court also stated that it had \"inquired appropriately under the law\" and that it did not think that \"there's any further action required of the [c]ourt and counsel is not asking for any further action.\" Defense counsel did not voice any disagreement with this assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal, the defendant argues that the court abused its discretion when it declined \"to ascertain how much the jurors' feelings of nervousness or fear ... impact[ed] their deliberations and verdict.\" Particularly with regard to the court's voir dire of R.A., the defendant argues that the court should have asked R.A. whether the phone call had \"emotionally impacted him\" instead of just asking him whether, in spite of the call, he could\n   be a fair and impartial juror. The defendant also contends that defense counsel's \"comments did not constitute a waiver of the jury misconduct issue.\" We do not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We set forth the applicable standard of review. \"[T]he right to a trial by jury guarantees to the criminally accused a fair trial by a panel of impartial, indifferent jurors.\" (Internal quotation marks\n   omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Roman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=320%20Conn.%20400\">\n    320 Conn. 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 408,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=133%20A.3d%20441\">\n    133 A.3d 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). \"[W]e have adopted the definition of a valid waiver of a constitutional right as the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right. ...

A defendant's claim that the trial court did not conduct an adequate investigation into alleged jury bias is one which can be waived by the actions of counsel. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=977%20A.2d%20199\">\n    id., at 337-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=977%20A.2d%20199\">\n    977 A.2d 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial court gave defense counsel the opportunity to question R.A. about the phone call after it conducted its own voir dire, but defense counsel declined to do so. The court proposed to the parties that it conduct an individualized voir dire of each juror about whether any jury bias existed, and defense counsel did not object or request that any further action be taken. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=977%20A.2d%20199\">\n    id., at 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=977%20A.2d%20199\">\n    977 A.2d 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defense counsel requested that trial court conduct general inquiry of jury after trial court dismissed juror for juror misconduct). After the individualized voir dire of each of the remaining eleven jurors, the court afforded defense counsel the opportunity to question the juror, but defense counsel again declined to ask any additional questions. Most importantly, defense counsel expressly acknowledged that he was \"not too concerned about any of [the jurors] being affected [because] [t]hey all said [they] weren't\" and that \"the jurors have indicated that they can proceed and [he] [thought that] they should.\" Considering\n   defense counsel's actions under the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that he consented to and expressed satisfaction with the issue.

Accordingly, we conclude that defense counsel waived any claim that the trial court did not conduct an adequate hearing as to alleged jury bias.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Apart from the individualized voir dire of each juror, defense counsel waived any claim that the court should have conducted an \"investigation\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the call to R.A.'s home. After stating that he thought \"a quick investigation could be done,\" defense counsel expressly acknowledged that \"the jurors have indicated [that] they can proceed and I think they should.\" Thus, again, defense counsel consented to and expressed satisfaction with the issue.

In response, the state argues that the court did not abuse its discretion in sustaining the objection because defense counsel failed to show that the testimony he sought to elicit was relevant to demonstrating\n   Pearson's motive to lie about who was responsible for the murder. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. After the state objected to defense counsel's question on the ground of relevancy, the court excused\n   the jury from the courtroom. Defense counsel argued before the court that the question of whether Pearson was aware of any disputes between Mary Brooks and the tenants on the first floor was relevant because it went to Pearson's state of mind, in that it tended to show that she was \"falsely implicating [the defendant] because she [was] afraid of the other people who [lived] on the first floor.\" The state argued that because Pearson testified that she knew neither the people who lived on the first floor nor the \"other\" people who were on the porch the night of the murder, there was no evidence in the record to suggest that she would be afraid of anyone present that night or of anyone living on the first floor, rendering the question irrelevant. The court sustained the objection \"based on numerous claims.\" The court noted, however, that it was not foreclosing defense counsel from \"developing motive, interest, or bias.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The defendant argues on appeal that the court abused its discretion in determining that the question was irrelevant. The defendant contends that the question of whether Pearson was aware of any disputes between Mary Brooks and the first floor tenants was relevant because it tended to show that Pearson was afraid of the first floor tenants. Her fear of the first floor tenants, the defendant argues, was relevant to the defendant's defense because it explained why Pearson continuously lied to the police throughout the investigation. He contends that it also tended to explain why Pearson may have lied on cross-examination about not knowing who the people on the front porch were or who the people who lived on the first floor were. The defendant argues that she may have lied for a number of reasons, including the possibility that one of the people on the porch that night or a tenant of the first floor may have given testimony that was inconsistent with hers or that she was afraid of those alleged to be the real perpetrators,\n   namely, the first floor tenants. In short, the defendant argues that \"[d]eveloping information as to Pearson's fears because of the alleged disputes was entirely relevant to her bias, prejudice, and interest in the outcome of the case.\" We do not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"In analyzing the defendant's claim, we first review the trial court's evidentiary [ruling].

Defense counsel presented no evidence that Pearson knew the people on the front porch, that the tenants of the first floor were the people on the porch, or that Pearson even knew the people who lived on the first floor. Therefore, any disputes that Mary Brooks may have had with the first floor tenants would be irrelevant in establishing that Pearson lied because she was afraid of the first floor tenants or of anyone present the night of the murder. After an examination of the facts on the record, we do not quarrel with the trial court's conclusion that the question did not have a logical tendency to aid the jury in determining Pearson's motive or credibility, rendering the question irrelevant.

Because we find that the court did not abuse its discretion on the evidentiary issue, the defendant's claim that the trial court's restriction on his cross-examination of Pearson violated his constitutional right to confrontation also fails.

In short, there was significant evidence on the record to support defense counsel's arguments in summation that Pearson had a \"bias, prejudice and interest\" in the outcome of the case and that she lied because she was afraid of someone else.
