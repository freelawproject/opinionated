He sets forth claims of constitutional violations because of the actions of trial counsel, and he claims deficient performance of trial counsel, appellate counsel, and first habeas counsel. The petitioner bases these claims on trial counsel's (1) allegedly discriminatory and improper statements during closing argument; (2) failure to pursue a motion to suppress a purportedly inculpatory statement by the petitioner; and (3) failure to call a witness. Following a trial, the habeas court denied the petitioner's second petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After careful review of the record and the parties' appellate briefs, their oral arguments before this court, and the habeas court's thoughtful and well reasoned\n   memorandum of decision, we conclude that the court properly denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
