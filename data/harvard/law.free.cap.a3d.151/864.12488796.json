On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly concluded that it had no authority to limit the hours of operation of the plaintiff's restaurant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the\n   defendant claims that the court (1) should have determined that municipal zoning boards have the authority to place temporal restrictions on special exception uses, (2) erroneously concluded that Connecticut's Liquor Control Act, General Statutes \u00a7 30-1 et seq., divests the defendant of its power to attach conditions limiting the hours of operation of restaurants that serve alcohol, and (3) erroneously concluded that the challenged condition was not integral to the defendant's approval of the special exception. We agree with the defendant's second claim and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. The plaintiff leases property on State Street in New Haven, on which it operates a restaurant. The property is situated in a BA zone, and the area surrounding the restaurant is used for both residential and commercial purposes. Three dwelling units are located above the restaurant, and there also is a separate two-family dwelling located on the subject property. The use of the property as a restaurant began in the 1990s.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In August, 2000, the defendant granted a special exception to Amato Bernardo that permitted the service\n   of wine and beer in the then existing forty-two seat restaurant. In September, 2011, the plaintiff leased the restaurant portion of the property. In January, 2012, the restaurant was severely damaged by fire. The plaintiff expended approximately $15,000 to rebuild the restaurant, and, on January 25, 2013, it filed an application for a special exception to operate a forty-seven seat restaurant with a full restaurant liquor permit. Additionally, the plaintiff requested permission to allow three on-site parking places instead of the twelve spaces ordinarily required for a forty-seven seat restaurant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendant held a public hearing on the plaintiff's application on March 12, 2013. Several individuals attended the hearing, some speaking in favor of the proposal and others speaking against it. Exhibits were submitted to the defendant, including an advisory report prepared by the New Haven City Plan Department (department) and an advisory report prepared by the New Haven City Plan Commission (commission). At a voting session held on April 9, 2013, the defendant's board members discussed the plaintiff's application and the commission's suggestions in its report. The members voted unanimously to approve the special exception subject to the five conditions stated in that report. By letter dated April 12, 2013, the defendant notified the plaintiff of its decision. The plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court, challenging the authority of the defendant to impose the conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The trial court held a hearing on November 13, 2014. The court heard testimony from Daniel Parillo, the president of the plaintiff corporation, and found that the plaintiff was aggrieved.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following that determination, the parties' counsel presented their arguments to the court. They agreed that the pivotal issue before the court was whether the defendant had the authority to\n   impose a limitation on the hours of the restaurant's operation as set forth in the first condition attached to the special exception. That condition provided: \"Hours of operation not to extend past 11:30 p.m. daily. (Consistent with conditions attached to similar requests in this neighborhood.)\" Although not expressly alleged in its administrative appeal or argued in its pretrial brief, plaintiff's counsel claimed at the hearing that the provisions of the Liquor Control Act governed the hours of operation for restaurants authorized\n   to provide full liquor service.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the plaintiff, only a town, by vote of a town meeting or by ordinance; see General Statutes \u00a7 30-91 (b) ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   could limit those hours of operation. The trial court allowed both parties to submit supplemental briefs addressed to that particular issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The court issued its memorandum of decision on December 12, 2014. The court made the following determination: \"Local authorities unquestionably have a general power to regulate health, safety, and welfare factors affecting establishments where liquor is sold.... Such regulation must, however, be done in a comprehensive, but not inconsistent, manner.... When local authorities seek to regulate the hours of operation of establishments selling alcoholic beverages ... \u00a7 30-91 (b) tells them exactly how to do this. They must do so by vote of a town meeting or by ordinance.\" (Citations\n   omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Citing\n   <em>\n    Bora v.

Accordingly, the court found the condition limiting the plaintiff's hours of operation to be illegal.

In order to serve alcoholic liquor, however, the plaintiff was required to obtain a special exception pursuant to article V, \u00a7 42, of the New Haven Zoning Ordinance (regulations). Section 63 (d) of the regulations, pertaining to special exceptions, provides the following statement of purpose: \"It is recognized ... that there are certain uses and features which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be distinctly classified or regulated in a particular district or districts, without consideration, in each case, of the impact of such uses and features upon neighboring uses and the surrounding area, compared with the public need for them at particular locations. Such uses and features are therefore treated as special exceptions.\" (Emphasis omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Section 63 (d) (3) of the regulations provides the defendant with the following guidelines in evaluating an application for a special exception: \"Special exceptions shall be granted only where the [defendant] finds that the proposed use or feature or the proposed extension or substantial alteration of an existing use or feature is in accord with the public convenience and welfare after taking into account, where appropriate ... (b) [t]he resulting traffic patterns and adequacy of proposed off-street parking and loading ... (c) [t]he\n   nature of the surrounding area and the extent to which the proposed use or feature might impair its present and future development ... (d) [t]he proximity of dwellings, churches, schools, public buildings and other places of public gathering ... (e) [a]ll standards contained in this ordinance ... (f) [t]he comprehensive plan of the City of New Haven, and other expressions of the purpose and intent of this ordinance.\" (Emphasis omitted.) In addition to these general conditions, \u00a7 63 (d) (5) authorizes the defendant to impose specific conditions on a special exception when appropriate: \"In granting a special exception, the [defendant] may attach such additional conditions and safeguards as are deemed necessary to protect the neighborhood, such as, but not limited to, those listed in paragraph 63 (c) (3) of this ordinance. Failure to comply with any such condition or safeguard shall constitute a violation of this ordinance.\" The conditions listed in \u00a7 63 (c) (3) include, inter alia, \"[l]imitation of size, number of occupants,\n   <em>\n    method or time of operation\n   </em>\n   , or extent of facilities ....\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The applicable zoning regulations clearly authorize the defendant to attach a condition limiting the hours of operation when granting a special exception. In reaching its decision that such a condition was warranted in the present case, the defendant had to rely on the record of the proceedings before it, which included the evidence presented at the public hearing and the advisory reports of the department and\n   the commission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the public hearing, the defendant was apprised of the fact that the plaintiff had added a separate bar area to the restaurant with seven seats. The dining area accommodated forty seats, for a total of\n   forty-seven seats. An opposition to the plaintiff's application, titled \"[a]pproval of this special exception would intensify the present use and cause undue hardship to neighboring residents and businesses due to the lack of parking,\" that was signed by approximately forty-five people, was presented to the defendant. Additionally, concerns were expressed that the addition of the bar would change the nature of the restaurant's former use. Although only seven seats were in the bar area, one speaker at the hearing noted that many people would congregate in that area, standing behind the seats and ordering drinks. Further, individuals who identified themselves as living in the neighborhood for several years stated that the parking situation was \"awful\" and a \"nightmare,\" that there were many families with small children living in the area, that there would be \"more bar action,\" and that the traffic would increase if the restaurant had a full liquor permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The advisory reports both recommended granting the special exception with conditions. The department's report contained the following statement: \"The proposed change from beer and wine to full alcohol service (including a bar) does change the nature of the restaurant. Practically speaking, the question is whether or not it is apparent (or even just likely) that ... this change ... will result in an establishment that can operate 'in accordance with the public convenience and welfare' as was determined to be the case for the previous restaurant in 2000. In the view of staff, much of what could be viewed as additional impact is mitigable. For example, while it is unlikely that extending full liquor service to diners would in any way affect existing neighborhood conditions, the addition of a bar might. In many cases, bar service continues far past dining hours into early morning hours, occasionally disturbing nearby residents. Staff suggests that the imposition of hours of operation reflecting dining hours is not only\n   appropriate but is reflective of recent policy in respect to restaurants located not only on State Street but also in other neighborhood business districts within the City.\" The department suggested adding a condition to the approval of the special exception that the \"[h]ours of operation [are] not to extend past 11:30 p.m. daily.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The commission's report expressed similar concerns. In reviewing the criteria in the regulations pertaining to the granting of special exceptions, the commission noted: \"The Plan's Housing and Neighborhood Planning section advises that neighborhoods be protected against potentially deleterious and/or nuisance influences. Any approval of this application should provide some assurances of that protection.\" The commission recommended that the application be approved with five conditions, including the following: \"Hours of operation not to extend past 11:30 p.m. daily. (Consistent with conditions attached to similar requests in this neighborhood.)\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the defendant's voting session\n   on April 9, 2013, it followed the recommendation of the commission and approved the plaintiff's special exception with the five conditions listed in the commission's advisory report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The plaintiff claims, however, that even if temporal conditions relating to a business' operation may be appropriate under certain circumstances, the defendant could not limit the plaintiff's hours of operation because\n   the provisions of the Liquor Control Act grant only the city of New Haven, and not its zoning board, the authority to restrict the hours during which its restaurant can sell liquor. The plaintiff argues, and the trial court agreed, that \u00a7 30-91 (a) sets forth the permissible hours of operation for a restaurant with a full liquor permit and that \u00a7 30-91 (b) allows a municipality to restrict those hours by vote of a town meeting or by ordinance. In other words, as argued, although a municipality has the authority to restrict the hours of sale, a zoning board has no such authority. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The plaintiff maintains that the defendant erroneously construes the trial court's decision as holding that the preemption doctrine precludes the defendant from restricting the plaintiff's hours of operation. We conclude that the preemption doctrine does factor into our analysis because the trial court essentially has determined that a local zoning board is precluded, by virtue of \u00a7 30-91 (b), from restricting the hours of operation of a restaurant that possesses a full liquor permit. Even though the regulations expressly authorize the defendant to impose such a condition in granting a special exception, the court, in adopting the reasoning of the plaintiff, determined that zoning boards are preempted by the provisions of the Liquor Control Act from restricting the hours of service because only a municipality is expressly authorized to do so by \u00a7 30-91 (b). Accordingly, we look to the legal principles involved in the determination of when a local ordinance is preempted by a state statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"The authority to engage in zoning is drawn from the police power, which is the source of all zoning authority.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    VIP of Berlin, LLC v.

As already noted, \u00a7 30-91 (b) authorizes a town, by vote of a town meeting or by ordinance, to reduce the number of hours during which sales of alcoholic liquor are permissible. Further, a town may vote to prohibit the sale of alcoholic liquor within its boundaries. General Statutes \u00a7 30-9. Additionally, the Department of Consumer Protection must refuse to grant permits for the sale of alcoholic liquor in no-permit towns and where\n   prohibited by the zoning ordinance of any city or town.

Therefore, [t]hat a matter is of concurrent state and local concern is no impediment to the exercise of authority by a municipality through the enactment of an ordinance, so long as there is no conflict with the state legislation....

Decisions regarding applications for special exceptions are particularly fact bound. A zoning board must consider \"the particular circumstances of the precise site,\" including whether the \"mode of operation must be regulated because of the topography, traffic problems [and] neighboring uses ... of the site.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Meriden v.

The defendant in this case concluded that a change from the plaintiff's service of beer and wine to full alcohol service, including a bar, would adversely affect the public convenience and welfare of the neighboring residential uses unless a condition limiting the hours of operation was imposed. This decision involves a particular use of a particular business in a particular zone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As such, we conclude that the exercise of such authority pursuant to the regulations does not conflict with the purpose and intent of \u00a7 30-91 (b). The provisions of \u00a7 30-91 (b) permit a town to limit the hours of service in all types of businesses selling alcohol in all of the zoning districts in that town. It is a legislative decision, expressing a policy that service of alcohol should be restricted. Unlike a zoning board's administrative decision relating to an application for a special exception, a town, when it acts by vote of a town meeting or by ordinance pursuant to \u00a7 30-91 (b), has determined that everyone within its boundaries must limit the hours of sale because of a general determination that such a limitation is in the best interests of the town. The purposes for limiting the hours of operation in connection with a special exception and the purposes for restricting the hours of sale of liquor on a town-wide basis are separate and distinct, and both the local zoning regulation and the state statute can coexist without conflict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We conclude that the condition imposed by the defendant on the plaintiff's special exception, which limited the hours of operation with respect to the sale of alcoholic liquor, was authorized by a regulation that was not in conflict with the provisions of \u00a7 30-91 (b). The defendant's restriction of hours merely went further in its prohibition on sales as set forth in \u00a7 30-91 (a). For the reasons stated in this opinion, the trial court improperly determined that the defendant was precluded from imposing the condition restricting the plaintiff's hours of operation and improperly determined that the condition at issue was illegal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to dismiss the plaintiff's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    The defendant granted the special exception subject to five conditions, two of which were not challenged by the plaintiff and two of which the defendant conceded were advisory and not integral to the decision.

Nevertheless, the defendant urges this court to \"clarify that municipal zoning authorities may place reasonable hours of operation restrictions on local businesses when considering applications for special exceptions.\" Because this issue is not in controversy between the parties, we decline to address it. \"This court does not render advisory opinions....
