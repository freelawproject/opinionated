On appeal, the petitioner contends, inter alia, that the habeas court improperly determined that: (1) in\n   <em>\n    Duperry\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Solnit\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"828682\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/261/309/\">\n    261 Conn. 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=803%20A.2d%20287\">\n    803 A.2d 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002), this court considered the issue of whether a plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect must be knowing and voluntary and, further, that\n   <em>\n    Teague\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032050\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/288/\">\n    489 U.S. 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032050\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/288/\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032050\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/288/\">\n    103 L.Ed.2d 334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989), bars this claim for habeas relief;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   and (2) his criminal trial attorney rendered effective assistance of counsel by failing to research the law surrounding the defense of mental disease or defect and failing to inform the petitioner of the court's authority to extend his commitment beyond the maximum twenty-five year sentence. We disagree with the petitioner's claims and, therefore, affirm the judgment of the habeas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The record reveals the following relevant facts and procedural history. In December, 1983, the petitioner hijacked a bus carrying forty-seven people by stating that he was armed with a bomb and nerve gas. Once on the bus, the petitioner ordered the bus driver to drive to a bank. After moving some of the passengers from the bus into the bank, the petitioner held them hostage. He then contacted the state police to demand that he speak with a news reporter so that he could be interviewed regarding a perceived threat to national security. The petitioner then allowed the passengers to leave the bank unharmed, and police officers entered the bank and arrested him without further incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The state charged the petitioner with two counts of kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (1), two counts of threatening in the second degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 53a-62 (a) (1), and one count of carrying a dangerous weapon in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 53-206 (a). The petitioner, represented by counsel, pleaded not guilty to all charges. He then filed a notice of his intention to assert a defense of mental disease or defect. The petitioner was tried before the court on November 2, 1984, in a nonadversarial proceeding during which neither party challenged the other's case. After the proceeding, the court rendered a judgment that acquitted the petitioner of all offenses on the basis of mental disease or defect and committed the petitioner to the custody of the respondent for a period not to exceed twenty-five years. The\n   respondent later transferred custody of the petitioner to the jurisdiction of the Psychiatric Security Review Board (board) in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 17a-602.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Since his initial confinement, despite multiple unsuccessful challenges, the petitioner\n   has remained committed to the custody of the board for more than twenty-five years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   To challenge his extended confinement, the petitioner filed a petition for habeas corpus. Following the appointment of habeas counsel, the petitioner filed a revised amended petition, through which he raised two claims relevant to this appeal: (1) his pursuit of a defense based on mental disease or defect was not knowing and voluntary, in violation of his due process rights, because he believed that he could not be confined involuntarily beyond a maximum period of twenty-five years; and (2) trial defense counsel was ineffective by failing to research the law and advise the petitioner that he could be confined involuntarily for more than twenty-five years in the event he was found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The habeas court denied the petitioner's petition for a writ of habeas corpus. In its thoughtful and comprehensive memorandum of decision, the court concluded that: (1) the petitioner's claim that his plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect was not knowing and voluntary was barred by\n   <em>\n    Duperry\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Solnit\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"828682\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/261/309/\">\n    261 Conn. at 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=803%20A.2d%20287\">\n    803 A.2d 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and in any event was barred procedurally by\n   <em>\n    Teague\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lane\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032050\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/288/\">\n    489 U.S. at 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032050\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/288/\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and (2) the petitioner failed to prove that his criminal trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective under either of the deficient performance or prejudice prongs of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 687,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petitioner filed a petition for certification to appeal, which the habeas court granted.

We engaged in a\n   <em>\n    Teague\n   </em>\n   analysis of whether the canvass issue was procedurally barred and ultimately held, \"with respect to the plea canvass, that the habeas court improperly declared and applied a new constitutional rule in contravention of the principle enunciated in\n   <em>\n    Teague\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Duperry\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Solnit\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 312,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=803%20A.2d%20287\">\n    803 A.2d 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Kirk\n   </em>\n   , the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut considered whether Duperry's claim that his plea was not entered knowingly and voluntarily and his canvass claim were doctrinally separate and distinct.

After determining that Duperry had raised two separate claims in his petition, the federal court analyzed whether this court had reached and decided the merits of both claims in\n   <em>\n    Solnit\n   </em>\n   , in order to determine whether the federal court owed deference to this\n   court's adjudication of Duperry's claims.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090889\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/563/370/\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The federal court analyzed, in great depth, footnote 7 in this court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Solnit\n   </em>\n   , which stated: \"In light of our conclusion, we do not address whether the substance of the habeas court's holding was proper, i.e., whether the principle of\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Alabama\n   </em>\n   , [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1771759\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/395/238/#p242\">\n    395 U.S. 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 242-44,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1771759\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/395/238/#p242\">\n    89 S.Ct. 1709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1771759\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/395/238/#p242\">\n    23 L.Ed.2d 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1969) ], that due process requires a plea of guilty to be knowing and voluntary, applies equally to a plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect.\"\n   <em>\n    Duperry\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Solnit\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"828682\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/261/309/\">\n    261 Conn. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   326 n.7,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=803%20A.2d%20287\">\n    803 A.2d 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, the rule that pleas of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect must be entered knowingly and voluntarily does not satisfy the\n   <em>\n    Teague\n   </em>\n   watershed exception. Thus, we conclude that the habeas court properly denied the petitioner relief on his claim regarding the knowing and voluntary nature of his plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We next address the petitioner's claim that the habeas court improperly determined that his defense counsel rendered effective assistance in the underlying criminal proceedings. Specifically, he claims that his defense counsel was ineffective for failing to research the law concerning the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect and failing to inform him that he could be confined beyond the maximum twenty-five year period if that defense was successful. In response, the respondent contends that the petitioner did not satisfy his factual burden to demonstrate that his defense counsel's actions constituted deficient performance and prejudiced him. We agree with the respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The record reveals the following additional relevant facts. Relevant to the petitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel claim, it is important to note the lack of\n   evidence presented in the habeas court. First, no transcripts exist of the underlying criminal proceedings, as they since have been destroyed. Second, and most important is that the petitioner's defense counsel, Richard A. Kelley, died prior to the habeas trial. At the habeas trial, three witnesses testified: Attorney Raymond Canning, Attorney John Watson, and the petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Canning testified that he had one interaction with the petitioner and Kelley, which took place right after the petitioner was arrested. Kelley, who was running late to work one morning, had called Canning and asked him to meet with the petitioner. Once Kelley arrived, he, Canning and the petitioner discussed the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect. At that time, the petitioner was advised that, although he could serve a maximum of twenty-five years, he would likely serve less time. Canning specifically testified that he and Kelley advised the petitioner that he would not be held beyond the maximum twenty-five years. Further, Canning stated that the petitioner's biggest concern was how much time he would serve. He testified that, at the time of his meeting with Kelley and the petitioner, the board did not exist, and that before the board's existence, \"[t]he maximum was the maximum,\" but once the board was created, an individual could remain committed for a longer period of time than the initial maximum commitment period. Finally, Canning confirmed that this brief meeting with Kelley and the petitioner had been his only involvement in the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Next, Watson, who has been a public defender since 1980, testified about what a reasonable attorney would have done in his or her representation of the petitioner. He noted that, at the time of the petitioner's plea, the revision of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-47 then in effect provided that the petitioner could be committed beyond the\n   maximum of twenty-five years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   He testified,\n   however, that prior to the creation of the board, it was typical for an acquittee to be confined for a period shorter than the maximum sentence and that it would have been a very unusual case for an acquittee to serve a longer term. Further, Watson testified that the petitioner should have been informed that the maximum confinement would be twenty-five years, at which time it would then be his burden to prove that he was no longer mentally ill in order to secure his release, but that ultimately, his commitment could be extended at the petition of the state. He opined that, had the petitioner been informed of his options and pursued a different defense, there was a reasonable probability that he would have been confined for less than twenty-five years. Watson further testified that he was unaware of any research that Kelley had conducted after his initial meeting with the petitioner, and did not know of anyone he might have consulted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Lastly, the petitioner testified. He stated that Kelley never told him that if he successfully asserted the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect, he nevertheless could remain committed for more than twenty-five years. He testified that, although he recalled discussing his options, Kelley had told him that the worst case scenario would be that he would be committed for about one year and then he would be released. The petitioner recalled meeting with Kelley at least five times from his arrest in 1983 through his commitment in March, 1985. Ultimately, he stated that, had he known that he could have been held beyond twenty-five years, he would not have pursued the same defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The habeas court, in its memorandum of decision, determined that the petitioner failed to establish both deficient performance and prejudice under the standard of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and, thus, failed to demonstrate that counsel rendered effective assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \"A criminal defendant is constitutionally entitled to adequate and effective assistance of counsel at all critical stages of criminal proceedings. ...

First, the habeas court found that Canning's testimony lacked evidentiary weight and was of little probative value. His interactions with the petitioner and Kelley\n   pertained only to one meeting, which was held just after the petitioner's arrest. As such, he could not testify as to any other conversations between the petitioner and Kelley, including those in closer proximity to the assertion of the petitioner's affirmative defense. Additionally, the habeas court noted the difficulty an individual would have in recalling details from a single meeting that had taken place thirty years prior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Second, the habeas court found that the petitioner's testimony was \"uncompelling,\" \"largely self-serving and unsupported.\" After observing the petitioner testify, the habeas court noted that the petitioner had difficulty remembering when he had met with his attorneys and with which attorneys he had met. Significantly, the habeas court pointed out that the petitioner himself conceded that his recollection was \"iffy\" of the initial meeting between himself, Canning, and Kelley, during which he claimed that he was advised that if he pursued a defense of mental disease or defect, that he could not be committed for more than twenty-five years. Thus, the habeas court concluded that, on the basis of the extremely limited evidence offered, the petitioner failed to meet his burden on the deficient performance prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On the basis of our review of the evidence presented at the habeas trial, giving deference to the habeas court's factual findings; see\n   <em>\n    Sanchez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=314%20Conn.%20585\">\n    314 Conn. at 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=103%20A.3d%20954\">\n    103 A.3d 954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; we hold that the habeas court\n   properly determined that the petitioner failed to establish that Kelley's conduct fell below an objectively reasonable standard because the petitioner did not establish factually that Kelley misadvised him regarding the fact that he could remain committed beyond the maximum term of twenty-five years confinement if he successfully pursued a defense of mental disease or defect. Specifically, we defer to the habeas court's credibility determination that Canning's testimony\n   was \"of little probative value\" and that the petitioner's testimony was \"largely self-serving.\" What remains is a record devoid of any credible factual indication that Kelley did in fact misadvise the petitioner. Accordingly, we conclude that the habeas court properly concluded that the petitioner failed to establish that his counsel's actions fell below an objectively reasonable standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In this opinion ROGERS, C.J., and ZARELLA, EVELEIGH, McDONALD and ESPINOSA, Js., concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    The habeas court granted the petitioner's petition for certification to appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-470(b).
