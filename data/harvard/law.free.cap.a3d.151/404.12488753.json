On appeal, the defendant, Robert Buchman, claims that the trial court incorrectly denied his postjudgment motion for attorney's fees, sought pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 42-150bb, on the basis that his motion for attorney's fees was untimely, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 11-21.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following undisputed procedural and factual background is pertinent to our consideration of the issue on appeal. The plaintiff nursing home facility, Meadowbrook Center, Inc., brought an action against the defendant based on contract and promissory estoppel relating to its care of the defendant's mother. The admission agreement executed by the plaintiff and the defendant, as a responsible party, contained a clause providing for the responsible party to pay the cost of collection, including reasonable attorney's fees, in the event an overdue account is referred to an agency or attorney for collection. Following a trial to the court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Robert J. Hale\n   </em>\n   , judge trial referee, judgment was rendered for the plaintiff in the sum of $47,561.15 with attorney's fees to be decided postjudgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On appeal, however, this court reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the trial court with direction\n   to render judgment in favor of the defendant.\n   <em>\n    Meadowbrook Center, Inc.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buchman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414901\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/149/177/#p212\">\n    149 Conn.App. 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 212,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=90%20A.3d%20219\">\n    90 A.3d 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). The order from this court was dated April 8, 2014. Thereafter, on April 30, 2014, the court,\n   <em>\n    Robaina, J.\n   </em>\n   , rendered judgment for the defendant. The defendant then submitted a bill of costs on May 16, 2014, and, on June 4, 2014, the thirty-fifth day after judgment, the defendant filed a motion for attorney's fees and costs. On January 29, 2015, the court,\n   <em>\n    Wahla, J.\n   </em>\n   , conducted a hearing on the defendant's motion in which he claimed attorney's fees of $74,918.70 and costs of $1337.38. On April 7, 2015, the court issued its decision denying the defendant's motion for attorney's fees on the basis that the motion was not timely. Rejecting the defendant's argument that attorney's fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb are a component of damages and, therefore, not subject to the time limits of Practice Book \u00a7 11-21, the court stated: \"Because I conclude that attorney fees were not a component\n   of damages, the defendant's motion for attorney's fees and costs [is] not timely, hence I am constrained to agree with the plaintiff. The defendant's motion is hereby DENIED.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following the court's ruling, the defendant filed a motion for reconsideration and reargument on April 17, 2015. In this motion, the defendant argued, inter alia, that the court incorrectly had failed to rule whether the time limit set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 11-21 is mandatory or directory. The defendant alleged that he had raised this issue in his memorandum of law in support of attorney's fees and at the hearing on his motion. In response, the plaintiff urged the court to not consider the defendant's motion as, \"the defendant wants to rehash the same arguments that he already made which were unpersuasive.\" By order dated May 12, 2015, Judge Wahla denied the defendant's motion for reconsideration and reargument without comment. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendant claims, in essence, that once the court determined that Practice Book \u00a7 11-21 governed the defendant's request for attorney's fees, the court should have determined that the time limitation contained in the rule was directory and, therefore, the court should have exercised its discretion to permit a filing that was five days late and, finally, that the court should have awarded attorney's fees in light of the mandate of \u00a7 42-150bb and the fact that the defendant's delay in filing was reasonable and minimal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Our analysis requires discussion of \u00a7 42-150bb, captioned \"Attorney's fees in action based on consumer contract or lease,\" and of Practice Book \u00a7 11-21, captioned \"Motion for Attorney's Fees.\" In analyzing these two enactments, we must determine whether realizing the statutory entitlement to attorney's fees, pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb, is necessarily limited by the thirty day filing requirement in Practice Book \u00a7 11-21, or whether a trial court has the discretion to excuse a filing delay in order to effectuate the public policy of \u00a7 42-150bb. On the basis of the record before us, it is clear that the court did not believe it had such discretion, and, therefore, did not exercise it. Because the interpretation of a statute or rule of practice involves a question of law, our review of the trial court's interpretation is plenary.

Section 42-150bb provides in relevant part: \"Whenever any contract or lease entered into on or after October 1, 1979, to which a consumer is a party, provides for the attorney's fee of the commercial party to be paid by the consumer, an attorney's fee\n   <em>\n    shall be awarded as a matter of law\n   </em>\n   to the consumer who successfully prosecutes or defends an action or a counterclaim based upon the contract or lease. ...\" (Emphasis added.) The parties do not\n   dispute that, for purposes of the application of \u00a7 42-150bb, the plaintiff is a commercial party and the defendant is a consumer. In sum, the provisions of \u00a7 42-150bb are applicable to the case at hand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Our Supreme Court has stated: \"Under \u00a7 42-150bb, the court has no latitude to deny [attorney's fees] to a consumer\n   who successfully defends an action brought against him by a commercial party.\"\n   <em>\n    Rizzo Pool Co.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Del Grosso\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1613224\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/240/58/#p66\">\n    240 Conn. 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 66,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=689%20A.2d%201097\">\n    689 A.2d 1097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997).

Section 42-150bb is a legislative vehicle for consumer protection that affords consumers, as a matter of law, awards of reasonable attorney's fees for their successful defense or prosecution of actions based on consumer contracts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the\n   entitlement to attorney's fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb is a mandatory, substantive right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We now turn to Practice Book \u00a7 11-21, which provides in relevant part: \"Motions for attorney's fees\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   be filed with the trial court within thirty days following the date on which the final judgment of the trial court was rendered.\" (Emphasis added.) There is no dispute between the parties that the defendant's motion for attorney's fees was untimely as it was not filed within thirty days of judgment, but, rather, five days later. Moreover, the record makes plain that the trial court believed it was constrained to deny the defendant's motion on the basis that it was not timely filed in accordance with \u00a7 11-21. The question before us is whether the trial court correctly assumed that the time limitation of \u00a7 11-21 is mandatory and not directory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the former,\n   then\n   the court had no leeway to exercise its discretion. If the latter, however, the court was required to exercise its discretion to determine whether to excuse the tardiness of the defendant's motion and to make an award of attorney's fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, in a case in which the court has discretion to act, but fails to exercise its discretion, that failure alone is error.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"517917\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/201/74/#p88\">\n    201 Conn. 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 88,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=513%20A.2d%20116\">\n    513 A.2d 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986) ; see also\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"760042\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/229/60/#p73\">\n    229 Conn. 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 73-74,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=640%20A.2d%20553\">\n    640 A.2d 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994) (\"[i]n the discretionary realm, it is improper for the trial court to fail to exercise its discretion\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As a general proposition, our decisional law has made it clear that the rules of practice are not intended to enlarge or abrogate substantive rights. See\n   <em>\n    In re Samantha C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8458315\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/268/614/#p639\">\n    268 Conn. 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 639,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=847%20A.2d%20883\">\n    847 A.2d 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). In the case at hand, as we have noted, a consumer's right to attorney's fees pursuant to the mandate of \u00a7 42-150bb is substantive as that right represents the core of the statute and the reason for its enactment. Thus, although we recognize the right of the judges of the Superior Court to enact rules of practice for the orderly conduct of the court's affairs, the enforcement of those\n   rules must be accomplished in the light of the substantive rights they are intended to actualize.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Also, in assessing any particular rule of practice, we are guided by the provisions of Practice Book \u00a7 1-8, which states: \"The design of these rules being to facilitate business and advance justice, they will be interpreted liberally in any case where it shall be manifest that a strict adherence to them will work surprise or injustice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   With this foundation in mind, we turn to our analysis of Practice Book \u00a7 11-21. At the outset, we note that our Supreme Court has made clear that the proper procedural vehicle for a party seeking attorney's fees in an action based on a consumer contract is by filing a motion pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 11-21.\n   <em>\n    Traystman, Coric &amp; Keramid\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    s, P.C.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daigle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3951796\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/282/418/#p432\">\n    282 Conn. 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 432,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=922%20A.2d%201056\">\n    922 A.2d 1056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) (\n   <em>\n    Traystman\n   </em>\n   ). The reach of\n   <em>\n    Traystman\n   </em>\n   , however, is not as broad as the plaintiff contends. Contrary to the plaintiff's argument, the court in\n   <em>\n    Traystman\n   </em>\n   did not determine whether the thirty day time provision in Practice Book \u00a7 11-21 is mandatory. Instead, the court focused its analysis on whether a successful litigant in a consumer contract case could seek attorney's fees as part of a bill of costs filed pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 18-5. Id., at 432,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=922%20A.2d%201056\">\n    922 A.2d 1056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Answering this question in the negative, our Supreme Court opined that the appropriate route for a successful party in\n   a consumer contract action is to file a motion for attorney's fees pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 11-21. Id., at 432-33,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=922%20A.2d%201056\">\n    922 A.2d 1056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Importantly, the court in\n   <em>\n    Traystman\n   </em>\n   explicitly declined to opine on whether the provisions of Practice Book \u00a7 11-21 are mandatory or directory. \"[T]he trial court saw no need to consider whether the time limits provided by \u00a7 11-21 are mandatory or directory, or to exercise its discretion to excuse compliance with those\n   time limits. Indeed, in the proceedings before the trial court the defendant never responded to the plaintiff's claim that the defendant's request for attorney's fees was time barred by \u00a7 11-21, never argued that the rule's timing provision was directory rather than mandatory, and never explained why his failure to comply with the rule should be excused. We conclude that, under these circumstances, it would be inappropriate for this court to review the action of the trial court as if it had treated the portion of the defendant's bill of costs requesting attorney's fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-150bb as the effective equivalent of a motion for attorney's fees pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 11-21 and had exercised its discretion to excuse compliance with the rule's timing requirement.\" Id., at 433,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=922%20A.2d%201056\">\n    922 A.2d 1056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In sum, although our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Traystman\n   </em>\n   determined that Practice Book \u00a7 11-21 is the appropriate vehicle for a successful party in a consumer contract case to seek attorney's fees, the court did not opine on whether the rule's timing requirement is mandatory or directory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In analyzing Practice Book \u00a7 11-21, we must determine whether the use of the term \"shall\" creates a mandatory or directory duty, as the use of the word \"shall\" does not automatically create a mandatory duty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our Supreme Court has noted: \"[A]lthough we have often stated [that] [d]efinite words, such as must or\n   shall, ordinarily express legislative mandates of a nondirectory nature ... we also have noted that the use of the word shall, though significant, does not invariably establish a mandatory duty.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Teresa T.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ragaglia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3593949\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/272/734/#p744\">\n    272 Conn. 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 744,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=865%20A.2d%20428\">\n    865 A.2d 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). Rather, the test to apply in determining whether the use of the word \"shall\" connotes a mandatory duty, or is merely directory, is \"whether the prescribed mode of action is the essence of the thing to be accomplished, or in other words, whether it relates to a matter of substance or convenience. ... If it is a matter of substance, the statutory provision is mandatory. ... If, however, the legislative provision is designed to secure order, system and dispatch in the proceedings, it is generally held to be directory, especially where the requirement is stated in affirmative terms unaccompanied by negative words. ...

First, the purpose of the timing provision in Practice Book \u00a7 11-21 is procedural and intended to facilitate the progress of the case since the timing of such a motion does not go to the essence of the right to reasonable attorney's fees. Second, the purpose of the timing provision in \u00a7 11-21 is to avoid a long period of delay between judgment and a request for attorney's fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In light of the public policy of \u00a7 42-150bb to balance the equities between commercial contractors and consumers, the mandate of the statute that attorney's fees be awarded to a consumer who successfully defends a consumer contract claim, we conclude that the timing provision of Practice Book \u00a7 11-21 is directory and not mandatory. To hold to the contrary would rigidly exalt form over substance and, in the case of a minor failure to adhere to the rule's timing requirement, would prevent the court from fulfilling the public policy driven mandate of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Our reasoning is consistent with the analysis of our Supreme Court regarding an analogous rule of procedure. In\n   <em>\n    Statewide Grievance Committee\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rozbicki\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"523852\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/219/473/#p480\">\n    219 Conn. at 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=595%20A.2d%20819\">\n    595 A.2d 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , our Supreme Court was called\n   upon to assess Practice Book (1991) \u00a7 31 (a) (now Practice Book \u00a7 2-47 [a] ) concerning the attorney grievance procedure. In part, \u00a7 31 (a) stated: \"Any interim proceedings to the contrary notwithstanding, a hearing on the merits of the [presentment] shall be held within sixty days of the date the complaint was filed with the court.\" Faced with a record that demonstrated that a hearing on the merits had not been held until several months after the presentment, the court was required to assess whether the sixty day time period set forth in the rule was mandatory or directory. The court stated: \"Practice Book \u00a7 31 (a) is designed to encourage order and dispatch\n   in the prosecution of presentments. This section is cast in affirmative words, contains no penalty for noncompliance and purports only to establish a time limit for acting upon complaints. We conclude therefore that its terms are directory, and not mandatory, and that failure to meet its time requirements does not deprive the court of jurisdiction.\" Id., at 481,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=595%20A.2d%20819\">\n    595 A.2d 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Our Supreme Court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Rozbicki\n   </em>\n   is applicable equally to Practice Book \u00a7 11-21. The timing of a motion for attorney's fees is not a matter of substance. Instead, as we have noted, the substance of \u00a7 11-21 is the creation of a pathway for a party to seek the fees to which he or she is entitled which, in this instance, is as a successful consumer pursuant to the dictates of \u00a7 42-150bb. As with Practice Book (1991) \u00a7 31 (a), the timing requirement set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 11-21 is intended to avoid extensive delay and ensure order. In sum, the timing provision is a matter of procedure and, therefore, directory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As noted, the court denied the defendant's motion for attorney's fees because it felt constrained by the thirty day time limitation in Practice Book \u00a7 11-21 for the filing of such a motion. As a consequence, the court did not exercise its discretion to determine whether strict adherence to the rule would \"work surprise or injustice.\" Practice Book \u00a7 1-8. Accordingly, a hearing on the defendant's motion is necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to conduct a hearing on the defendant's motion for attorney's fees consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    In his brief, the defendant also repeats his argument, made at trial, that counsel fees are a component of damages under the pertinent statute, and, therefore, the rule regarding the filing of a postjudgment motion for attorney's fees does not apply.

Our review of the legislative history supports this proposition as well. As a sponsor of the bill, Senator Salvatore DePiano commented during a Senate hearing: \"This bill would require that in a specified situation attorney's fees be awarded to a consumer who successfully brings or defends an action based upon a contract or lease whenever such contract or lease provides for the attorney's fees of a commercial party.\" 22 S. Proc., Pt. 13, 1979 Sess., p. 4275, remarks of Senator DePiano. In the House, similar comments were made by Representative Richard Tulisano, another sponsor of the bill. He commented: \"Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us today provides [for] the first time the ability for consumers in this state to obtain attorney's fees, of reasonable amount, as a result of defending or prosecuting any action in which the commercial party has provided for attorney's fees for their own behalf. What this does is give some equity to the situation.\" 22 H.R. Proc., Pt. 22, 1979 Sess., p. 7489, remarks of Representative Tulisano. Representative Tulisano further commented that the purpose of the bill was to provide balance where the consumer contract, typically drawn up by the commercial party, provides for attorney's fees in the event of consumer liability under the contract.

At issue in\n    <em>\n     Cornelius\n    </em>\n    was the defendant's filing of a motion for attorney's fees twenty months after judgment had entered, and the question was what event, in a complicated procedural history, triggered the thirty day filing deadline of \u00a7 11-21.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486334\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/143/611/\">\n     Id., at 132-33\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486334\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/143/611/\">\n     143 A.3d 611\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
