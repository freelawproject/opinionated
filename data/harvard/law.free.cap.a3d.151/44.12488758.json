This ancient metaphor, conceived originally as a mock example used to discredit medieval scholastic philosophy, but deployed here with non-satirical intent, is an apt segue into this opinion. Based on the parties' positions regarding the flagship question in the present case, we imagine the answer Appellants would give to the philosophical query would be \"one,\" while Appellees would respond likely with \"a lot more than that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Appellees, Eugene B. Casey Foundation (Casey) and Frederick County, Maryland (the County), entered into a Development Rights and Responsibilities Agreement (DRRA) in October 2014, following its approval by the Board of County Commissioners for Frederick County (BOCC), to facilitate the\n   development of Casey's 634 acre property in Frederick County. Concurrent with the approval and execution of the DRRA, the BOCC approved Casey's rezoning application, changing the zoning of the property from agricultural to planned unit development (PUD).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Appellants, led by Cleanwater Linganore, Inc. (CLI),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   appeal these BOCC actions. CLI argues first that the DRRA includes unlawfully broad language that purports to \"freeze\" local laws beyond those authorized by Md. Code, Land Use Art. (LU), \u00a7 7-304 (2012, 2016 Supp.), which describes the field as \"the local laws, rules, regulations, and policies governing the use, density, or intensity of the real property subject to an agreement.\" Second,\n   CLI contends that the BOCC approved erroneously Casey's rezoning application because it failed to make certain of the supporting factual findings required for the PUD zone by the Frederick County Code (FCC). We conclude that the General Assembly intended a broader interpretation of the DRRA Act's \"freeze\" provision than CLI imagines and that the BOCC made all required factual findings to justify granting the rezoning. Accordingly, we hold that the BOCC's approval, and the County's execution, of the DRRA, and the BOCC's grant of the rezoning, are supported by substantial evidence and free of legal error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Legal Proceedings\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Casey property consists of 634 acres located in Frederick County's New Market Planning Region (NMPR). From 1972 to 2008, the property was zoned for Planned Unit Development (PUD), designated for low density residential (LDR) development, and located in a community growth area (CGA). In 2008, the then-members of the BOCC downzoned much of\n   the NMPR, including the Casey property, to the Agricultural Zoning District. Additionally, it removed the Casey property's CGA status as well as its recommended LDR designation on the County's Comprehensive Plan Land Use Map, replacing the latter with a designation for agricultural land use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2012, as a part of a Comprehensive Planning and Zoning Review, a newly-constituted BOCC restored the Casey property's CGA status and amended the Land Use Map to reinstate its recommended LDR designation. Because a PUD is a floating zone for which no individual rezoning application had been filed or prosecuted yet to the degree required by the zoning ordinance, the BOCC could not approve at that time Casey's desired rezoning during its Comprehensive Plan and rezoning process. Accordingly, Casey submitted a piecemeal rezoning application for the PUD zone, pursuant to FCC \u00a7\u00a7 1-19-3.110, Zoning Map Amendments, and 1-19-10.500, Planned Development Districts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The County Planning Commission reviewed Casey's rezoning application and recommended approval to the BOCC. The BOCC considered the application at a public hearing on 15 July 2014. The Planning Staff Report (Staff Report) opined that, in the staff's view, the application conformed to all applicable legal standards. Casey presented several expert witnesses who testified to the rezoning application's consistency with the Staff Report and the Comprehensive Plan. During the hearing, Appellants' counsel argued that the rezoning application relied on land use maps adopted improperly and that the BOCC failed to contemplate adequately population projections. The BOCC rejected these arguments and approved the rezoning by Ordinance No. 14-20-675 on 23 October 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As a companion matter, Casey petitioned the BOCC, anticipating hoped-for favorable action on its rezoning application, for the negotiation of a DRRA between itself and Frederick County. DRRAs generally are bargained-for agreements between property owners/developers and local jurisdictions that, among other things, provide for \"freezing,\" as of the date of the agreement, the application of certain extant local laws and\n   regulations during a fixed period of time coinciding typically with the estimated build-out of the proposed development, as long as the\n   period does not exceed the statutory \"cap.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Obtaining forbearance of the application of subsequent changes in relevant local laws provides certainty and stability to developers, whose projects may take many years to complete and/or sell-off or lease. Local governments derive, in return, negotiated greater public benefits than may be attained through typical governmental exactions or conditions of development approvals. To determine whether to approve the Casey-County DRRA, the BOCC held a public hearing on 21 August 2014. Casey presented expert testimony in support of the DRRA. The Board voted to approve of the DRRA, which was executed on 23 October 2014 and recorded in the County land records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   CLI petitioned the Circuit Court for Frederick County for judicial review of the BOCC's approval, and the County's execution, of the DRRA and the rezoning. Finding both actions legal and supported by substantial evidence in the record, the court affirmed the actions on 9 October 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   CLI appealed timely to the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Questions Presented\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Appellants present essentially two questions for appellate review:\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   1.

Regarding the BOCC's rezoning of the Casey property, CLI argues that the BOCC failed to make requisite factual findings regarding design and building siting, compatibility with neighboring land use and plans, and population growth. Appellee Casey answers, regarding the DRRA, that: State and Frederick County laws permit DRRAs to freeze the range of local laws provided in the Casey DRRA;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   parties to a DRRA may negotiate which local laws governing \"use, density, or intensity\" will be frozen; and, execution of the DRRA, in light of recent amendments to implicated County laws, does not operate to usurp County police powers as reflected in the amended laws. On the rezoning question, Casey contends that the BOCC made all of the factual findings necessary to rezone the Casey property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

VIII \u00a7 8.1.B. Because, since the Casey DRRA's execution, the County amended, among other laws, its ordinance regulating developments near waterbodies, CLI argues that its challenge to the scope of the freeze provision is ripe for judicial review:\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Frederick County has amended a number of County laws that are directly implicated by the DRRA's freeze provision, including an amendment to the County's Waterbody law limiting imper[v]ious development within the waterbody buffers. ... [T]he Waterbody amendments would be directly\n   applicable to the impervious structures allowed on the Casey property, which is heavily\n   traversed by waterbodies. Several tributaries to Linganore Creek and Lake Linganore originate or flow through the Casey Property. Lake Linganore provides drinking water to Frederick County and Frederick City Residents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   FCC \u00a7 1-19-9.400, amended in 2015, mandates waterbody buffer requirements for \"[a] parcel, lot, or tract of land submitted to Frederick County for subdivision or resubdivision review and approval,\" and applies \"to applications for subdivision or resubdivision approved after November 10, 2013.\" The ordinance regulates generally the development activities that may transpire permissibly in proximity to a waterbody, and the amended portion, \u00a7 1-19-9.400(D), governs specifically the construction of \"buildings, structures, or impervious surfaces\" and other \"activities requiring clearing or grading over 5,000 square feet\" in waterbody buffers. Home to \"stream corridors\" and \"stream valleys designated as Natural Resources,\" Ordinance No. 14-20-675 at 4, 6, the Casey property contains \"[s]everal tributaries to Linganore Creek / Lake Linganore [that] originate or flow through the\n   <em>\n    Casey Foundation\n   </em>\n   ... propert [y].\" ENVIRENS INC., ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL OCCURRENCE-RARE, THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES 4 (Aug. 20, 2014). The presence of streams and tributaries on the property catalyzes the need for Casey to consider and meet the requirements of FCC \u00a7 1-19-9.400 as amended, unless the DRRA in this case \"freezes\" this area of regulation as of the effective date of the DRRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We agree with CLI that its challenge to the scope of the freeze provision of the Casey DRRA is ripe for review. The amendment of the aforementioned local provision constitutes an accrued state of facts, beyond the theoretical, that bears directly on the justiciable question of whether the DRRA froze properly a wide range of laws, implicating, at a minimum, the ordinance regulating developments near waterbodies that was amended subsequent to the execution of the DRRA and would otherwise apply to development of the Casey property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The DRRA Act's legislative history and purpose suggest an intent to freeze a broader range of local laws than merely the local zoning ordinance.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Each side posits facially reasonable arguments regarding interpretation of the scope of \"local laws, rules, regulations, and policies governing the use, density, or intensity of the real property subject to [a DRRA].\" LU \u00a7 7-304. Appellants read \"use,\" \"density,\" and \"intensity\" as zoning terms of art (not science) and advocate a narrow interpretation that limits a DRRA's freeze provision to the local zoning ordinance. Appellees Casey and the County urge, on the other hand, a broader reading that encompasses the several regulatory domains listed in its DRRA: \"[c]ontrary to Appellants' assertions, the laws, rules, regulations, and policies 'frozen' in \u00a7 8.1.B of the Casey DRRA do affect the use, density[,] or intensity of the project. For example, subdivision regulations necessarily affect the density of a development because platting and other requirements determine the number of lots that can be created on any given parcel. The same is true for stormwater regulations, since these requirements can affect where the development is ultimately located.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   LU \u00a7 7-304 reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the local laws, rules, regulations, and policies governing the use, density, or intensity of the real property subject to an agreement shall be the local laws, rules, regulations, and policies\n   in force at the time the parties execute the agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (b) If the local jurisdiction determines that compliance with local laws, rules, regulations, and policies enacted or adopted after the effective date of an agreement is essential to ensure the public health, safety, or welfare, an agreement may not prevent a local government from requiring a person to comply with those local laws, rules, regulations, and policies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Article VIII \u00a7 8.1 of the Casey-County DRRA identifies the local laws, rules, regulations, and policies subject to its freeze provision as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   8.1\n   <em>\n    Effect of Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   B.

First, the Fiscal Note for HB 700, the original bill that became the Act in 1995, discussed some of the types of local laws implicated by the DRRA in dispute here. With specific reference to local revenues, the Fiscal Note stated that \"[a] local jurisdiction opting to enact such an [implementing] ordinance and enter into agreements could be affected to the extent that\n   <strong>\n    during the period of an agreement it could not effect changes in impact fees, permit fees, water and sewer hookup fees, etc\n   </strong>\n   . applicable to development. Thus, there could be a loss in revenues, of an indeterminate amount, to the local governments.\" MD. GEN. ASSEMB. DEP'T OF FISCAL SERVS., FISCAL NOTE, H.B. 700, at 1 (1995) (emphasis added). Moreover, regarding local expenditures, \"[t]he Department of Fiscal Services points out that increases in the costs of\n   <strong>\n    paving, storm drains, water and sewer hookups, etc.\n   </strong>\n   would have to be absorbed by the local jurisdiction unless an agreement accounts for cost increases otherwise (depending on applicable development policies).\" FISCAL NOTE at 2 (emphasis added). Similarly, the Senate Economic and Environmental Affairs Committee Floor Report for HB 700 stated, in reference to the bill's local fiscal impact, \"[r]evenues may decrease by an indeterminate amount due to the inability of a local jurisdiction to make changes to\n   <strong>\n    development fees, for example, impact fees, permit fees, water and sewer hookup fees\n   </strong>\n   , during the period of an agreement.\" S.

AFFAIRS COMM., FLOOR REPORT, H.B. 700, at 2 (Md. 1995) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   These statements demonstrate that the General Assembly was aware of, and contemplated presumably, the DRRA Act's freeze provision to embrace more than\n   merely zoning ordinances, including something as seemingly attenuated as a variety of fees related to development. The use of \"etc.\" in both passages from the Fiscal Note, and \"for example\" in the Floor Report, suggest that the General Assembly anticipated that the freeze provision would impact fiscally local jurisdictions via the suspended application of increases in existing fees or the creation of new kinds of fees, and even more kinds of laws than fee schemes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   It is patent that local zoning ordinances govern most directly the \"use, intensity, or density\" of real property. Subdivision ordinances and regulations, as well as many environmental and public facility or utilities laws (enforced typically during the subdivision process) are to like effect. Costs and fees associated with public facilities impacts, permits, and water and sewer hookups, on the other hand, seem at first glance rather more attenuated from direct governance of a property's \"use, intensity, or density.\" And yet, the DRRA Act's legislative history demonstrates the Legislature's contemplated inclusion of them as well as among reachable local laws for purposes of LU \u00a7 7-304(a). Viewing relevant local provisions on a continuum from the most direct governance to the least contemplated by the freeze provision, zoning and subdivision would be located at one end and fees at the other. Assuming these outer limits for purposes of the DRRA in the present case, the freeze provision must contemplate, axiomatically, local laws, rules, regulations, and policies that might fit between these poles. Local provisions related to development, comprehensive planning, moderately-priced dwelling units, growth management, environmental protection, land planning and design, adequate public facilities laws, and architecture govern more clearly \"use, intensity, or density\" than do, for example, impact and permit fees. We conclude, therefore, that the Maryland General Assembly intended the DRRA Act's\n   freeze provision to contemplate each of the genres of local laws listed in Article VIII \u00a7 8.1.B of the Casey-County DRRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

This opinion\n   recognized that local governments may \"change a permissible land use ... very late in the land use approval process. In fact, a change could occur after the issuance of a building permit.\" BILL ANALYSIS at 3. The purpose of the DRRA Act, therefore, was to strike a balance between the interests of developers and local governments to \"solve the vesting problem.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The House Commerce and Government Committee explained such a balance as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Development agreements can provide benefits for both developers and local governments. For the developer, a development agreement establishes the rules and regulations which will govern the project throughout its construction, and perhaps beyond. For the local government, the development agreement provides for greater certainty in the comprehensive planning process, as well as an opportunity to ensure the provision of necessary public facilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   BILL ANALYSIS at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   What would achieve best the legislative purpose of balancing a developer's interest in legal stability against a local government's interest in certainty and obtaining enhanced public benefits: limiting, for example, the Casey DRRA's freeze provision to subsequent changes in the zoning code only, as urged by CLI, or allowing it to apply to the expansive list of local provisions in the negotiated DRRA as written? If the DRRA Act only allowed DRRAs to freeze the application of local zoning ordinance provisions, a local government could undermine still the legal and financial stability of an on-going development project by changing the laws related to, for example, development or site plans, subdivision, or planning compliance. Where a developer assumed that its project could be thwarted by a last-minute or mid-stream change to any of these non-zoning laws, it would be less likely to undertake a substantial development at all in a jurisdiction. This, in turn, would frustrate the local government's interest in obtaining greater public benefits through negotiation of a DRRA's terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   We conclude that, like its statutory history, the purpose of the DRRA Act suggests a more expansive reading of the local laws eligible for inclusion in a DRRA's freeze provision, beyond merely the local zoning ordinance, that includes the local laws and regulations falling into the categories listed in the Casey-County DRRA. Accordingly, the BOCC's approval (and the County's execution) of the DRRA, including its expansive and specific freeze enumeration in Article VIII \u00a7 8.1.B, does not expand impermissibly the statutorily-allowed scope of local laws, rules, regulations, and policies governing use, density, or intensity beyond that contemplated by LU \u00a7 7-304(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The parties to the Casey DRRA did not negotiate impermissibly the freeze provision, nor does the DRRA interfere with local police powers.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Because we find permissible the BOCC's and the County's interpretation and application of the DRRA Act's freeze provision as reflected in the Casey-County DRRA, we reject also CLI's argument that the parties to the agreement attempted to negotiate the freeze of local laws beyond those\n   governing \"use, density, or intensity.\" Certainly the Casey-County DRRA freezes a panoply of laws beyond zoning, but the DRRA Act's legislative history and purpose support a broader interpretation of what provisions govern use, density, or intensity beyond zoning alone. We reject further CLI's contention that the Casey-County DRRA's expansive manifestation of the freeze provision interferes with the proper exercise of local police powers. Regardless of the scope of laws a given DRRA freezes, LU \u00a7 7-304(b) allows a local government to enforce any \"local laws, rules, regulations, and policies enacted or adopted after the effective date of an agreement\" if compliance with the new laws \"is essential to ensure the public health, safety, or welfare.\" Article VIII \u00a7 8.1.C of the Casey DRRA provides exactly for that potentiality.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The BOCC found also that rezoning the Casey property to PUD \"is consistent with the current County Comprehensive Plan,\" and that the proposed development accords with the Plan's \"overall community development principles such as encouraging higher density development, a mix of land uses, providing distinctive design that contributes to a distinctive community character, efficiency of layout relative to public infrastructure, and general accessibility through multiple modes of transport as well as interconnectedness of the transportation network.\" Ordinance No. 14-20-675 at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   It appears to us that the BOCC made adequate findings supporting a favorable conclusion relative to the factors in FCC \u00a7 1-19-10.500.3(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

First, the BOCC described the property: \"[t]he Site surrounds an existing horse farm, Hall's Choice Farm, which is a 35 acre sales, breeding, and training facility for Hanoverian horses. This property is not a part of this PUD application, though it is designated Low Density Residential and is part of the growth area.\" Ordinance No. 14-20-675 at 14. Further along in the Ordinance, the BOCC examined the Casey developments' compatibility with the use of the farm: \"[l]andscape buffers between the project and Hall[']s Choice Farm, the Audubon Property, and the Swanby Property will effectively mitigate potential inconsistencies between the project and the existing uses on those properties.\" Ordinance No. 14-20-675 at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

In the Rezoning Ordinance, however, the BOCC calculated the population increase expected to result from developing the Casey property, based on 2010 U.S. Census data, finding that \"[t]he potential additional population change as a result of the proposed 1,017\n   units equates to 2,746 persons, based on 2.7 persons per household.\" Ordinance No. 14-20-675 at 15. Speculating that, \"[a]s a matter of public policy,\" LU \u00a7 4-204(b)(1)(i)'s requirement that a population finding accompany a zoning-changing map amendment must entail more than \"a mere mathematical equation devoid of any planning or growth analysis,\" CLI asserts that the BOCC \"fail[ed] to make a meaningful finding in connection with 'population.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   As to the BOCC's approach to addressing the findings regarding design and the siting of buildings, compatibility with neighboring land uses, and population growth, we must defer to the expertise of the BOCC. \"The scope of judicial review of administrative fact-finding is a narrow and highly deferential one,\" and we do not substitute our judgment for that of the BOCC.\n   <em>\n    Trinity Assembly of God of Baltimore City, Inc. v.

Moreover, we do not consider the scope (if any) of the catch-all description in \u00a7 8.1.B of the Casey DRRA, \"including but not limited to,\" that precedes the enumeration of the regulatory fields intended to be frozen by the Agreement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Although they forebode further litigation, there will be further opportunities to test the ultimate boundaries of any freeze provision in a DRRA. Casey (or its successors/assigns), for example, will confront many additional and necessary governmental development processes, at which times the appropriate governmental body may confront questions regarding whether a law, regulation, or policy is frozen or not. Even if the specific regulatory rule then under examination is deemed covered by the Agreement (and comes within the intent of LU \u00a7 7-304(a)), the local government may unfreeze the rule by exercising its prerogative under Art. VIII, \u00a7 8.1.C of the Agreement, for public safety, health, and welfare reasons, as noted\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    at 394, 151 A.3d at 56.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Given our conclusion as to the General Assembly's intent in enacting Art. 66B, \u00a7 13.01 and LU \u00a7 7-304(a), no purpose is served by considering CLI's arguments regarding how other States and localities have enacted or interpreted their DRRA legislation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
