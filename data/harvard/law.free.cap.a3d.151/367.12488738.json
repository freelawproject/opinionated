On appeal, the plaintiff claims that he is entitled to workers' compensation benefits because he had departed his \"place of abode\" for duty as a police officer. We agree with the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, as found by the commissioner, and procedural history are relevant to the disposition of this appeal. The plaintiff was employed by the defendant as a police officer on October 25, 2012. The plaintiff was scheduled to perform an extra duty job as a police officer\n   for the defendant beginning at 7 a.m. on that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiff moved his vehicle out of his driveway at approximately 5:30 a.m. on that morning so that his son could move another vehicle out of the driveway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After moving his vehicle, the plaintiff parked it in the street directly in front of his house. The vehicle was parked so that the passenger side of the vehicle was facing the house and the driver's side of the vehicle was facing the street. After parking his vehicle on the street, the plaintiff went back into his home and finished getting ready for work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At approximately 6 a.m., the plaintiff walked through his breezeway, down the driveway and to the driver's side door of his vehicle, which was still parked on the street. While standing on the street at the driver's side door, the plaintiff dropped his keys. The keys ricocheted off his foot and landed underneath his vehicle. The plaintiff squatted down and twisted to pick up his keys, injuring his lumbar spine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The commissioner dismissed the plaintiff's claim, concluding that \"[b]ased on the totality of the evidence submitted ... the [plaintiff had] not met his burden [of demonstrating] that the ... injury arose out of and in the course of his employment as he was injured at home prior to commencing his normal commute to work. He had not departed from his 'place of abode' pursuant to ... \u00a7 31-275 (1) (A) (i) at the time he sustained his back injury and therefore this incident is not compensable.\" The plaintiff appealed to the board, which affirmed the decision of the commissioner. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"As a threshold matter, we set forth the standard of review applicable to workers' compensation appeals. The principles that govern our standard of review in workers' compensation appeals are well established. The conclusions drawn by [the commissioner] from the facts found must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them. ... [Moreover, it] is well established that\n   [a]lthough not dispositive, we accord great weight to the construction given to the workers' compensation statutes by the commissioner and [the] board. ...

Section 31-275 (1) (A) (i) provides as follows: \"For a police officer or firefighter, 'in the course of his employment' encompasses such individual's departure from such individual's place of abode to duty, such individual's duty, and the return to such individual's place of abode after duty ....\" Section 31-275 (1) (A) (i) does not define the term \"place of abode\" and this court has never had an opportunity to address the meaning of that term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Both the plaintiff and the defendant rely on the Appellate Court's interpretation of \u00a7 31-275 (1) (A) (i) in\n   <em>\n    Perun\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Danbury\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415784\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/143/313/\">\n    143 Conn.App. 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=67%20A.3d%201018\">\n    67 A.3d 1018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013), to support their positions in the present case. Specifically, the defendant asserts that the Appellate Court adopted a broad definition of the term \" 'place of abode' \" in\n   <em>\n    Perun\n   </em>\n   , and that the broad definition would include\n   the area on the public street in front of the plaintiff's house in the present case. On the other hand, the plaintiff asserts that, unlike the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Perun\n   </em>\n   , he had crossed the demarcation line of his abode when he entered the public street in front of his house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Perun\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff, a police officer, slipped and fell on a patch of ice in his driveway as he approached his vehicle to depart for work.\n   <em>\n    Perun\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Danbury\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415784\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/143/313/\">\n    143 Conn.App. at 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=67%20A.3d%201018\">\n    67 A.3d 1018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The commissioner granted the\n   plaintiff's claim, finding that the injury occurred during his departure to work. The board reversed the commissioner's decision, relying on \u00a7 31-275 (1) (E) and (F). Id., at 315,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=67%20A.3d%201018\">\n    67 A.3d 1018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The board concluded that the plaintiff's injury did not arise out of and in the scope of his employment, and was not compensable under \u00a7 31-275 (1) (E) (i) because the injury occurred at the plaintiff's place of abode.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=67%20A.3d%201018\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The Appellate Court affirmed the board's dismissal, reasoning that \"[\u00a7] 31-275 (1) (E) and (F) articulate at what point a police officer's or firefighter's course of employment commences and terminates. Section 31-275 (1) (E) provides in relevant part that '[a] personal injury shall not be deemed to arise out of the employment if the injury is sustained ... [a]t the employee's place of abode, and ... while the employee is engaged in a preliminary act or acts in preparation for work unless such act or acts are undertaken at the express direction or request of the employer.' What constitutes one's 'place of abode' is defined in \u00a7 31-275 (1) (F), and it 'includes the inside of the residential structure, the garage, the common hallways, stairways, driveways, walkways and the yard ....' \" (Emphasis omitted; footnote omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Perun\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Danbury\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 317,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=67%20A.3d%201018\">\n    67 A.3d 1018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Appellate Court further reasoned that \"[r]eading \u00a7 31-275 (1) as a whole, we hold that a police officer's or firefighter's commute to and from work is part of his or her 'course of employment.' The commute, however, according to the legislature, does not begin when the police officer or firefighter breaks the plane of his front door: an injury occurring in a driveway does not occur in the course of employment. In other words, police officers do enjoy so-called 'portal-to-portal coverage' under the workers' compensation statutes ... but, [the plaintiff] had not crossed the demarcation line as defined by the legislature when he sustained his injury.\" (Citation omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=67%20A.3d%201018\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Although we are not bound by the Appellate Court's interpretation of \u00a7 31-275 (1) (A) (i), we find that it is instructive. In interpreting \u00a7 31-275 (1) (A) (i), consistent with \u00a7 1-2z, the Appellate Court looked to other relevant statutory provisions-namely \u00a7 31-275 (1) (E) and (F).

Section 31-275 (1) (E) provides that \"A personal injury shall not be deemed to arise out of the employment if the injury is sustained: (i) At the employee's place of abode, and (ii) while the employee is engaged in a preliminary act or acts in preparation for work unless such act or acts are undertaken at the express direction or request of the employer ....\" Section 31-275 (1) (E) is \"two-pronged and injuries are not compensable only if both prongs of the statute are met.\"\n   <em>\n    McMorris\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New Haven Police Dept.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=156%20Conn.%20App.%20822\">\n    156 Conn.App. at 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20A.3d%20491\">\n    115 A.3d 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Section 31-275 (1) (F) provides as follows: \"For purposes of subparagraph (E) of this subdivision, 'place of abode' includes the inside of the residential structure, the garage, the common hallways, stairways, driveways, walkways and the yard ....\" Section 31-275 (1) (F) does not purport to provide an exhaustive list of the areas that will be considered in \"place of abode,\" but\n   instead provides examples of those items that will be \"include[d]\" in the term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"According to the [doctrine] of ejusdem generis, unless a contrary intent appears, where general terms are followed by specific terms in a statute, the general terms will be construed to embrace things of the same general kind or character as those specifically enumerated. 2A J.

In \u00a7 31-275 (1) (F), the legislature has provided examples in an effort to help define the term \"place of abode.\" This list indicates that the legislature intended to include areas related to where an individual resides, such as walkways, breezeways, yards, and driveways. Notably, this list does not include public areas that may be adjacent to a person's property, such as sidewalks or streets.

In \u00a7 31-275 (1) (F), the legislature chose to use the phrase \"place of abode\" in concert\n   with numerous terms associated with areas related to where an individual resides-the inside of the residential structure, the garage, the common hallways, stairways, driveways, walkways and the yard. Therefore, the legislature's use of the term \"place of abode\" in connection with areas that are related to where an individual resides is further indication that the legislature intended \"place of abode\" to be private areas related to where an individual resides, not public property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant asserts that the legislature's use of the term \"includes\" in \u00a7 31-275 (1) (F) demonstrates an intent to have a broad definition of \"place of abode,\" which encompasses areas beyond one's property. We disagree. Although we agree that the term \"includes\" indicates that the legislature was only providing examples of areas that are considered within one's \"place of abode,\" we cannot conclude that the legislature's use of \"includes\" demonstrates an intention to encompass public areas unrelated to where an individual resides to be within the definition of \"place of abode.\" To the contrary, all of the examples provided by the legislature are areas within the confines of one's property. Therefore, it is consistent with our interpretation that the legislature may have intended to include areas such as a deck or patio within the definition of \"place of abode,\" but we cannot conclude that the legislature intended\n   to make the definition so broad as to include public areas. Keeping in mind the remedial nature of the act and our obligation to construe it in favor of injured employees, we conclude that construing \"place of abode\" broadly so as to include a public street would incorrectly limit the operation of the statute and frustrate the remedial purpose of the act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The dissent asserts that \"[t]he scope of \u00a7 31-275 (1) (A) (i) must be read expansively enough to accommodate [the realities of employees' varied] circumstances to the extent as is consistent with the purpose of the coming and going exception.\" Although we agree that \u00a7 31-275 (1) (A) (i) must be read so as to further the purpose of the coming and going exception, we disagree that the broad construction proposed by the dissent accomplishes that purpose. It has been recognized that \"[t]he extension of workers' compensation benefits to periods when police and firefighters are going to or coming home from work makes sense since by the very nature of their work, these public servants are always on duty serving and protecting the community.\" R Carter et al., 19 Connecticut Practice Series: Workers' Compensation (2008) \u00a7 6:14, p. 199. Instead of accomplishing the purpose of the act and the coming and going exception-namely, providing extra coverage for police officers and firefighters-the dissent's proposed construction of the statute expands the statute so far that it frustrates the purpose of the act and severely limits coverage. The dissent asserts that \"[t]he plaintiff's place of abode extended to the street where his vehicle was parked. Such a construction sensibly treats employees similarly irrespective of where they park their vehicles-in their driveways, on the street, or in a garage across the street.\" We disagree that the statute calls for such a broad construction of the term \"place of abode.\" Even if we were to agree with the dissent that the point at which the employee commences his commute\n   is determinative, which we do not, it still would be appropriate to make the residential areas the proper line of demarcation to make that assessment. In doing so, employees would be treated consistently irrespective of whether they drive their own car, use public transportation, walk, or use some combination of modes of transport. Such a broad construction of the term unduly limits the coverage of the statute. Furthermore, not only does this interpretation frustrate the purpose of the statute and our mandate to interpret it so as to confer coverage on an injured employee, it ignores the other language of the statute.\n   It is important to our construction of \u00a7 31-275 (1) (A) (i) that we recognize that the statute provides that \"[f]or a police officer or firefighter, 'in the course of his employment'\n   <em>\n    encompasses such individual's departure from such individual's place of abode to duty\n   </em>\n   , such individual's duty, and the return to such individual's place of abode after duty ....\" (Emphasis added.) Section 31-275 (1) (A) (i) does not define the term \"departure.\" Accordingly, pursuant to \u00a7 1-2z, we look to the dictionary definition of the term. The term \"departure\" is defined with substantial similarity in numerous dictionaries. Webster's Third New International Dictionary (2002) defines \"departure\" as, inter alia, \"separation ... removal from a place ... act of going away ... a setting out [as on a journey] ....\" The American Heritage College Dictionary (4th Ed. 2007) similarly defines \"departure\" as, inter alia, \"[t]he act of leaving ... a starting out, as on a trip ....\" On the basis of these definitions of departure, we conclude that fact that the plaintiff in the present case had entered the public thoroughfare on his way to duty is sufficient to establish that he was covered. It was not necessary for the plaintiff to demonstrate that he had entered his vehicle or started his engine, or otherwise \"begun\" his commute. The fact that the plaintiff had left his driveway\n   and entered the public thoroughfare is sufficient to establish coverage, even if he then planned to enter a vehicle and continue to duty by way of a vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The plaintiff asserts that the reading of \u00a7 31-275 (1) (A) (i) urged by the defendant and adopted by the dissent would lead to absurd and unworkable results. We agree. Specifically, the plaintiff asserts that if he happened to live in New Haven and walk to work, there would be no dispute that from the moment he left the boundary of his property and entered out onto the public street, any injury would be \" '[within] the course of his employment' \" under \u00a7 31-275 (1) (A) (i). Specifically, the plaintiff asserts that if he were walking to work and dropped his keys on the street in the same relative location as he did in the present case, his injury would be compensable. The plaintiff claims that such an interpretation of \u00a7 31-275 (1) (A) (i) is unworkable because he would be treated differently because he drives to work and had not entered his vehicle, despite the fact that he had entered the public road. We agree and conclude that, based on the plain language of \u00a7 31-275 (1) (A) (i), \"place of abode\" does not include the public street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Furthermore, this court's prior interpretation of other statutes is consistent with our conclusion that the term \"place of abode\" should not be interpreted so broadly as to include a public street.

At any time there might be [delivery persons], the landlord,\n   his or her agents, visitors, or residents of the other apartment in that common hallway and the defendant could not lawfully have excluded them from the premises. In other words, although the defendant may have been the principal user of the third floor landing and stairway, other individuals, however infrequent their use, also had a right to use that area. ... This being the case, we conclude that the stairway and landing which led to the defendant's apartment were not part of his residence or abode.\" (Citation omitted; footnote omitted.)

For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Clover v.

This court explained that \"[i]n a sense it is of course true that [the plaintiff] had his 'usual place of abode' in Waterbury and in the apartment house in question, but it is manifest that leaving a copy of process anywhere in Waterbury or anywhere in the apartment house, would be insufficient. ...

This did not include the outer hall used by the other tenant in connection with his apartment and occasionally used by [the plaintiff], any more than it included the walk from the street to the house, or the yard which the tenants used in common. In legal view, the apartments in a house of this character are as separate and distinct as though under separate roofs. [The plaintiff's] place of abode was as much a separate and distinct habitation as though in a building by itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The outer hall was merely a passageway for his use in common with other tenants, and his place of abode was not reached from the street\n   until one came to the door which led into his own apartment.

Leaving the copy of the process in the outer hall was much the same, and it failed as completely as if it had been left on the common sidewalk or in the common yard.\" (Citations omitted.)

The statute provides in relevant part that \" 'place of abode' includes the inside of the residential structure, the garage, the common hallways, stairways, driveways, walkways and the yard ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (1) (F). The regulation similarly provides in relevant part that \" 'place of abode' includes, but is not limited to: (a) House, condominium, or apartment; (b) Inside of residential structures; (c) Garages; (d) Common hallways; (e) Stairways; (f) Driveways; (g) Walkways, or (h) Yards.\" Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 31-275-1 (2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Notably, these definitions are not limited to the actual residential area but also include places where the employee would store a vehicle used to commute to work, i.e., a garage or a driveway. Although one's place of abode may have a more limited scope in other contexts, such as those identified by the majority, it is logical and necessary for this term to extend to locations where the employee's vehicle is stored for purposes of \u00a7 31-275 (1). Section 31-275 (1) (A) (i) is directed at covering certain employees' commutes to work, which most often occur through the employees' use of their own vehicles. In addition, the statutory definition of place of abode also applies to \u00a7 31-275 (1) (E), which sets forth the rule deeming preliminary acts or acts in preparation for work performed at the employee's place of abode to be generally noncompensable. See footnote 1 of this dissenting opinion. The examples of such acts indicate that clearing obstacles\n   inhibiting egress from where the vehicle is stored would fall under the scope of this rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   See Regs., Conn.

As the majority concedes, the enumerated locations in the definitions are not an exhaustive list.

The definitions of place of abode are not limited in application to \u00a7 31-275 (1) (A) (i) but also to other provisions applicable to all employees. See footnote 1 of this dissenting opinion. Employees' arrangements for their place of residence and for their storage of vehicles vary widely. For example, an employee may rent a room in someone else's house, temporarily stay with friends or relatives, live in a shelter or group housing, or live on a college campus. An employee may store his vehicle in his own garage or driveway, in a garage or lot in a common interest community, in an unassigned parking space in an apartment complex, in his neighbor's garage or driveway, or in other locations. Although the majority's determination that an employee's place of abode terminates at the employee's own property line has the superficial appeal of a bright line rule, that line is unmoored to the realities of employees' varied circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The scope of \u00a7 31-275 (1) (A) (i) must be read expansively enough to accommodate such circumstances to the extent as is\n   consistent with the purpose of the coming and going exception. The paramount question is whether the employee's commute has commenced. That question is dependent upon the facts and circumstances of each case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The aforementioned factors demonstrate that, under the circumstances of the present case as recited in the majority opinion, the commissioner properly concluded that the plaintiff had not departed from his\n   place of abode to duty when he bent down by his vehicle to retrieve his dropped keys, thereby injuring his back. In making her determination, the commissioner adopted a construction of the statute that affords logical, consistent treatment of claims without regard to inconsequential differences in factual circumstances. Under the commissioner's construction, the happenstance of the plaintiff moving his vehicle out of his driveway to accommodate his son's departure was immaterial. The plaintiff's place of abode extended to the street where his vehicle was parked. Such a construction sensibly treats employees similarly irrespective of where they park their vehicles-in their driveways, on the street, or in a garage across the street. Similarly, the commissioner's construction would render immaterial the happenstance of whether the plaintiff had parked with the driver's side of his vehicle facing the street or in the opposite direction abutting his yard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The commissioner's conclusion also took into account the fact that the plaintiff had not entered his vehicle or even opened the vehicle's door when he sustained his injury. As such, the commissioner reasonably concluded that the plaintiff's commute had not begun when he sustained his back injury, irrespective of whether his vehicle had remained in his driveway or was moved to the street in front of his house. At the evidentiary hearing, the following exchange occurred\n   during the cross-examination of the plaintiff by the defendant's counsel:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \"Q. And you had not departed your house at the time that this incident had occurred, is that correct?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \"A. When I felt the pain in my back?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \"Q. Right?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \"A. Right, I had not left yet.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The commissioner found that the plaintiff \"acknowledged that at the time he felt the pain in his back he had not departed from his home.\" The plaintiff did not file a motion to correct that finding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As such, the commissioner's construction also is reasonable because it is consistent with the purpose of \u00a7 31-275 (1) (A) (i), to exempt police officers' commutes from the coming and going rule. The commissioner\n   reasonably took this purpose into account when she concluded that the plaintiff's departure to duty had not yet commenced. Accordingly, I would affirm the Workers' Compensation Review Board's decision affirming the commissioner's decision\n   concluding that the plaintiff's back injury is not compensable because it did not occur in the course of employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    We note that Connecticut Interlocal Risk Management Agency, the workers' compensation claims administrator for the New Haven Police Department, is also a defendant in the present case.

To the extent that the regulations constitute a time-tested interpretation of the board, the terms of the regulation are consistent with the terms used in the statute itself and our interpretation to include privately owned areas within the confines of the property line.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    A plethora of evidence demonstrates that both the statutory and regulatory definitions relating to place of abode are intentionally limited in their application to subparagraph (E) of \u00a7 31-275 (1), which, as I explain herein, is an unrelated provision that applies to all employees. Subparagraphs (A) through (E) of \u00a7 31-275 (1) prescribe the circumstances under which an injury is compensable. Subparagraph (F) defines terms used in two of those subparagraphs, one of which provides in relevant part: \"For purposes of subparagraph (E) of this subdivision, 'place of abode' includes ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (1) (F). Subparagraph (A) was in effect at the time the legislature added subparagraphs (E) and (F), but we note that the legislature declined to provide that the definition in \u00a7 31-275 (1) (F) applied \"[f]or purposes of subparagraphs (A) and (E) ....\" With respect to the regulation, the legislature directed the Workers' Compensation Commission to adopt regulations implementing the provisions of \u00a7 31-275 at the same time it amended the statute to add subparagraphs (E) and (F). See Public Acts 1995, No. 95-262, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3. The following year, the commission adopted the regulation defining an \" '[e]mployee's place of abode' ....\" Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 31-275-1 (2). Notably, only subparagraph (E) of the statute uses the regulation's term \"[\n    <em>\n     e\n    </em>\n    ]\n    <em>\n     mployee's\n    </em>\n    place of abode,\" whereas subparagraph (A) (i) refers to an \"\n    <em>\n     individual's\n    </em>\n    place of abode ....\" (Emphasis added.) Compare General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (1) (E) with General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (1) (A) (i). Although an employee is an individual, the use of the different terms appear to be intentional, as the commission could have simply defined \"place of abode\" to cover both subparagraphs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Subparagraph (E) addresses a matter that is not implicated in the present case, namely, the limited circumstances under which an employee's injury sustained during a preliminary act in preparation for work at his place of abode (i.e., grooming, clearing obstacles blocking the vehicle) is deemed to occur in the course of employment. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (1) (E) (\"[a] personal injury shall not be deemed to arise out of the employment if the injury is sustained: [i] At the employee's place of abode, and [ii] while the employee is engaged in a preliminary act or acts in preparation for work unless such act or acts are undertaken at the express direction or request of the employer\"). Nonetheless, even if the statutory and regulatory definitions were not intended to control \u00a7 31-275 (1) (A) (i), it would be reasonable to construe this provision consistent with those definitions.
