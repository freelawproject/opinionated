In the present appeal, we must determine how these changes in juvenile sentencing law impact individuals who were sentenced before the changes occurred. The defendant, Melvin Delgado, was sentenced to sixty-five years imprisonment without parole in 1996 for crimes that he committed when he was sixteen years old. Although he is now eligible for parole\n   following the passage of No. 15-84 of the 2015 Public Acts (P.A. 15-84),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   he filed a motion to correct his allegedly illegal sentence, claiming that he is entitled to\n   be resentenced because the judge who sentenced him failed to consider youth related mitigating factors. The trial court rejected the defendant's claim and dismissed his motion to correct, and the defendant has appealed to this court. We affirm the trial court's dismissal of the motion to correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the present appeal. The defendant was convicted of accessory to murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54a and 53a-8, and commission of a class A, B or C felony with a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-202k. On December 16, 1996, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Corrigan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , rendered judgment sentencing the defendant to a total effective sentence of sixty-five years imprisonment without parole. On appeal, this court affirmed the judgment with respect to the murder conviction but vacated the judgment with respect to the weapons charge.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Delgado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"247055\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/247/616/#p634\">\n    247 Conn. 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 634,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=725%20A.2d%20306\">\n    725 A.2d 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999). The facts underlying the defendant's conviction are set forth in that decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2014, the defendant filed a motion to correct his sentence pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 43-22,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   contending that a prison term that is equivalent to life\n   imprisonment without parole constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9, of the Connecticut constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant further argued that his sentence was illegal because he had not been given a meaningful opportunity for release from prison, and that the sentence had been imposed in an illegal manner because he was not afforded an individualized sentencing hearing at which the court could consider specific mitigating factors associated with his young age at the time of the crime of which he was convicted. The trial court,\n   <em>\n    Alexander\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , did not reach the merits of the motion to correct but dismissed the\n   motion for lack of jurisdiction, from which dismissal the defendant now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   PRINCIPLES OF JUVENILE SENTENCING LAW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before turning to the defendant's claims, we consider recent changes to juvenile sentencing law that guide our analysis.

The court also indicated that, for those who had received such a sentence without consideration of youth related mitigating factors, resentencing was not necessary because constitutional concerns would be satisfied by providing such individuals with an opportunity for parole.

Such an allegation is an essential predicate to the trial court's jurisdiction to correct the sentence. An allegation that the court failed to consider youth related factors before imposing a sentence of life\n   <em>\n    with parole\n   </em>\n   is not\n   sufficient to establish a jurisdictional basis for correcting a sentence.

In the present case, the legal landscape concerning juvenile sentencing laws has changed so significantly that the remaining claims, which would have required resentencing when the motion to correct was filed, no longer require resentencing. In view of the long-standing principle that challenges to the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time by either party or the court; e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Blumberg Associates Worldwide, Inc.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown &amp; Brown of Connecticut, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=311%20Conn.%20123\">\n    311 Conn. 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 149,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20A.3d%20840\">\n    84 A.3d 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) ; and the established rule that a sentencing court's jurisdiction to correct a sentence is limited to sentences that are invalid;\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304713\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/825/#p834\">\n    295 Conn. at 835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=992%20A.2d%201103\">\n    992 A.2d 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; we conclude that the trial court no longer possesses jurisdiction over the defendant's motion to correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We further emphasize that the defendant is not entitled to resentencing under P.A. 15-84, \u00a7 2, codified as amended at General Statutes (Supp. 2016) \u00a7 54-91g, which requires the trial court to consider youth related mitigating factors before sentencing a juvenile convicted of a class A or B felony. The defendant does not expressly claim that this provision applies to him retroactively, and, in any event, the text of P.A. 15-84, \u00a7 2, does not support any such assertion. There are ten sections in P.A. 15-84, four of which specify that they are \"[e]ffective October 1, 2015, and applicable to any person convicted prior to, on or after said date.\" (Emphasis omitted.) P.A. 15-84, \u00a7\u00a7 6 through 9. In contrast, P.A. 15-84, \u00a7 2, provides it is \"[e]ffective October 1, 2015,\" indicating that the legislature did not intend for this section to apply retroactively. Moreover, there is nothing in the text of General Statutes (Supp. 2016) \u00a7 54-91g or the legislative\n   history of P.A. 15-84 to suggest that the legislature intended that all juveniles convicted of a class A or B felony who were sentenced without consideration of the age related mitigating factors identified in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   would be resentenced. In sum, even if the defendant had alleged that his sentence was imposed in an illegal manner because the trial court failed to adhere to the requirements of P.A. 15-84, \u00a7 2, he would not be able to demonstrate that that provision applies to him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, we are not persuaded by several arguments advanced by the defendant. First, the defendant contends that\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   \"does not limit Connecticut to using parole eligibility as the sole remedy for\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   violations\" and refers to the legislature's decision to require both \"a\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   compliant sentencing hearing\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   an opportunity for parole\" to suggest that resentencing is required. (Emphasis in original.) Although we agree that the text of P.A. 15-84 reflects the legislature's intent to require both of these elements, as we have explained, the text indicates that the requirement of a\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   compliant sentencing hearing does not apply retroactively. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, we reject this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Second, the defendant argues that \"\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   does not ... supersede the final and controlling precedent in\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Casiano\n   </em>\n   , which provide a new sentencing hearing as the remedy for sentences that are illegal or were imposed in an illegal manner ....\" As we noted in this opinion, however, neither\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Casiano\n   </em>\n   requires the sentencing court to consider specific youth related mitigating factors before imposing a sentence of life\n   <em>\n    with an opportunity for parole\n   </em>\n   . Furthermore, the defendant's entitlement to parole consideration under P.A. 15-84 defeats any claim challenging the propriety of his original sentence insofar as that sentence precluded any possibility of an early release. In short, because the defendant cannot raise a viable claim that his sentence was illegal or was imposed in an illegal manner under\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Casiano\n   </em>\n   , neither case requires resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Third, the defendant posits that this court previously recognized that \"parole legislation would not appropriately address\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   claims\" when it decided\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Casiano\n   </em>\n   and acknowledged that\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   claims are separate and distinct. The fact that this court drew a distinction between those claims, however, simply does not support the proposition that this court previously determined that an opportunity for parole is insufficient to remedy a trial court's failure to account for the mitigating factors of youth.\n   Because the defendant's remaining claims in his motion to correct no longer fall within the purview of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , the motion fails to allege a claim that, if proven, would require resentencing. In the absence of a viable claim that the sentence is illegal or was imposed in an illegal manner, the sentencing court lacks jurisdiction to correct the sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The trial court's dismissal of the defendant's motion to correct an illegal sentence is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In this opinion the other justices concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Section 1 of No. 15-84 of the 2015 Public Acts, codified at General Statutes (Supp. 2016) \u00a7 54-125a, provides in relevant part: \"(f) (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) to (e), inclusive, of this section, a person convicted of one or more crimes committed while such person was under eighteen years of age, who is incarcerated on or after October 1, 2015, and who received a definite sentence or total effective sentence of more than ten years for such crime or crimes prior to, on or after October 1, 2015, may be allowed to go at large on parole in the discretion of the panel of the Board of Pardons and Paroles for the institution in which such person is confined, provided (A) if such person is serving a sentence of fifty years or less, such person shall be eligible for parole after serving sixty per cent of the sentence or twelve years, whichever is greater, or (B) if such person is serving a sentence of more than fifty years, such person shall be eligible for parole after serving thirty years.

The state now concedes, and we agree, that the trial court incorrectly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the defendant's motion to correct at that time. The motion, at that point, raised a viable claim by alleging that a sentence of life imprisonment without parole had been imposed without consideration of youth related mitigating factors. As we discuss subsequently in this opinion, however, the defendant is now eligible for parole and can no longer claim that he is serving a sentence of life imprisonment without parole. We therefore conclude that the trial court no longer possesses jurisdiction over the defendant's motion to correct.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    See\n    <em>\n     Fisher\n    </em>\n    v\n    <em>\n     .

The limited discussion on this topic occurred before the Judiciary Committee. Attorney Robert Farr, a member of the working group of the Connecticut Sentencing Commission, which helped craft the proposed legislative language, discussed how the legislation would affect previously sentenced individuals. See Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 2, 2015 Sess., pp. 949, 955-56. He first mentioned this court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Riley\n    </em>\n    , in which the defendant in that case had been sentenced to 100 years in prison and then resentenced, and noted that, under the proposed legislation, \"instead of having to worry about resentencing what would have happened is in [thirty] years, [twenty-one] years from now there will be a parole hearing and then that parole hearing would decide whether [the defendant in\n    <em>\n     Riley\n    </em>\n    ] was going to be-get another parole hearing .... So it gave some resolution to this which was consistent we believe with the federal-with the [United States] Supreme Court cases.\" Id., p. 956, remarks of Attorney Farr.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
