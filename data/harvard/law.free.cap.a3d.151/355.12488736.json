The defendant, who was sentenced to fifty years imprisonment without parole in 1992 for a crime that he committed when he was seventeen years old, contends that he is entitled to resentencing on the basis of recent changes to juvenile sentencing law.

The facts underlying the defendant's conviction are set forth in that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2013, the defendant filed a motion to correct his sentence pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 43-22,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   contending that a prison term that is equivalent to life imprisonment without parole constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9, of the Connecticut constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant\n   further argued that his sentence was illegal because he had not been given a meaningful opportunity for release from prison, and that the sentence had been imposed in an illegal manner because he was not afforded an individualized sentencing hearing at which the court considered specific mitigating factors associated with his young age at the time of the crime of which he was convicted.

The trial court,\n   <em>\n    Clifford, J.\n   </em>\n   , did not reach the merits of the motion to correct but dismissed the motion\n   for lack of jurisdiction, from which dismissal the defendant appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the present case, as in\n   <em>\n    Delgado\n   </em>\n   , we affirm the trial court's dismissal of the defendant's motion to correct for lack of jurisdiction. As we explained in\n   <em>\n    Delgado\n   </em>\n   , an allegation that a sentence is illegal or was imposed in an illegal manner is a necessary predicate to a trial court's jurisdiction to correct a sentence. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delgado\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488735\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/151/345/\">\n    323 Conn. at 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488735\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/151/345/\">\n    151 A.3d 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When the defendant in the present case filed his motion to correct, he was serving a sentence that was equivalent to life imprisonment and he was not eligible for parole. As a result, he could raise a colorable claim that his sentence was illegal or imposed in an illegal manner on the ground that the trial court had failed to consider youth related factors as required by\n   <em>\n    Miller.\n   </em>\n   Following the enactment of No. 15-84 of the 2015 Public Acts (P.A. 15-84),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   however, the defendant is now eligible for parole and can no longer claim that he is serving a sentence of life imprisonment, or its equivalent, without parole. In considering this issue in\n   <em>\n    Delgado\n   </em>\n   , we explained that \"[t]he eighth amendment, as interpreted by\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , does not prohibit a court from imposing a sentence of life imprisonment\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   the opportunity for parole for a juvenile homicide offender, nor does it require the court to consider\n   the mitigating factors of youth before imposing such a sentence. ... Rather, under\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , a sentencing court's obligation to consider youth related mitigating factors is limited to cases in which the court imposes a sentence of life, or its equivalent,\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   parole. ... As a result, the defendant's sentence no longer falls within the purview of\n   <em>\n    Miller, Riley\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Casiano\n   </em>\n   , which require consideration of youth related mitigating factors only if the sentencing court imposes a sentence of life without parole.\" (Citations omitted; emphasis in original.)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488735\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/151/345/\">\n    Id., at 810-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488735\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/151/345/\">\n    151 A.3d 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In sum, because\n   <em>\n    Miller, Riley\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Casiano\n   </em>\n   do not require a trial court to consider any particular mitigating factors\n   associated with a juvenile's young age before imposing a sentence that includes an opportunity for parole, the defendant can no longer allege, after the enactment of P.A. 15-84, that his sentence was imposed in an illegal manner on the ground that the trial court failed to take these factors into account. We therefore conclude that the defendant has not raised a colorable claim of invalidity that, if decided in his favor, would require resentencing. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488735\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/151/345/\">\n    id., at 812-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488735\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/151/345/\">\n    151 A.3d 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the absence of such an allegation, the trial court does not have jurisdiction over the motion to correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The trial court's dismissal of the defendant's motion to correct an illegal sentence is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In this opinion the other justices concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    Practice Book \u00a7 43-22 provides: \"The judicial authority may at any time correct an illegal sentence or other illegal disposition, or it may correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner or any other disposition made in an illegal manner.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    The eighth amendment to the United States constitution provides: \"Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    On appeal, the defendant has not raised or briefed any separate arguments or claims under the state constitution. Because, for purposes of this appeal, the defendant does not contend that the state constitution affords him any greater rights than he possesses under the federal constitution, we limit our analysis to his federal constitutional claim. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Barros\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Barros\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20Conn.%20499\">\n     309 Conn. 499\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 507 n.9,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20A.3d%20367\">\n     72 A.3d 367\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2013).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    The trial court,\n    <em>\n     Clifford\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     J.\n    </em>\n    , concluded that a motion to correct was not the appropriate mechanism for addressing an alleged\n    <em>\n     Miller\n    </em>\n    violation and dismissed the motion for lack of jurisdiction. The state now concedes, and we agree, that the trial court incorrectly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the motion to correct at that time. The motion, at that point, raised a viable claim insofar as it alleged that a sentence of life imprisonment without parole had been imposed without consideration of youth related mitigating factors. As we discuss subsequently in this opinion, however, the defendant is now eligible for parole and can no longer claim that he is serving a sentence of life imprisonment without parole. As a result, the defendant's claim no longer falls within the purview of\n    <em>\n     Miller\n    </em>\n    , and the trial court no longer has jurisdiction over the motion to correct.
