The plaintiffs, Zara Lackman and Dylan Hunt, appeal\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   from the trial court's award of summary judgment in favor of the defendants,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   who are beneficiaries of a trust settled by the decedent, Hugh I. Hunt. On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly determined that the phrase \"otherwise dispose of\" within \u00a7 47-20 does not include a specific devise in a will. The plaintiffs argue, therefore, that the decedent's failure to record a separate document limiting his\n   powers as trustee when he quitclaimed a certain parcel of real property to himself as trustee subsequently allowed the decedent to devise the property to the plaintiffs in his will. We disagree with the plaintiffs, and conclude that \u00a7 47-20 does not apply in this case because it protects only the interests of third parties who obtain property by means of a conveyance from a grantor who had received that property as trustee in the first instance. Because \u00a7 47-20 did not nullify the decedent's quitclaim deed to himself as trustee, the property was a trust asset, and the specific devise in the decedent's will adeemed. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. On December 8, 1994, the decedent became the sole owner of the property, which is located at 6 North Street in the town of Goshen. On October 21,\n   1999, the decedent settled an inter vivos trust. The trust was revocable, and the decedent amended it on three separate occasions. In the first amendment, made on March 7, 2003, the decedent removed his daughter, Robyn Hunt Vogel as trustee, leaving himself as sole trustee, and funded the trust with $10 \"together with any property added to the trust estate.\" This amendment also included a provision transferring the decedent's interest in the property at his death equally to his daughters, Alexandra A. Armitage and Samantha Hunt McAnulty. On June 30, 2004, the decedent amended the trust for a second time. Through that second amendment, the decedent eliminated, inter alia, the provision concerning the property in the previous amendment and replaced it with a more generalized provision distributing the remaining trust corpus equally to all of his daughters. The decedent also added a provision in the second amendment expressing his specific intent not to provide a distribution for his son, Hugh Hunt III. On February 24, 2006, the decedent made a third and final amendment to the trust, in which he, inter alia, equalized the trust distribution among all of his children, including his son.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Shortly after the second amendment, on July 8, 2004, the decedent executed a quitclaim deed of the property to himself as trustee, placing the property into the trust corpus. The quitclaim deed then was recorded on the Goshen land records. However, no document specifying or restricting his powers as trustee ever was recorded. As the trial court noted, \"[a]fter deeding the property to himself as trustee, the decedent never amended the trust to exclude the property, never conveyed the property out of the trust, and never revoked the trust.\" Subsequently, in 2011, the decedent executed a will through which he purported to devise the property to the plaintiffs and their father, Hugh I. Hunt III. In 2013, the decedent passed away. McAnulty, acting as the\n   executrix of the decedent's estate, did not distribute the property to the plaintiffs because counsel advised her that the property remained in the trust, outside of the probate estate, and therefore could not have been devised through the will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiffs then brought this action against the defendants seeking, inter alia, a declaratory judgment determining, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 47-31, the rights and ownership interests of the defendants in the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendants\n   also filed a counterclaim that sought judgment, pursuant to \u00a7 47-31, dismissing the plaintiffs' claims to the property and quieting title in favor of McAnulty and Katherine Hunt McNeil as successor trustees. Thereafter, the defendants moved for summary judgment, claiming that the property remained a trust asset at the time of the decedent's death and, as such, never became part of the decedent's probate estate. In response, the plaintiffs filed a cross motion for summary judgment claiming that, pursuant to \u00a7 47-20, the failure to record a separate, duly executed document setting forth the powers of the grantee rendered the quitclaim deed a nullity and, as such, allowed the decedent to dispose of the property through his will. On October 6, 2015, the trial court issued the operative memorandum of decision,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   dismissing, inter alia, the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, and\n   granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment as to count one of the complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the trial court applied General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z to its analysis of \u00a7 47-20. In a thorough textual analysis, the trial court determined that the legislature's use of the word \"such\" to modify the words \"real estate\" and \"interest\" in the second sentence, required it to read the two sentences of \u00a7 47-20 together. The trial court then determined that the dictionary definition of \"dispose of\" encompassed both a permanent assignment and a more temporary designation. Although those two conflicting meanings could lead to ambiguity, the trial court reasoned that, when read in the context of the remainder of \u00a7 47-20, the statute clearly and unambiguously indicates that the legislature intended the phrase \"dispose of\" only to include permanent transfers of real property. The court ultimately concluded that the phrase \"otherwise dispose of\" as used in \u00a7 47-20, plainly and unambiguously did not include devising property through a will. Accordingly, the trial court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment and quieted title to the property in their favor. The plaintiffs' appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly interpreted \u00a7 47-20. Specifically, the plaintiffs assert that the phrase \"dispose of\" within \u00a7 47-20 has a well recognized meaning under Connecticut law that includes devises in wills. Additionally, the plaintiffs contend that the phrase \"or otherwise\" is meant to be read as broadly inclusive, and so, taken together with the phrase, \"dispose of,\" \u00a7 47-20 plainly and unambiguously includes will devises. Thus, according to the plaintiffs' view of \u00a7 47-20, based in part on this court's\n   decision in\n   <em>\n    Benassi\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1558520\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/147/451/\">\n    147 Conn. 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=162%20A.2d%20521\">\n    162 A.2d 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1960), the property never became part of the trust corpus because the decedent failed to record a separate instrument limiting his powers as trustee, thereby rendering the term \"trustee\" in the quitclaim deed without legal effect, leaving the decedent free to dispose of the property as if he had\n   continued to hold it as an individual. Finally, the plaintiffs contend that the second sentence of \u00a7 47-20 does not limit the first sentence's applicability only to permanent transfers, in that the two sentences govern the rights of two different constituencies, namely, the rights of the grantee as trustee and the rights of a transferee receiving property from such grantee, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In response, the defendants initially contend that \u00a7 47-20 does not apply to the question presented, as it only applies when there is a transfer of real estate from a grantee, as trustee, to a third party. The defendants further argue that the phrase \"otherwise dispose of\" within \u00a7 47-20 does not include a will devise because the plaintiffs erroneously assume that the occasional colloquial use of the term \"disposition\" to describe leaving property in a will must also include will transfers. The defendants contend that a fee interest in the property never transferred to the plaintiffs because a will devise is not a transfer of interest in real property, but is rather a statement of a future intent to transfer and, as such, no interest transferred prior to the decedent's death. In contrast, however, the defendants observe that the transfer of property from a grantor to a trustee is a present transfer of interest because it conveys legal title to the trustee with the beneficial interest in the property going to the beneficiaries of the trust. We agree with the defendants, and conclude that the plain and unambiguous language of \u00a7 47-20 does not apply in the present case, which does not involve a subsequent\n   transfer of the property of the grantee \"as trustee\" to a third party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Whether \u00a7 47-20 applies to the facts of this case presents a question of statutory construction over which we exercise plenary review.\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    O &amp; G Industries, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485369\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/950/#p302\">\n    322 Conn. 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 302,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485369\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/950/#p302\">\n    140 A.3d 950\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). \"When construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature....

Significantly, \"our case law is clear that ambiguity exists only if the statutory language at issue is susceptible to more than one plausible interpretation.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Orr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5764224\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/291/642/#p654\">\n    291 Conn. 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 654,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=969%20A.2d%20750\">\n    969 A.2d 750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In accordance with \u00a7 1-2z, we begin our analysis with the text of the statute. Section 47-20 provides in relevant part: \"The word 'trustee' or 'agent', or the words 'as trustee', or words of similar meaning, following the name of the grantee in a duly executed and recorded instrument which conveys, transfers or assigns real estate or any interest therein ... do not, in the absence of a separate duly executed and recorded instrument defining the powers of the grantee, affect the right of the grantee to sell, mortgage or otherwise dispose of the real estate or interest therein in the same manner as if those words had not been used. No person to whom such real estate or interest therein has been transferred or mortgaged by such grantee is liable for the claim of any undisclosed beneficiary or principal or for the application of any money which may have been paid by such person therefor.\" When read in isolation, the first sentence, as viewed by the plaintiffs, appears to describe the precise factual scenario presently before us. Here, we have a grantor, the decedent, who quitclaimed the property to himself, as trustee, without recording a separate document defining his duties as trustee. Reading just the first sentence suggests that the plaintiffs' interpretation is correct, and that here, because the decedent failed to execute a separate document limiting his powers as trustee, that he was free to dispose of the property as if he owned it as an individual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We do not, however, read the first sentence of \u00a7 47-20 in isolation. \"[I]t is a basic tenet of statutory construction that [w]e construe a statute as a whole and read its subsections concurrently in order to reach a reasonable overall interpretation.\" (Emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dept. of Developmental Services\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087586\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/297/391/#p403\">\n    297 Conn. 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 403-404,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=999%20A.2d%20682\">\n    999 A.2d 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). Importantly, \"[l]egislative intent is not to be found in an isolated sentence; the whole statute must be considered.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Historic District Commission\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3951963\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/282/672/#p684\">\n    282 Conn. 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 684,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=923%20A.2d%20726\">\n    923 A.2d 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). The second sentence focuses on eliminating a third-party grantee's liability surrounding a transfer of \"such real estate or interest therein\" based on undisclosed beneficiaries. General Statutes \u00a7 47-20. As the statute does not define the word \"such,\" in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 1-1(a), we look to the common understanding expressed in dictionaries in order to afford the term its ordinary meaning. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Standard Oil of Connecticut, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Administrator, Unemployment Compensation Act\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=320%20Conn.%20611\">\n    320 Conn. 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 645,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=134%20A.3d%20581\">\n    134 A.3d 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). \"The word 'such' has been construed as an adjective referring back to and identifying something previously spoken of; the word naturally, by grammatical usage, refers to the last antecedent.... The accepted dictionary definitions of 'such' include 'having a quality already or just specified,' 'previously characterized or specified,' and 'aforementioned.' \" (Citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    LaProvidenza\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    State Employees' Retirement Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"706562\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/178/23/#p27\">\n    178 Conn. 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 27,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=420%20A.2d%20905\">\n    420 A.2d 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979), quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1971). Mindful of the dictionary definition of the term \"such,\" the defendants' contention that the second sentence of \u00a7 47-20, through the use of the phrases \"such real estate or\n   interest therein\" and \"such grantee,\" limits the scope of the first sentence.\n   The second sentence of \u00a7 47-20 focuses on eliminating liability surrounding a transfer of \"such real estate or interest therein\" based on the claims of potential beneficiaries to the property, undisclosed to the transferee. \"Such real estate or interest therein\" refers back to the property transferred from a grantor to another person \"as trustee,\" as set forth in the first sentence of \u00a7 47-20. Thus, when read as a whole, \u00a7 47-20 describes two separate conveyances of the same property: (1) from the original grantor to a grantee \"as trustee,\" and (2) from that trustee to a third-party grantee. Section 47-20 therefore provides protection to a third party grantee in the second conveyance in the event of subsequent claims to the property from undisclosed beneficiaries. Put simply, without a second conveyance of property to a third-party grantee, \u00a7 47-20 does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In contending that the decedent's failure to record a separate instrument restricting his powers as trustee nullified the transfer of the property to the trust, the plaintiffs, however, rely on this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Benassi\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1558520\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/147/451/\">\n    147 Conn. at 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=162%20A.2d%20521\">\n    162 A.2d 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , for the proposition that, pursuant to \u00a7 47-20, in the absence of such an instrument, the use of the word \"trustee\" in the decedent's quitclaim deed is a nullity. We disagree. As the trial court aptly noted in its memorandum of decision,\n   <em>\n    Benassi\n   </em>\n   is readily distinguishable from the situation before us and, particularly, buttresses our interpretation that \u00a7 47-20 applies only to protect the interest of third parties who have received their interest via a second conveyance of property from a grantor who received his interest as a trustee. In\n   <em>\n    Benassi\n   </em>\n   , two conveyances of property occurred. Id., at 453-54,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=162%20A.2d%20521\">\n    162 A.2d 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We have just one conveyance of the property-from the decedent to\n   himself as trustee for the benefit of his children. The decedent, \"as trustee,\" never purported to make another transfer of the property.

Reis, Jr., and the law firm, Sullivan, Reis, Sanchy &amp; Perlotto, LLC, that had advised McAnulty not to transfer interest in the property to the plaintiffs.

In response, the plaintiffs filed a motion to strike Cooper's affidavit. Cooper then submitted a revised affidavit, in response to which the plaintiffs filed a second motion to strike. The trial court granted the plaintiffs' second motion to strike Cooper's affidavit on the ground that it expressed an opinion on the ultimate legal issue, which was the court's prerogative, rather than that of the expert witness. The defendants have filed a cross appeal to challenge the trial court's decision with respect to the issue of the admissibility of Cooper's affidavit. We note that, because the defendants were not aggrieved by the judgment of the trial court, this claim is not the proper subject of a cross appeal.

The defendants were not parties to the developer's agreement with the plaintiff, and as such, could not be required specifically to perform the contract or pay damages for its breach.

When discussing the purpose of the bill in the Senate, Senator T. Clark Hull stated the following: \"Mr. President, this is a technical bill ... to clarify language in a long existing statute, to make it clear that when title is taken by a person as trustee, agent or other similar meanings, it does not require a person thereafter dealing with that title to check into the trust or agency power to that deed.\" 13 S. Proc., Pt. 1, 1969 Sess., p. 439.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    These remarks reveal that the legislature did not intend for \u00a7 47-20 to remove corpus from the trust based on a grantor's failure to record a separate document limiting his or her powers as trustee with respect to that corpus. Rather, based on these remarks, \u00a7 47-20 was enacted to protect third-party grantees in a second conveyance of property. Specifically, in the first conveyance of property, a grantor conveys land to a grantee, as trustee. In the second conveyance, that grantee transfers the property to a third party. Section 47-20 provides protection for third-party grantees in a second conveyance who receive title to property from a \" 'trustee, agent,' \" or from a person with a title of similar meaning.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20A.3d%20783\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    remarks of Senator Senator T. Clark Hull.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    At oral argument before this court, a question was raised about whether the decedent's second trust amendment, which eliminated the specific reference to the property and replaced it with a more generalized provision that included the entire remaining trust corpus, effectively removed the property from the trust. Although the trust was revocable, the record is devoid of any indication that the decedent amended the trust specifically to exclude the property, conveyed the property out of the trust, or revoked the trust. Thus, we agree with the trial court's conclusion that it was undisputed that, \"[a]fter deeding the property to himself as trustee, the decedent never amended the trust to exclude the property, never conveyed the property out of the trust, and never revoked the trust.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    It is of note that, in the decedent's second amendment to the trust, he eliminated the provision concerning the property and replaced it with a new, more generalized provision that stated that all of the remaining trust corpus would be distributed equally to his daughters. Less than two weeks after the second amendment, the decedent quitclaimed the property to himself, as trustee, placing it within the trust corpus. As such, the generalized language encompassed the property, as well as any other trust corpus remaining in the trust, upon the decedent's death.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
