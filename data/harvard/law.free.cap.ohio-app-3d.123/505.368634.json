We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-16\">John Doe\u2019s mother (\u201cMother\u201d) and appellant were married in 1988 and had one child who was born in January 1991. They separated in August 1991. The Summit County Domestic Relations Court issued a temporary order on November 25, 1991, which granted custody of John Doe to Mother. The order gave appellant standard visitation at his mother\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-17\">The final divorce decree- was issued in March 1993. The decree granted custody of John Doe to Mother and granted appellant restricted visitation. Appellant\u2019s mother, John' Doe\u2019s grandmother, was to be present during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>visitations. Appellant filed objections to visitation and other matters delineated in the magistrate\u2019s report. In July 1993, appellant\u2019s objections were overruled by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">In November 1994, appellant agreed to visitation supervised by Carol Miller of Family Visitation and Mediation Services. Appellant visited John Doe on December 13, 1994, and December 19, 1994, in Carol Miller\u2019s office. A third meeting was scheduled for December 29, 1994, but Mother and John Doe failed to attend this meeting. In January 1995, appellant moved to alter his visitation rights. Upon the court\u2019s request, appellant submitted a visitation plan. The court never responded to appellant\u2019s submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">During June 1995, Mother married appellee. On December 22, 1995, appellee filed a petition to adopt appellant\u2019s child. The magistrate of the probate division found that appellant had failed, without justification, to communicate with his child for at least one year and thereby concluded, that appellant\u2019s consent for adoption was not required. On January 17, 1997, the probate court, over appellant\u2019s objections, adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision as its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Appellant now appeals the probate court\u2019s judgment in favor of appellee and raises five assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Assignment of Error I</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred in finding that appellant failed to communicate with his son for at least one year preceding the filing of the petition for adoption.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">Assignment of Error II</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-11\">\u201cThe trial court erred in finding that appellant was without justifiable cause in his alleged failure to communicate with his son.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">Assignment of Error III</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-13\">\u201cThe probate court\u2019s determination that appellant\u2019s alleged failure to communicate with his children was without justifiable cause was against the manifest weight of evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-14\">Assignment of Error IV</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-15\">\u201cThe trial court erred in ruling that the consent of the appellant to the adoption is not required.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-16\">Assignment of Error V</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-17\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s finding that appellant was without justifiable cause in allegedly failing to communicate is erroneous as a matter of law where a natural parent\u2019s motion for visitation is pending before the domestic relations court during the year preceding and at the time of the filing of the petition for adoption.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>All five assignments of error will be addressed together because they all relate to the probate court\u2019s application of R.C. 3107.07(A). The statutory provisions that govern adoption ordinarily require the written consent of a minor child\u2019s natural parent prior to adoption. See R.C. 3107.06. However, R.C. 3107.07(A) provides that consent will not be required if \u201cthe parent has failed without justifiable cause to communicate with the minor or to provide for the maintenance and support of the minor as required by law or judicial decree for a period of at least one year immediately preceding either the filing of the adoption petition or the placement of the minor in the home of the petitioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">A petitioner wishing to adopt has to prove that the natural parent either failed to communicate or failed to provide maintenance and support. See <em>In re Adoption of McDermitt </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 301, 304, 17 O.O.3d 195, 196-197, 408 N.E.2d 680, 682-683. The probate court\u2019s judgment made pursuant to R.C. 3107.07(A) that the consent of a natural parent is not required for the adoption of a minor by another is a final order subject to appellate review. <em>In re Adoption of Johnson </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 1217, 651 N.E.2d 429. The question whether justifiable cause exists in a particular case is a factual determination. Therefore, we will not disturb the probate court\u2019s finding unless it is unsupported by clear and convincing evidence. <em>In re Adoption of Holcomb </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 361, 18 OBR 419, 481 N.E.2d 613, paragraph three of the syllabus. The Supreme Court of Ohio has held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">\u201cThe question of whether a natural parent\u2019s failure to support his or her child has been proven by the petitioner by clear and convincing evidence to have been without justifiable cause is a determination for the probate court, and will not be disturbed on appeal unless such determination is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>In re Adoption of Bovett </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 102, 515 N.E.2d 919, paragraph four of the syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">In determining where the burden of proof lies, the Supreme Court of Ohio has acknowledged that the termination of fundamental parental rights are at stake. <em>In re Adoption of Holcomb, </em>18 Ohio St.3d at 368, 18 OBR at 425, 481 N.E.2d at 620-621. The party petitioning for adoption bears the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the parent failed to communicate with the child for the statutory period and that no justifiable cause existed for the failure. <em>Id. </em>at 362, 18 OBR at 420, 481 N.E.2d at 616, paragraph four of the syllabus, modifying <em>In re Adoption of McDermitt, supra. </em>Although the nonconsenting parent is responsible for articulating a justifiable cause, no burden is to be placed upon the nonconsenting parent to establish that his or her failure was justifiable. <em>In re Adoption of Anthony </em>(1982), 5 Ohio App.3d 60, 62, 5 OBR 156, 158-159, 449 N.E.2d 511, 514-515.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>In appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, he contends that appellee failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that appellant failed to communicate with his child. The Ohio Supreme Court has construed \u201cfailing to communicate\u201d under R.C. 3107.07(A) as a complete absence of communication for the statutorily defined one-year period. <em>In re Adoption of Holcomb </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus. The \u201cfailing to communicate\u201d portion of the statute is an objective standard, and courts should not read into the phrase such qualifiers as \u201cmeaningfully,\u201d \u201csubstantially,\u201d \u201csignificantly,\u201d or \u201cregularly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366, 18 OBR at 423-424, 481 N.E.2d at 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Applying this objective standard, the probate court did not err by finding that appellant failed to communicate with his child for a one-year period for several reasons. First, the facts are uncontested that appellant and his child had not communicated during the one-year period. Second, although appellant\u2019s mother sent cards to her grandchild, appellant was not involved in the sending.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Appellant\u2019s second, third, and fifth assignments of error propose that the probate court erred by finding that appellant lacked a justifiable cause for failing to communicate with his son for the one-year period. He argues that Mother\u2019s actions coupled with his efforts of showing up to a visitation meeting and seeking court relief to enforce and augment his visitation rights established justifiable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">The Supreme Court of Ohio has held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-9\">\u201cSignificant interference by a custodial parent with communication between the non-custodial parent and the child, or significant discouragement of such communication, is required to establish justifiable cause for the non-custodial parent\u2019s failure to communicate with the child.\u201d <em>In re Adoption of Holcomb, </em>18 Ohio St.3d 361, 18 OBR 419, 481 N.E.2d 613, at paragraph three of the syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">Determining whether an interference is significant requires a court to look at the particular facts of the case at hand and also to consider the custodial parent\u2019s conduct and the noncustodial parent\u2019s efforts. For instance, the Supreme Court has found that a custodial parent who moved, maintained an unlisted phone number, and refused to provide even a scintilla of information to the noncustodial parent created a significant interference and thereby a justifiable cause for the noncustodial parent\u2019s failure to communicate. <em>Id. </em>at 369, 18 OBR at 426, 481 N.E.2d at 621. Sufficient interference was also established when a custodial parent acknowledged that she declined to permit visitation by the noncustodial parent, threatened to seek an increase in the noncustodial parent\u2019s child support payments if the noncustodial parent insisted upon seeing his children, and told the noncustodial parent she did not want him to see his children. <em>In re Adoption </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number><em>of Hupp </em>(1982), 9 Ohio App.3d 128, 132, 9 OBR 192, 196-197, 458 N.E.2d 878, 883-884. Likewise, this court determined that a custodial parent made a concerted effort to thwart the noncustodial parent\u2019s communication with his children when the custodial parent either threw away or refused and returned letters from the noncustodial parent to his children. <em>In re Adoption of Lauck </em>(1992), 82 Ohio App.3d 348, 352-353, 612 N.E.2d 459, 461-462.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Appellant showed up for the December 29, 1994 meeting, and Mother and John Doe failed to appear. Thereafter, appellant again sought relief in the courts to enforce and augment his visitation rights. Based on the conduct of Mother and the efforts of appellant, a significant interference was established. Therefore, appellee failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that appellant did not possess a justifiable cause for failing to communicate with his child for the entire one-year period. Consequently, the probate court erred by concluding that appellant had failed to communicate with his child without justifiable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The probate court\u2019s determination that no justifiable cause existed was against the manifest weight of evidence. Appellant\u2019s second, third, and fifth assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">In his fourth assignment of error, appellant argues that his consent is required. The above discussion of the previous assignments of error indicate that the probate court erred by finding that appellant\u2019s consent was not mandated in order for appellee to adopt the child. Under R.C. 3107.06, a petitioner must meet the requirements of R.C. 3107.07 in order to bypass the consent requirement. Because petitioner failed to show that R.C. 3107.07 applies in this case, appellant\u2019s consent is required. Thus, appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Appellant\u2019s second, third, fourth, and fifth assignments of error are sustained. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled. This court finds that the probate court\u2019s finding that appellant failed to communicate with his child for one year without justifiable cause was against the manifest weight of evidence. The judgment of the trial court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b540-10\">Dickinson, P.J., and Reece, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
