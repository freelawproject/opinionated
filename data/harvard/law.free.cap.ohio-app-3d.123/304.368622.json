Eastland Shopping Mall Assn. </em>(1983), 11 Ohio App.3d 158, 11 OBR 240, 463 N.E.2d 655; App.R. 11.1(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">In the appeal <em>sub judice, </em>defendant-appellant and father James W. Rundle appeals from the February 27,1997 denial of his motion for relief from judgment. For the reasons adduced below, we dismiss the notice of appeal as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">A review of the record on appeal indicates that appellant and his spouse, plaintiff-appellee and mother Roseanne M. Rundle,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were divorced in 1987, with custody of the two minor children being awarded to the mother, and the father being ordered to pay child support. Thereafter, the eldest daughter was emancipated in 1994, and, pursuant to the agreement of the parties, the court ordered an adjustment in father\u2019s child support arrearage. On October 31, 1995, Magistrate Nelson held a hearing to determine the emancipation of the younger daughter and possible support arrearage or overpayments. Following the hearing, the magistrate recommended in her report of December 11, 1995, that the remaining daughter be emancipated as of June 11, 1995, and also determined that the father was in arrears on spousal support in the amount of $24,199.79. The father filed his objections to the magistrate\u2019s report on December 20, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The trial court affirmed the magistrate\u2019s report on April 2, 1996. No direct appeal from this final order was filed by the father. Instead, the father, on September 26, 1996, filed a motion for relief from judgment pursuant to Civ.R. 60(B)(1), (4), and (5), generally alleging that the motion was timely and that the arrearage calculation by the court was erroneous. Without opinion, the trial court denied the motion for relief from judgment on February 27, 1997. The notice of appeal from that denial was filed on March 26, 1997. Prior to addressing the three assignments of error presented by the appellant,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> each of which argue the final order of April 2, 1996, we note: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>not be extended. <em>Ditmars v.
