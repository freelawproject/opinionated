Slone, appeals from the decision of the Common Pleas Court affirming the decision of the appellee, Board of Embalmers and Funeral Directors of Ohio (\u201cBoard\u201d), revoking plaintiffs state licenses as a funeral director and embalmer. Plaintiff claims the revocation was not supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence. We find no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-12\">The Board originally revoked appellant\u2019s Ohio licenses in November 1994 based on appellant\u2019s admitted embezzlement of substantial funds from his employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-13\">Pursuant to R.C. 119.12, appellant appealed that decision to the common pleas court, which affirmed the Board\u2019s order. On appeal to this court, the Board\u2019s order was reversed because the Board originally sent the revocation order to appellant via regular mail and to appellant\u2019s counsel via certified mail, when the certified mail delivery should have been sent to appellant rather than to his counsel. <em>Slone v. Ohio Bd. of Embalmers &amp; Funeral Directors </em>(1995), 107 Ohio App.3d 628, 669 N.E.2d 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Subsequently, the Board rescinded and re-issued its order revoking appellant\u2019s licenses, thereby complying with the procedural requirements of R.C. 119.09 and 119.12. Appellant appealed the Board\u2019s order again to the common pleas court, contending <em>inter alia </em>that the Board had failed to certify the complete record to the common pleas court. In fact, the record had been timely certified to the court by the Board and was misfiled in the clerk\u2019s office, a fact which appellant now concedes. The lower court affirmed the Board\u2019s order on November 5, 1996, finding that it was supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence. Appellant filed a timely appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The assignments of error will be addressed in the order asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">\u201cI. The court erred when it failed to reverse the decision of the board of embalmers and funeral directors of ohio when said board failed to respond to its statutory duty and provide a copy of the stenographic record to the affected party after request for same was made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Appellant contends that the Board\u2019s order should be reversed because the Board failed to provide appellant a copy of the transcript of the administrative hearing. R.C. 119.12 states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\">\u201cUpon demand by any interested party, the agency shall furnish at the cost of the party requesting it a copy of the stenographic report of testimony offered and evidence submitted at any hearing and a copy of the complete record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">The Board admits that a request for the transcript was made by appellant\u2019s counsel; however, when appellant\u2019s counsel was informed that it would be at appellant\u2019s cost, no offer to pay or tender of costs was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">We are unable to review this assignment of error, as the appellant did not file his notice of appeal from the orders of the trial court denying his motions for judgment based on the Board\u2019s failure to supply him a copy of the transcript. Plaintiff filed his notice of appeal only from the trial court\u2019s judgment filed on November 5, 1996, which affirmed the Board\u2019s decision as \u201csupported by reliable, substantial and probative evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">App.R. 3(D) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-12\">\u201cContent of the notice of appeal. The notice of appeal shall specify the party or parties taking the appeal; shall designate the judgment, order or part thereof appealed from; and shall name the court to which the appeal is taken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-13\">Plaintiffs notice of appeal does not designate or even refer to the earlier orders of the trial court, dated July 9 and August 14, 1996, which overruled appellant\u2019s motion for judgment because he did not receive a copy of the transcript specified by R.C. 119.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>This court has held that it is without jurisdiction to review a judgment or order that is not designated in the appellant\u2019s notice of appeal. <em>Parks v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio RR. </em>(1991), 77 Ohio App.3d 426, 428, 602 N.E.2d 674, 675-676; <em>Schloss v. McGinness </em>(1984), 16 Ohio App.3d 96, 98, 16 OBR 101, 103, 474 N.E.2d 666, 668; <em>Cavanaugh v. Sealey </em>(Jan. 23, 1997), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 69907, 69908, and 69909, unreported, at 5, 1997 WL 25521; <em>In re Estate of Carl Borgh </em>(Jan. 4, 1996), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 68033 and 68145, unreported, at 9, 1996 WL 4039; <em>Chotkevys v. Seman </em>(Sept. 21, 1995), Cuyahoga App. No. 67812, unreported, at 8, 1995 WL 558871; <em>McCarthy v. Stop-N-Shop Supermarkets, Inc. </em>(July 28, 1994), Cuyahoga App. No. 65839, unreported, at 5-7, 1994 WL 393696.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">In any event, appellant will not be heard to complain of the Board\u2019s failure to supply him with a copy of the transcript when he made no effort to ensure payment of the costs incurred as required by the statute. R.C. 119.12. Although we do not believe the appellant had to make an \u201coffers\u201d to pay, he should have informed the agency he still desired the copy when told he would have to pay for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Furthermore, we find no evidence that appellant has been prejudiced by lack of a copy of the transcript. Appellant had the opportunity to review the official record and transcript on file in the clerk\u2019s office and obtain copies of any relevant materials necessary to his appeal. He does not explain how he was prejudiced by not receiving his personal copy of the transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Assignment of Error I is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">\u201cII. The court erred in not reversing the decision of the board of embalmers and funeral directors of ohio to revoke appellant Slone\u2019s embalmers license when such revocation was not based upon reliable, probative and substantial evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Appellant contends that the Board\u2019s order revoking both his funeral director\u2019s and embalmer\u2019s licenses was not supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence because he embezzled funds from his employer in his capacity as a funeral director and not as an embalmer. We find no merit to this contention. We recently described the limitations on the scope of review on R.C. 119.12 appeals in <em>In re Senders </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 199, 203, 673 N.E.2d 959, 962 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-10\">\u201cThe standards of review in both the trial court and this Court on an R.C. 119.12 administrative appeal were recently set forth in <em>Diversified Benefit Plans Agency, Inc. v. Duryee </em>(1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 495, 499, 655 N.E.2d 1353, 1355-1356:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-12\">\u201c \u2018When reviewing an order of an administrative agency, a common pleas court acts in a \u201climited appellate capacity.\u201d <em>Univ. Hosp., Univ. of Cincinnati College </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number><em>of Medicine v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 339, 343, 587 N.E.2d 835, 838. In reviewing an order of an administrative agency pursuant to R.C. 119.12, the common pleas court is bound to affirm the agency\u2019s order \u201cif it is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence, and is in accordance with the law.\u201d <em>Pons v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 619, 621, 614 N.E.2d 748, 750. See, also, <em>Bottoms Up, Inc. v. Ohio Liquor Control Comm. </em>(1991), 72 Ohio App.3d 726, 728, 596 N.E.2d 475, 476. The common pleas court \u201c \u2018must give due deference to the administrative resolution of evidentiary conflicts\u2019 \u201d and therefore must not substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency. <em>Hawkins v. Marion Corr. Inst. </em>(1990), 62 Ohio App.3d 863, 870, 577 N.E.2d 720, 724, quoting <em>Univ. of Cincinnati v. Conrad </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 108, 111, 17 O.O.3d 65, 67, 407 N.E.2d 1265, 1267.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\">\u201c \u2018An appellate court\u2019s review of the trial court\u2019s decision is even more limited and requires the appellate court \u201cto determine only if the trial court has abused its discretion, <em>i.e., </em>being not merely an error of judgment, but perversity of will, passion, prejudice, partiality or moral delinquency.\u201d <em>Pons, </em>66 Ohio St.3d at 621, 614 N.E.2d at 750-751. Where the common pleas court applies a standard of review greater than that called for in R.C. 119.12, the trial court has abused its discretion. <em>Bottoms Up, Inc., </em>72 Ohio App.3d at 729-730, 596 N.E.2d at 476-477.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The Board revoked appellant\u2019s licenses pursuant to R.C. 4717.08(B) and (D). Those sections state that the Board \u201cmay revoke any license granted under this chapter for any of the following reasons\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">\u201c(B) If the applicant or holder has been convicted of a felony or crime involving moral turpitude;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-8\">\"* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-9\">\u201c(D) If the applicant or holder has been guilty of immoral or unprofessional conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">We find no merit to appellant\u2019s contention that the Board improperly revoked his embalmer\u2019s license because the embezzlement involved only his funeral director\u2019s license. Clearly, the embezzlement of $150,000 from one\u2019s employer involves a crime of moral turpitude as well as unprofessional conduct. The Board is clearly vested with broad discretion under these statutes, and we will not interfere with what we deem to be its sound exercise. See <em>Rose Hill Chapel-Ciriello Funeral Home v. Ohio Bd. of Embalmers &amp; Funeral Directors </em>(1995), 105 Ohio App.3d 213, 218, 663 N.E.2d 978, 981, where the court ruled that \u201can administrative agency\u2019s construction of a statute that the agency is empowered to enforce must be accorded due deference,\u201d citing <em>Leon v. Bd. of Psychology </em>(1992), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>63 Ohio St.3d 683, 687, 590 N.E.2d 1223, 1226, and <em>Chaney v. Clark Cty. Agr. Soc., Inc. </em>(1993), 90 Ohio App.3d 421, 426, 629 N.E.2d 513, 516-517.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Appellant\u2019s convoluted argument that he only stole \u201cinterest income\u201d does not warrant further discussion. We find that the Board\u2019s revocation of both licenses was amply justified by this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Assignment of Error II is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b580-8\">James D.
