In 1996, defendant, Lindsay Acura (\u201cAcura\u201d), a car dealership, ran a print advertisement in a local newspaper that contained language offering $200 off the purchase price of any vehicle. The relevant language of the coupon reads as follows: \u201cBring This Ad In And SAVE $200.00 OFF Selling Price!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">The plaintiff, Robert Conley, Jr., went to Acura armed with seventy-four copies of the ad, which he offered, unsuccessfully, as full payment for a vehicle. According to Conley, since the advertisement contained no limitations on the offer, he construed the language to mean that he was entitled to use all of his coupons for the entire purchase price of the car. Acura refused to accept more than one coupon, informing Conley that the ad was intended to be limited to one coupon per customer per purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-13\">On March 22, 1996, Conley filed a complaint in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, naming Acura as the lone defendant. Conley\u2019s complaint asserted two claims: first, he claimed that Acura breached a unilateral contract; second, he alleged a violation of Ohio\u2019s Consumer Sales Practices Act, which is set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-14\">In a decision journalized July 17, 1996, the trial court sustained Acura\u2019s motion for dismissal of the breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>There is no dispute that the ad in question contained no express limitation such as \u201cone coupon per customer per purchase.\u201d Ultimately, both parties filed motions for summary judgment. Pursuant to an entry journalized March 25, 1997, the trial court ultimately overruled Conley\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted Acura\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Conley (\u201cappellant\u201d) has timely appealed, assigning two errors for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">\u201cAssignment of Error I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred at pages 23 and 46 of the record when it granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment on counts one and then two of the Complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">\u201cAssignment of Error II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred at page 46 of the record when it denied appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Count II of the complaint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">As part of his first assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred' \u201cat pages 23 and 46 of the record.\u201d The record at page 23 is the trial court\u2019s decision granting Acura\u2019s Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion for dismissal of the breach of contract claim, finding that no unilateral contract existed. Although appellant improperly phrases his argument in terms of \u201csummary judgment\u201d as to the breach of contract claim, we nevertheless address the propriety of the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">In <em>Alligood v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co. </em>(1991), 72 Ohio App.3d 309, 311-312, 594 N. E.2d 668, 668-669, the Hamilton County Court of Appeals addressed a factually similar issue in the context of a claimed unilateral contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-13\">\u201cIt is basic contract law that to have an enforceable contract, <em>there must be a meeting of the minds </em>of the parties to the contract. <em>Noroski v. Fallet </em>(1982), 2 Ohio St.3d 77, 2 OBR 632, 442 N.E.2d 1302. <em>A valid contract must also be specific as to its essential terms, </em>such as the identity of the parties to be bound, the subject matter of the contract, consideration, a quantity term, and a price term. * * * If it can be determined that the parties intend to be bound, a court may fashion less essential terms that were omitted, in order to reach a fair and just result. <em>Litsinger Sign Co. v. American Sign Co. </em>(1967), 11 Ohio St.2d 1, 40 O.O.2d 30, 227 N.E.2d 609.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-15\">\u201cHowever, the Ohio Supreme Court has stated that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-16\">\u201c \u2018It is settled law that if the parties\u2019 manifestations taken together as making up the contract, <em>when reasonably interpreted in the light of all the circumstances, </em>do not enable the court to determine what the agreement is and to enforce it without, in effect, \u201cmaking a contract for the parties,\u201d no enforceable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>obligation results.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 14, 40 O.O.2d at 37, 227 N.E.2d at 619.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Applying the foregoing, we find that the trial court did not err in granting Acura\u2019s Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The language contained in Acura\u2019s ad failed to satisfy all the requirements necessary to create a valid contract. Accordingly, that portion of the first assignment of error pertaining to the Civ.R. 12(B)(6) dismissal is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Since the remaining substance of appellant\u2019s assignments of error are interrelated, we address them together. We preface our discussion and analysis of the contended errors with the standards by which we are bound in reviewing summary judgment issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Summary judgment is governed by Civ.R. 56(C), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">\u201cSummary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence in the pending case, and written stipulations of fact, if any, * * * show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. * * * A summary judgment shall not be rendered unless it appears from the evidence * * * that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, such party being entitled to have the evidence * * * construed most strongly in his favor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Thus, pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C), summary judgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine issue of material fact, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and, construing all evidence in favor of the nonmoving party, reasonable minds could reach only a conclusion in favor of the moving party. <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 74, 375 N.E.2d 46, 47. A summary judgment motion \u201cforces the nonmoving party to produce evidence on any issue for which that party bears the burden of production at trial.\u201d <em>Wing v. Anchor Media, Ltd. of Texas </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 108, 570 N.E.2d 1095, paragraph three of the syllabus,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> citing <em>Celotex v. Catrett </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 317, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265. Further, in opposing a motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must <em>affirmatively demonstrate facts </em>that would entitle that party to the relief sought. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number><em>Baughn v. Reynoldsburg </em>(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 561, 563, 605 N.E.2d 478, 479-480.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Based upon the foregoing standards, we find that the trial court did not err in determining that Lindsay Acura was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 109:4-3 addresses deceptive acts or practices in connection with consumer transactions. The purpose of the Consumer Sales Practices Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), codified at R.C. Chapter 1345, is set forth at Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-01 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">\u201c(A) Purposes, rules of construction</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">\u201c(1) * * * [Tjhese rules shall be <em>liberally construed </em>and applied to promote their purposes and policies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">\u201c(2) The purposes and policies of these rules are to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-9\">\u201c(a) Define with reasonable specificity acts and practices which violate [the Act] * * *;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-10\">\u201c(b) Protect consumers from suppliers who * * * commit <em>deceptive acts </em>or practices, <em>or commit unconscionable acts or practices;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-11\">\u201c(c) Encourage the development of <em>fair </em>consumer sales practices.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">Appellant relies upon Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-02(A)(1), which specifically addresses exclusions and limitations in advertisements. That section reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-13\">\u201c(A)(1) <em>It is a deceptive act </em>or practice in connection with a consumer transaction <em>for a supplier, </em>in the sale or offering for sale of goods or services, <em>to make any offer in written or printed advertising </em>or promotional literature <em>without stating clearly </em>and conspicuously in close proximity to the words stating the offer <em>any material exclusions, reservations, limitations, modifications, or conditions. </em>Disclosure shall be easily legible to anyone reading the advertising or promotional literature and shall be sufficiently specific so as <em>to leave no reasonable probability that the terms of the offer might be misunderstood.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-14\">With specific regard to the advertisement and sale of motor vehicles, Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-16 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-15\">\u201c(B) It shall be a deceptive and unfair act or practice for a dealer * * * in connection with the advertisement or sale of a motor vehicle, to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-16\">\"* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>\u201c(3) Use any statement * * * in any advertisement * * * which could create in the mind of a <em>reasonable </em>consumer a false impression as to any material aspect of said advertised or offered vehicle * * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Appellant essentially urges this court to adopt a strict liability standard when \u201cviolations\u201d such as the one that allegedly occurred here (the omission of express limitations). Given the above language of the Ohio Administrative Code, we decline to hold that reasonableness plays no part whatsoever in the determination as to whether an act amounts to deceptive, unconscionable, or unfair conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Furthermore, we interpret the language in the advertisement to be self-limiting by its terms. Again, we quote the subject language: \u201cBring This Ad In And SAVE $200.00 <em>OFF Selling Price!\u201d </em>Since there is only one agreed upon \u201cselling price\u201d for a particular vehicle, appellant\u2019s interpretation of the ad to require successive reductions off the selling price is not a reasonable interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Construing all the evidence in favor of appellant, reasonable minds could reach only a conclusion in favor of Acura, and, thus, we hold that the trial court did not err. Accordingly, the assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Having overruled the assignments of error, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b605-10\">Bowman and Deshler, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-9\">. In <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 295, 662 N.E.2d 264, 274-275, a narrow majority of the Supreme Court of Ohio found paragraph three of the <em>Wing </em>syllabus to be \u201ctoo broad\u201d and expressly \u201climited\u201d that paragraph. The limitation relates to the burden placed upon a <em>moving </em>party and is not directly at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
