Appellee subsequently gave birth to the parties\u2019 only child, Ashley Davis, on December 21, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-19\">In December 1995, appellant filed a complaint for divorce in the Warren County Court of Common Pleas. A final hearing was held on July 30 and October 11,1996, at which the trial court heard testimony relevant to the issue of child custody. The trial court then issued a detailed written decision and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>divorce decree in which it awarded custody of Ashley to appellee. Appellant now appeals, setting forth the following assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting custody of the parties\u2019 minor child to appellee on the basis that appellee\u2019s parents, with whom appellee lives, would provide a good home for the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">A trial court has broad discretion to determine what custody arrangement is in a child\u2019s best interest under R.C. 3109.04. <em>Thrasher v. Thrasher </em>(1981), 3 Ohio App.3d 210, 214, 3 OBR 240, 243-244, 444 N.E.2d 431, 434-435. An appellate court must not disturb a trial court\u2019s custody determination unless there has been an abuse of discretion. <em>Masters v. Masters </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 83, 85, 630 N.E.2d 665, 666-667.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Appellant argues that the trial court should not have considered the fact that appellee is currently living with her parents in California and that appellee\u2019s parents have been assisting her in caring for Ashley when conducting its best-interest analysis under R.C. 3109.04(F)(1). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">R.C. 3109.04(F)(1)(c) requires a trial court to consider \u201c[t]he child\u2019s interaction and interrelationship with his parents, siblings, and any other person who may significantly affect the child\u2019s best interest\u201d when making an award of custody in a divorce action. The fact that appellee is currently living with her parents and that appellee\u2019s parents have demonstrated a strong commitment toward Ashley by helping appellee care for her is certainly relevant to whether an award of custody to appellee is in Ashley\u2019s best interest under R.C. 3109.04(F)(1)(c). See <em>Burden v. Burden </em>(Dec. 13, 1996), Greene App. No. 96-CA-56, unreported, 1996 WL 715436; <em>Dixon v. Dixon </em>(Nov. 4, 1994), Clark App. No. 94-CA-25, unreported, 1994 WL 603221. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by considering the role appellee\u2019s parents play in Ashley\u2019s life as one factor in its best-interest analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">Appellant also argues that the trial court abused its discretion by considering Ashley\u2019s relationship and interaction with her maternal grandparents without first determining that he was an \u201cunsuitable\u201d parent. Appellant relies on the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>In re Perales </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St.2d 89, 6 O.O.3d 293, 369 N.E.2d 1047.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">In <em>Perales, </em>the Supreme Court held that a juvenile court may not award legal custody to a nonparent unless it first determines that both of the child\u2019s parents are \u201cunsuitable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at syllabus. However, there is nothing in the language of <em>Perales </em>which indicates that a trial court must make a finding that one of the child\u2019s parents is \u201cunsuitable\u201d before it may consider a child\u2019s relationship with his or her grandparents as one factor in its best-interest analysis under R.C. 3109.04(F)(1)(c) when rendering an award of custody incident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>to a divorce proceeding. Therefore, we find that the rule enunciated in <em>Perales </em>has no application to this case. Appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is overruled and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b52-6\">William W.
