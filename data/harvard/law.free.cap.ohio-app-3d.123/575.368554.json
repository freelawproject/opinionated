This cause originated on October 7, 1992, when appellee filed a complaint against appellant, \u201calleging nine counts arising from his discharge from [appellant\u2019s] employ.\u201d <em>Patrick v. Painesville Commercial Properties, Inc. </em>(1994), 99 Ohio App.3d 360, 362, 650 N.E.2d 927, 929 <em>(\u201cPatrick I</em>\u201d). Appellant moved for summary judgment, which was granted by the trial court on December 8, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">Appellee appealed to this court. <em>Patrick I. </em>We vacated the judgment and remanded the cause to the trial court on the counts relating to promissory estoppel and implied contract. <em>Id. </em>at 367, 650 N.E.2d at 932. In <em>Patrick I, </em>we stated that implied contract and promissory estoppel are the exceptions to the doctrine of employment at will, articulated the requirements for promissory estoppel, noted the additional compelling factors that must, be proved on such a claim, and held that there were genuine issues for trial as to the doctrine of promissory estoppel and whether an implied contract existed between the parties. <em>Id. </em>at 363-366, 650 N.E.2d at 929-932.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">Upon remand, a jury trial was conducted. Appellee testified that he answered appellant\u2019s classified advertisement for a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning maintenance (\u201cHVAC\u201d) position. At the first interview, he informed appellant\u2019s representative, Lori Keener, the property manager, that he was happy with his current, secure employment, but was interested in locating a position closer to his home. Appellant stated that Keener offered him $10 per hour plus medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>coverage, and he advised her that he needed to think about it. At' a subsequent meeting, he advised Keener that upon consideration, he did not want to 'give up his secure, well-paying employment. Appellant stated that Keener\u2019s response was to increase the hourly pay rate to $11 per hour, and that she also asked him how long he planned to work at his current position. Appellant responded that he planned to work to age sixty-five. Keener then asked appellee how long would he plan on working for appellant. Appellee answered he would work until age seventy-two, and Keener allegedly responded, \u201cFine, [t]hat\u2019s what I want.\u201d Appellee then quit his job at Dairymens and began working for appellant at Victoria Place on or about May 18, 1992. Eight weeks later, appellant terminated appellee on July 21, 1992. Upon being informed by Keener of his termination, appellee responded \u201cWell, that\u2019s just great. I left a good job to come here. I\u2019m a 61 year [old] man, what in the hell am I going to do now?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">The jury returned a verdict in appellee\u2019s favor on the claim of promissory estoppel and in appellant\u2019s favor on the claim of implied-in-fact contract, deciding that appellee was not an employee at will and that appellant did not.have just cause to terminate appellee. Appellant timely appealed, and submits the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">\u201c[1.] The trial court erred in overruling [appellant\u2019s] motion for directed verdict at both the close of the [appellee\u2019s] case and at the conclusion of the evidence, as well as the [appellant\u2019s] motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">\u201c[2.] The trial court erred in overruling [appellant\u2019s] objections to the testimony of an economist regarding [appellee\u2019s] lost wages as well as his report of the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">\u201c[3.] The trial court erred by allowing the jury to consider the issue of damages despite [appellee\u2019s] failure to produce and keep necessary records making it impossible to assess those damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-8\">\u201c[4.] The trial court failed to submit proper instructions to the jury regarding the doctrine of promissory estoppel as well as the calculation of damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">Appellant presents two arguments under the first assignment: appellee failed to present sufficient evidence to establish a claim of promissory estoppel, and appellee failed to present evidence to establish the element of detrimental reliance. Upon review, we conclude that neither argument is well founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">In <em>Sutherland v. Nationwide Gen. Ins. Co. </em>(1994), 96 Ohio App.3d 793, 800, 645 N.E.2d 1338, 1343, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-11\">\u201cIn ruling upon a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the test to be applied by the trial court is the same test to be applied concerning a motion for directed verdict. <em>Posin v.

Under this test, the evidence adduced at trial and the facts set forth by admissions in the pleadings and record \u2018must be construed most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is made, and, where there is substantial evidence to support his side of the case, upon which reasonable minds may reach different conclusions, the motion must be denied.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>Further, \u2018[njeither the weight of the evidence nor the credibility of the witnesses is for the court\u2019s determination in ruling upon either of the above motions.\u2019 <em>Id.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">The Supreme Court of Ohio has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">\u201cIt is the duty of a trial court to submit an essential issue to the jury when there <em>is </em>sufficient evidence relating to that issue to permit reasonable minds to reach different conclusions on that issue * * *.\" (Emphasis <em>sic.)

Webb </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St.2d 215, 58 O.O.2d 424, 280 N.E.2d 896, paragraph four of the syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The law-of-the case doctrine provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">\u201cThere can be no question that where a judgment becomes final in the course of litigation, it becomes <em>res judicata </em>or the law of the case as to all questions therein decided. Where a second action or a retrial of an action is predicated on the same cause of action and is between the same parties as the first action or first trial of an action, a final judgment of an appellate court in the former action or the first trial of an action is conclusive in the second action or second trial of an action as to every issue which was or might have been presented and determined in the former instance.\u201d <em>Burton, Inc. v. Durkee </em>(1954), 162 Ohio St. 433, 438, 55 O.O. 247, 250, 123 N.E.2d 432, 435.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">\u201c[T]he decision of a reviewing court in a case remains the law of that ease on the legal questions involved for all subsequent proceedings in the case at both the trial and [appellate] levels.\u201d <em>Nolan v. Nolan </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 1, 3, 11 OBR 1, 2-3, 462 N.E.2d 410, 412. \u201c[T]he decision of an appellate court in a prior appeal will ordinarily be followed in a later appeal in the same case and court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4, 11 OBR at 4, 462 N.E.2d at 413. This doctrine is designed \u201cto avoid endless litigation by settling the issues\u201d and \u201cto compel trial courts to follow the mandates of reviewing courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3, 11 OBR at 3, 462 N.E.2d at 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">The law of the case governing the instant appeal, regarding promissory estoppel, was stated by this court in <em>Patrick I </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-10\"><em>\u201cMers [v. Dispatch Printing Co. </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 100, 19 OBR 261, 483 N.E.2d 150] held that a demonstration of detrimental reliance on specific promises of job security can create another exception to the doctrine of employment at will. <em>Id. </em>at paragraph three of the syllabus; <em>Helmick v. Cincinnati Word Processing, Inc. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 131, 136, 543 N.E.2d 1212, 1217. \u2018The test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>in such cases is whether the employer should have reasonably expected its representation to be relied upon by its employee and, if so, whether the expected action or forbearance actually resulted and was detrimental to the employee.\u2019 <em>Mers </em>at paragraph three of the syllabus. Most important, \u2018the employer\u2019s representation is to be determined by what the \u201cpromisor should reasonably expect\u201d the <em>employee </em>to believe the promise means if expected action or forbearance results.\u2019 (Emphasis <em>sic.) Mers, </em>19 Ohio St.3d at 105, 19 OBR at 265, 483 N.E.2d at 154.\u201d <em>Patrick I, </em>99 Ohio App.3d at 364-365, 650 N.E.2d at 930-931.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Recognizing that additional factors must also exist for a valid claim of promissory estoppel claim, we stated in <em>Patrick I:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">\u201cThis court has also acknowledged that without \u2018additional compelling factors constituting promissory estoppel,\u2019 the fact of an employee\u2019s giving up his or secure employment in reliance upon representations of the new employer would eliminate the doctrine of employment at will in an instance where an employee left a secure job to take a new job. <em>Romoser v. Amweld Bldg. Products, Inc. </em>(Feb. 15, 1991), Trumbull App. No. 89-T-4307, unreported, at 8 [1991 WL 18656].\u201d <em>Id., </em>99 Ohio App.3d at 366, 650 N.E.2d at 931.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">We concluded in <em>Patrick I </em>that the summary judgment evidentiary materials contained \u201c \u2018additional compelling factors constituting promissory estoppel\u2019 which together [amounted] to specific promises of job security upon which [appellee] could have reasonably relied.\u201d <em>Patrick I, </em>99 Ohio App.3d at 366, 650 N.E.2d at 931. Those factors included appellee\u2019s age, sixty-two; his desire to find employment closer to his home; appellee\u2019s fear of giving up the job security and salary he had with Dairymens; appellant\u2019s awareness of those factors when they interviewed appellee and when appellee rejected appellant\u2019s initial offer; appellant\u2019s awareness, as indicated in its affidavit and its response to appellee\u2019s interrogatories, that appellee would probably retire at age sixty-five if he continued working for Dairymens, whereas if he were to work for appellant, assuming an acceptable salary level, he would work until age seventy-two.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">We observed that the critical issue was when the statements concerning appellant\u2019s working until age seventy-two were made, and which party made them. Then, having considered the facts adduced in the summary judgment evidential materials, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-9\">\u201cTherefore, construing the evidence most favorably toward [appellee], when [appellant] responded \u2018that\u2019s what we want\u2019 or \u2018fine\u2019<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>after </em>[appellee] stated he would work until age seventy-two, [appellant] made a representation which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>should have reasonably expected [appellee] to believe meant he had a long-term, secure job, and that such representation would induce action by [appellee], to wit, that he would quit his job at Dairymens.\u201d (Emphasis and footnote added.) <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">Thus, we decided that if the discussion about working until age seventy-two occurred after appellee had rejected the initial offer because of a concern about job security, the trial court could not grant summary judgment, and a factual issue existed which required jury consideration. <em>Id. </em>Appellant was bound by that preliminary determination upon remand to the trial court. Thus, the trial court properly overruled appellant\u2019s motion for directed verdict and correctly submitted the case to the jury in light of this court\u2019s prior determination regarding the adequacy of the summary judgment evidentiary material with regard to those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">A claim of promissory estoppel involves four elements: (1) there must be a clear and unambiguous promise, (2) the party to whom the promise was made must rely on it, (3) the reliance is reasonable and foreseeable, and (4) the party relying on the promise must have been injured by the reliance. <em>Doe v. Adkins </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 427, 437, 674 N.E.2d 731, 737-738. There must be a specific promise of continued employment from the employer to the employee. <em>Wing v. Anchor Media, Ltd. of Texas </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 108, 570 N.E.2d 1095, paragraph two of the syllabus, modified on other grounds in <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 662 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Appellee testified that when he subsequently returned to Keener\u2019s office to advise that he was rejecting appellant\u2019s offer, the following discussion occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-7\">\u201c[APPELLEE] I told her, Mrs. Keener, thank you, Lori, but I don\u2019t want to give up money, I don\u2019t want to give up that security I have, I just bought my mobile home, didn\u2019t want to take a chance of losing it, I knew I was pretty secure where I was at.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-8\">\u201c[MR. PEROTTI] And did Mrs. Keener have a response to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-9\">\u201c[APPELLEE] Yes, she upped my offer to $11.[00] an hour, which was just a few cents under what I was making.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-10\">\u201c[MR. PEROTTI] How did you feel about that as far as any\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-11\">\u201c[APPELLEE] I felt good about that, I figured the money was there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-12\">\u201c[MR. PEROTTI] Did she say anything else to you as far as the security issue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-13\">\u201c[APPELLEE] She asked me if I stayed with Dairymens how long did I plan on working for Dairymens, and I told her to age 65.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-14\">\u201c[MR. PEROTTI] Did she say anything else to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>\u201c[APPELLEE] She asked me at that point if I came to work for Victoria Place how long would you plan on working with us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-4\">\u201c[MR. PEROTTI] And what did you respond to her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\">\u201c[APPELLEE] I told her I would stay until I was 72.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\">\u201c[MR. PEROTTI] What did she say in response to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">\u201c[APPELLEE] She said, \u2018Fine, that\u2019s what I want.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-8\">\u2022 \u201c[MR. PEROTTI] And what did you do in response to that conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-9\">\u201c[APPELLEE] I accepted Lori\u2019s job offer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-10\">\u201c[MR. PEROTTI] And did you ask her for anything in writing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-11\">\"* <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-12\">\u201c[APPELLEE] No, we shook hands and I considered that a deal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-13\">\u201c[MR. PEROTTI] And in response to that, what did you do next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-14\">\u201c[APPELLEE] I \u2014 like I said, I accepted the job * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-15\">On cross-examination, appellee\u2019s attorney asked Keener to read a portion of the transcript from a tape that appellee had secretly made without her knowledge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-16\">\u201c[MR. PEROTTI] If you would please take a look here and read to the jury the discussion between you and Mr. Patrick. That it starts out, \u2018Yeah, and then, uh, we did talk at the time when I come in that, you know, you asked me how long I\u2019d work and I did say until 72.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-17\">\u201cWould you read to the jury what the response to that was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-18\">\u201c[KEENER] Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-19\">During further cross-examination, Keener conceded that appellee had offered his services as an independent contractor on evenings and weekends so that he would not have to leave his full-time position with Dairymens, but that she had advised appellee that he would have to resign from his current employment in order to take her offer. Keener admitted that appellant was seeking a recognized contractor who would be able to supply appellant with replacement parts for their heating and air conditioning units, since they had no other source. She further acknowledged that appellant was \u201clooking for ways to provide better service to [their] tenants in a cost effective manner.\u201d Keener also admitted that the contract with the former outside maintenance company had expired, and averred that appellant did not have any other company under contract at the time that appellee was hired. She acknowledged that she had signed a service invoice from Advance Maintenance dated April 16 or 17, 1992, for work done on appellant\u2019s Victoria Place property. Keener conceded that appellee was termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>nated because appellant did not need him anymore. According to Keener, appellant had assumed that having someone on staff who could take care of the HVAC and electrical systems would be less expensive than having an outside company perform such duties, but appellant still had to call in an outside company because ultimately there were no cost savings. Additionally, Keener avowed that she had not informed appellee that appellant had entered into contracts for $26,000 and $51,000, each, for installation of heating and air conditioning units for which appellee would not be performing the maintenance. Keener further acknowledged that at the time of the interview, appellant was negotiating with Advance Maintenance for a full-time, permanent maintenance contract on all of appellant\u2019s units.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">On direct examination, Kenner indicated that appellee had been terminated for his performance, citing equipment problems that he had encountered difficulty in repairing; however, on cross-examination she admitted that in response to a question posed by appellee\u2019s attorney during an earlier deposition, \u201c \u2018the reason he was terminated did not relate at all to his performance, did it\u2019?\u201d she had answered \u201c \u2018I have no idea.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">We conclude that there was sufficient evidence presented at trial to support each element of appellee\u2019s promissory estoppel claim. The timing of Keener\u2019s statement is significant in several respects. The fact that Keener told appellee, \u201cFine, that\u2019s what I want\u201d during the subsequent interview <em>after </em>appellee turned down Keener\u2019s initial offer, while expressing his reluctance to disturb his current employment situation, indicates that appellant\u2019s agent\u2019s representation was made with the intent to induce appellee to act on it. We think it is important that during the latter interview, appellant initiated and concluded the age discussion, beginning with a query probing appellee\u2019s expected or desired retirement age, and ending with appellant\u2019s responding affirmatively to appellee\u2019s answer. The fact that Keener immediately followed appellee\u2019s statement about working until age seventy-two with the words \u201cFine, that\u2019s what I want\u201d was sufficient to allow appellee to believe that appellant was expressly avowing that appellee would work through age seventy-two. In our view, this sequence of events was adequate to indicate appellant\u2019s assent to a specific term of employment. Appellant\u2019s original, question, viewed in conjunction with its final response, was promissory in nature. Moreover, Keener\u2019s phrase \u201cFine, that\u2019s what I want\u201d was sufficiently clear and definite to reflect appellant\u2019s assent to a specific duration of employment for appellee. In our opinion, the entire exchange went beyond a simple discussion of future opportunity, and instead rose to the crest of what could be considered as a specific promise of continued employment. See <em>Wing, </em>59 Ohio St.3d 108, 570 N.E.2d 1095, at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>There is also evidence demonstrating that appellee relied to his detriment on appellant\u2019s statements. First, he relinquished a secure, satisfactory employment relationship, which apparently would have continued through age sixty-five, to take another job, and then was deprived of that position. Second, appellee departed his former employer with the expectation of earning seven years\u2019 worth of additional income at his newly secured position. Third, appellee\u2019s prospects for reemployment subsequent to his termination were significantly hampered by his age, as corroborated by his testimony that he was not able to secure other employment even after submitting numerous resumes and registering with the employment bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"ADW7\">The existence or nonexistence of promissory estoppel essentially turns on the credibility of the witnesses. <em>Cervelli v. Health Ent. of Am., Inc. </em>(Feb. 8, 1991), Trumbull App. No. 89-T-4329, unreported, at 4, 1991 WL 16545. The weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are primarily for the trier of fact. <em>Bechtol v. Bechtol </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 21, 23, 550 N.E.2d 178, 180. The jury in this case decided that appellee\u2019s version of the events was more credible than appellant\u2019s agent\u2019s recitation, as it was entitled to do. We see no reason to disturb that determination. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Appellant submits two arguments under the second assignment, first, that the trial court erred by allowing the expert witness, Dr. John Burke, to testify before any other evidence concerning the damages was introduced, <em>i.e., </em>before Robert Patrick testified, and, second, that appellee\u2019s expert violated the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Worrell v. Multipress, Inc. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 241, 543 N.E.2d 1277, and, as a result, presented to the jury figures that were not supported by the evidence. Neither of these assertions is well grounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Evid.R. 703 and Evid.R. 705 both require that a proper factual foundation be laid before an expert opinion is rendered. <em>State v. Hinkle </em>(Aug. 23, 1996), Portage App. No. 95-P-0069, unreported, at 6, 1996 WL 494873. However, \u201c[w]hile the testimony as to the facts underlying the expert\u2019s testimony should have been presented first, the courts of this state have held that the failure to present the evidence in the proper order will be considered harmless if evidence as to the underlying facts is eventually submitted. See, <em>e.g., Wells v. Miami Valley Hosp. </em>(1993), 90 Ohio App.3d 840, 857, 631 N.E.2d 642 [652-653].\u201d <em>State v. Williams </em>(Mar. 24, 1995), Trumbull App. No. 89-T-4210, unreported, at 38, 1995 WL 237092, affirmed in part and reversed in part on other grounds, <em>State v. Williams </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 569, 660 N.E.2d 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Dr. Burke, who testified concerning appellee\u2019s total expectancy damages, stated that appellant\u2019s attorney provided him with a figure that estimated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>appellee\u2019s subsequent income at approximately $5,000, which did not include a breakdown of the particular sources. He further testified that his calculations had not taken into consideration appellee\u2019s self-employment or reemployment income, but admitted that it would have been proper to have subtracted those amounts from his figures. Burke avowed that to obtain an accurate result, it would be necessary to calculate the present value of $5,000. He also related that if the actual $5,000 figure rather than the present value of that amount were subtracted, then there would be an overestimated subtraction that would be less, and that would work to appellee\u2019s detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Appellee then testified concerning his income in mitigation that constituted the appropriate deductions from the damage award. During cross-examination, he stated that he h'ad deposited into his bank account all of the money he had earned from Bob\u2019s Refrigeration, his pension checks from Ohio Rubber, the' income earned from occasional side jobs, and unemployment compensation. Appellee related that he had worked for Anderson Door for approximately three months and earned $849 in that period, but had had to leave the company because his truck caught on fire and it was a risk to drive the truck. Appellee also stated that he earned $20 to $30 on occasional odd jobs, and that the total income from these noncontractual jobs approximated $4,500 from July 21, 1992 through July 21,1993, $5,000 from 1993 through 1994, and $3,500 from 1994 through 1995. He presented his federal income tax return for 1992, and several W-2 forms. Later, the parties stipulated to the amounts of unemployment compensation received by appellee, $4,000 in 1992 and $3,587 from January through April 1993. Appellee further testified that his monthly Social Security benefit of $772 commenced in April 1993. On redirect examination, appellee related that $14,000 of the money deposited from August 1992 to December 1993 was from Bob\u2019s Refrigeration.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Consequently, although appellee\u2019s testimony concerning his reemployment efforts and his other income was not received until after Dr. Burke had already testified, the order of presentation does not constitute reversible error in the instant appeal, under the authority of <em>Wells.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Turning to appellant\u2019s second argument under this assignment, the Eighth District Court of Appeals has held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">\u201cA damage award in a promissory estoppel claim can be based upon reliance or expectancy damages. 1A Corbin, Corbin on Contracts (1963) 221, Section 200; <em>Mers v. Dispatch Printing Co. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio App.3d [99] at 105 [529 N.E.2d 958, at 965-966].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-8\">\u201cThe remedy is dependent on what justice requires. <em>Id. </em>The jury\u2019s finding of fact will not be upset as long as there is competent, credible evidence to support it. <em>C.E. Morris </em>[Co.] <em>v. Foley [Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>261, 376 N.E.2d 578].\u201d <em>Wallace v. Gray Drug, Inc. </em>(Aug. 23, 1990), Cuyahoga App. No. 57031, unreported, at 6, 1990 WL 121500. See, also, <em>Newkirk v. Precision Automotive, Inc. </em>(Mar. 3, 1992), Montgomery App. No. 12498, unreported, at 5, 1992 WL 41832.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Thus, under the authority of <em>Mers, </em>a damage award in a promissory estoppel claim can properly include expectancy damages. In this case, appellee\u2019s expectancy, based on his discussion with Keener, was that he would be employed until age seventy-two based on appellant\u2019s agent\u2019s indication that appellant also wanted appellee to work until age seventy-two. Accordingly, the expert\u2019s testimony regarding appellee\u2019s expectancy damages, calculated through age seventy-two, was not erroneous particularly when evidence concerning the appropriate deductions was also presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertion, the jury instruction on damages in the case <em>sub judice </em>did not contradict the law stated in <em>Worrell. Worrell </em>was primarily concerned with a claim of intentional discrimination in which no promise concerning a definite term of employment was made. Here, a promise of employment through a specific age was at issue. Appellant argues that <em>Worrell </em>stands solely for the proposition that a party should receive compensation only for the period until reemployment in the same or similar position. However, in <em>Worrell, </em>the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">\u201c[T]he usual remedy in breach of contract cases for wrongful discharge is to pay the injured party the difference between any wages due under the contract from the date of discharge until the contract term expires, and that amount is to be reduced by any wages the employee earned in subsequent employment. * * * \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Id., </em>45 Ohio St.3d at 246, 543 N.E.2d at 1282.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">The <em>Worrell </em>court held that \u201cfront pay\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was appropriate from the time of termination to the time of subsequent reemployment. <em>Id., </em>45 Ohio St.3d at 247, 543 N.E.2d at 1283. However, the court acknowledged that its decision did not restrict an award of \u201cfront pay <em>for a more expended period of time </em>in age discrimination suits filed pursuant to R.C. Chapter 4112, Civil Rights Commission.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>Thus, even the <em>Worrell </em>court recognized that an extended payment period may be required under certain circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">Appellee asserts that if the employment relationship is for an <em>indefinite </em>period of time, the damages are calculated through the date of reemployment in a similar position. Conversely, where the parties undertake an employment rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>tionship for a <em>specific </em>and <em>definite </em>term, damages are calculated based on the length of that term. This position is supported by the holdings in <em>Worrell </em>and <em>Mers. </em>Front pay, alone, is undeniably appropriate where no definite term is at stake, but where a definite, specific term is at issue, expectancy damages for the balance of the term are properly awarded. In conclusion, appellant\u2019s arguments under this assignment are not well founded. Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Appellant\u2019s argument under the third assignment is that appellee failed to introduce records corroborating his income. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">In <em>State ex rel. Martin v. Columbus </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 261, 12 O.O.3d 268, 389 N.E.2d 1123, paragraph three of the syllabus, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">\u201cThe principle of mitigation of damages applicable in a suit to recover compensation for a period of wrongful exclusion from employment is an affirmative defense and the burden of proof on that issue resides upon the employer responsible for the wrongful discharge.\u201d See, also, <em>State ex rel. Hamlin v. Collins </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St.3d 117, 119, 9 OBR 342, 343-344, 459 N.E.2d 520, 523.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Thus, the defendant/employer has the burden of proof on the issue of mitigation. Here, appellee testified regarding the money he had received from self-employment and a brief period of employment with Anderson Door. He further stated that the income he had received from the various sources had been deposited into his checking account. Defendant\u2019s Exhibit L contained records of appellee\u2019s bank account from 1992 through 1993. The parties stipulated to the amount of unemployment compensation, which was $4,009 in 1992 and $3,587 in 1993. Appellee testified that the income from his subsequent full-time employment with Anderson Door was $849 and that the amount of Social Security earnings per month was $772. Thus, while the records from appellee were not bookkeeping exemplars regarding his outside income, since he did not maintain a complete, formal ledger, the bank records nevertheless adequately substantiated appellee\u2019s mitigation efforts. Appellee\u2019s damages were proved with reasonable certainty. <em>Bemmes v. Pub. Emp. Retirement Bd. </em>(1995), 102 Ohio App.3d 782, 789, 658 N.E.2d 31, 35-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">Moreover, appellant, bearing the burden of proof on mitigation, did not present any contradictory evidence from an expert of its own concerning a different amount of money that appellee could have, or should have, earned in the subject period. Therefore, appellant failed on its burden to show that appellee did not mitigate damages. We also note that the issue of mitigation would be moot if damages were awarded to age seventy-two, since appellee would have no incentive to mitigate damages based on his expectation of continued employment. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Appellant presents three arguments under the fourth assignment. First, appellant contends that the trial court made directly inconsistent instructions with regard to the issue of reliance under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. Second, appellant argues that the trial judge refused to clarify certain instructions as given previously. Third, appellant submits that the court improperly instructed the jury as to the measure of damages. None of appellant\u2019s arguments is well founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">In <em>Doyle v. Fairfield Machine Co., Inc. </em>(1997), 120 Ohio App.3d 192, 214-215, 697 N.E.2d 667, 681, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">\u201cErroneous jury instructions are not <em>per se </em>plain and reversible error. The relevant inquiry in determining whether erroneous jury instructions constitute plain and reversible error is \u2018whether the jury charge probably misled the jury in a matter materially affecting the complaining party\u2019s substantial rights.\u2019 <em>Becker [v. Lake Cty. Mem. Hosp. W. </em>(1990)] 53 Ohio St.3d [202] at 208, 560 N.E.2d 165 [at 171]. Stated slightly differently, the reviewing court\u2019s inquiry is whether \u2018but for the error, the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise.\u2019 Further, the reviewing court is not to look at specific provisions of the jury instructions; rather, the court is to look at the totality of the jury charge in determining whether the erroneous portion of it is harmless or so prejudicial as to warrant reversal. Without a <em>timely </em>objection on the record, the prejudice allegedly created by the erroneous instructions must satisfy the plain error standard.\u201d (Citations omitted and emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">One question asked by the jury was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">\u201cAre the underlined words on p. 10, possibly the wrong words. It appears to <em>us </em>that this changes the subjects in the middle of the paragraph.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">\u201cIt seems that the paper is talking about prom, estoppel, but the words implied contract are stuck in the sentence by accident.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Another question posed was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-10\">\u201cWhat are the definitions of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-11\">\u201c1.) Implied Contract?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-12\">\u201cand</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-13\">\u201c2.) Promissory Estoppel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-14\">\u201cThe 10th page is a little unclear on what the page is referring to. Especially the part marked.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-15\">The instruction on promissory estoppel given in this case is substantially similar to the version in 3 Ohio Jury Instructions (1996), Section 302.01, which recites the law on promissory estoppel as set forth in <em>Mers, </em>and also to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>attorneys\u2019 submissions. Responding to the stated questions, the court acknowledged that the words \u201cimplied contract\u201d had indeed been used where the phrase \u201cpromissory estoppel\u201d should have been inserted. In response, the judge simply gave the jury the definition of implied contract. In our opinion, the trial court\u2019s response was not completely satisfactory, since it failed to explicitly address the question of whether the wrong phrase had been used. However, viewing the instruction in its totality, and considering the record as a whole, we cannot say that that failure by the trial court rendered the verdict defective. The jurors apparently resolved the ambiguity themselves on the basis of the additional implied-contract definition. The signed interrogatories reflect the jury\u2019s determination that appellee established promissory estoppel but failed to establish implied contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">Additionally, the trial judge\u2019s instruction to the jury that it was not enough that appellee had quit his job in reliance on appellant\u2019s promise, but that additional compelling factors would have to be proved, is not an inconsistency or contradiction. Instead, these combined statements, as adopted from <em>Mers, </em>merely demonstrate that the employee carries an increased burden of proof and not a lesser burden as appellant suggests.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Turning to the trial court\u2019s response to the other questions, it is our view that the trial judge addressed these queries adequately. The first question received from the jury was \u201cCan we use the depositions? If not, can we have the dates they were taken[?]\u201d The trial judge\u2019s response was to reiterate that he had already given the jurors all of the applicable instructions, and then he advised them to reread the instructions and to apply the law to the case. The second question, composed of two parts, queried, \u201cDoes this being a contract, if agreed upon, neccesatate <em>[sic </em>] the age of employment to 72[?]\u201d and \u201cCan we have the transcripts from the actual trial since it was when we were all present anyway[?]\u201d The court\u2019s response here was similar to its answer to the first question. These responses, while admittedly perfunctory, nevertheless fell within the realm of the trial court\u2019s sound discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Finally, with regard to the jury instruction concerning damages,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the charge comported with the definition of damages as stated in <em>Mers </em>and <em>Worrell. </em>The analysis set forth in the second assignment on this issue is equally applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>here. The damage instruction was not erroneous. Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Finally, appellee/cross-appellant filed a notice of cross-appeal, but never filed an appellate brief in support of the cross-appeal. To request affirmative relief, appellee/cross-appellant was required to file a brief, as appellant, within twenty days after the date on which the clerk mailed the notice that the record was filed, unless extended by the court.
