McNabb argues that the district court erred in enhancing his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) based on the use of a firearm in connection with another felony offense, burglary of a building. The Government contends that McNabb waived this argument in the district court. However, the record does not reflect that McNabb affirmatively relinquished his right to assert an objection to the enhancement. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-16\">McNabb makes specific arguments on appeal that he did not make in the district court. Therefore, review of those arguments is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Guerrero-Robledo, </em>565 F.3d 940, 946 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 227, 175 L.Ed.2d 158 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-19\">McNabb argues for the first time on appeal that under Texas law his offense of burglary was complete when he entered the gun shop with the intent to steal and, thus, the subsequently stolen firearms could not be used to facilitate a crime already committed. He argues that a plain reading of the Guidelines implies that there must be a second crime committed before imposing the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-20\">Section 2K2.1(b)(6) authorizes a four-level increase of a defendant\u2019s offense level \u201c[i]f the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\u201d Both the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>mentary following this Guideline and this court\u2019s interpretation of the Guideline support this enhancement if a firearm is obtained contemporaneously with the commission of a burglary offense. <em>See United States v. Armstead, </em>114 F.3d 504, 512-13 (5th Cir.1997); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, comment. (n. 14(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Insofar as McNabb argues that the possession of the firearm was not separate in time and conduct from the burglary, this court has rejected the argument that the other felony offense must be distinct from the possession of the weapon. <em>See United States v. Perez, </em>585 F.3d 880, 886-87 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Armstead, </em>114 F.3d at 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The district court did not plainly err in enhancing McNabb\u2019s offense level pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). The sentence imposed is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b473-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
