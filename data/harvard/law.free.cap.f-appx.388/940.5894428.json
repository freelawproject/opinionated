(\u201cAlcatraz\u201d), and William M. Windsor, who participated in the management of Alcatraz, seeking an injunction against Alcatraz for future ticket sales for Maid of the Mist boat tours. The case was assigned to United States District Judge Orinda Evans, who granted summary judgment in favor of Maid and entered judgment accordingly in October 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-15\">William M. Windsor appeals the district court\u2019s December 22, 2009, order denying/dismissing 62 post-judgment motions he filed in 2009, dismissing a complaint of professional misconduct he filed in 2009, and issuing an injunction restricting Windsor from filing any further motion, pleading, or other paper in relation to the instant civil action, and any new lawsuit in any court involving claims arising from the same factual predicate or nucleus of operative facts as in the instant case. Specifically, Windsor argues that the district court abused its discretion by: (1) refusing to recuse from this case; (2) denying Windsor\u2019s Rule 60 motions for relief from judgment; (3) denying Windsor\u2019s motions for sanctions against Maid, its officers, and its attorneys; (4) denying Windsor\u2019s motions for a hearing or conference; (5) denying Windsor\u2019s motion to waive the requirement that Alcatraz be represented by counsel; (6) denying Windsor\u2019s motion to lift a seal from a document and by dismissing his motion to compel discovery; (7) dismissing Windsor\u2019s complaint of professional misconduct; and (8) permanently enjoining Windsor and those acting in conjunction with him from filing further pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>After thorough review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we summarily affirm the district court\u2019s December 2009 orrler in all respects. In light of our September 9, 2009, dismissal of Windsor\u2019s prior appeal as frivolous, we will address only the injunction issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">\u201cIn reviewing the district court\u2019s decision to grant an injunction, including an injunction under the All Writs Act, we apply an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Klay v. United Healthgroup, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1092, 1096 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion if it applies an incorrect legal standard, follows improper procedures in making the determination, or makes findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">\u201cFederal courts have both the inherent power and the constitutional obligation to protect their jurisdiction from conduct which impairs their ability to carry out Article III functions.\u201d <em>Procup v. Strickland, </em>792 F.2d 1069, 1073 (11th Cir.1986) <em>(ien banc). </em>The All Writs Act is a codification of this inherent power and provides that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court and all courts established by Act of Congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\u201d <em>Klay, </em>376 F.3d at 1099 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a)). The Act allows courts \u201cto safeguard not only ongoing proceedings, but potential future proceedings, as well as already-issued orders and judgments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnotes omitted). This includes the power to enjoin litigants who are abusing the court system by harassing their opponents. Har<em>relson v. United States, </em>613 F.2d 114, 116 (5th Cir.1980). A \u201ccourt has a responsibility to prevent single litigants from unnecessarily encroaching on the judicial machinery needed by others,\u201d and a litigant \u201ccan be severely restricted as to what he may file and how he must behave in his applications for judicial relief.\u201d <em>Procup, </em>792 at 1074. \u201c[A litigant] just cannot be completely foreclosed from <em>any </em>access to the court.\u201d <em>Id. A </em>party seeking to obtain an All Writs Act injunction \u201cmust simply point to some ongoing proceeding, or some past order or judgment, the integrity of which is being threatened by someone else\u2019s action or behavior.\u201d <em>Klay, </em>376 F.3d at 1100.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">We conclude from the record that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the injunction on Windsor based on his litigious behavior that undermined the integrity of the judgments and orders in this case. Although the case is closed, Windsor has repeatedly filed unsubstantiated, duplicative pleadings, many after the district court issued an order denying them. Moreover, his pleadings are long and repetitive, and the volume of his filings poses a burden to clerical and judicial operations and is an impediment to the administration of justice. Windsor\u2019s filings also have been costly and burdensome to Maid, who has repeatedly defended itself against unfounded accusations concerning a case in which it prevailed and which has been closed for over two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s December 22, 2009, order denying/dismissing all of Windsor\u2019s motions, dismissing his complaint of professional misconduct, and imposing a filing injunction upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
