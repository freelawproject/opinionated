After review, we DENY the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b889-16\">Arteaga and his wife are natives and citizens of Colombia and their two sons are natives and citizens of Venezuela. Administrative Record (\u201cAR\u201d) at 259, 279, 299, 319. Arteaga and his family were admitted to the United States on 12 July 2002, as non-immigrant visitors with authorization to remain until 11 January 2003. <em>Id. </em>In June 2003, Arteaga filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief, listing his wife and children as derivative applicants. <em>Id. </em>at 233-44. Ar-teaga stated in his application that he and his wife were residents of Venezuela before coming to the United States and that he and his family would be killed or tortured by FARC guerillas if returned to Colombia. <em>Id. </em>at 237-39, 243-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-17\">On 26 November 2003, the Department of Homeland Security served Arteaga, his wife, and both of their children with Notices to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d), charging them with removability pursuant to \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B) of the INA. <em>Id. </em>at 259-60, 279-80, 299-300, 319-20. Arteaga admitted the allegations in the NTA and conceded removability. <em>Id. </em>at 126. After a hearing on the merits, the IJ denied Ar-teaga\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. <em>Id. </em>at 103-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-18\">The BIA dismissed Arteaga\u2019s appeal from the IJ\u2019s order, and we dismissed his petition for review in this Court. In Au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>gust 2008, Arteaga filed a motion with the BIA to reopen his asylum proceedings based on changed circumstances in Colombia. <em>Id. </em>at 21-27. Arteaga asserted that he was still targeted by the FARC and that he would be persecuted if returned. <em>Id. </em>at 23. On 27 January 2009, the BIA denied Arteaga\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>Id. </em>at 15. The BIA explained that although Ar-teaga\u2019s evidence post-dated his removal hearing, it was very similar to the evidence Arteaga presented to the IJ during his removal proceedings. <em>Id. </em>The BIA thus determined that Arteaga had not provided sufficient evidence of changed circumstances to warrant reopening his asylum application. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Arteaga did not seek a petition for review in this Court, but instead filed a motion to reconsider with the BIA in February 2009, stating that he \u201cdisagreed\u201d with the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen. <em>Id. </em>at 8-12. He argued that he had submitted evidence with his motion to reopen demonstrating the severity of the FARC\u2019s threats against him, and urged the BIA to reconsider that evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">The BIA denied Arteaga\u2019s motion to reconsider, finding that Arteaga\u2019s evidence that the FARC \u201cstill\u201d wanted to harm him did not reflect changed circumstances in Colombia since the time of his removal proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 3. The BIA also noted that Arteaga\u2019s motion to reopen had been untimely filed. <em>Id. </em>The BIA reasoned that, because Arteaga had not submitted material evidence demonstrating changed circumstances in Colombia, his motion was subject to the filing deadline. Because it did not err in denying Arteaga\u2019s motion to reopen, the BIA concluded that reconsideration was not warranted. <em>Id. </em>Arteaga then filed the instant petition for review of the BIA\u2019s order denying his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">Arteaga did not file a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s 27 January 2009 denial of his motion to reopen, but instead filed a motion to reconsider in February 2009, which the BIA denied. We therefore lack jurisdiction to decide the merits of Arteaga\u2019s motion to reopen and may decide only whether the BIA abused its discretion in denying the motion to reconsider.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (2010) (\u201cThe petition for review must be filed not later than 30 days after the date of the final order of removal.\u201d); <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 504 F.3d </em>1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2007) (review of the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider is for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">\u201cA motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1) (2010); <em>see also </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(6)(C); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C) (2010). A motion to reconsider that merely restates the arguments that the BIA previously rejected provides no reason for the BIA to change its prior decision. <em>See Calle, </em>504 F.3d at 1329-31. \u201cTherefore, merely reiterating arguments previously presented to the BIA does not constitute \u2018specifying ... errors of fact or law\u2019 as required for a successful motion to reconsider.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1329 (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>In his motion to reconsider, Arteaga failed to identify any errors of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s prior decision denying his motion to reopen. Instead, he merely expressed his \u201cdisagreement\u201d with the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen, and asked the BIA to reconsider the evidence he had previously submitted in support of his motion to reopen. This was insufficient to warrant reconsideration. <em>See id. </em>at 1330-31. Because the BIA\u2019s decision to deny Arteaga\u2019s motion to reconsider was neither arbitrary nor capricious, we DENY the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b890-6\">. On appeal, Arteaga argues only that the BIA erred in denying his motion to reopen, and has thus abandoned any challenge to the BIA's denial of his motion to consider. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (noting that issues on which an appellant fails to offer any argument are deemed abandoned). Because Ar-teaga is proceeding <em>pro se, </em>however, we will address whether the BIA abused its discretion in denying the motion to reconsider.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
