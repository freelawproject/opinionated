Reece, Sr., pro <em>se </em>and <em>informa pauperis, </em>sued Walden Affordable L.L.C. and Fountaingate Apartments (collectively \u201cDefendants\u201d) for, among other things, unlawful discrimination with regard to his eviction from Fountaingate Apartments. The district court found Reece\u2019s complaint frivolous and malicious, and dismissed it with prejudice under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). On appeal, Reece argues that the district court erred by dismissing his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-18\">We have previously held that \u201cin forma pauperis complaints may be dismissed as frivolous if they seek to relitigate claims that allege substantially the same facts arising from a common series of events which have already been unsuccessfully litigated by the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Pittman v. Moore, </em>980 F.2d 994, 994 (5th Cir.1993). The claims in Reece\u2019s current complaint allege facts that are virtually identical to the facts in his previous complaint, which the district court dismissed with prejudice. <em>Reese [sic] v. Fountaingate Apartments, </em>No. 7:08-CV-155, 2008 WL 5061642, at *2 (N.D.Tex. Nov.25, 2008). Both cases allege an improper eviction in May 2007, a broken oral agreement not to evict, and an improper use of Reece\u2019s rent money to pay Defendants\u2019 court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-23\">Because we find that the district court did not err in dismissing Reece\u2019s claims as frivolous, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b490-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
