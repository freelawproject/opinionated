He alleged that, as the only African-American employee who also was a Muslim, he was subjected to discriminatory comments about his religion from other employees. He also alleged that he was given the least desirable routes and the oldest truck in the fleet, which had many safety problems that Defendant refused to repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">The district court concluded that Alansari failed to make a <em>prima </em>facie case of disparate treatment because he presented no valid comparator. A plaintiff fails to establish a <em>prima facie </em>disparate treatment case if he fails to show that he was treated less favorably than a similarly-situated person outside his protected class. <em>McCann v. Tillman, </em>526 F.3d 1370, 1373 (11th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When determining whether a comparator is \u201csimilarly situated,\u201d we \u201crequire that the quantity and quality of the comparator\u2019s misconduct be nearly identical to prevent courts from second-guessing employers\u2019 reasonable decisions and confusing apples with oranges.\u201d <em>Burke-Fowler v. Orange County, Fla., </em>447 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">Alansari argues\u2014as he did before the district court\u2014that his fellow employee, Donald Hamm, engaged in similar company violations as Alansari did, but that Hamm was disciplined less harshly.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant terminated Alansari\u2019s job because he had many customer complaints against him, had slept on the job, twice had run his truck out of fuel, and had made unauthorized repairs on his truck. Hamm did not engage in these same violations. While evidence showed that Hamm was arrested for soliciting a prostitute while in his truck and that he had his license suspended, these incidents were not similar to Alansari\u2019s incidents, which included costing Defendant $1000 in repairs. Thus, Alan-sari presented no valid comparator and failed to make a case of disparate treatment based on religion or race.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">About Alansari\u2019s hostile work environment claim, the district court concluded that the incidents were not objectively severe enough to constitute an abusive environment; Alansari disagrees and maintains that the harassment against him was pervasive and severe. A hostile work environment \u201cis permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult, that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim\u2019s employment and create an abusive working environment.\u201d <em>Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., </em>510 U.S. 17, 114 S.Ct. 367, 370, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993) (citation omitted). To determine whether acts alter the terms and conditions of employment, we consider these factors: \u201c(1) the frequency of the conduct; (2) the severity of the conduct; (3)whether the conduct is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>fensive utterance; and (4) whether the conduct unreasonably interferes with the employee\u2019s job performance.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. Borden, Inc., </em>195 F.3d 1238, 1246 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\">The district court committed no error in concluding that Alansari failed to make a hostile work environment claim. The behavior Alansari was subjected to while stocking his truck at the warehouse \u2014 including solicitations to go to church because \u201cJesus would save\u201d him, other comments about his Muslim religion, and the playing of Christian music on the radio\u2014 may have been unwanted and even derogatory, but it did not rise to a threatening or humiliating level. Instead, these comments were more akin to \u201cmere offensive utterances\u201d and not something that unreasonably interfered with Alansari\u2019s work of loading his truck and delivering his goods. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">About retaliation, the district court concluded that Alansari established no causal connection between his protected activity and his termination. To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation under Title VII, Alansari had to show that (1) he engaged in statutorily protected expression, (2) he suffered an adverse employment act, and (3) some causal connection existed between the two events. <em>Pennington v. City of Huntsville, </em>261 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2001). To establish a causal connection, Alansari must show that (1) the decision-makers were aware of the protected conduct and (2) the protected activity and the adverse act were not wholly unrelated. <em>Shannon v. Bellsouth Telecomm., Inc., </em>292 F.3d 712, 716 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">Here, Alansari failed to show a causal connection between his protected activity \u2014 complaining about the alleged harassment from his coworkers \u2014 and the adverse employment act of being terminated. Alansari complained about the harassment only to his direct supervisor; and nothing evidences that he told anyone else. The record makes clear that those persons involved in the decision to fire Alansari\u2014 company owner Kevin Coats and transportation manager Jason Jernegan \u2014 did not know about Alansari\u2019s protected activity. But both men knew about Alansari\u2019s work performance issues.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">Alansari sought to have his state workers\u2019 compensation retaliation claim remanded to state court, but the district court refused because Alansari did not seek remand within 30 days of removal. \u201cA civil action in any State court arising under the workmen\u2019s compensation laws of such State may not be removed to any district court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1445(c). We have concluded that, under section 1445(c), a district court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to review a retaliation claim arising out of state workers\u2019 compensation laws. <em>Reed v. Heil Co., </em>206 F.3d 1055, 1060-61 (11th Cir.2000); see <em>also In re Trusted Net Media Holdings, LLC, </em>550 F.3d 1035, 1042 (11th Cir.2008) (subject-matter jurisdiction involves a court\u2019s power to hear a case and can never be forfeited or waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-14\">Because the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Alansari\u2019s state workers\u2019 compensation retaliation claim, we conclude that it erred in refusing to remand the claim to state court. <em>See Reed, </em>206 F.3d at 1061 (requiring remand when district court exercised jurisdiction over state workers\u2019 compensation claim); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) (a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>remand a case to state court \u201con the basis of any defect <em>other than lack of subject-matter jurisdiction </em>must be made within 30 days\u201d of removal) (emphasis added). We vacate and remand the court\u2019s order on this claim with instructions for the district court to grant Alansari\u2019s motion to remand to state court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b929-16\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court's grant of summary judgment. <em>Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1363 (11th Cir.2007). And we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b929-17\">. Defendant removed Alansari's case to federal court. Claims brought under the Florida statutes employ the same analysis as Title VII claims. <em>See Harper v. Blockbuster Entm\u2019t Corp., </em>139 F.3d 1385, 1389 (11th Cir.1998) (Florida Civil Rights Act); <em>Sierminski v. Transouth Fin. Corp., </em>216 F.3d 945, 950-51 (11th Cir.2000) (Florida Whistleblower Act).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b930-7\">. Because this case is a circumstantial evidence case, the burden-shifting framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), applies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b930-8\">. Nothing supports Alansari's contention, other than his speculative allegations, that he was assigned a longer route or a faulty truck because of his race or religion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b930-9\">. Alansari disagrees with Defendant\u2019s reasons for terminating him and argues that these reasons are evidence of pretext. But we need not reach the issue of pretext because Alan-sari failed to make a <em>prima facie </em>case of disparate treatment. And even still, Alansari cannot simply question the wisdom of Defendant's reasons for terminating him to show pretext. <em>See Holifield v. Reno, </em>115 F.3d 1555, 1565 (11th Cir.1997) (the pretext inquiry centers upon the employer's beliefs, and not the employee's own perceptions of his performance).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b931-7\">. Alansari argues dial a material fact issue exists about who made the decision to fire him because the district court referred to a \"Jason Coats,\" and no such person exists. But it is clear from the district court's order that this reference simply was a scrivener's error and that the court was referring to the company's owner, Kevin Coats.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b932-15\">. Because we conclude that remand is necessary, we make no comment on the district court's substantive conclusion about the workers' compensation retaliation claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
