The IJ determined that Segovia had failed to show that her removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to her family, as required for cancellation of removal. Segovia argues in this petition that the IJ cited to legal authority involving hardship factors that are not present in her situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-21\">We lack jurisdiction to consider the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that Segovia failed to demonstrate exceptional and unusual hardship. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00a9; <em>Sung v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 372, 377 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831 (5th Cir.2004). The jurisdiction-stripping provision of \u00a7 1252 does not preclude review of constitutional claims and questions of law. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Sung, </em>505 F.3d at 377. Segovia did not make any arguments in her brief raising a colorable constitutional claim or a question of law that we would have jurisdiction to review. Because we lack jurisdiction to review the final order of removal, the petition for review is dismissed. <em>See Alwan v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 507, 515 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-22\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b487-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
