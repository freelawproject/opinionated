Mendoza appealed his sentence, arguing that his second drug possession offense should not have been considered an aggravated felony for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) because the Government did not establish that the offense was prosecuted under state recidivism laws providing Mendoza with notice and procedural protections commensurate with those prescribed by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851. We affirmed the judgment of the district court, relying on our decision in <em>United States v. Cepeda-Rios, </em>530 F.3d 333, 335-36 (5th Cir.2008). <em>United States v. Mendoza-Delgado, </em>No. 09-40559 (5th Cir. Dec.15, 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">After Mendoza petitioned for a writ of certiorari, the Supreme Court vacated our decision and remanded the case for consideration in light of <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010). <em>Mendoza-Delgado v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3457, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2010). The Court in <em>Carachun-Rosendo </em>held that \u201cwhen a defendant has been convicted of a simple possession offense that has not been enhanced based on the fact of a prior conviction, he has not been \u2018convicted\u2019 under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1229b(a)(3) of a \u2018felony punishable\u2019 as such \u2018under the Controlled Substances Act,\u2019 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2).\u201d 130 S.Ct. at 2589. In accordance with the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Carachwti-Ro-sendo, </em>we VACATE the sentence and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b410-26\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cm.
