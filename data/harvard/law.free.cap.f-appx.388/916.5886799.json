Swanson was sentenced to 327 months imprisonment after he pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five grams or more of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. After this court affirmed his sentence on direct appeal, Swanson filed a section 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered the offense levels that apply based on the quantity of crack cocaine attributed to a defendant. On appeal, Swanson argues that the district court erred in finding him ineligible for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>sentencing reduction on the ground that his guideline range was determined based on his status as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and thus had not been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. Because Amendment 706 became effective before Swanson was sentenced and was applied at his original sentencing, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\">A district court has the authority to modify a defendant\u2019s sentence if it was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.... \u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Under this provision, courts cannot modify a sentence unless a retroactively applicable amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines has the effect of lowering the guideline range upon which a defendant\u2019s sentence was based. <em>United States v. Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d 905, 909 (11th Cir.2003). We review <em>de novo </em>a district court's legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under section 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). We review the denial of a section 3582(c)(2) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Jules, </em>595 F.3d 1239, 1241 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Because Amendment 706 became effective before Swanson was sentenced and was applied at his original sentencing, it did not subsequently lower his guideline range. Amendment 706 became effective on November 1, 2007. U.S.S.G. App. C, Amend. 706 (2007). Swanson was sentenced on June 9, 2008. His guideline range was calculated pursuant to the 2007 Federal Sentencing Guidelines Manual, which incorporated the revision mandated by Amendment 706. While Swanson\u2019s guideline range was ultimately determined based on his status as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, his base offense level was also calculated under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) and, pursuant to Amendment 706, reduced by two levels because his offense involved crack cocaine. Therefore, the district court had no authority under section 3582(c)(2) to modify Swanson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">To the extent that Swanson challenges his original sentence \u2014 he argues that both the crack-powder sentencing disparity and the inapplicability of Amendment 706\u2019s base offense level reduction to defendants sentenced as career offenders violate the Equal Protection Clause \u2014 the district court properly declined to address these arguments because they are outside the scope of a section 3582 proceeding. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781-82 (11th Cir.2000) (holding that district courts lack jurisdiction under section 3582(c) to consider challenges to the original sentence or to change original sentencing determinations \u201cwith the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d). Swanson has also raised these equal protection claims in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion pending in the district court, which is the proper vehicle for a collateral attack on his original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-12\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Swanson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b943-6\">. The district court denied the motion on a different ground, but we may affirm for any reason supported by the record. <em>United States v. Al-Arian, </em>514 F.3d 1184, 1189 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
