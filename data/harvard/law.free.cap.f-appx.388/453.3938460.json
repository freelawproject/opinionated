R. Civ. Pro. 12(b)(1) and for failure to state a claim. Hurrey seeks to have his \u00a7 1983 complaint reinstated and raises numerous issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Hurrey failed to raise the majority of his arguments before the district court. This court generally does not address arguments raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Stewart Glass &amp; Mirror, Inc. v. U.S. Auto Glass Disc. Ctrs., Inc., </em>200 F.3d 307, 316-17 (5th Cir.2000) (\u201cIt is a bedrock principle of appellate review that claims raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered.\u201d). Moreover, Hurrey fails to brief any argument regarding the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous in part, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) in part, and for failure to state a claim in part. Failure to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis is the same as if the appellant had not appealed the judgment. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Therefore, Hurrey has abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s dismissal of his civil rights complaint. <em>See Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748. This appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. See <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). It is therefore DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">This court\u2019s dismissal of Hurrey\u2019s appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Hurrey should be cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes he will no longer be allowed to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">APPEAL DISMISSED, SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b479-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
