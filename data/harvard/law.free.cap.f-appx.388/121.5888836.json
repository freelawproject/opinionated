Hoffman, </em>271 Fed.Appx. 227, 228 (3d Cir.2008). He was sentenced to an aggregate term of sixty-five years of imprisonment. In August 2007, Hoffman filed this lawsuit against Roberto Rashid, a government witness during Hoffman\u2019s criminal trial, and Rashid\u2019s employer, AT &amp; T. In his complaint, Hoffman claimed that Rashid gave false and/or misleading testimony concerning Hoffman\u2019s cellular telephone records.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, Hoffman claimed that AT &amp; T\u2019s practice of publishing certain \u201crouting numbers\u201d in its telephone records violated some unspecified provision of the Federal Communications Act (\u201cFCA\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Rashid and AT &amp; T moved to dismiss Hoffman\u2019s complaint under, <em>inter alia, </em>Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The District Court granted the motion. The District Court determined that because the FCA contains a two-year statute of limitations, Hoffman\u2019s claims under that statute were time-barred. The District Court determined that even if Hoffman\u2019s claims under the FCA were timely, he failed to \u201callege a violation of the FCA upon which this Court may grant relief.\u201d The District Court also determined that under Pennsylvania law, Rashid was entitled to absolute testimonial immunity from civil liability and, by extension, AT &amp; T could not be held liable under a theory of respondeat superior. Hoffman appealed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">Having granted Hoffman leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we must dismiss his appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if it has no arguable basis in law. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 819, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). Alternatively, we may take summary action if it clearly appears that Hoffman\u2019s appeal presents no substantial questions. <em>See </em>LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6. We may affirm the District Court on any basis that finds support in the record. <em>See Tourscher v. McCullough, </em>184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">The only relief sought by Hoffman in his complaint is monetary damages. We thus agree with the District Court that Rashid is immune from civil liability since, as a witness who provided testimony at Hoffman\u2019s trial, he is cloaked with absolute immunity from liability. Both Pennsylvania law and federal law command this result. <em>See Hughes v. Long, </em>242 F.3d 121, 125 (3d Cir.2001) (\u201cWitnesses, including public officials and private citizens, are immune from civil damages based upon their testimony.\u201d) (citing <em>Briscoe v. Lallue, </em>460 U.S. 325, 341, 345-46, 103 S.Ct. 1108, 75 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>L.Ed.2d 96 (1983)); <em>Pelagatti v. Cohen, </em>370 Pa.Super. 422, 536 A.2d 1337, 1342 (1987) (Under Pennsylvania law, \u201cit is well settled that private witnesses, as well as counsel, are absolutely immune from damages liability for testimony, albeit false, given or used in judicial proceedings.\u201d) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Furthermore, even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that his claims were timely raised, we conclude that Hoffman\u2019s claims under \u00a7\u00a7 201(b), 206, 206, 217, and 220(e) of the FCA are not viable because they do not demonstrate conduct by AT &amp; T that could form the basis of an FCA violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Under the FCA, business practices of common carriers like AT &amp; T cannot be \u201cunjust or unreasonable.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(b). Hoffman ostensibly claims that AT &amp; T\u2019s alleged practice of including \u201crouting information\u201d in telephone records is either unjust or unreasonable. However, it is within the purview of the Federal Communications Commission, not Hoffman, \u201cto determine whether a particular practice constitutes a violation for which there is a private right to compensation.\u201d <em>North County Commc\u2019ns Corp. v. California Catalog &amp; Tech., </em>594 F.3d 1149, 1158 (9th Cir.2010); <em>see also Global Crossing Telecomms., Inc. v. Metrophones Tele-comms., Inc., </em>550 U.S. 45, 49, 53, 127 S.Ct. 1513, 167 L.Ed.2d 422 (2007); <em>Prometheus Radio Project v. F.C.C., </em>373 F.3d 372, 391 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Section 220(e) criminalizes, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cwillfully mak[ing] any false entry in the accounts of any book of account or in any record or memoranda kept by any such [common] carrier.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 220(e); <em>see, e.g., United States v. Rigas, </em>583 F.3d 108, 112 (2d Cir.2009). Even assuming that a common carrier\u2019s conduct in violation of \u00a7 220(e) could form the basis of a civil suit under the FCA, Hoffman cannot point to anything in the record to demonstrate impropriety in AT &amp; T\u2019s record-keeping practice, or that such impropriety was specifically intended by AT &amp; T or one of its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">Because he cannot independently show that AT <em>&amp; </em>T violated \u00a7 201(b) or \u00a7 220(e) of the FCA, \u00a7\u00a7 206 and 207 do not apply. <em>See Core Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Verizon Pennsylvania, Inc., </em>493 F.3d 333, 340 (3d Cir.2007) (\u201cDivorced from any provision of the [FCA], it appears that \u00a7\u00a7 206 and 207, which make common carriers liable for damages \u2018under the provisions of this chapter,\u2019 do not apply.\u201d); <em>see also Global Crossing Telecomms., Inc., </em>550 U.S. at 53, 127 S.Ct. 1513 (\u201cthe purpose of \u00a7 207 is to allow persons injured by \u00a7 201(b) violations to bring federal-court damages actions.\u201d). And because Hoffman has failed to show that Rashid committed an FCA violation, \u00a7 217, the FCA\u2019s vicarious liability provision, also does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">Accordingly, because this appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. Hoffman\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b148-6\">. Specifically, Hoffman claimed that \"[it] was the willful misconduct by Mr. Roberto Rashid, and his reckless disregard for the consequences of his acts or omission by not [explaining] in more specific detail that AT &amp; T 'routing\u2019 numbers were improperly listed on Plaintiff\u2019s telephone records and bills....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b148-7\">. According to Hoffman, \"[i]t was because of [AT &amp; T and] Mr. Roberto Rashid\u2019s failure to render accurate service to Plaintiff by having \u2018improper routing\u2019 information in Plaintiff\u2019s telephone records and bills that cause Plaintiff\u2019s trial Judge and Jury to erroneously believe that \u2018routing\u2019 numbers were unlawfully used in a criminal drug conspiracy.\u201d Hoffman later specified which provisions of the FCA he believed had been violated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b148-12\">.The District Court exercised diversity jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the District Court's decision de novo. <em>See Capogrosso v. Supreme Court of N.J., </em>588 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b149-8\">. Pennsylvania follows the common law doctrine of respondeat superior. <em>See Solomon v. Gibson, </em>419 Pa.Super. 284, 615 A.2d 367, 371 (1992). Because Rashid is immune from liability, there is no liability to impute to AT &amp; T under a respondeat superior theory. <em>See </em>Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 2.04 (2006) (\"An employer is subject to liability for torts committed by employees while acting within the scope of their employment.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
