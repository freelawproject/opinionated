With respect to Count One, in August 2008, federal authorities were notified that, in July 2006, Krpata had purchased child pornography from a website operated by Sergio Marzola, an individual who engaged in the mass production and sale of child pornography via the internet. With respect to Count Two, federal authorities conducted a separate investigation of a commercial child pornography website which revealed that on January 13, 2007, Krpata had purchased access to a member-restricted website containing video files and images of child pornography. On or about October 15, 2008, federal authorities searched Krpata\u2019s parents\u2019 residence, where Krpata resided, and discovered a collection of child pornography containing DVD\u2019s from Marzola\u2019s website, as well as downloaded files, cut-out photo images, and other DVD\u2019s. Following the district court\u2019s denial of Krpata\u2019s motion to dismiss based on double jeopardy grounds, Krpata agreed to plead guilty with the right to appeal the issue of whether the conviction and sentence for both counts violated the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-14\">Krpata argues on appeal that his convictions and sentences violate the Double Jeopardy Clause because possession of child pornography in violation of \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B) is a lesser-included offense of receipt of child pornography in violation of \u00a7 2252A(a)(2) under the \u201csame-elements\u201d or <em>Blockburger </em>test. <em>See Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932). Moreover, he asserts that when applying this test, the facts of the particular case should not be taken into consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-15\">We review claims of double jeopardy <em>de novo. United States v. Bobb, </em>577 F.3d 1366, 1371 (11th Cir.2009). The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment guarantees that no person shall \u201cbe subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V. This guarantee prohibits, among other things, multiple punishments for the same offense. <em>Bobb, </em>577 F.3d at 1371. Thus, \u201cwhere two statutory provisions proscribe the same offense and there is no clear indication that the legislature intended multiple punishments for the offense, the Double Jeopardy Clause\u2019s prohibition against multiple punishments protects a defendant from being convicted under both provisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1371-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-16\">The test for determining whether two statutory provisions prohibit the same offense \u201cis whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u201d <em>Blockburger, </em>284 U.S. at 304, 52 S.Ct. at 182. Applying this test in <em>Bobb, </em>we determined that \u00a7 2252A(a)(2), prohibiting receipt of child pornography, and \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B), prohibiting possession of the same, proscribe the same conduct be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>cause \u201cby proving that a person \u2018knowingly receives\u2019 child pornography, the Government necessarily proves that the person \u2018knowingly possesses\u2019 child pornography.\u201d 577 F.3d at 1373. Moreover, we found \u201cno clear indication of legislative intent to impose multiplicitous punishment for receipt and possession of child pornography\u201d and therefore acknowledged that possession of child pornography is a lesser-included offense of receipt of child pornography. <em>Id. </em>at 1374 (citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">However, we nevertheless affirmed defendant Bobb\u2019s convictions for both receipt and possession because the \u201cconvictions were based on two different offenses, occurring on two different dates, and proscribed by two different statutes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1375. In so doing, we, in part, relied upon the evidence presented at trial. <em>Id. </em>Although our analysis in <em>Bobb </em>was conducted for purposes of plain error review, our opinion does not indicate that our reasoning would be any different in the context of preserved error. <em>See Id. </em>Moreover, in <em>United States v. Mendez, </em>we reviewed the double jeopardy claim <em>de novo </em>and also \u201cassess[ed] the elements [of each offense] in light of the facts\u201d presented at trial. 117 F.3d 480, 487 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Here, the district court did not err in denying Krpata\u2019s motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds. In this case, two different groups of child pornography images were being relied upon to support the charges alleged in Count One and Count Two. With respect to Count One, the government would introduce evidence that Krpata had purchased and received child pornography from Marzola in July 2006. With respect to Count Two, the government would introduce evidence that in October 2008, Krpata possessed additional DVD\u2019s and images of child pornography. Therefore, because Krpata\u2019s convictions and sentences were based on two distinct offenses, occurring on different dates, and proscribed by two different statutes, Krpata\u2019s convictions and sentences do not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-6\">.
