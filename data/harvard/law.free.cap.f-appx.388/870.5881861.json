Thompson initiated the present action to rescind an agreement settling her Title VII claims against the U.S. Army. The district court granted the Army\u2019s motion to dismiss, finding that the government had not waived sovereign immunity with respect to Thompson\u2019s claim and that the court therefore lacked subject-matter jurisdiction. After reviewing the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-17\">This case arises out of Thompson\u2019s allegations that she was sexually harassed while employed by the Army. On March 13, 2008, with the assistance of counsel, Thompson entered into a negotiated settlement agreement with the Army. The settlement agreement provided for monetary damages, attorney\u2019s fees, and occupational reassignment. In signing the agreement, Thompson certified that she understood the agreement, freely and voluntarily agreed to its conditions, and accepted its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-18\">Four days later Thompson\u2019s attorney contacted the Army, requesting rescission of the settlement agreement on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>grounds that Thompson was coerced and under duress when she signed the settlement agreement. The Army issued a final decision determining that the settlement agreement was valid. On appeal, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) likewise concluded that the <em>agreement </em>was valid and binding. The EEOC also denied Thompson\u2019s subsequent motion for reconsideration. Both the EEOC\u2019s initial decision and its later denial of the motion for reconsideration informed Thompson that she had \u201cthe right to file a civil action in an appropriate United States District Court within ninety (90) calendar days from the date that you receive this decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">On May 19, 2009, Thompson initiated this action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. Her complaint alleged that she entered the settlement agreement while \u201cunder duress and mental incapacity\u201d \u2014 primarily because her mental state, uncontrolled by medication at the time of settlement, interfered with her decision-making ability. She sought to void the agreement, to have her cases referred for further administrative processing, and to obtain attorney\u2019s fees. The district court found that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction and dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Par<em>ise v. Delta Airlines, Inc., </em>141 F.3d 1463, 1465 (11th Cir.1998). \u201cThe burden for establishing federal subject matter jurisdiction rests with the party bringing the claim.\u201d <em>Street Pea Marine, Ltd. v. API Marine, Inc., </em>411 F.3d 1242, 1247 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">Federal courts have jurisdiction over suits against the United States and its agencies only to the extent that sovereign immunity has been waived. <em>See United States v. Mitchell, </em>463 U.S. 206, 212, 103 S.Ct. 2961, 2965, 77 L.Ed.2d 580 (1983) (\u201cIt is axiomatic that the United States may not be sued without its consent and that the existence of consent is a prerequisite for jurisdiction.\u201d); <em>see also FDIC v. Meyer, </em>510 U.S. 471, 475, 114 S.Ct. 996, 1000, 127 L.Ed.2d 308 (1994) (\u201cAbsent a waiver, sovereign immunity shields the Federal Government and its agencies from suit.\u201d). Because Thompson is suing the Army, she bears the burden of establishing that the federal government has waived its sovereign immunity with respect to her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">Thompson contends that there are three grounds for asserting jurisdiction: (1) Title VII, particularly 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-16 and 2000e-5(f)(3); (2) various regulations promulgated by the EEOC, specifically 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1614.504, 1614.401, and 1614.407; and (3) public policy. For the reasons discussed below, none of these is sufficient to establish federal subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">First, Title VII does not authorize Thompson\u2019s suit. Title VII waives sovereign immunity when a federal employee seeks relief for unlawful employment practices \u2014 that is, for \u201cany discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(a), (c). However, Thompson\u2019s complaint does not seek relief for employment discrimination. Her claim is for contract rescission, a claim that is founded on general principles of contract law. She acknowledged as much before the district court: when responding to the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, she argued that the law applicable to her complaint was \u201cgeneral contract law, which controls all contractual agreements.\u201d (Doc. 6, at 2.) That the contract in question resolved Title VII complaints is incidental to Thompson\u2019s rescission claim, which is based on allegations of coercion and duress during the contracting process. <em>See Schmidt v. Shah, </em>696 F.Supp.2d 44, 61-62 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>(D.D.C.2010) (finding that federal employee\u2019s claims challenging validity of settlement agreement due to alleged threats, deception, coercion, duress, and poor health were \u201ccontractual in nature\u201d); <em>see also Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>511 U.S. 375, 379, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 1676, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994) (rejecting the idea that \u201cbreach of an agreement that produced the dismissal of an earlier federal suit\u201d can serve as the basis for \u201casserting otherwise nonexistent federal jurisdiction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Thompson specifically relies on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c), which authorizes federal employees to bring civil actions for redress of grievances. However, the statute applies only to civil suits initiated after final agency action or an EEOC determination \u201con a complaint of discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c). As discussed above, Thompson\u2019s present claim is for contract rescission, not unlawful employment discrimination. The statute says nothing about challenges to the validity of settlement agreements between federal departments and their employees. \u201cJurisdiction over any suit against the Government requires a clear statement from the United States waiving sovereign immunity, together with a claim falling within the terms of the waiver.\u201d <em>United States v. White Mountain Apache Tribe, </em>537 U.S. 465, 472, 123 S.Ct. 1126, 1131-32, 155 L.Ed.2d 40 (2003) (citations omitted). Because Thompson\u2019s contract rescission claim is not a claim falling with the scope of Title VII\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity, Title VII does not provide a basis for exercising jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Second, we are not persuaded by Thompson\u2019s argument that certain regulations promulgated by the EEOC provide subject-matter jurisdiction. The fact that the EEOC has been given broad power to promulgate regulations does not waive sovereign immunity. \u201cA waiver of the Federal Government\u2019s sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed in statutory text and will not be implied.\u201d <em>Lane v. Pena, </em>518 U.S. 187, 192, 116 S.Ct. 2092, 2096, 135 L.Ed.2d 486 (1996) (citations omitted). The scope of any waiver must be strictly construed in favor of the government. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">In addition, the specific regulations cited by Thompson do not indicate that Congress intended to waive sovereign immunity for claims to rescind Title VII settlement agreements. <em>See Heller v. United States, </em>776 F.2d 92, 98 n. 7 (3d Cir.1985) (\u201c[Government regulations alone, without the express intent of Congress, cannot waive sovereign immunity.\u201d). Section 1614.504 provides a complainant with certain internal and administrative remedies if she \u201cbelieves that the agency has failed to comply with the terms of a settlement agreement.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.504. Section 1614.401 authorizes appeals to the EEOC from \u201can agency\u2019s final action\u201d or \u201can agency\u2019s alleged noncompliance with a settlement agreement or final decision in accordance with \u00a7 1614.504.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1614.401(a), (e). Neither of these regulations mentions the possibility of filing a civil action in federal district court. The only regulation that does so, section 1614.407, sets forth filing deadlines for a complainant who \u201cis authorized under title VII, the ADEA and the Rehabilitation Act to file a civil action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1614.407. Section 1614.407 does not purport to authorize civil actions other than those already authorized by the various statutes. In short, the regulations cited by Thompson do not establish that the government has specifically consented to be sued for claims to rescind Title VII settlement agreements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number><em>See United States v. Transocean Air Lines, Inc., </em>386 F.2d 79, 81 (5th Cir.1967) (\u201cThe right [to sue the United States] can be acquired only by the specific consent of Congress, which is not present here.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">Finally, we disagree with Thompson\u2019s argument that public policy justifies the exercise of subject-matter jurisdiction. Thompson\u2019s general invocation of public policy does not allow us to contravene the well-settled principle that \u201c[a] waiver of the Federal Government\u2019s sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed in statutory text.\u201d <em>Lane, </em>518 U.S. at 192, 116 S.Ct. at 2096. Although we recognize that the EEOC twice informed her that she had a right to file a civil action appealing the EEOC\u2019s determination that the settlement agreement was valid and binding, an agency\u2019s actions cannot waive sovereign immunity. <em>See United States v. N.Y. Rayon Importing Co., </em>329 U.S. 654, 660, 67 S.Ct. 601, 604, 91 L.Ed. 577 (1947) (\u201cIt has long been settled that officers of the United States possess no power through their actions to waive an immunity of the United States or to confer jurisdiction on a court in the absence of some express provision by Congress.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">For the reasons discussed above, neither Title VII, its implementing regulations, nor public policy waive sovereign immunity so as to allow Thompson\u2019s contract rescission claim. Because Thompson does not present any other arguments that sovereign immunity has been waived, we conclude that the district court did not err in dismissing Thompson\u2019s claim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b899-7\">. Although Thompson argues that she merely followed the procedure outlined in <em>Jones v. Wynne, </em>266 Fed.Appx. 903, 905 (11th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>2008), her reliance on <em>Jones </em>is unavailing. Unpublished opinions such as <em>Jones </em>\"are not controlling authority and are persuasive only insofar as their legal analysis warrants.\u201d <em>Bonilla v. Baker Concrete Constr., Inc., </em>487 F.3d 1340, 1345 n. 7 (11th Cir.2007). Also, <em>Jones </em>is \"not persuasive because its facts are materially different from this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When a federal employee alleges breach of a Title VII settlement agreement, as did the plaintiff in <em>Jones, </em>federal regulations provide certain internal and administrative remedies. <em>See 29 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1614.504, 1614.401(e). However, the regulations are silent with respect to claims for <em>rescission </em>of Title VII settlement agreements. The <em>Jones </em>Court had no need or occasion to consider the proper procedure for claims like the one Thompson brought in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b900-21\">.
