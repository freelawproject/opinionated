Although the applicable advisory sentencing guidelines range was 37 to 46 months of imprisonment, the district court determined that a non-guidelines sentence was appropriate and sentenced Espinoza-Moran to 60 months of imprisonment. Espinoza-Moran argues on appeal that his sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-22\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), our review of sentences is for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.2005). We first determine whether the district court committed procedural error. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If there is no procedural error, we then \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-23\">As Espinoza-Moran does not suggest that the sentencing court committed any procedural errors in calculating or explaining the reasons for his sentence, our review is confined to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>See United States v. Brantley, 537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th </em>Cir.2008); <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. We find no merit in Espinoza-Moran\u2019s argument that the district court erred in finding that the guidelines range did not adequately account for his criminal history. <em>See Brantley, 537 </em>F.3d at 350. In light of the substantial criminal conduct not counted under the Sentencing Guidelines, Espinoza\u2019s 60-month sentence was within the discretion of the district court and was substantively reasonable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Brantley, </em>537 F.3d at 348-50; <em>United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 433-34, 440-41 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b454-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5tii Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
