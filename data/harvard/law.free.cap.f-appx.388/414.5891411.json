Garcia argues that his sentence is invalid because it was imposed under the formerly mandatory version of the Guidelines, based on facts that were neither admitted by him nor found by a jury. He also contends that the district court erred in enunciating an alternate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Garcia\u2019s assertion of sentencing error is meritorious. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He preserved this error by raising an objection to his sentence grounded in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). <em>See United States v. Garza, </em>429 F.3d 165, (5th Cir.2005). When, as is the case here, a <em>Booker </em>error has been preserved in the district court, we \u201cwill ordinarily vacate the sentence and remand, unless [this court] can say the error is harmless under Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 284 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Government has not met its \u201carduous\u201d burden of demonstrating \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that the Sixth Amendment <em>Booker </em>error did not affect the sentence that [Garcia] received.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 285, 287. Further, it would not be appropriate for us to impose the alternate sentence articulated by the district court. <em>See United States v. Story, </em>439 F.3d 226, 233 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Adair, </em>436 F.3d 520, 524, 527-29 (5th Cir.2006). Consequently, Garcia\u2019s sentence is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING. His convictions are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b440-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
