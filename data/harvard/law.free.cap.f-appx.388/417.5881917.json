Jenkins named as defendants Brad Livingston, the executive director of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice; Todd Foxworth, warden of the unit where Jenkins was housed; and Mark Dearing, a sergeant involved in Jenkins\u2019s disciplinary case. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Jenkins\u2019s complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) is reviewed de novo. <em>Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Jenkins first challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claim of deliberate indifference to his safety. Prison officials have a duty under the Eighth Amendment to protect inmates from violence at the hands of other prisoners. <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 833, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). However, not every injury inflicted by one inmate against another inmate rises to the level of a constitutional violation. <em>Id. </em>at 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970; <em>Horton v. Cockrell, </em>70 F.3d 397, 400 (5th Cir.1995). To establish a failure-to-proteet claim, an inmate must show that the conditions of his incarceration posed \u201ca substantial risk of serious harm\u201d and that prison officials were deliberately indifferent to his need for protection. <em>Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970. Because Jenkins did not allege in the district court that the defendants knew he would be attacked by Davis or knew he otherwise faced an excessive risk to his health or safety, the district court did not err in dismissing his claim of deliberate indifference to his safety. <em>See Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Second, Jenkins complains that the inadequate investigation of and response to Davis\u2019s alleged theft and assault resulted in the loss of Jenkins\u2019s fan and watch. The Fourteenth Amendment protects against the deprivation of one\u2019s property by state actors without due process of law. <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 536-37, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981), <em>overmled on other grounds by Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 330-31, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986). However, where the individuals acting under the col- or of state law infringe a property interest through \u201crandom and unauthorized\u201d acts, the existence of adequate postdeprivation state remedies satisfies procedural due process requirements by providing a means of redress for the property deprivation and, accordingly, justifies dismissal of a \u00a7 1983 claim that is based on the infringement. <em>Id. </em>at 537-43, 106 S.Ct. 662; <em>Augustine v. Doe, </em>740 F.2d 322, 327-28 (5th Cir.1984). Because Texas provides an adequate state postdeprivation remedy, the district court did not err in dismissing Jenkins\u2019s claim of property loss resulting from any deficiency in the defendants\u2019 response to Davis\u2019s conduct. <em>See Murphy v. Collins, </em>26 F.3d 541, 543-44 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Third, Jenkins contends that his procedural due process rights were violated with respect to his disciplinary conviction. Jenkins would be entitled to procedural due process with respect to his disciplinary proceeding if the hearing implicated a protected liberty interest. <em>See Ky. Dep\u2019t of Corr. v. Thompson, </em>490 U.S. 454, 460, 109 S.Ct. 1904, 104 L.Ed.2d 506 (1989). Jenkins alleged that his disciplinary conviction resulted in a punishment of 15 days of commissary restriction and one day of solitary confinement, as well as a two-year set off in his parole. None of those consequences implicated a protected liberty interest. <em>See Madison v. Parker, </em>104 F.3d 765, 768 (5th Cir.1997) (commissary restriction); <em>Luken v. Scott, </em>71 F.3d 192, 193 (5th Cir.1995) (solitary confinement); <em>Orellana v. Kyle, </em>65 F.3d 29, 32 (5th Cir.1995) (parole). Additionally, any property interest stemming from the loss of Jenkins\u2019s fan and watch was not implicated by his disciplinary conviction because, according to Jenkins\u2019s allegations, those items were stolen by Davis before Jenkins\u2019s disciplinary complaint was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Fourth, Jenkins contends that Fox-worth\u2019s response to the grievance Jenkins filed regarding the loss of his fan and watch constituted discrimination based on Jenkins\u2019s severe mental disorder. To the extent that Jenkins claims discrimination based on violation of a prison regulation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>we will not consider the claim because it is raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999). In any event, a claim based on a prison regulation violation would not be cognizable under \u00a7 1983 because \u201c[a] claim for relief under \u00a7 1983 must allege the deprivation of a right secured by the Constitution or the laws of the United States by a defendant acting under color of state law.\u201d <em>Calhoun v. Hargrove, </em>312 F.3d 730, 734 (5th Cir.2002). Insofar as Jenkins\u2019s contention may be liberally construed as pertaining to the district court\u2019s dismissal of his discrimination claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Jenkins has not briefed any argument challenging the reasons for the district court\u2019s decision and thus has failed to show that the district court erred in dismissing his ADA claim. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Fifth, Jenkins contends that the magistrate judge erred by not responding to his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. This contention is unavailing because the district court conducted a de novo review of Jenkins\u2019s objections to the report and recommendation and determined that they were without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Jenkins\u2019s contentions challenging the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 complaint are unavailing. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
