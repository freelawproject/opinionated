Common to all plaintiffs are claims that HUD improperly exempted the Housing Authority of New Orleans (HANO) from Louisiana civil service laws and that LCSC improperly acceded to HUD\u2019s action. As briefly explained below, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">We first address HUD\u2019s liability. HUD took control of HANO, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437d(g). Under federal law, when HUD takes over a housing authority under \u00a7 1437d(g), it may exempt the housing authority from state civil service rules if those rules \u201csubstantially impede[ ]\u201d HUD\u2019s efforts to rehabilitate the housing authority. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1437d(j)(3)(D)(i)(V). In April 2008, HUD exempted HANO from Louisiana\u2019s civil service rules. The plaintiffs say this action was arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, but the undisputed facts do not support this view. HUD\u2019s action was based on a memorandum that outlined various impediments to HANO\u2019s mission, focusing especially on compensation limits that kept HANO from hiring the employees it needed, such as project managers to rebuild housing stock depleted by Hurricane Katrina, and substantial administrative burdens involved in both retaining necessary employees and terminating low-performing or unneeded employees. This memorandum suffices to pass the deferential standard of review for agency action.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-14\">Turning to LCSC, once HUD properly exempted HANO from Louisiana\u2019s civil service laws, LCSC could no longer enforce those laws. Even assuming LCSC had a duty to try to convince HUD to change its decision to exempt HANO, the plaintiffs point to no evidence that such efforts would have succeeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-15\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b461-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b461-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
