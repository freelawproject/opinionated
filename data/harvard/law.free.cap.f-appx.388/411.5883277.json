Wang petitions this court to review the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denying his motion to reopen. This court applies a highly deferential abuse of discretion standard when reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Panjwani v. Gonzales, </em>401 F.3d 626, 632 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-22\">Wang asserts that he should be allowed to file a motion to reopen, despite the fact that he has exceeded the number limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>tions for such motions, because of changed country conditions in China. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The filing limitations on motions to reopen do not apply if, inter alia, the motion to reopen is \u201cbased on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2); <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 304 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Wang has failed to show that if he returns to China that he will be subject to persecution because of changed country conditions. See \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). Thus, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying his motion to reopen. <em>See Panjwani, </em>401 F.3d at 632. The petition is therefore DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b437-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under dle limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
