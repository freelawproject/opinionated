Because we lack jurisdiction over the Appellants\u2019 interlocutory appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>we deny the appeal and remand the case to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">This case arose out of the Defendants Appellee Houston\u2019s Finest\u2019s inability to pay for produce purchased from a number of its suppliers. On January 16, 2008, Plaintiff-Appellee Ruby Robinson Co., Inc. filed a complaint in the district court against Defendants Kalil Fresh Marketing, Inc., d/b/a Houston\u2019s Finest Produce Company (\u201cHouston\u2019s Finest\u201d), John Kalil, Bryan Herr, and Samuel Petro seeking payment for produce under the trust provisions of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (\u201cPACA\u201d), 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 499e(c). Counsel for Appellant Sun Valley Produce Company, Inc. (\u201cSun Valley\u201d) filed a Notice of Appearance on January 28, 2008, and a motion to intervene in the action on January 29, 2008. Because Houston\u2019s Finest had a limited pool of assets, all of the suppliers, including Appellants\u2019 counsel, stipulated to an order establishing a procedure for identifying, liquidating and distributing the PACA trust assets to the qualified PACA Trust Beneficiaries. The district court entered this Order on January 7, 2009. Pursuant to the district court\u2019s January 7th Order, all suppliers were required to file a PACA Proof of Claim on or before February 27, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">Appellants failed to file their PACA Proof of Claim. During the eight months that followed the February 27th deadline, forty-eight other suppliers filed their complaints, answers, objections and declarations, all of which were served on all parties (including Appellants\u2019 counsel). Then, on October 29, 2009, more than eight months after the deadline to file claims, the Appellants filed their Motion to Enlarge Time to file their PACA claim, as well as their objections to the distribution of PACA trust assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">On November 3, 2009, the district court denied Appellants\u2019 request to enlarge the time for filing a PACA claim and overruled Appellants\u2019 objections to distribution. Appellants immediately appealed from the rulings of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-11\">This Court is without jurisdiction over the Appellants\u2019 appeal. <em>See Pemberton v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>996 F.2d 789, 791 (5th Cir.1993) (\u201cFederal appellate jurisdiction is predicated on federal subject matter jurisdiction over the matter in dispute and the existence of a final judgment or otherwise appealable order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292, or Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b).\u201d). \u201cThe rule that only final decisions are ap-pealable is intended to promote judicial economy by preventing multiple appeals in the same case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consequently, this Court lacks jurisdiction over the Appellants\u2019 appeal because the appeal is not from a final order, but rather, arises from an unappealable interlocutory order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-12\">Appellants, however, assert that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(2) vests this Court with jurisdiction. Appellants\u2019 assertion is without merit since Congress limited Section 1292(a)(2)\u2019s jurisdictional grant to \u201c[ijnter-locutory orders appointing receivers, or refusing orders to wind up receiverships or to take steps to accomplish the purposes thereof, such as directing sales or other disposals of property.\u201d <em>See also, Warren v. Bergeron, </em>831 F.2d 101, 103 (5th Cir.1987) (\u201cCongress decided to make interlocutory orders appointing receivers appeal-able.\u201d). The district court\u2019s denial of Appellants\u2019 Motion to Enlarge Time does not constitute an order \u201cappointing [a] receive[r]\u201d nor can it be understood as \u201crefusing orders to wind up [a] receiver-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>shi[p].\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(2). This appeal is in no way related to a receivership.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Furthermore, Appellants cite no authority for the application of \u00a7 1292(a)(2)\u2019s appellate jurisdiction over district court orders denying motions to enlarge time to file objections or claims \u2014 and we know of none. Consequently, we decline the opportunity to extend \u00a7 1292(a)(2)\u2019s application beyond the boundaries clearly delineated by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">Accordingly, the Appellants\u2019 appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b976-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b976-22\">. We must examine the basis of our jurisdiction on our own motion if necessary. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b977-7\">. We note that the district court did not issue a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) certificate authorizing an interlocutory appeal for our discretionary acceptance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b978-7\">. We note that the Appellants do not argue that their appeal in any way involves a receivership.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
