He argues that the district court erred in enhancing his criminal history category pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(f) on the ground that three indecency with a child convictions in violation of Texas Penal Code \u00a7 21.11(a)(2)(A) were crimes of violence for which he received a single sentence. Zavala-Flores properly concedes that his argument is subject to review for plain error because he did not raise the issue at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">To establish plain error, Zavala-Flores must identify a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Whether the convictions at issue are crimes of violence within the meaning of \u00a7 4Al.l(f) is an issue of first impression in this circuit. Thus, if error occurred, it was not clear or obvious and does not warrant relief on plain error review. <em>See United States v. Ellis, </em>564 F.3d 370, 376-78 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 371, 175 L.Ed.2d 124 (2009); <em>Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b491-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
