Cavazos\u2019s initial brief failed to attempt to demonstrate error in the district court\u2019s determination that he was without standing to sue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Cavazos\u2019s failure to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis on this issue constitutes a failure to appeal that ruling. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). As are other litigants, a pro se party is required to brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Consequently, we deem Cava-zos\u2019s appeal to have been abandoned. His effort to address standing in his reply brief comes too late, as we will not consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>426 F.3d 301, 304 n. 2 (5th Cir.2005) (\u201cArguments raised for the first time in a reply brief, even by pro se litigants ... are waived.\u201d) Accordingly, the judgment below is affirmed; the pending motion to strike Cavazos\u2019s record excerpts is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">AFFIRMED; MOTION TO STRIKE RECORD EXCERPTS DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b425-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-8\">. Cavazos contended only that a \"Notice of International Commercial Claim in Admiralty Administrative Remedy\u201d he sent to the defendants around the time this case was removed constitutes proof of his claimed ownership in the property due to \"estoppel by acquiescence.\u201d To the extent that this constitutes a challenge to the district court's standing determination, it is frivolous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b425-23\">. In any event, Cavazos's reply brief is wholly lacking in any legal citation, relying instead on quoting Latin maxims which in no way address the specific reasoning of the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
