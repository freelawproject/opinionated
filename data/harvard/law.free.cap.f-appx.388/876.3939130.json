Shorter also appeals his sentence of 328 months in prison, and Volcy appeals his sentence of 97 months. Baptiste and Volcy were found guilty of one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute marijuana, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(b)(1)(A), and one count of possession with intent to distribute 100 kilograms or more of marijuana, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B). They were arrested when police, acting on a tip from an informant, stopped them driving a tractor-trailer loaded with over 700 kilograms of marijuana that was concealed behind boxes of frozen cookie dough. Shorter, the ringleader of the operation and the intended recipient of that shipment and many others like it, was found guilty of one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute marijuana, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(b)(1)(A), and one count of possession with intent to distribute 1,000 or more kilograms of marijuana, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(D). We affirm Shorter\u2019s convictions and all three defendants\u2019 sentences. We find no error in the convictions of Baptiste and Volcy, but remand for the limited purpose of correcting clerical errors in their judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-13\">Baptiste, who was driving the truck, contends that the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress the marijuana found in it. He argues that the police did not have justification for the initial traffic stop, that they unreasonably prolonged the stop, and that they exceeded the scope of his consent to search the truck by cutting into a cellophane-wrapped package to verify that it contained marijuana.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-14\">The district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress evidence is reviewed as a mixed question of law and fact. <em>See United States v. Perkins, </em>348 F.3d 965, 969 (11th Cir.2003). We review the court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its application of the law to the facts <em>de novo. Id. </em>\u201cThe facts are construed in favor of the party that prevailed below.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-15\">A confidential informant told DEA agents that a large shipment of marijuana was due to arrive by truck at Shorter\u2019s warehouse. He told the agents that previous deliveries had come in a white trailer pulled by a blue tractor, but he was not sure it would be the same truck this time. The agents arranged with the Florida Highway Patrol to intercept the truck on its way to the warehouse. At the appointed time, a state police officer waited on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>interstate where the truck was expected to exit. The informant talked to Volcy on a cell phone, instructing him and Baptiste how to get off the highway and find their way the last few miles to the warehouse, while simultaneously recording their conversation and relaying the truck\u2019s current location to authorities. Although Baptiste\u2019s truck was a different color than the one previously described, it was the only tractor-trailer the officer saw on the road at the right time. The officer saw the truck take the correct exit and then make several turns that appeared to match the informant\u2019s directions. Noting the truck was drifting outside of its lane, the officer pulled it over to write a traffic citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">A traffic stop is a \u201cseizure\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. <em>United States v. Purcell, </em>236 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2001). Police may stop a vehicle and briefly detain its occupants in order to investigate a reasonable suspicion that they are involved in criminal activity. <em>See Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 19-21, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1879-80, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968); <em>United States v. Lindsey, </em>482 F.3d 1285, 1290 (11th Cir.2007). To justify such a detention, the police must \u201cbe able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\u201d Ter<em>ry, </em>392 U.S. at 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1880. \u201cReasonable suspicion\u201d is determined from the totality of the circumstances and from the collective knowledge of the officers involved in the stop. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>876 F.2d 1521, 1524 (11th Cir.1989). The reasonable suspicion standard \u201cis considerably less demanding than proof of wrongdoing by a preponderance of the evidence and less than probable cause,\u201d but nonetheless requires officers to \u201carticulate facts which provide some minimal, objective justification for the stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Authorities may rely on an informant\u2019s tip as the basis for reasonable suspicion, but there should be sufficient corroboration, such as an ability to predict the defendant\u2019s future actions. <em>See United States v. Lee, </em>68 F.3d 1267, 1271 (11th Cir.1995) (citing <em>Alabama v. White, </em>496 U.S. 325, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 110 L.Ed.2d 301 (1990)). Officers may also stop a vehicle upon observing probable cause for a traffic violation, even if their real purpose is to investigate some other crime. <em>See Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 813, 819, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 1774, 1777, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996); <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>172 F.3d 775, 778 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">Baptiste argues that the officer lacked a reasonable suspicion that his truck was the one identified by the informant because it was the wrong color, and that the officer lacked probable cause to pull him over for a traffic citation because he had not actually violated Florida\u2019s lane usage statute. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.089. We need not construe the meaning of Florida\u2019s Uniform Traffic Control Law. Regardless of whether there was a traffic violation, the officer performed a legal stop because he had a reasonable suspicion, as a result of the informant\u2019s real-time conversation with Volcy and his accurate prediction of the truck\u2019s movements, that the tractor-trailer driven by Baptiste was transporting marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">After the officer pulled over the truck, he saw Volcy attempting to disassemble a cell phone. Both defendants seemed nervous, and they gave inconsistent answers to his questions about their destination. The officer also observed that the refrigerated trailer was not set at the correct temperature for the frozen foodstuffs the defendants told him they were hauling. He put Baptiste and Volcy in the back of his car while he called for a drug-sniffing dog.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the dog and its handler had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>to be brought in from a neighboring town, this prolonged the duration of the stop by about twenty minutes. Once a legitimate traffic stop is made, it must last no longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop. <em>United States v. Pruitt, </em>174 F.3d 1215, 1220 (11th Cir.1999). Baptiste argues twenty minutes was too long to detain him for the purpose of wilting a traffic citation. Perhaps, but the officer had reasonable suspicion that the truck was carrying a large shipment of marijuana, and calling for a drug-sniffing dog was necessary to confirm or dispel that suspicion. The time it took for the dog and its handler to arrive was not unreasonably long. <em>See Simmons, </em>172 F.3d at 778 (detention of 17 to 26 minutes while officer checked for outstanding warrants was not unreasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">When the dog arrived, it alerted outside the front end of the trailer. The officer told Baptiste he suspected the presence of marijuana and asked for consent to search the truck. Baptiste agreed to the search. Inside the trailer the officer found numerous packages wrapped in cellophane and duct tape that were concealed behind boxes of frozen cookie dough. He cut into one of those packages and confirmed that it contained marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Baptiste argues that the scope of his consent to search the truck did not extend to permission to cut into a wrapped package. A search may be unreasonable, even when an individual consents to that search, \u201cwhen an officer does not conform to the limitations imposed by the person giving consent.\u201d <em>United States v. Zapata, </em>180 F.3d 1237, 1242 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cWhen an individual provides a general consent to search, without expressly limiting the terms of his consent, the search is constrained by the bounds of reasonableness: what a police officer could reasonably interpret the consent to encompass.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Permission to search an area for narcotics \u201cmay be construed as permission to search any compartment or container within the specified area where narcotics may be found,\u201d but officers may not intentionally damage the places or things to be searched. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>949 F.2d 1117, 1119 (11th Cir.1992). The permissible scope of the search generally includes any area where the item in question may be found, even if the search requires \u201cseparate acts of entry or opening,\u201d including \u201cforcing open locked compartments or containers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1120-21 (consent to search warehouse reasonably included consent to search locked trunk of car parked inside it, even though police had to force it open).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">The officer did not exceed the scope of Baptiste\u2019s consent by cutting into the package, because it could have contained the drugs for which Baptiste had given consent to search. <em>See Martinez, </em>949 F.2d at 1119. By that point the dog had already detected the smell of marijuana, and the officer had recognized the wrapped bundles as typical of the packaging often used by drug smugglers. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of Baptiste\u2019s motion to suppress and we affirm his and Volcy\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-13\">Shorter, who is black, argues that his Sixth Amendment right to a jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community was violated because the venire did not include a representative number of African-Americans.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We review <em>de novo </em>con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>stitutional challenges to the jury selection process based on the fair cross-section requirement. <em>United States v. Grisham, </em>63 F.3d 1074, 1077 (11th Cir.1995). The Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant the right to be tried by a jury \u201cdrawn from a fair cross-section of the community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1078. A defendant claiming a violation of that right makes a <em>prima facie </em>case by showing (1) that the underrepresented group is distinctive, (2) that the group\u2019s representation in the venire is \u201cnot fair and reasonable in x-elation to the number of such persons in the community,\u201d and (3) that the underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion in the jury-selection process. <em>Id. </em>Failure to establish any of these elements is fatal to a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment challenge. <em>See United States v. Clarke, </em>562 F.3d 1158, 1163 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">We find Shorter\u2019s claim to be wholly without merit. When the venire was seated, Shorter\u2019s counsel said the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-5\">Your Honor, on behalf of my client, who is African-American, and the other two co-defendants who are African-American, we\u2019re making a challenge that the venire that is not a representative example of the community, nor is it statistically proportionate to African-Americans here. We believe our client may be prejudiced by the present venire. And for the record I\u2019m making that objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">The court responded: \u201cYou have it for the record.\u201d Voir dire and jury selection then went forward with no further discussion of the matter. Shorter contends that the district court erroneously denied his objection and prevented him from presenting evidence to support it. However, the record does not show that Shorter ever tried to offer any such evidence. He objected to the composition of the jury pool but without any evidence to support his objection. It was Shorter\u2019s burden to make a <em>prima facie </em>showing of underrepresentation and systematic exclusion, and his failure to even attempt to do so is not error on the part of the court. <em>See Clarke, </em>562 F.3d at 1163; <em>Grisham, </em>63 F.3d at 1077.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">Shorter next argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions. We review <em>de novo </em>the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201cviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>473 F.3d 1137, 1142 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cThe jury gets to make any credibility choices, and we will assume that they made them all in the way that supports the verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he issue is not whether a jury reasonably could have acquitted but whether it reasonably could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The testimony of a co-conspirator, even if uncorroborated, is sufficient to support a conviction unless it is \u201cincredible or otherwise insubstantial\u201d on its face. <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>248 F.3cl 1065, 1093-94 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">Two co-conspirators testified extensively about the marijuana distribution enterprise and Shorter\u2019s leading role in it. Their testimony was corroborated by ledgers documenting some of the shipments, by marijuana actually seized from some of Shorter\u2019s associates, and by Shorter\u2019s own words in several phone conversations secretly taped by a government informant. The evidence proved that Shorter set up a connection with a marijuana supplier in Arizona, and recruited drivers and couriers to transport drugs and cash between there and Florida. On one occasion, Shorter chartered a private jet and flew west carrying duffel bags filled with cash. Although he did so using an alias, the jet\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>pilot identified him. Shorter supervised other associates who warehoused the marijuana at several locations in and around Tampa, distributed it to local dealers, and collected money owed. He took the lion\u2019s share of the proceeds, using some of the money to buy expensive sports cars. After police seized 80 pounds of marijuana from one of the warehouses, Shorter was caught tape asking the informant what had happened to it and demanding payment for it. Even though Shorter did not handle the marijuana himself, the evidence at trial established his constructive possession by showing his \u201cownership, dominion, or control\u201d over it and over the premises on which it was concealed. <em>See United States v. Montes-Cardenas, </em>746 F.2d 771, 778 (11th Cir.1984). The evidence was more than sufficient for the jury to find Shorter guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on both the conspiracy and substantive possession counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Shorter also contends that the evidence did not support the district court\u2019s decision at sentencing to hold him responsible for more than 10,000 kilograms of marijuana. The district court accepted the PSR\u2019s calculation that Shorter had distributed 13,-483.7 kilograms. This amount gave Shorter a base offense level of 36. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(2) (more than 10,000 but less than 30,000 kilograms of marijuana).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">The district court\u2019s determination of the quantity of drugs used to establish a base offense level for sentencing purposes is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Simpson, </em>228 F.3d 1294, 1298 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cWhen a defendant objects to a factual finding that is used in calculating his guideline sentence, such as drug amount, the government bears the burden of establishing the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1296 (11th Cir.2005). When the quantity of drugs seized does not reflect the scale of the offense, the district court must approximate the amount attributable to the defendant, and \u201cmay base its computation on evidence showing the average frequency and amount of a defendant\u2019s drug sales over a given period of time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, the defendant\u2019s sentence must be based on \u201cfair, accurate, and conservative\u201d estimates of drug quantity, not mere speculation. <em>Id. </em>For sentencing purposes, a member of a drug conspiracy is liable not only for his own acts, but also for the reasonably foreseeable acts of co-conspirators in furtherance of the activity the defendant agreed to undertake. <em>United States v. Ismond, </em>993 F.2d 1498, 1499 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">The evidence at trial established that the conspirators received shipments averaging at least 1,000 pounds of marijuana per month over a two-year period, which would add up to 24,000 pounds or 10,886 kilograms. This estimate is conservative, considering that two co-conspirators testified that an average shipment weighed between 1,200 and 1,500 pounds, and the fact that the marijuana seized from Baptiste and Volcy\u2019s truck weighed 1,561 pounds. In addition, the estimate does not include six or seven shipments of marijuana delivered in 1000-pound crates by air freight. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in holding Shorter responsible for more than 10,000 kilograms of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">The district court also imposed a four-level enhancement on Shorter under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) for being an \u201corganizer or leader\u201d of a criminal activity involving five or more participants. This gave him a total offense level of 40. Shorter argues the enhancement was error because he was merely a supplier of marijuana and not a leader of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>A district court\u2019s upward adjustment of a defendant\u2019s offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 is a finding of fact reviewed only for clear error. <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>287 F.3d 1053, 1055 <em>(11th </em>Cir.2002). \u201c[T]he ultimate determination of role in the offense is ... a fundamentally factual determination entitled to due deference.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 938 (11th Cir.1999). Factors to consider in determining whether the enhancement applies are: \u201c(1) exercise of decision-making authority, (2) nature of participation in the commission of the offense, (3) recruitment of accomplices, (4) claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, (5) degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, (6) nature and scope of the illegal activity, and (7) degree of con-tool and authority exercised over others.\u201d <em>United States v. Rendon, </em>354 F.3d 1320, 1331-32 (11th Cir.2003); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. n. 4. The government bears the burden of proving the defendant\u2019s aggravating role by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Yeager, </em>331 F.3d 1216, 1226 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">The evidence supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that Shorter was an organizer or leader of the criminal conspiracy. He chartered a jet to fly bags of cash across the country, arranged for shipments of marijuana, supervised others who handled the marijuana directly, and took what he wanted from the proceeds. Two co-conspirators testified at trial that Shorter called the shots, and the evidence supports their testimony. The jury heard recorded phone conversations in which Shorter gave various orders to a co-conspirator, at one point telling him to pay a home visit to the mother of a buyer who owed him money in order to pressure him to pay. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err by enhancing Shorter\u2019s sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">Shorter finally contends that the district court failed to comply with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1) when it sentenced him to 328 months\u2019 imprisonment, the midpoint in the advisory guideline range of 292-365 months, without explaining its reason for choosing that particular sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">When a district court sentences a defendant within the guidelines, and the sentence range exceeds 24 months, the court must state its reason for imposing a sentence at a particular point within the range. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>438 F.3d 1272, 1274 (11th Cir.2006). In doing so, the district court should \u201ctailor its comments to show that the sentence imposed is appropriate, given the factors to be considered as set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176, 1181 (11th Cir.2006). However, there is no requirement that the court \u201cincant the specific language used in the guidelines\u201d or that it expressly discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 1182. In <em>Bonilla, </em>we upheld a sentence when the district court allowed the parties to offer argument as to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, heard the defendant\u2019s statement of remorse, stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and stated that the sentence was \u201cneither greater nor lesser than necessary to achieve the statutory purposes of sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the district court heard arguments from the attorneys, heard from Shorter himself, expressly acknowledged that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and concluded that the sentence imposed was \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory purpose of sentencing.\u201d That is enough to comply with \u00a7 3553(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">Volcy argues that the district court erred by not giving him a minor-role re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>duction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3) and 3B1.2 because he was less culpable than Baptiste in transporting the marijuana across the country. He describes his role as a \u201cmere passengei\u2019\u201d who only went along \u201cfor the ride\u201d and had no idea that the tractor-trailer was hauling marijuana. That claim is belied by the conversation recorded between him and Baptiste while they sat in the back of a police cruiser and watched the officers search the truck. In that conversation Voley worried that the police would see \u201cthe thing\u201d if they went far enough into the trailer, asked Baptiste how many boxes he had stacked on top of it, and exclaimed when he saw the drug-sniffing dog that they were \u201cout of luck.\u201d He also told Baptiste that he destroyed the memory chip from his cell phone by smashing it with his teeth.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">A defendant may receive a four-level reduction in his base offense level if his role in the offense can be described as \u201cminimal,\u201d a two-level reduction if his role can be described as \u201cminor,\u201d or a three-level reduction for cases falling in between. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. A \u201cminimal\u201d participant is one who is \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 4. The four-level reduction is intended to be used \u201cinfrequently.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A \u201cminor\u201d participant is one who is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as \u201cminimal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 5. The district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s offense role is a question of fact we review only for clear error. <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>175 F.3d at 938. The court \u201cis not required to make any specific findings other than the ultimate determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 940. The defendant, as proponent of the downward adjustment, bears the burden of establishing his minor role by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>175 F.3d at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">Under <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>the district court\u2019s determination is informed by a two-part analysis of the defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>See Id. </em>at 940-45. First, the court measures \u201cthe defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which [he] was held accountable at sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945. Where the relevant conduct attributed to a defendant is identical to his actual conduct, he cannot prove that he is entitled to a minor role adjustment simply by pointing to some broader criminal scheme in which he was a minor participant but for which he was not held accountable. <em>Id. </em>at 941. Thus, \u201cwhen a drug courier\u2019s relevant conduct is limited to [his] own act of importation, a district court may legitimately conclude that the courier played an important or essential role in the importation of those drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 942-43. The first prong of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>analysis is often dispositive of the issue. <em>See Id. </em>at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">In considering the second prong, the district court may measure the defendant\u2019s culpability as compared to other participants in the crime. <em>Id. </em>at 944. However, the court may only consider those who also participated in the same relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe conduct of participants in any larger criminal conspiracy is irrelevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Even if a defendant\u2019s role is \u201cless than that of other participants engaged in the same conduct,\u201d he might not be entitled to a reduction because, in some cases, there are no \u201cminor or minimal participants.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">The district court did not clearly err in refusing a minor-role reduction, because the record demonstrates that Volcy\u2019s role in the offense was identical to the relevant conduct for which he was held accountable at sentencing and comparable to the role of Baptiste in the same conduct. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 941-44. Therefore, Volcy\u2019s reliance on his relatively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>small role in the broader criminal enterprise is to no avail. <em>See Id. </em>The court calculated Volcy\u2019s offense level based on only the amount of marijuana found in the truck when he was arrested, not the much larger amount attributed to the conspiracy as a whole. Volcy fails to show how he was less culpable than anyone else in the relevant conduct of smuggling that load of marijuana. Both Volcy and Baptiste rode with the shipment all the way from its origin in Arizona, and they took turns driving. Both men took the stand and denied knowing anything about the marijuana in the truck, and the jury believed neither of them. Accordingly, this is a situation where there are no \u201cminor or minimal\u201d participants, <em>Id. </em>at 944, and we affirm Vol-cy\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">viil</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">We note <em>stia sponte </em>that the amended judgments against Baptiste and Volcy each contain two clerical errors. As to Count 1, the jury found both defendants responsible for 100 kilograms or more of marijuana, but the judgments incorrectly state that it was 1,000 kilograms or more. As to Count 3, the judgments indicate both defendants were found guilty of violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, the conspiracy statute, but Count 3 was not charged as a conspiracy. These mistakes did not appear in the presentence reports, and the district court made no error in calculating the sentencing ranges under the guidelines. Nevertheless, we vacate and remand to the district court for the limited purpose of correcting the errors in Baptiste\u2019s and Volcy\u2019s judgments. <em>See United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 822 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b905-10\">. Volcy, who rode in the truck with Baptiste, attempts to adopt Baptiste's argument on the motion to suppress the marijuana. Volcy is not entitled to a ruling on the merits of that motion because in the district court he did not file a pretrial motion to suppress nor join Baptiste's motion, and he therefore failed to preserve the issue. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(C), 12(e); <em>United States v. Nix, </em>438 F.3d 1284, 1288 (11th Cir.2006) (defendant failed to preserve challenge to search warrant by filing pretrial motion to suppress).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b906-5\">.
