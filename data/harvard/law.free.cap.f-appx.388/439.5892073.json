The district court sentenced Saveli to 71 months on Count One, 60 months on Count Two, to run concurrent, and 20 years on Count Three, to run consecutively to Counts One and Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-21\">Saveli first contends that the district court clearly erred in denying his request for a minor role adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A district court may decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by two levels if it finds that the defendant was a minor participant in the offense. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A \u00a7 3B1.2 reduction applies only when a defendant is substantially less culpable than the average participant. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203-04 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cIt is not enough that a defendant does less than other par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>ticipants; in order to qualify as a minor participant, a defendant must have been peripheral to the advancement of the illicit activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cA defendant has the burden of showing that he is entitled to the downward adjustment.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>242 F.3d 593, 597 (5th Cir.2001). Whether the defendant is a minor participant is a factual determination that we review for clear error. <em>Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">By Saveli\u2019s own admissions, he entered into the conspiracy with his codefendants knowing that the object of the conspiracy was to commit bank robbery. As reflected by the presentence report, which the district court was free to accept as reliable evidence, <em>see United States v. Vital, </em>68 F.3d 114, 120 (5th Cir.1995), Saveli furthered the object of that conspiracy by arming himself and firing at one of the guards during the course of the attempted robbery. Saveli\u2019s participation was not peripheral, but was essential, to the advancement of the illicit activity, <em>see Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 204, and was clearly \u201ccoextensive with the conduct for which he was held accountable.\u201d <em>See Garcia, </em>242 F.3d at 598-99. The district court did not clearly err in denying the role adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2. <em>See Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203 &amp; n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Also without merit is Saveli\u2019s challenge to the 20-year sentence as to Count Three, which was the result of an upward variance from the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008). Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), our review of sentences is for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.2005). We first determine whether the district court committed procedural error. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If there is no procedural error, we then \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Saveli\u2019s assertion that the district court committed procedural error by failing to consider all of the \u00a7 3553 factors and by focusing on the seriousness of his offense as justification for the variance is belied by the record. While the district court emphasized the seriousness of the offense and the injuries to guard, the court stated multiple times that it had considered all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707. Likewise without merit is Saveli\u2019s argument that the district court could not rely on factors already encompassed within the guidelines to support a non-guidelines sentence. <em>See Brantley, </em>537 F.3d at 350. The district court committed no procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">Nor was Saveli\u2019s 20-year sentence substantively unreasonable. The 20-year sentence reflected the seriousness of Saveli\u2019s offense, the need to promote respect for the law, the need to provide just punishment, and the need to protect the public from future crimes. The sentence imposed \u201cwas reasonable under the totality of the relevant statutory factors.\u201d <em>Brantley, </em>537 F.3d at 349 (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b466-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
