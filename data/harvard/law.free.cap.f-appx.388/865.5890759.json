On appeal, Lomax argues that the district court erred in dismissing her claims against the may- or, police department, and officers arising out of her arrest for propping a stereo on top of two dairy cases. She was not the registered owner of the cases\u2019 name or mark, which constitutes a violation of Florida Statute Section 506.508. She alleges that the officers mocked her arrest by taking pictures of themselves with the dairy cases. The charges against Lomax were dropped when the arresting officers, Garcia and Baralt, failed to show up at Lomax\u2019s hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-22\">Although the conduct of which Lomax complains is, if true, unfortunate, her alleged victimization at the hands of the police cannot surmount the officers\u2019 qualified immunity defense because, under the aforementioned Florida statute, they had probable cause to arrest her.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>district court did not err in dismissing the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b891-16\">.
