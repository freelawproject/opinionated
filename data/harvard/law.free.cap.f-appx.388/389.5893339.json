On August 5, 2008, Miller filed suit claiming that on August 6, 2007 \u201ctwo unknown\u201d deputies unlawfully arrested him and used excessive force. His complaint named Sheriff Mancuso, \u201ctwo unknown deputies,\u201d and \u201cXYZ Insurance Company.\u201d On March 10, 2009, Miller identified Deputies Cloud and Aymond and St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Company in a motion to amend his complaint. The district court dismissed the claim against Sheriff Mancu-so, a ruling that Miller does not appeal. Following Sheriff Mancuso\u2019s dismissal, the remaining three defendants moved to dismiss, asserting that Miller had not filed timely claims against them. The district court granted the motion to dismiss and Reverend Miller appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Section 1983 does not provide for a statute of limitations; rather, the forum state\u2019s personal injury statute of limitation applies. <em>Moore v. McDonald, </em>30 F.3d 616, 620 (5th Cir.1994). In Louisiana, there is a one-year prescription period for delictual actions. <em>See Elzy v. Roberson, </em>868 F.2d 793, 794 (5th Cir.1989); La. Civ.Code Ann. art. 3492. Filing suit against one alleged tortfeasor interrupts prescription against all joint tortfeasors. La. Civ.Code Ann. art. 2324(c). However, \u201cwhere no liability is found on the part of a timely sued alleged tortfeasor, then prescription is not interrupted as to untimely sued tortfeasors, as no joint or solidary obligation exists.\u201d <em>Gallina v. Hero Lands Company, </em>859 So.2d 758, 767 (La.App.Ct. 4th Cir.2003). \u201cPrescription is not interrupted as to an actual defendant when only a fictitious defendant is named in a petition, unless prescription is interrupted by some other means.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at n. 6 (quoting <em>Hill v. Shell Oil Co., </em>760 So.2d 511, 512-13 (La.Ct.App. 5th Cir.2003)). Thus, the dismissal of Sheriff Mancuso eliminated his status as an anchor for interruption of prescription against the deputies.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">Miller alternatively asserts that his March 10, 2009 amendment to his complaint should relate back to his initial pleading on August 5, 2008, which would make his suit timely against the deputies. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c) allows an amendment to a complaint to relate back to the date the original complaint was filed. Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c). However, Rule 15(c) \u201cis meant to allow an amendment changing the name of a party to relate back to the original complaint <em>only if the change is the result of an error, such as a misnomer or misidentification.\u201d Jacobsen v. Osborne, </em>133 F.3d 315, 320 (5th Cir.1998) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). \u201c[Fjailing to identify individual defendants cannot be characterized as a mistake.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Barrow v. Wethersfield Police Dept., </em>66 F.3d 466, 469 (2d Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The record shows that Reverend Miller knew the identities of the \u201ctwo unknown deputies\u201d long before he filed his initial complaint. In a deposition, Miller revealed that he learned Deputy Aymond\u2019s name a couple days after the incident and learned Deputy Cloud\u2019s name on the night of the incident. Further, Miller\u2019s wife filed a citizen\u2019s complaint with the Calca-sieu Parish Sheriffs Office of Internal Affairs and specifically named Deputies Cloud and Aymond on August 13, 2007, one week after the lawful arrest. Consequently, there was no mistake about their identities and no reason to either interrupt prescription under Louisiana law or allow the March 10, 2009 amendment to relate back to the original complaint. The district court correctly held that Miller\u2019s claims are untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b416-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
