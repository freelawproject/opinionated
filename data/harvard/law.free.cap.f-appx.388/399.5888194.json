(\u201cWeeks\u201d) and Atlantic Sounding Co., Inc. (\u201cAtlantic\u201d) appeal from the district court\u2019s award of damages to Everett for injuries suffered onboard the E.W. ELLEFSEN. We affirm the district court in part, reverse in part, and remand this case for correction of the judgment entered for Everett.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">In April 2007, Atlantic hired Everett to work as an oiler onboard the E.W. EL-LEFSEN, a dredge vessel owned by Weeks, Atlantic\u2019s parent company. On August 5, 2007, Everett slipped while moving a hose onboard the vessel and injured his tailbone and lower back. Less than a month later, Everett filed suit against Atlantic and Weeks, claiming that defendants\u2019 negligence and the unseaworthiness of the E.W. ELLEFSEN caused his injury. He sought damages under general maritime law and the Jones Act, <em>see </em>46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30104 (2006), and payment of maintenance and cure. Generally, after an accident, a seaman\u2019s employer must pay maintenance and cure, or in other words, \u201cfood and lodging of the kind and quality [the injured seaman] would have received aboard the ship\u201d and reimbursement for \u201cmedical expenses actually incurred.\u201d <em>Boudreaux v. United States, </em>280 F.3d 461, 468 (5th Cir.2002). Everett also sought damages for lost wages, loss of future earning capacity, and payment of attorney\u2019s fees for defendants\u2019 failure to pay for any maintenance and cure other than his visit to the emergency room immediately following the accident. After his emergency room visit, Everett received additional medical treatment for his back injury, and he alleges that the injury prevents him from returning to heavy labor similar to that he performed before the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-16\">After a bench trial, the district court found that Everett\u2019s injury resulted from defendants\u2019 negligence and the consequent unseaworthiness of the E.W. ELLEF-SEN, but that 20% of the fault for the accident could be attributed to Everett\u2019s own negligence. It therefore awarded Everett $50,000 for past pain and suffering, but reduced the award by 20% to $40,000. It also awarded Everett maintenance and cure. An employer\u2019s obligation to pay maintenance and cure terminates when an injured seamen attains maximum cure, i.e., \u201c \u2018where it is probable that further treatment will result in no betterment in the claimant\u2019s condition.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 468 (quoting <em>Rashidi v. Am. President Lines, </em>96 F.3d 124, 128 (5th Cir.1996)). The district court found that Everett attained maximum cure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>on November 7, 2007, when he began performing general carpentry work. As such, the district court awarded Everett maintenance payments of $20 per day from the date of his accident until November 7 and a cure payment covering the cost of his medical expenses up to November 7. The court docked Everett\u2019s cure award for his contributory negligence, reducing it from $6,796.75 to $5,437.40, but did not similarly limit Everett\u2019s maintenance award.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Everett now appeals the district court\u2019s determination that he reached maximum cure on November 7, 2007, the court\u2019s decision not to award reimbursement for medical expenses incurred past that date, its failure to award damages for lost wages and his future loss of earning capacity, and its limitation of his cure award for contributory negligence. Conversely, Weeks and Atlantic appeal the district court\u2019s award of any maintenance and cure at all, as they argue that Everett\u2019s failure to disclose his status as HIV positive should bar any award. After reviewing the evidence, we find that it would waste judicial resources to write a lengthy opinion, as our opinion would merely restate the analysis already provided in the district court\u2019s excellent opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment, with one exception. We find that the court erred in reducing Everett\u2019s cure award for his contributory negligence, since \u201ca seaman\u2019s negligence does not negate a shipowner\u2019s duty to pay maintenance and cure.\u201d <em>Bertram v. Freeport McMoran, Inc., </em>35 F.3d 1008, 1013 (5th Cir.1994). It appears that the district court\u2019s error was inadvertent, as the court itself acknowledged that an employer\u2019s obligation to provide maintenance and cure arises independently \u201cof any other source of recovery for the seaman,\u201d <em>id., </em>and that therefore a seaman or employer\u2019s negligence is not at issue in such circumstances. <em>See Brister v. AWI, Inc., </em>946 F.2d 350, 360 (5th Cir.1991). That said, we have previously recognized that \u201ca seaman clearly can receive only one recovery for his medical expenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 361. As a result, a seamen is not entitled to maintenance and cure that duplicates other awarded damages. However, in this case, it does not appear that the district court\u2019s award of $40,000 in damages covered any of Everett\u2019s medical expenses, which would justify limiting his cure award. The district court characterized its award of $40,000 as remedying Everett\u2019s past pain and .suffering, while it stated that \u201c[w]ith respect to the Plaintiffs benefits for cure, ... the Court finds that an award of $6,796.75 for past medical expenses is appropriate.\u201d Consequently, the district court\u2019s limitation of its cure award to $5,437.40 was erroneous; instead, Everett is entitled to cure award of $6,796.75, without reduction for his contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">Consequently, the district court is AFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part, and this case is REMANDED for correction of the judgment entered in favor of Everett.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b426-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b427-7\">. In its opinion, the district court also reduced Everett\u2019s maintenance award to account for his contributory negligence. However, in the judgment entered by the district court, the court did not reduce the maintenance award for contributory negligence. As will be explained below, maintenance awards generally may not be reduced for contributory negligence. The district court\u2019s judgment properly corrected the erroneous limitation of Everett's maintenance award in its opinion, but did not similarly correct the opinion's limitation of Everett\u2019s cure award.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
