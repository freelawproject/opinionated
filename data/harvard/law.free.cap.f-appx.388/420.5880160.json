The district court granted summary judgment for the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-21\">The district court pointed out that the person who got the promotion was black, as is Hubert. The successful candidate was ranked first by the staff, was more experienced, and was the only candidate who met the educational requirements for the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>On appeal, Hubert tenders only a five-page brief. The first issue he raises is that there are genuine fact issues that should preclude summary judgment. Hubert does not state what the contested facts are.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The second issue is that the district court abused its discretion in denying Hubert\u2019s motion to alter or amend the judgment. That motion, however, was accompanied by an affidavit that did not raise a fact issue with regard to the relative qualifications of Hubert and the successful candidate. Moreover, Hubert filed no opposition to the motion for summary judgment, waiting until it had been granted before filing his affidavit along with the motion to alter or amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">This appeal is without merit, and the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b446-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
