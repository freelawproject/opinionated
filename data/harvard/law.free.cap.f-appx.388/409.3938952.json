Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-23\">Guedea argues that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence for possession of a dangerous weapon under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). The record shows that Guedea sold and delivered drugs for his brother, Luis Guedea Veloz, and collected money owed to Veloz for drugs. Guedea was involved in an extensive drug conspiracy that involved large quantities of drugs and money. Numerous weapons were found at locations where the drug activities had taken place. Ammunition was found at a location where Guedea had sold drugs and collected drug money owed to Veloz.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-24\">In light of these facts, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Veloz\u2019s possession of a dangerous weapon was reasonably foreseeable to Guedea. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 765-66 (5th Cir.2008). Consequently, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b435-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
