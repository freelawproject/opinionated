(\u201cUnderwriter Defendants\u201d) (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d). The Court has jurisdiction of the action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">Plaintiffs claims are based upon purchases of Focus Media\u2019s American Depositary Shares (\u201cFMCN Shares\u201d) during Focus Media\u2019s November 2007 public secondary offering (the \u201cSecondary Offering\u201d) and purchases of FMCN Shares in the marketplace for the period beginning on September 27, 2007, and ending on November 19, 2007. The principal factual predicate for the claims is the decline in the Company\u2019s share price following the Company\u2019s November 19, 2007, announcement of its financial results for its most recently concluded quarter, including an allegedly disappointing gross margin figure. Defendants move to dismiss the consolidated amended class action complaint (\u201cComplaint\u201d or \u201cCAC\u201d) pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 9(b) and 12(b)(6) and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, 15 U.S.C. 78u-4 (\u201cPSLRA\u201d). The Court has considered thoroughly the parties\u2019 submissions. For the following reasons, Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the Complaint is granted in its entirety and Plaintiffs request for leave further to amend the Complaint is denied as futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-12\">\n<em>Background </em>\n<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b576-13\">Focus Media is a public company that is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and maintains its principal offices in Shanghai, the People\u2019s Republic of China. Focus Media\u2019s American Depositary Shares trade on the NASDAQ stock exchange. Focus Media provides advertising and marketing solutions to its clients in China through various platforms. (CAC \u00b6 30.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Focus Media\u2019s business has three principal segments: the Digital Oub-of-Home Advertising Network, the Mobile Handset Advertising Network, and the Internet Advertising Services Network. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 31.) In fiscal year 2006, Focus Media earned $83,197,000 of net income on $211,905,000 of total net revenues. When reporting its quarterly financial performance, Focus Media disclosed, among other information, its gross margins, which are a measure of the company\u2019s profitability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 37.)</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">On September 27, 2007, Focus Media issued a press release (the \u201cSeptember 27 Press Release\u201d) announcing its financial results for the second quarter of 2007 (\u201c2Q07\u201d), a period that ended on June 30, 2007. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 48.) Along with the financial results for 2Q07, the September 27 Press Release contained earnings guidance for the third quarter of 2007 (\u201c3Q07\u201d), which would end three days later on September 30, 2007. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 56.) As part of this guidance, Focus Media estimated it would report total revenue between $132 million and $135 million and earn non-GAAP income <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> between $52 million and $54 million in 3Q07. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 56; Cattell Aff. Ex. D at 4.) The 3Q07 guidance did not include any specific estimates with respect to anticipated gross margins. Focus Media did not provide any further guidance for 3Q07 until it disclosed its actual 3Q07 results on November 19, 2007. (CAC \u00b6 58.)</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Focus Media hosted a conference call with analysts contemporaneously with the September 27 Press Release (the \u201cSeptember 27 Conference Call\u201d). (CAC \u00b6 49.) During the September 27 Conference Call, defendant Chief Financial Officer Wu specifically addressed the Company\u2019s declining gross margin by stating that \u201c[f]or the Company as a whole, the blended gross margin for the Company in the second quarter was 54.6% compared to 56.9% in the second quarter of 2006, lower primarily due to the addition of the lower-margin Internet advertising business to our revenue mix.\u201d (Cattell Aff., Ex. F at 3.) In response to a question about the future prospects for the gross margin of the Company\u2019s internet advertising business, and the impact on that gross margin of the March 2007 acquisition of Allyes, an Internet advertising agency and service technology business (CAC \u00b6 66), Wu responded as follows: \u201c90% of our Internet advertising business still is digital media service, which is interactive agency business, itself a lower margin ... Those margins can continue to improve as the revenue base becomes larger, revenue growth becomes larger, and also due to the larger media buying power of our Internet advertising business ... it\u2019s going to be a gradual improvement ... Going forward, we see [ ] two areas for the margin improvement ... But those will be gradual processes.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 129; Cattell Aff. Ex. F at 8.) In both the September 27 Press Release (Cattell Aff., Ex. D at 6) and the September 27 Conference Call (Cattell Aff., Ex. F at 2), the Company referred investors to the Company\u2019s SEC filings, including the Company\u2019s Form F-l Registration Statement, which, in its discussion of gross margin, cautioned that \u201c[i]n the future, our gross margin may fluctuate depending on the respective financial performance and stage of development of each of our networks as well as the relative contribution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>to our revenues and costs of each network.\u201d (Cattell Aff., Ex. L at 83.)</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">On or about November 1, 2007, Focus Media filed a Form F-l/A Registration Statement (\u201cRegistration Statement\u201d) with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a step toward executing the Secondary Offering. (CAC \u00b6 60.) On or about November 7, 2007, the prospectus (\u201cProspectus\u201d) with respect to the Secondary Offering became effective. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 61.) The Prospectus\u2019 discussion of the Company\u2019s gross margin also warned that \u201cour gross margin may fluctuate depending on the respective financial performance and stage of development of each of our networks as well as the relative contribution to our revenues and costs of each network.\u201d (Cattell Aff., Ex. C at 78.) The Prospectus did not include Focus Media\u2019s 3Q07 results nor provide any guidance for that quarter other than by reference to the September 27 Press Release.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">During the Secondary Offering, Focus Media sold approximately 13.5 million shares at $64.75 per share. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 61.) The Underwriter Defendants served as underwriters for the Secondary Offering and purchased FMCN Shares from Focus Media, which they re-sold to the investing public. (CAC \u00b6 62.) The Individual Defendants each signed the Registration Statement. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 103.) The putative class includes two groups of purchasers of FMCN Shares: those who purchased shares in the Secondary Offering and those who purchased shares in the open market during the period beginning on September 27, 2007 (when Focus Media released its earnings guidance for 3Q07), and ending on November 19, 2007 (when Focus Media released the actual 3Q07 results). <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 24.)</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">After the close of the market on November 19, 2007, Focus Media announced its results for the quarter ending on September 30, 2007. The release of the 3Q07 results revealed that, although Focus Media\u2019s revenue and non-GAAP income were higher than estimated in the September 27 Press Release, the company\u2019s gross margin had fallen to 50.9%<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 63.) The gross margins for the previous four quarters had been 54.6% for the second quarter of 2Q07 (\u201c2Q07\u201d), 58.0% for the first quarter of 2007 (\u201c1Q07\u201d), 68.5% for the fourth quarter of 2006 (\u201c4Q06\u201d), and 65.3% for the third quarter of 2006 (\u201c3Q06\u201d). <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38, 40, 48, 63.) The reasons for Focus Media\u2019s declining gross margin included a decline of the gross margin for its In-Store division, whose 3Q07 gross margin of 17.7% represented a 10.7% decrease from the previous quarter and an 18.5.% decline from the same quarter of the previous year <em>{id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 64, 69); a decline of the gross margin for its Internet advertising division, whose gross margin of 23% represented a 4.1 % decline from the same quarter of the previous year <em>{id. </em>\u00b6 76); and acquisition of various competitor businesses, including the previously undisclosed acquisition of a billboard business whose assets where chiefly in traditional billboards that would not be able to be converted for some time to the digital LED billboards that were the core of FM\u2019s outdoor advertising business. The profit margins on traditional billboards were lower than those on LED billboards. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 67).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">Focus Media\u2019s share price reacted negatively to the announcement of the 3Q07 results. After closing at $57.15 on November 19, 2007, the price fell to $52.00 at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>close of trading on November 20, 2007, and continued to decline the next day, closing at $50.35.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 95.) Various financial news media and equity research publications attributed the share price decline to the lower-than-expected gross margin figure. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 96-97.) This action was initiated on November 27, 2007, and was consolidated with another putative class action on April 24, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">In adjudicating a motion to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court accepts the factual allegations in the complaint as true and draws all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Roth v. Jennings, </em>489 F.3d 499, 501 (2d Cir.2007). Nevertheless, \u201c[t]o survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atlantic v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). This standard applies to all civil actions. <em>Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">\n<em>The Common Requirement to Allege a Misstatement or Omission of Material Fact</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">Plaintiff has alleged violations of Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act and violations of Sections 10(b) and 20A of the Exchange Act, in connection with the purchase of FMCN Shares during the November 2007 Secondary Offering, and in the open market between September 27, 2007, and November 19, 2007. To establish a prima facie case under any of the aforementioned statutes and regulations, Plaintiff must plead a misstatement or omission of a material fact. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k (Section 11); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>77l </em>(a)(2) (Section 12(a)(2)); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>77o </em>(Section 15); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t-1 (Section 20A); <em>Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc., v. Broudo, </em>544 U.S. 336, 341-42, 125 S.Ct. 1627, 161 L.Ed.2d 577 (2005) (Section 10(b) and Rule 10b \u2014 5). A material omission or misstatement is actionable only if the omitted facts were either: (1) required by SEC regulations to be stated in the relevant communication, or (2) necessary to make the disclosures not misleading. <em>In re N2K Sec. Litig., </em>82 F.Supp.2d 204, 207 (S.D.N.Y.2000), <em>aff'd, </em>202 F.3d 81 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-14\">\n<em>The September 27 Press Release and the September 27 Conference Call</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b579-15\">Plaintiff asserts that the earnings guidance issued by Focus Media as part of the September 27 Press Release announcing its financial results for 2Q07 was materially false and misleading. Plaintiff alleges that, in light of the fact that 3Q07 would close only three days later, Defendants knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that Focus Media would actually generate lower gross margins in 3Q07 than suggested by its September 27, 2007, revenue and income projections. For the following reasons, the Court concludes that the press release statements are not actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-16\">Plaintiffs seek to hold Defendants liable for Focus Media\u2019s failure to disclose financial information about the third quarter before that quarter had concluded. How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>ever, \u201c[t]he disclosure structure set out by the SEC ... recognizes how unworkable and potentially misleading a system of instantaneous disclosure out [of] the normal reporting periods would be.\u201d <em>In re Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetler, </em>AN. <em>Sec. Litig., </em>202 F.Supp.2d 8, 13 (S.D.N.Y.2001). The case law reflects that \u201ccourts have been reluctant to impose liability based upon a failure to disclose financial data for a fiscal quarter in progress,\u201d <em>see, e.g., Schoenhaut v. American Sensors, Inc., </em>986 F.Supp. 785, 791 (S.D.N.Y.1997) (citing <em>Zucker v. Quasha, </em>891 F.Supp. 1010, 1015 (D.N.J. 1995) (finding the defendant not liable for failure to disclose, when the quarter in progress was 95% complete, that it was experiencing a higher actual return rate of gross shipments than predicted in the Registration Statement)). The facts alleged here do not warrant a contrary holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Focus Media did not offer any guidance in the September 27 Press Release as to the Company\u2019s likely third quarter gross margin and it was not under any legal obligation to do so. The Company did provide guidance with respect to its projected 3Q07 revenue and income in the press release and those projections, rather than being materially misleading, proved to be conservative, as the company\u2019s actual results exceeded those projections. Plaintiff, however, argues that the guidance proved to be misleading because the actual third quarter revenue exceeded the projected third quarter revenue to a much greater degree than the actual third quarter gross profit exceeded the projected third quarter gross profit, producing a lower actual gross margin figure than the projections had suggested.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Compl. \u00b6 90.)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">The PSLRA safe harbor provision renders forward-looking statements accompanied by adequate cautionary statement non-actionable: \u201cA person [ ] shall not be liable with respect to any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, if and to the extent that the forward-looking statement is identified as a forward-looking statement, and is accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statement.\u201d 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 78u-5(c)(l)(A)(i) (West 2009). In determining whether the cautionary language is adequate, courts interpreting both this provision and the analogous \u201cbespeaks caution\u201d doctrine \u201cidentify the allegedly undisclosed risk and then read the allegedly fraudulent materials \u2014 including the cautionary language \u2014 to determine if a reasonable investor could have been misled into thinking that the risk that materialized and resulted in his loss did not actually exist. If the court determines that no reasonable investor could have been misled about the nature of the risk when he invested then the complaint fails to state a claim of securities fraud and must be dismissed.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>In re Sierra Wireless, Inc. Sec. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number><em>Litig., </em>482 F.Supp.2d 365, 380 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (quoting <em>Halperin v. eBanker USA.com, </em>295 F.3d 352, 359 (2d Cir.2002)) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The September 27 Press Release identified the 3Q07 revenue and income projections as forward-looking statements. (Cat-tell Aff. Ex. D at 6.) Additionally, the Company\u2019s guidance included cautionary language warning investors that \u201ca number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained [in the press release]\u201d and referring investors to the extensive risk disclosures in its SEC filings <em>(id.), </em>which included the warning that \u201cour gross margin may fluctuate depending on the respective financial performance and stage of development of each of our networks as well as the relative contribution to our revenues and costs of each network\u201d (Cattell Aff. Ex. L at 83). The Company therefore had explicitly flagged the possibility that its gross margin could be lower in reporting periods that experienced relatively higher contributions from lower margin and less developed components of the Company\u2019s business. This is precisely what occurred in 3Q07 and, therefore, the Court concludes that no reasonable investor who read this cautionary language could have failed to perceive the risk that the Company\u2019s actual 3Q07 gross margin could be lower than that suggested by the guidance in the September 27 Press Release. Accordingly, Plaintiffs allegations with respect to the September 27 Press Release do not plead actionable misstatements or omissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">This analysis applies equally to Plaintiffs allegations regarding the September 27 Conference Call, in which the Company included the same revenue and income projections as in the September 27</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Press Release as well as the same cautionary language identifying the statements as forward-looking statements and alerting investors to the relevant risks. (Cattell Aff. Ex. F at 2-3.) However, in the September 27 Conference Call, unlike in the September 27 Press Release, the Company also addressed specifically its future prospects for its gross margins (as opposed to merely providing revenue and income guidance) with respect to its Internet advertising business. In that discussion, Wu highlighted the potential for gross margin improvement over time in that business, while emphasizing that it would be gradual in nature (\u201c90% of our Internet advertising business still is digital media service ... itself a lower margin\u201d; \u201cthese margins can continue to improve ... [but] it\u2019s going to be a gradual improvement\u201d; \u201ctwo areas for margin improvement ... will be gradual processes\u201d). No reasonable investor could have construed these statements about anticipated gradual improvements over time as anything but optimistic projections related to a time horizon well beyond the quarter in progress. As \u201ccompanies must be permitted to operate with a hopeful outlook ... [and] are not required to take a gloomy, fearful or defeatist view of the future,\u201d <em>Rombach v. Chang, </em>355 F.3d 164, 174 (2d Cir.2004), Plaintiffs allegations with respect to these statements in the September 27 Conference Call do not plead actionable misstatements or omissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">\n<em>The Registration Statement for the Secondary Offering</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">Plaintiff argues that the Registration Statement for the Secondary Offering contained untrue statements of material facts and omitted facts necessary to make the Registration Statement not misleading. Specifically, Plaintiff argues that the Reg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>istration Statement was misleading because it omitted material information concerning the company\u2019s declining third quarter gross margin and material information concerning the company\u2019s LED billboard division. The Court concludes that neither of these omissions is actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">\n<em>The Omitted 3Q07 Gross Margin Information</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Plaintiff argues that the financial information provided in the Registration Statement \u2014 the Company\u2019s final results for the second quarter of 2007 \u2014 was insufficient to meet the applicable disclosure requirements because it did not include information regarding actual results for the third quarter that, when later reported, revealed margin declines despite revenue and income increases. SEC Regulation S-X (the \u201c135-Day Rule\u201d) requires that the registration statement contain financial statements covering a period that concluded fewer than 135 days before the registration statement\u2019s effective date. 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.3-12(a). Focus Media\u2019s registration statement was declared effective on November 7, 2007, fewer than 135 days after the June 30, 2007, close of the second quarter, for which the Registration Statement contained complete financial results. The Registration Statement thus complied with the 135-Day Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Plaintiff argues that the 135-Day Rule sets only a minimum disclosure obligation and that Focus Media\u2019s silence with respect to its 3Q07 gross margin is actionable pursuant to principles articulated in case law. In <em>Shaw v. Digital Equip. Corp., </em>the defendants were alleged to have violated the securities law by failing to disclose in Digital Equipment Corporation\u2019s offering documents the company\u2019s \u201cdisastrous\u201d financial condition. <em>Shaw v. Digital Equip. Corp., </em>82 F.3d 1194, 1199\u20141206 (1st Cir.1996). The <em>Shaw </em>plaintiffs complained that, at the time Digital Equipment Corporation (\u201cDEC\u201d) commenced its offering, the defendants did not disclose that it was experiencing surging operating losses in the quarter that was just eleven days shy of ending. <em>Id. </em>at 1199-1200. After the offering was completed and the quarter ended, DEC reported a quarterly operating loss of $183 million, a 150% increase from the previous quarter\u2019s loss of $72 million. <em>Id. </em>at 1200. The Court concluded that this loss \u201cwas far greater than analysts had been expecting,\u201d it \u201cbucked the positive trend of reduced losses under the company\u2019s new management,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1210, and it represented an \u201cextreme departure from the range of results which could be anticipated based on currently available information .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1210. The Court held that, under these circumstances, the disclosure provisions of the securities laws could have compelled DEC to disclose nonpublic information concerning its ongoing quarter-to-date performance in the offering documents, and the plaintiffs\u2019 allegation survived the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>Id. </em>at 1199.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">In contrast to the \u201cdisastrous\u201d operating loss that was central to the plaintiffs\u2019 action in <em>Shaw, </em>Focus Media\u2019s actual results for 3Q07 exceeded the results forecasted in the September 27 Press Release with respect to both total revenues and income. These higher than forecasted results were accompanied by a decline in gross margin, which continued a trend observed in the Company\u2019s financial results for the previous two quarters: gross margin had declined 10.5% between 4Q06 and 1Q07 and 5.4% from 1Q07 to 2Q07. When considered in the context of the overall revenue and income figures that exceeded expectations and an identifiable trend of falling gross margins, the 4.7% quarterly gross margin decline in 3Q07 cannot reasonably be char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>acterized as an \u201cextreme departure\u201d from the range of anticipated results that would render actionable the Registration Statement\u2019s omission of information concerning the Company\u2019s financial performance in 3Q07.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The Court finds the reasoning of both <em>In re Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetler, A.S. Sec. Litig., </em>202 F.Supp.2d 8 (S.D.N.Y.2001), and <em>In re N2K Sec. Litig., </em>82 F.Supp.2d 204 (S.D.N.Y.2000), <em>aff'd, </em>202 F.3d 81 (2d Cir.2000), to be persuasive and apposite to the instant case. In <em>Turkcell, </em>the court found that a 9% decline in the defendant company\u2019s operating income from the previous quarter did not meet the \u201cextreme departure\u201d standard of <em>Shaw. </em>The <em>Turk-cell </em>court reached this conclusion despite the fact that this decline was the company\u2019s first quarterly operating income decline. <em>In re Turkcell, </em>202 F.Supp.2d at 12-13. In the <em>N2K </em>case, the defendant company\u2019s announced per share loss was approximately 8% worse than analysts\u2019 expectations, allegedly causing an ensuing 25% decline in the defendant\u2019s stock price. <em>In re N2K, </em>82 F.Supp.2d at 208. The court similarly concluded that this alleged discrepancy between announced results and expected results was not enough to satisfy the \u201cextreme departure\u201d standard. <em>Id. </em>In both <em>Turkcell </em>and <em>N2K, </em>the courts held that the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations failed as a matter of law to rise to the level of material omissions and granted the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the claims.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Here, where the Company\u2019s actual revenues and income exceeded its projections and its actual gross margin, although a disappointment to some in the investment community, merely continued the trend of modest gross margin decline exhibited in the previous quarters, there was no \u201cextreme departure\u201d requiring accelerated disclosure of 3Q07 financial results. The Company\u2019s compliance with the 135-Day Rule was thus sufficient as a matter of law and, accordingly, Plaintiffs allegation with respect to omission of information concerning the Company\u2019s 3Q07 financial performance in the Registration Statement fails to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">Plaintiff also asserts that Defendants may be liable for their failure to warn investors in Focus Media\u2019s Registration Statement and Prospectus of \u201cknown trends [and] uncertainties ... that [were] reasonably likely to have a material effect\u201d on Focus Media\u2019s profitability, as required by SEC Forms F-l and 20-F and Regulation S-K. However, Focus Media provided ample disclosures in the Prospectus to warn reasonable investors of such risks of investing in FMCN Shares. The risks disclosed included the prospect that competitive forces could lead to decreased profitability and rising costs in connection with its Internet Advertising Services Network and In-store Network. (Cattell Aff. Ex. H at 29, 67.) The disclosures specifically articulated the possibility that the Company\u2019s gross margin could fluctuate \u201cdepending on the respective financial performance and stage of development of each of our networks as well as the relative contribution to our revenues and costs of each network.\u201d (Cattell Aff. Ex. L at 83.) Furthermore, as Plaintiffs complaint acknowledges, margins had trended downward in the three preceding quarters. (CAC \u00b6\u00b6 40, 48.) In light of the downward trend in Focus Media\u2019s gross margins prevailing at the time of Plaintiffs purchases of FMCN Shares, and the disclosures of the specific risks the Company faced with respect to maintaining profitability, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Court concludes that Plaintiffs argument that Defendant had a legal duty to disclose additional information with respect to Focus Media\u2019s gross margin before it released its 3Q07 financial statements fails as a matter of law. <em>See In re N2K, </em>82 F.Supp.2d at 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">\n<em>Nondisclosure of Purchases of Traditional Billboards</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">In support of its argument that the Registration Statement was misleading, Plaintiff argues that Focus Media improperly failed to disclose its acquisition of traditional billboards during the first half of 2007, an omission that was material due to its depressive effect on profit margins. (CAC \u00b6\u00b6 79-83.) However, the quoted language in the Registration Statement speaks only about the Company\u2019s \u201cLED billboard network\u201d and says nothing about the universe of the Company\u2019s billboard assets and, accordingly, is not misleading as a matter of law. With respect to the impact of these acquisitions on the Company\u2019s 3Q07 gross margin, for the reasons stated above, the Court has concluded that Plaintiff has not pleaded any actionable misstatement or omission related to gross margins in the Registration Statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">In light of the Court\u2019s determination that Plaintiff fails to state an actionable claim of a violation of the disclosure requirements of Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 20A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Court need not consider further the parties\u2019 arguments regarding the adequacy of Plaintiffs Consolidated Amendment Complaint. Plaintiffs request for leave to replead is denied as futile, in light of the foregoing analysis. <em>Patane v. Clark, </em>508 F.3d 106, 113 n. 6 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">For the foregoing reasons, Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Plaintiffs Complaint is granted in its entirety. The Clerk of Court is respectfully requested to enter judgment accordingly and close this case and the consolidated case, <em>Bauer v. Focus Media Holding Limited, </em>07 Civ. 11479. This Opinion and Order resolves docket entry no. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-9\">. The following facts are alleged in the Complaint and are construed as true for purposes of this motion practice. <em>See McCarthy v. Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp., </em>482 F.3d 184, 189 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b577-7\">. <em>\"A </em>gross margin is a company\u2019s total sales revenue minus its costs of goods sold, divided by the total sales revenue, expressed as a percentage.\u201d (CAC \u00b6 33.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b577-10\">. Non-GAAP income is defined in the September 27, 2007, press release as net income excluding share-based compensation expense and intangible assets amortization expense resulting from acquisitions. (CAC \u00b6 56; Cattell Aff. Ex. D at 4.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b578-7\">. Focus Media earned non-GAAP income of $54.6 million on total revenues of $151.4 million in 3Q07. (Cattell Aff. Ex. I at 2.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b579-11\">. The price of FMCN Shares quickly rebounded, closing at $56.44 on November 30, 2007, and $57.48 on December 12, 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b579-12\">. The Court may also consider any written instrument attached to the complaint, statements or documents incorporated into the complaint by reference, and documents possessed by or known to the plaintiff and upon which it relied in bringing the suit. <em>See Roth-man v. Gregor, 220 </em>F.3d 81, 88 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b580-5\">. Although the revenue and income projections implied plied the likely range of the Company\u2019s projected 3Q07 gross margin, they were insufficient to allow an investor to calculate a projected gross margin with precision because various line items (in addition to revenue and income) that were not projected are necessary to perform that calculation. <em>See </em>n. 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b580-6\">. Plaintiff contends that the PSLRA safe harbor provision and the \"bespeaks caution\" doctrine do not protect the 3Q07 projections in the September 27 Press Release and Conference Call because, at the time they were made, the third quarter was nearly over and, so the argument goes, the statements were more akin to appraisals of the Company\u2019s recent performance than \"forward-looking\" statements. This argument is not supported by any legal authority and is contrary to the principles underlying the reporting schedules in the securities laws and, therefore, is rejected. <em>See In re Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetler, </em>A.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number><em>Sec.
