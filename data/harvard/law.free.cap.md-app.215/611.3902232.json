The primary issue before us is the extent to which the Local Government Tort Claims Act (the \u201cLGTCA\u201d) limits recovery for state constitutional violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Following Espina\u2019s death, Espina\u2019s wife, Estela Concepcion Jacome-Espina (\u201cEstela\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Espina\u2019s son, Manuel de Jesus Espina-Jacome (\u201cManuel\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Espina\u2019s estate (collectively, \u201cthe Espinas\u201d) filed suit against Jackson and Prince George\u2019s County (\u201cthe county\u201d) in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. After a twenty-three day trial and three days of deliberation, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the Espinas, finding that Jackson violated Espina\u2019s rights under Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, assaulted and battered Espina, wrongfully caused Espina\u2019s death, and violated Manuel\u2019s rights under Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The jury found that Jackson acted with actual malice and did not act in self-defense, and awarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>damages totaling $11,505,000.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Applying the Local Government Tort Claims Act (\u201cLGTCA\u201d) damage cap, the circuit court reduced the $11,505,000 million verdict against Prince George\u2019s County to $405,000.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The original verdict against Jackson was not reduced.

Prince George\u2019s County police officer Steven Jackson drove by Espina and his friend and observed the men drinking what he believed to be alcoholic beverages in the common area of the apartment complex.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Jackson was driving his marked police cruiser and was wearing his Prince George\u2019s County police uniform.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Jackson worked secondary employment as a security guard at the apartment complex. After driving past the men twice in hopes that the men would disperse after seeing the police cruiser, Jackson parked his cruiser and approached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>the area where Espina and his friend had been standing. After Espina and his friend had entered the building, Jackson used his master key to enter the locked building. Inside the building, a confrontation ensued between Jackson and Espina. The details of the confrontation were significantly disputed at trial. We first describe the version of events as presented by Jackson. Thereafter, we describe the incident as testified to by the other witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">\n<em>A. Jackson\u2019s version of events.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Jackson testified that he entered the building to investigate possible violations of loitering, trespassing, or open container laws. When he entered the building, Jackson believed that Espina and another man had \u201ctaken evasive movements or measures\u201d by going into the building and Jackson felt \u201coutnumbered.\u201d Jackson testified that he asked Espina if he had any weapons and to put his hands against the wall. Jackson placed his hands on Espina and then, according to Jackson, Espina elbowed him in the back of his neck. Jackson testified that Espina became anxious and took a combative stance, and that after Espina charged him, Jackson sprayed Espina in the eyes with pepper spray. Jackson explained that he was able to get one handcuff on Espina\u2019s left hand but was unable to finish handcuffing him due to Espina\u2019s resistance. Jackson testified that he viewed the loose handcuff on Espina\u2019s left hand as a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">At some point, Jackson and Espina moved down the stairs to the first floor landing. Jackson testified that as Espina and he were pushing each other, they lost their balance and both fell down the stairs. Jackson further explained that Espina landed face-first on the floor; Jackson landed on top of Espina. Jackson acknowledged that Espina was noticeably bleeding from his face. Jackson testified that he allowed Espina to push himself up. After Espina got up, he charged at Jackson and Jackson began to strike Espina with his baton. According to Jackson, the baton strikes were ineffective, so Jackson placed Espina in an arm lock. Jackson testified that Espina walked with him toward the front door of the building <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>and the struggle continued with pushing and shoving near the mailboxes. While near the front door, Jackson called for backup over his police radio.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Jackson testified that after he finished his call to dispatch, Espina began running downstairs to the lower level. Jackson explained that he grabbed Espina by the shirt and struck him with his baton because he was concerned that Espina might be trying to break into one of the lower level apartments. Espina and Jackson continued fighting into the lower level apartment of Espina\u2019s friends, Maria Gamez (\u201cGamez\u201d) and her daughter, Elvia Rivera (\u201cRivera\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Jackson believed that Espina had forced the apartment door open with the weight of his body. Jackson testified that Espina fell face-first onto the hard floor of Gamez\u2019s apartment, but then Espina rolled onto his back and engaged in defensive kicking. Jackson testified that, at that point, he began hitting Espina with his baton with \u201cas much force as [he] could.\u201d Jackson further testified that while he was striking Espina, he felt a blunt force from behind him that caused him to fall onto the couch. Jackson did not see who had struck him. Jackson testified that after he got up from the couch, four to five unidentified men came into the apartment, but he did not know where the men came from; they did not appear to have entered through the door. Espina and one other man attempted to grab the baton from his hand. Jackson and the two men engaged in a struggle for the baton.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Thereafter, according to Jackson, the other men engaged in the struggle and a total of five to seven people pushed at him and grabbed for the baton. Jackson testified that the men were pushing him toward the couch and reaching near his waistband and holster. Jackson testified that he begged the people to stop pushing against him, but they continued to push. According to Jackson, Espina reached toward his service weapon and Jackson feared that he might lose his weapon. Jackson removed his weapon from his belt and pointed the gun at the group of people. Jackson testified that, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>he was holding the gun at waist level pointing toward the group of men, he asked everyone to get back and warned that he would shoot, but the members of the group continued reaching for his baton and service weapon. Espina was on his feet and moved toward Jackson, with his hands on Jackson\u2019s baton. Espina removed his hands from the baton and Jackson believed that Espina was going to take his service weapon. Jackson testified that, in fear for his life, he leaned his upper body backwards and fired his service weapon, striking Espina in the stomach. Jackson testified that Espina was standing when the fatal shot was fired and remained standing immediately after he was shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Jackson testified that after the shooting, the group retreated enough so that he was able to leave the apartment. Jackson attempted to put his foot in the door to keep the door open, but someone inside the apartment pushed the door closed. Jackson went outside of the apartment building and radioed that shots had been fired. Additional backup arrived shortly after the call. Jackson testified that he walked into the apartment with one of the arriving officers. At least two other officers arrived as well, although Jackson could not remember exactly when they arrived. The officers observed a man, who later was identified as Manuel, performing CPR on Espina, who was lying on the floor. Jackson testified that he had no recollection of seeing Estela in the apartment after he returned with the other officers, nor did he see the group of men present in the apartment. Jackson asked one of the other officers to arrest Manuel (who was still performing CPR on his father) because he was involved in the previous alleged attack against Jackson. Jackson testified that he planned to resume CPR after Manuel was handcuffed, but the paramedics arrived and began performing CPR on Espina. Manuel was handcuffed and removed from the apartment; he was later charged with second degree assault, second degree assault on a law enforcement officer, and obstruction and hindering. The criminal charges against Manuel were later dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Jackson testified that he used deadly force because he believed that his life was in danger. Jackson explained that he feared for his life because the group of men had a strategic advantage over him by virtue of their number and position. Jackson denied that he yelled profanity at any time during the altercation.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">\n<em>B. The incident as testified to by other witnesses.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Noe Cordova (\u201cCordova\u201d), a friend of the Espina family, testified that on the afternoon of August 16, 2008, he was outside of the apartment building with Espina, Estela, Manuel, and Gamez. It was Espina\u2019s birthday and Gamez was planning a birthday meal for him in her apartment. After the individuals went into the apartment building, Espina told Cordova that he thought he saw a police officer outside. Espina walked up to the landing and a police officer, who was later identified as Jackson, entered through the door and quickly walked past Cordova. Cordova testified that Jackson had a furious expression on his face and uttered the phrase \u201cmother fucker.\u201d According to Cordova, Jackson grabbed Espina, pushed him against the wall, and hit him in the face. Jackson then sprayed Espina with pepper spray. Cordova testified that Espina began to yell, but Jackson kept hitting him and then threw Espina down the stairs. Cordova observed that Espina\u2019s face was bleeding and that Jackson continued to strike Espina with the baton. After Espina and Jackson moved to the lower level, Cordova was unable to see the altercation, but Cordova testified that he heard Espina\u2019s screams and heard a shot from Gamez\u2019s apartment. Cordova saw Jackson come out of the apartment after the shot was fired. He testified that he did not see anyone else come out of the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Luis Felipe Agust\u00edn (\u201cAgust\u00edn\u201d), another friend of the Espinas and resident of the apartment complex, testified that he saw a police cruiser parked outside of the apartment when he arrived home from work on the afternoon of August 16, 2008. When he walked up to the door of the apartment, Agust\u00edn saw Espina pushed up against the glass door at the entrance to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>building. Agust\u00edn testified that Espina, whose face was \u201cbathed in blood,\u201d was trying to exit through the door and the officer, who was later identified as Jackson, was striking him with his hands. Agust\u00edn testified that Jackson pushed Espina down the stairs to the lower level of the apartment building. Once Jackson and Espina moved to the lower level of the building, Agust\u00edn was no longer able to see the altercation. Thereafter, Agust\u00edn saw Manuel running out from the adjacent building where he lived. Agust\u00edn told Manuel that he needed to see what was going on with his father and the officer. Agust\u00edn observed Manuel enter the lower level apartment, where Jackson and Espina continued to struggle, through the kitchen window. Agust\u00edn testified that he heard a gunshot approximately ten seconds after Manuel entered the apartment. Agust\u00edn then saw Jackson running out of the apartment before other officers began to arrive. Agust\u00edn did not see any other men or any other people run out of the apartment building. Agust\u00edn testified that did not see Espina hit, kick, or strike Jackson at any point in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Elvia Rivera (\u201cRivera\u201d), a friend of the Espina family, testified that as of August 16, 2008, she lived with her mother, Gamez, in the lower level apartment. Rivera testified that Gamez was preparing a meal for Espina\u2019s birthday celebration. Rivera looked through the peephole in her apartment door and observed an officer, who was later identified as Jackson, beating Espina with a baton. The struggle was occurring on the landing near the front door of the apartment building. She described Espina as \u201cvery hurt and bloody.\u201d According to Rivera, Espina did not resist or fight back and was not hitting or kicking Jackson in any way. Rivera testified that she unlocked and opened her apartment door because she saw her friend getting hurt. Immediately after she opened the door, Rivera saw Espina and Jackson coming down the stairs. Rivera described Espina as \u201crolling on his back\u201d with Jackson \u201cbeating him behind him.\u201d Rivera testified that Jackson was yelling the word \u201cfuck\u201d and using a mean and angry tone of voice. She testified that she heard Jackson using the word \u201cfuck\u201d many times.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>After Rivera opened the door to the apartment, Jackson and Espina stumbled into her apartment. Rivera testified that Jackson continued to strike Espina, who at this point was \u201ccrouched down on the floor, pretty much on his knees.\u201d Jackson remained standing. Rivera testified that she heard Espina \u201cmoaning a lot.\u201d Rivera saw Jackson hitting Espina with the baton, saying \u201c[f]uck, shut the fuck up\u201d in a very mean voice. Rivera testified that she was afraid, so she grabbed Gamez and took her to the bedroom, where Gamez\u2019s boyfriend Carlos was also present. After she got her mother into the bedroom, Rivera came back out into the living room and saw Jackson shoot Espina in the stomach. Rivera testified that Jackson was standing when the shot was fired and that Espina was crouched on the floor. Rivera testified that after Jackson shot Espina, she heard Jackson say \u201cfuck\u201d again.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">Rivera testified that she did not see Espina touch Jackson\u2019s gun or waistband, and that there was not a group of five or six men surrounding Jackson before he shot Espina. Rivera testified that she did not see any other men in the apartment before Espina was shot, other than Carlos, who remained in the bedroom. According to Rivera, Manuel came into the apartment at some point and yelled to Jackson, \u201cWhy did you kill my father?\u201d Rivera did not remember exactly when Manuel came into the apartment, but she testified that she did not see Manuel \u201cdoing anything against [Jackson].\u201d She testified that she did not see Manuel doing anything with Jackson\u2019s baton or gun, nor did Rivera see Jackson fall or be pushed onto a couch.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">After Espina was shot, Jackson ran out of the apartment. Rivera testified that Estela came into the apartment and was \u201cscreaming, crying, yelling, \u2018Why,\u2019 you know, \u2018There\u2019s a God and he\u2019s up there and he\u2019s seen this, and why did you kill my husband?\u2019 \u201d Rivera testified that Jackson responded to Estela, saying, \u201cshut the fuck up.\u201d She also heard Jackson say \u201cfuck\u201d or \u201cfuck you\u201d using a very angry tone of voice. Rivera called 9-1-1; a recording of her 9-1-1 call was played for the jury and entered into evidence. Rivera identified her own voice on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>the tape. She also identified a voice on the tape as Jackson\u2019s. In the recording, the voice Rivera identified as Jackson\u2019s was heard saying, \u201cshut the fuck up\u201d and \u201cfuck you.\u201d Rivera identified the voice of Estela, which was heard on the tape screaming in the background. Rivera testified that during the time of the 9-1-1 call, Espina was gagging and looked like he was dying. No one was struggling with the officer. Rivera testified that she was told by the police to leave the apartment; she left and cooperated with officers outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Manuel, Espina\u2019s son, testified that on August 16, 2008, as he came out of his apartment, a neighbor alerted him that a police officer was beating his father. Manuel testified that he ran to the next-door apartment building in his complex and looked through the glass door; he observed the officer he identified as Jackson \u201chitting [his] father really hard.\u201d Manuel tried to open the door, but it was locked. He testified that, at this point, Espina was limping and bleeding significantly from his face. Initially, Manuel observed Jackson striking Espina with his fists, and later, striking Espina with his baton. Manuel testified that he saw Jackson use the baton to strike Espina\u2019s face, back, and leg. Manuel testified that Espina did not fight back. According to Manuel, Jackson struck Espina in the back with the baton, causing him to fall down the stairs to the lower level. Manuel testified that Jackson \u201ccontinued hitting him until he got to the basement door.\u201d In order to get into the apartment where Espina and Jackson continued to struggle, Manuel entered through a kitchen window.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Manuel testified that when he got into the apartment, he yelled at Jackson to stop hitting Espina. Jackson continued to strike Espina, who was on his feet but was bent over. Manuel explained that Jackson repeatedly knocked Espina over and Espina tried to get up, only to be knocked down again. Manuel testified that he did not see Espina roll onto his back and kick Jackson. Jackson repeatedly said \u201cfuck\u201d as he struck Espina. Espina\u2019s face was bleeding and his eyes were filling with blood. From Manuel\u2019s perspective, Jackson was the only person who had control in the altercation. Manuel testified that the only people in the apartment were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Espina, Jackson, Gamez, Rivera, and himself and that there was no group of five to six men.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">Manuel denied that he ever pushed Jackson onto the couch, as Jackson testified. Manuel further testified that he never put his hands on Jackson in any way. Prior to the gunshot, Manuel did not hear Jackson say \u201cplease stop\u201d or \u201cplease let me go.\u201d Rather, Manuel testified that \u201c[t]he only thing that [Jackson] was saying is \u2018fuck.\u2019 \u201d Manuel did not hear Jackson say, \u201cGet back, or I will shoot.\u201d Manuel testified that he saw Jackson shoot Espina and Espina screamed and fell to the floor. After Espina was shot, Manuel started crying and asked Jackson to call an ambulance. Manuel testified that Jackson responded by saying \u201cshut up, shut the fuck up.\u201d Manuel attempted to perform CPR on Espina, while Jackson stood by the door and did not render assistance. While Manuel was attempting to perform CPR, another officer came up behind Manuel, arrested him, and removed him from the apartment. Manuel did not see a police officer take over CPR after his arrest. When Espina was brought out of the apartment by the paramedics, Manuel was not permitted to see Espina. Manuel testified that after his arrest, he was taken to the police station and shackled to a wall for four and a half to five hours. He was questioned and charged with assault on a police officer. Manuel testified that he was taken to jail and released after two days.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Estela, Espina\u2019s wife, testified that she arrived at Gamez\u2019s apartment after Espina had been shot. Manuel told Estela that an officer had beaten and shot Espina. Estela testified that there was not a group of four to six men inside the apartment and that she did not see any men leaving the apartment. Estela testified that she asked Jackson why he killed her husband and he responded using offensive language. Estela saw Manuel attempt to perform CPR on Espina. Estela explained that Espina was on the floor, was \u201closing a lot of blood,\u201d and \u201chad [his] eye blown up, like it was puffed out.\u201d Estela testified that two officers grabbed her and removed her from the apartment. Estela asked to go with Espina, but the officers did not allow Estela to join her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>husband in the ambulance. Estela identified her own voice as well as Jackson\u2019s voice in the 9-1-1 recording. The voice Estela identified as Jackson\u2019s was heard saying \u201cshut the fuck up\u201d and \u201cfuck you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The jury ultimately returned a verdict for the Espinas, finding Jackson and Prince George\u2019s County liable for the violation of Espina\u2019s rights under Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, assault and battery of Espina, and wrongful death. The jury further found a violation of Manuel\u2019s rights under Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and awarded damages totaling $11,505,000. Jackson and the county filed a motion for remittitur, JNOV, and/or a new trial. After briefing and a hearing on the post-trial motions, the circuit court denied the motion for JNOV and the motion for a new trial, but granted the motion for remittitur by applying the LGTCA cap to the judgment and reducing the judgment as to the county to $805,000. Following this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Leake v. Johnson, supra, </em>204 Md.App. 387, 40 A.3d 1127 the county filed a motion for reconsideration. After a hearing, the circuit court reduced the verdict as to Prince George\u2019s County to $405,000. The entire verdict as to Jackson was not reduced. The county also filed a motion to dismiss the \u201cunlawful pattern or practice\u201d claim against Prince George\u2019s County, which was the only remaining claim. The circuit court denied the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Additional facts will be discussed as necessitated by the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">I. State Constitutional Torts and the LGTCA Damages Cap</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">The applicability and constitutionality of the LGTCA damages cap, as applied to constitutional claims, is an issue that has been presented several times but never addressed by this Court or the Court of Appeals. In this case, however, we are presented squarely with the issue of the constitutionality of the LGTCA damages cap and are asked to decide the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>to which the LGTCA limits recovery for state constitutional violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">The damages cap provision of the LGTCA appears in \u00a7 5-303 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">(a) (1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the liability of a local government may not exceed $200,000 per an individual claim, and $500,000 per total claims that arise from the same occurrence for damages resulting from tortious acts or omissions, or liability arising under subsection (b) of this section and indemnification under subsection (c) of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">(2) The limits on liability provided under paragraph (1) of this subsection do not include interest accrued on a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">(b)(1) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, a local government shall be liable for any judgment against its employee for damages resulting from tortious acts or omissions committed by the employee within the scope of employment with the local government.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">Md.Code (1974, 2013 RepLVol.), \u00a7 5-303 of the Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The County<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> urges us to conclude that the LGTCA damages cap applies to the damages award in the instant case. The Espinas, on the other hand, assert that the LGTCA cap does not apply to damages awarded for state constitutional claims, and alternatively, if the cap does apply, it constitutes an unconstitutional abridgment of Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>A. The LGTCA damages cap\u2019s applicability to constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">In considering the applicability of the LGTCA cap to claims involving constitutional violations, we look first to the statute itself. It is well established that \u201c[t]he cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the real and actual intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Lockshin v. Semsker, </em>412 Md. 257, 274, 987 A.2d 18 (2010). The Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">To ascertain the intent of the General Assembly, we begin with the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute. If the language of the statute is unambiguous and clearly consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, our inquiry as to legislative intent ends ordinarily and we apply the statute as written, without resort to other rules of construction. We neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute, and we do not construe a statute with \u201cforced or subtle interpretations\u201d that limit or extend its application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-6\">We, however, do not read statutory language in a vacuum, nor do we confine strictly our interpretation of a statute\u2019s plain language to the isolated section alone. Rather, the plain language must be viewed within the context of the statutory scheme to which it belongs, considering the purpose, aim, or policy of the Legislature in enacting the statute. We presume that the Legislature intends its enactments to operate together as a consistent and harmonious body of law, and, thus, we seek to reconcile and harmonize the parts of a statute, to the extent possible consistent with the statute\u2019s object and scope.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">Where the words of a statute are ambiguous and subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, or where the words are clear and unambiguous when viewed in isolation, but become ambiguous when read as part of a larger statutory scheme, a court must resolve the ambiguity by searching for legislative intent in other indicia, including the history of the legislation or other relevant sources intrinsic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>and extrinsic to the legislative process. In resolving ambiguities, a court considers the structure of the statute, how it relates to other laws, its general purpose, and the relative rationality and legal effect of various competing constructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-4\">In every case, the statute must be given a reasonable interpretation, not one that is absurd, illogical, or incompatible with common sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 274-76, 987 A.2d 18 (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Accordingly, we look first to the text of the statute, which provides that the cap applies \u201cfor damages resulting from tortious acts or omissions.\u201d CJP \u00a7 5-303(a)(l). The statute further provides that the \u201clocal government shall be liable for any judgment against its employee for damages resulting from tortious acts or omissions committed by the employee within the scope of employment with the local government.\u201d CJP \u00a7 5 \u2014 303(b)(1). The statute, however, does not define the term \u201ctortious acts or omissions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The Court of Appeals\u2019 discussion of the Maryland Torts Claim Act (\u201cMTCA\u201d) in <em>Lee v. Cline, </em>384 Md. 245, 863 A.2d 297 (2004), while not directly on point, is instructive. In Lee, the Court of Appeals considered whether the MTCA provided qualified immunity to state personnel for tort actions based upon violations of the Maryland Constitution and certain common law intentional torts. The MTCA provided, in pertinent part, that state personnel enjoyed immunity \u201cfor a tortious act or omission that is within the scope of the public duties of the State personnel and is made without malice or gross negligence.\u201d CJP \u00a7 5-222(b). The Court discussed the language of the MTCA as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-8\">The current language of the Maryland Tort Claims Act plainly appears to cover intentional torts <em>and constitutional torts </em>as long as they were committed within the scope of state employment and without malice or gross negligence. There are no exceptions in the statute for intentional torts or torts based upon violations of the Maryland Constitution. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>This Court has been most reluctant to <em>recognize </em>exceptions in a statute when there is no basis for the exceptions in the statutory language. <em>See, e.g., O\u2019Connor v. Baltimore County, </em>382 Md. 102, 113, 854 A.2d 1191, 1198 (2004) (\u201cWhen interpreting a statute, we assign the words their ordinary and natural meaning. We will not ... \u2018judicially insert language to impose exceptions, limitations or restrictions not set forth by the legislature\u2019 \u201d)[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><em>Lee, </em>384 Md. at 256-57, 863 A.2d 297 (emphasis added). The Court concluded that \u201cthe immunity under the Maryland Tort Claims Act, if otherwise applicable, encompasses constitutional torts and intentional torts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266, 863 A.2d 297. Similarly, the language of the LGTCA provides no exceptions for intentional torts or constitutional violations. As such, we are similarly reluctant to recognize an exception in a statute when there is no express basis for the exception in the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">We addressed the issue of the definition of \u201ctort\u201d in <em>Green v. N.B.S., Inc., </em>180 Md.App. 639, 952 A.2d 364 (2008), <em>aff'd </em>409 Md. 528, 976 A.2d 279 (2009). In <em>Green, </em>we considered whether the statutory cap on noneconomic damages applied to claims based upon violations of the Consumer Protection Act (\u201cCPA\u201d). In reaching our conclusion that the cap applies to violations of the CPA, we noted that \u201c[i]n <em>Lee, </em>the Court interpreted the term \u2018tortious act or omission\u2019 to include causes of action to recover for constitutional torts. 384 Md. at 266, 863 A.2d 297. This is important for our purposes because a constitutional tort is obviously not a \u2018common law\u2019 tort.\u201d 180 Md.App. at 647, 952 A.2d 364 (internal citation omitted). The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that \u201cthe cap statute applied to appellant\u2019s claim for damages that arose, in part, out of a violation of the CPA.\u201d 409 Md. at 544, 976 A.2d 279 (quoting 180 Md.App. at 659-60, 952 A.2d 364). <em>Green, </em>therefore, provides further support for a conclusion that the term \u201ctort\u201d includes not only \u201ccommon law\u201d torts, but civil wrongs based upon statutory violations and constitutional violations as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>We have, however, acknowledged an \u201cuneasy fit\u201d between state constitutional torts and the requirements of the LGTCA. <em>Prince George\u2019s County, et al. v.

Less clear is whether the restrictions of those statutes that would defeat all or partial recovery apply in every respect to State constitutional torts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">On the one hand, the Court of Appeals has said that a State constitutional tort, such as one premised on a violation of a \u201cself-executing\u201d constitutional provision, like Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, is enforceable in a common law action for damages. In addition, State constitutional tort action cannot be defeated by the assertion of official or local government immunity. Thus, it appears to exist independently of the LGTCA, which is premised on a waiver of governmental immunity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">On the other hand, at least in MTCA cases, the Court of Appeals has indicated that recovery against the State is available as long as the claimant complies with procedural requirements of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-7\"><em>Longtin I, supra, </em>190 Md.App. at 117-19, 988 A.2d 20 (cited with approval in <em>Longtin II, </em>419 Md. at 470, 19 A.3d 859). We also observed that \u201cwhen it comes to State constitutional torts, there can be no easy reliance on a literal reading of either the MTCA or the LGTCA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 118 n. 26, 988 A.2d 20. Accordingly, despite the apparently unambiguous language of the LGTCA damages cap, we look beyond a mere literal reading of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">We find guidance in Judge Harrell\u2019s concurring and dissenting opinion in <em>Longtin II, </em>419 Md. at 500-23, 19 A.3d 859 (Harrell, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>Judge Harrell noted that he would conclude that the LGTCA damages cap limits recovery for constitutional claims. Judge Harrell explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-4\">At common law (that is, before the LGTCA), a plaintiff could bring a constitutional tort claim directly against local government officers and employees, as well as their employers \u2014 the local governments. After the passage of the LGTCA, a plaintiff lost, however, his/her/its ability to recover from the officers and employees, provided those tortfeasors acted within the scope of employment. <em>The LGTCA restriction on liability ultimately applies to constitutional and non-constitutional tort claims alike, such that a plaintiff bringing a constitutional claim may recover only from the employing-local government.

Judge Harrell further referenced the Court of Appeals holding in <em>Green, supra, </em>409 Md. 528, 976 A.2d 279, that the cap on noneconomic damages in CJP \u00a7 11-108 applies to constitutional claims as well as common law tort claims. <em>Longtin II, supra, </em>419 Md. at 522, 19 A.3d 859 (Harrell, J., concurring and dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>We agree that a broad definition of the term tortious acts or omissions is appropriate. We find further support for this conclusion in <em>Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. 70, 660 A.2d 447 (1995). In <em>Ashton, </em>neither party raised the issue of the LGTCA, but the Court expressed its opinion on the applicability of the LGTCA in dicta, noting that \u201cthere is no exception in the Local Government Tort Claims Act for constitutional torts. In fact, there is no exception in the statutory language for any category of torts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108 n. 19, 660 A.2d 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">Moreover, nothing in the legislative history suggests that the General Assembly intended to limit the application of the cap to nonconstitutional claims. The General Assembly enacted the LGTCA, effective July 1, 1987. Acts of 1987, ch. 594. The LGTCA \u201caffected the tort liability of local governments in several ways.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Housing Authority of Baltimore City, </em>200 Md.App. 176, 189, 26 A.3d 1012 (2011) (internal quotation omitted). In reviewing the legislative history of the LGTCA, we explained that the LGTCA \u201crepealed prior legislation that had placed monetary caps on waivers of governmental immunity by charter counties and had imposed notice requirements for certain claims against counties or municipalities; defined local governments; adopted damages caps in tort actions; and imposed notice requirements that were \u2018essentially the same notice requirements which had existed under the prior law which was repealed\u2019 by the legislation enacting the LGTCA.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">In <em>Housing Authority of Baltimore City v.

At that time, \u00a7 5-303(a) provided that \u201cthe liability of a local government may not exceed $200,000 per an individual claim, and $500,000 per total claims that arise from the same occurrence for damages resulting from tortious acts or omissions, <em>including </em>liability arising under subsection (b) of this section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>and indemnification under subsection (c) of this section.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Md.Code (1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-303(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. The Court of Appeals, focusing on the word \u201cincluding,\u201d held that the LGTCA damages cap did not apply \u201cto tort actions directly against local governments when the bases for such actions are enactments of the General Assembly, state common law, the state constitution, or federal law.\u201d <em>Bennett, supra, </em>359 Md. at 373-74, 754 A.2d 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Immediately after the Court of Appeals issued its opinion in <em>Bennett, </em>the General Assembly enacted emergency legislation, eliminating the word \u201cincluding\u201d from CJP \u00a7 5-303(a) and replacing it with the word \u201cor.\u201d Ch. 286, Acts of 2001 (effective April 20, 2001). In our opinion in <em>Longtin I, supra, </em>190 Md.App. 97, 988 A.2d 20, we summarized the legislative action after <em>Bennett </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-5\">In direct response to the <em>Bennett </em>decision, the General Assembly in 2001 passed emergency legislation, which, according to its title, was intended to \u201c[clarify] that the monetary limits on the liability of a local government under the [LGTCA] apply to claims against local governments when named as defendants [and] that the monetary limits under the [LGTCA] apply to tort judgments for which local governments are liable.... \u201d Ch. 286, Laws of 2001 (HB 942).

Applications \u201cof tradi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>tional or well-established immunities from suit\u201d do not violate Article 19. <em>Id. </em>\u201cArticle 19, however, \u2018precludes the Legislature from immunizing from suit both the government and the governmental official involved ... when the cause of action is based upon a violation of state constitutional rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Piselli, supra, </em>371 Md. at 207, 808 A.2d 508). Other restrictions have been held permissible under Article 19, including certain notice provisions as well as mandatory arbitration prior to filing in court. <em>Id. </em>at 379, 30 A.3d 854. The imposition of \u201ca reasonable limit\u201d upon noneconomic damages is permissible under Article 19, as are 5, 10, and 20-year statutes of repose for certain tort actions. <em>Id. </em>The Court has also provided that \u201cthe Legislature may <em>ordinarily </em>substitute a statutory remedy ... for a common law remedy without violating Article 19 of the Declaration of Rights or other Maryland constitutional provisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Robinson v. Bunch, </em>367 Md. 432, 446-47, 788 A.2d 636 (2002)). The issue, therefore, is whether the LGTCA damages cap is reasonable under Article 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Prior analysis of the limitation upon recoverable noneconomic tort damages pursuant to CJP \u00a7 11-108 is particularly instructive.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It is well established that the \u00a7 11-108 cap does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>not violate Article 19. The Court of Appeals was first presented with this issue in <em>Murphy v. Edmonds, </em>325 Md. 342, 601 A.2d 102 (1992), in which the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-4\">In our view, the limitation upon recoverable noneconomic tort damages under \u00a7 11-108 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article does not amount to a restriction upon access to the courts. There is a distinction between restricting access to the courts and modifying the substantive law to be applied by the courts. The plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action based on negligence was not abolished by \u00a7 11-108. Instead, \u00a7 11-108 simply modifies the law of damages to be applied in tort cases. While the right to recover noneconomic damages exceeding $350,000 was abrogated, this change in the substantive law is not a restriction upon access to the courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">325 Md. at 366, 601 A.2d 102 (1992). Similarly, the LGTCA damages cap does not modify access to the courts. Instead, it modifies the law of damages applied in cases involving claims against local governments.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The Espinas point to <em>Daekman, supra, </em>in support of their assertion that a cap of $200,000 per claim and $500,000 per occurrence is unreasonable. In <em>Daekman, </em>the Court of Appeals held that the substituted remedy under the Reduction of Lead Risk in Housing Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d) was invalid under Article 19. 422 Md. at 383, 30 A.3d 854. The Act provided that, when a landlord complied with certain requirements to properly maintain rental property, the maximum amount payable to a lead poisoned child was $17,000.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>adequacy of the remedy provided by the Act, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-4\">For a child who is found to be permanently brain damaged from ingesting lead paint, proximately caused by the landlord\u2019s negligence, the maximum amount of compensation under a qualified offer is minuscule. It is almost no compensation. Thus, the remedy which the Act substitutes for a traditional personal injury action results in either no compensation (where no qualified offer is made or where a qualified offer is rejected) or drastically inadequate compensation (where such qualified offer is made and accepted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgA\"><em>Id. </em>at 382, 30 A.3d 854. The Court also emphasized that there was no exception in the Act for an injured child to bring her own personal injury action once reaching the age of majority, observing that \u201cthe grant of immunity in the present case leave[s] a negligently injured child without a remedy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court noted that it could not \u201ccountenance a result that would leave the only innocent victim ... uncompensated for his or her injuries,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Piselli, supra, </em>371 Md. at 216, 808 A.2d 508 (quoting <em>Johns Hopkins Hospital v. Pepper, </em>346 Md. 679, 695, 697 A.2d 1358 (1997))). Accordingly, the Court held that \u201cthe immunity provisions of the Reduction of Lead Risk in Housing Act are invalid under Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383, 30 A.3d 854.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The LGTCA damages cap is distinguishable from the cap addressed in <em>Dackman. </em>The LGTCA damages cap of $200,000 per claim is over ten times the amount of the qualified offer at issue in <em>Dackman. </em>Moreover, in <em>Dackman, </em>if a qualified offer was rejected, the landlord had full immunity, including immunity against future claims by an injured child once she reaches majority, leaving a lead paint poisoned child with no remedy whatsoever. There is no similar immunity provision in the LGTCA, and plaintiffs injured by a local government may recover up to $200,000 per individual claim. Critically, in cases such as the instant case \u2014 in which malice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>was established \u2014 a plaintiff can recover in full, subject to no immunity or cap, against the local government employee himself. In our view, the LGTCA damages cap is more similar to the \u00a7 11-108 cap on noneconomic damages than to the qualified offer and immunity provisions of the Reduction of Lead Risk in Housing Act. As such, the LGTCA damages cap modifies the law of damages applied in cases involving claims against local governments. It does not operate \u2014 as the Espinas suggest \u2014 as a restriction upon access to the courts. We hold, therefore, that the LGTCA damages cap, as applied to state constitutional claims, does not violate the Espinas\u2019 rights under Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>C. Application of the LGTCA damages cap.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Having concluded that the LGTCA damages cap applies and is constitutional, our next task is to determine whether it was properly applied. Pursuant to CJP \u00a7 5-303(a), the circuit court reduced the judgment against Prince George\u2019s County from $11,505,000 to $405,000. Both parties maintain that the circuit court improperly reduced the verdicts under \u00a7 5-303(a). The Espinas argue that the assault and shooting of Espina constitute a separate occurrence from the constitutional violation against Manuel. The Espinas further argue that a separate $200,000 cap should have applied for each of the wrongful death claim beneficiaries. The County asserts that all of the claims asserted by the Espinas constitute one individual claim because the claims are based upon the same set of facts. The verdicts, according to the County, should have been reduced to $200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The LGTCA provides, in relevant part, that \u201cthe liability of a local government may not exceed $200,000 per an individual claim, and $500,000 per total claims that arise from the same occurrence.\u201d CJP \u00a7 5-303(a)(l). The circuit court found that the violation of Espina\u2019s constitutional right and the wrongful death of Espina constituted one occurrence and that Estela and Manuel\u2019s wrongful death claims were derivative. The circuit court further found that Manuel\u2019s constitutional claim constituted an individual claim arising out of the same occurrence. The court reduced the wrongful death award to $200,000 as to Prince George\u2019s County. The circuit court further reduced Manuel\u2019s award for violation of his constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>tional rights to $200,000, and left the $5,000 award for economic damages unchanged, resulting in a total award of $405,000.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">In <em>Leake, supra, </em>204 Md.App. at 417, 40 A.3d 1127 we explained that \u201ca wrongful death claim [is] aggregated with the claim of the injured person in applying the LGTCA limitation of liability of a local government to $200,000 per an \u2018individual claim.\u2019 \u201d We held in <em>Leake </em>that wrongful death claims must be aggregated with an estate\u2019s survival action under the LGTCA. Accordingly, the circuit court properly applied <em>Leake </em>when it found that Estela and Manuel\u2019s wrongful death claims were derivative of Espina\u2019s survival claim and limited recovery to $200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The County contends that Manuel\u2019s constitutional claim is similarly derivative. We disagree. As discussed, <em>infra, </em>in section 11(G), the jury\u2019s verdict finding that Manuel\u2019s constitutional rights were violated is reconcilable with the jury\u2019s verdict that Manuel was not assaulted. Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in finding that Manuel\u2019s constitutional claim was separate and not derivative. Applying the LGTCA cap, the circuit court properly reduced the verdict for Manuel\u2019s constitutional claim to $200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Finally, we hold that the circuit court erred by awarding $5,000 for economic damages. Unlike the \u00a7 11-108 cap, the LGTCA damages cap does not differentiate between economic and noneconomic damages. <em>See </em>CJP \u00a7 5-303(a). Rather, the LGTCA\u2019s $200,000 per claim and $500,000 per occurrence damages cap applies to both economic and noneconomic damages. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we hold that the total award should have been reduced to $400,000, rather than $405,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">II. Cross-Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">We now turn to the nine issues asserted by the County in its cross-appeal. We address each of the County\u2019s contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>A. The circuit court\u2019s denial of the County\u2019s motion to dismiss the unlawful pattern and practice claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Prior to trial, the circuit court bifurcated the Espinas\u2019 claim for unlawful pattern or practice and ordered that the unlawful pattern or practice claim proceed after the trial on all other counts. That claim has not been tried and is currently stayed by the circuit court, pending the outcome of the appeal in this case. Critically, the circuit court granted the County\u2019s motion for entry of final judgment. The order certifying the judgment as final did not apply to the unlawful pattern or practice count. Rather, the circuit court found and ordered that \u201cthe claims adjudicated at the trial held February 15, 2011 continuing to and including March 16, 2011, are final and totally decided\u201d and \u201cthere is no just reason for delay in certifying <em>those claims as final for purposes for appeal.\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Accordingly, we are precluded from addressing the Espinas\u2019 unlawful pattern and practice claim at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">B. Application of the CJP \u00a7 11-108 damages cap.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">The County urges that, if the LGTCA damages cap does not apply, we should apply the \u00a7 11-108 cap and reduce the noneconomic damages accordingly. Because we hold that the LGTCA damages cap applies and that, pursuant to the LGTCA damages cap, the award is reduced to $400,000, the award represents less than the amount allowable under the \u00a7 11-108 noneconomic damages cap. Accordingly, we need not address whether the \u00a7 11-108 cap on noneconomic damages applies to constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">C. The circuit court\u2019s exclusion of evidence regarding Espina\u2019s immigration status and folding pocket knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">Next, the County asserts that the trial court erred by excluding evidence that Espina had a knife in his pocket and evidence of Espina\u2019s undocumented immigration status. Indeed, the County acknowledges \u2014 as it must \u2014 that there is no indication that Jackson knew of either the knife or Espina\u2019s immigration status at the time of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Regarding the standard of review for evidentiary determinations, the Court of Appeals has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-4\">It is frequently stated that the issue of whether a particular item of evidence should be admitted or excluded is committed to the considerable and sound discretion of the trial court, and that the abuse of discretion standard of review is applicable to the trial court\u2019s determination of relevancy. Maryland Rule 5-402, however, makes it clear that the trial court does not have discretion to admit irrelevant evidence. While the clearly erroneous standard of review is applicable to the trial judge\u2019s factual finding that an item of evidence does or does not have probative value, the de novo standard of review is applicable to the trial judge\u2019s conclusion of law that the evidence at issue is or is not of consequence to the determination of the action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-5\"><em>Ruffin Hotel Corp. of Maryland, Inc. v. Gasper, </em>418 Md. 594, 619-20, 17 A.3d 676 (2011) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Evidence is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Md. Rule 5-401.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The County asserts that both the knife and Espina\u2019s immigration status were relevant to establish Espina\u2019s \u201cpossible motive\u201d for \u201cviolently resisting Officer Jackson\u2019s efforts, to support Jackson\u2019s version of events, and to show the jury how and why the incident escalated to the point of the shooting.\u201d The County concedes, however, that Jackson was never aware of Espina\u2019s knife or immigration status at any point during the altercation. Moreover, the knife was not discovered until <em>after Espina\u2019s death. </em>Although Jackson testified that Espina resisted his attempts to arrest him, there is no indication in the record that Espina\u2019s \u201cpossible motive\u201d for resisting arrest was an issue in the case, nor did this evidence have any tendency to make the existence of any fact of consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We fail to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>understand, how information \u2014 fully unknown to Jackson at the time of the incident, and in no way considered by Jackson at any point \u2014 is in any way relevant in the instant case. Evidence suggesting that Espina did, in fact, resist arrest is certainly relevant. Indeed, Jackson testified that Espina resisted arrest. Evidence suggesting \u201cpossible\u201d reasons for resistance, however, was not relevant. We agree with the circuit court\u2019s determination that neither Espina\u2019s knife nor Espina\u2019s immigration status were relevant.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">D. The circuit court\u2019s admission of evidence of Jackson\u2019s involvement in two previous stops of two other individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The County\u2019s next contention is that the circuit court erred by allowing the Espinas to introduce evidence of two prior incidents in which Jackson was involved in violent encounters with members of the public. The County argues that such evidence was not relevant and should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>At trial, the Espinas presented four motions to admit evidence of prior, violent encounters between Jackson and members of the public. The circuit court denied the first three motions without prejudice, but grunted the fourth motion, finding that Jackson had opened the door to allow the evidence by testifying about his practices as a police officer and his habit and practice of typically following the various levels of the continuum of force. The Espinas introduced evidence of a violent encounter between Jackson and Sean Leake, which occurred less than three months prior to the incident that resulted in Espina\u2019s death, and evidence of a violent encounter between Jackson and Jacques Ross, which occurred twenty-one days prior to the incident that resulted in Espina\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Specifically, Ross testified regarding an encounter he had with Jackson on July 27, 2008. Ross learned from his brother, who had been driving Ross\u2019s car, that his car had been impounded for a taillight infraction. Jackson was the officer who had pulled over Ross\u2019s brother and impounded the vehicle. Ross, with his brother in the vehicle, drove to a nearby fire station, where he saw Jackson, and asked the officer if he could help locate the impounded car. At this point, Ross was unaware that Jackson was the same officer who had pulled his brother over earlier and impounded that car. Recognizing Ross\u2019s brother, Jackson began to yell at Ross\u2019s brother, \u201cOh, so you\u2019ve come back, you\u2019ve come back for some trouble?\u201d and \u201cYou want a fucking piece of me? I\u2019m going to give you what you fucking want.\u201d Jackson grabbed Ross by the neck and forcibly removed him from the vehicle, and while Ross was being questioned by another officer, Jackson jumped on him and kicked Ross\u2019s legs. After Jackson\u2019s supervisor arrived, the altercation ended. Ross sought medical attention and was not charged with any crime. Jackson used very similar justifications to explain his conduct in both the Ross and Espina incidents. In both instances, Jackson said he was \u201coutnumbered\u201d and at a \u201cdisadvantage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Regarding the Sean Leake incident, Leake was unavailable for trial, but a recording from Jackson\u2019s police cruiser was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>introduced into evidence. The recording captured part of a violent encounter between Jackson and Leake on May 25, 2008. During a traffic stop, Jackson demanded that Leake step out of his car. Then, after Leake indicated that he was stuck in the vehicle, Jackson punched Leake in the face twice and wrestled him to the ground. Jackson testified that Leake hit him first, but that was not visible on the recording. Again, Jackson used very similar justifications to explain his conduct in both the Leake and Espina incidents. In both instances, Jackson said he was \u201coutnumbered.\u201d Jackson also said that both Leake and Espina took a \u201ccombative stance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In a civil case, the admissibility of prior bad acts evidence is governed by Maryland Rule 5-403. <em>Ruffin Hotel Corp. of Maryland, Inc. v. Gasper, </em>418 Md. 594, 625, 17 A.3d 676 (2011) (\u201c[Maryland] Rule 5-404(b) [is] applicable only to evidence offered by the State against the defendant in a criminal case. In civil cases, whether the evidence at issue is offered by a plaintiff or by a defendant, the admissibility of relevant evidence that presents the possibility of unfair prejudice is to be dealt with pursuant to Md. Rule 5-403.\u201d).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Under Rule 5-403, relevant evidence is excluded only if \u201cits probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d We review a trial court\u2019s application of the Rule 5-403 for an abuse of discretion. The Court of Appeals has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-6\">When weighing the probative value of proffered evidence against its potentially prejudicial nature, an abuse of discretion in the ruling may be found where no reasonable person would share the view taken by the trial judge. That is to say, an abuse of discretion occurs when a decision is well removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and beyond the fringe of what that court deems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>minimally acceptable. Thus, a ruling reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard will not be reversed simply because the appellate court would not have made the same ruling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><em>Consolidated Waste Industries, Inc. v. Standard Equipment Co., </em>421 Md. 210, 219, 26 A.3d 352 (2011) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">We hold that the circuit court did not err in finding the prior conduct relevant. The evidence was relevant to Jackson\u2019s motive, intent, and <em>modus operandi, </em>as well as to rebut Jackson\u2019s testimony that, as a police officer, he followed the various levels of the continuum of force. The evidence was not admitted \u201cto prove that [Jackson] acted in accordance with the character or trait on a particular occasion,\u201d as prohibited by Maryland Rule 5-404(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Nor did the circuit court abuse its discretion in determining that the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice pursuant to Rule 5-403. The circuit court afforded the County the opportunity to present testimony and admit evidence in order to explain these incidents. Indeed, two witnesses (in addition to Jackson) testified for the County regarding the Leake incident \u2014 both of whom supported Jackson\u2019s version of events. We cannot say that the circuit court\u2019s decision to admit the evidence was \u201cremoved from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and beyond the fringe of what that court deems minimally acceptable.\u201d <em>Consolidated Waste Industries, Inc. v. Standard Equipment Co., supra, </em>421 Md. at 219, 26 A.3d 352. Accordingly, we hold that the circuit court did not err nor abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence of Jackson\u2019s prior violent encounters with members of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">E. The Espinas\u2019 assertion of excessive force under Article 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">The County asserts that, as a matter of law, the Espinas\u2019 Article 24 claim should not have been submitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>the jury because such a claim can only be asserted via an Article 26 claim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">We have explained that claims brought under Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights are analyzed utilizing the same test as claims brought under Article 26.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Randall v. Peaco, </em>175 Md.App. 320, 330, 927 A.2d 83 (2007) (\u201c[A] claim of excessive force brought under Article 24 is analyzed in the same manner as if the claim were brought under Article 26. In both instances, the claim is assessed under Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, rather than notions of substantive due process, precisely like the analysis employed for claims brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d). The case of <em>Okwa v. Harper, </em>360 Md. 161, 757 A.2d 118 (2000), is particularly instructive. In <em>Okwa, </em>an individual brought an Article 24 claim alleging excessive force during an arrest; he did not assert an Article 26 claim. The Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the defendants, holding that excessive force could provide a basis for an Article 24 claim, and that the reasonableness of the police officer\u2019s conduct should be assessed utilizing the standard put forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989). <em>Okwa, supra, </em>360 Md. at 203-05, 757 A.2d 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The County misstates the law on this issue. Simply because an Article 24 claim is analyzed utilizing the Article 26/Fourth Amendment reasonableness standard articulated in <em>Graham, </em>a claimant is not precluded from asserting an Article 24 claim. Rather, an Article 24 claim is viable if a claimant can prove excessive force under the <em>Graham </em>test. <em>See, e.g., Okwa, supra, </em>360 Md. at 203-05, 757 A.2d 118; <em>Hines v. French, </em>157 Md.App. 536, 574-75, 852 A.2d 1047 (2004) (\u201cThe standards for analyzing claims of excessive force are the same under Arti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>cles 24 and 26 of the Maryland Constitution as that under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\u201d); <em>Tavakoli-Nouri v. State, </em>139 Md.App. 716, 730, 779 A.2d 992 (2001) (\u201cSuch excessive force could be a violation of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights....\u201d) Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in submitting the Espinas\u2019 Article 24 claim to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">F. Sufficiency of the evidence to establish malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The County\u2019s next contention is that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to establish \u201cactual malice,\u201d and that Jackson should retain his statutory immunity.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Regarding the evidence required to support a finding of malice, we have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">In the qualified immunity context, the Court of Appeals [has] affirmed that \u201cmalice\u201d has an \u201cactual malice\u201d meaning, and requires a determination of whether the arresting officer\u2019s \u201cconduct, given all of the existing and antecedent circumstances, was motivated by ill will, [or] by an improper motive.... [T]hat motive or animus may exist even when the conduct is objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Shoemaker [v. Smith], </em>353 Md. [143] at 164, 725 A.2d 549 [(1999)]. Malice can be established by proof that the officer \u201c \u2018intentionally performed an act without legal justification or excuse, but with an evil or rancorous motive influenced by hate, the purpose being to deliberately and willfully injure the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163, 725 A.2d 549 (quoting <em>Leese v. Baltimore County, </em>64 Md.App. 442, 480, 497 A.2d 159 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>305 Md. 106, 501 A.2d 845 (1985)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIx\"><em>Thacker v. City of Hyattsville, </em>135 Md.App. 268, 300, 762 A.2d 172 (2000). In the instant case, the jury rendered four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>separate findings of malice. The County argues that \u201c[t]he evidence at trial established, at best, mutual combat,\u201d and that the evidence \u201cestablished no more than the two men struggled and that, eventually, [Jackson] discharged his firearm as part of the struggle, killing [Espina].\u201d Such an assessment of the evidence is simply not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">We will not restate the details of the testimony laid out in the factual background section, <em>supra, </em>but we nevertheless identify a few key segments of testimony to illustrate the copious evidence presented to support a finding of malice. Several eyewitnesses testified that Jackson attacked Espina with no justification, yelled profanity in an angry voice, and ultimately shot and killed Espina when he was unable to resist or fight back. Noe Cordova testified that, when Jackson entered the apartment, he had a furious expression on his face and used the phrase \u201cmother fucker.\u201d Cordova further testified that Jackson continued to strike Espina despite Espina\u2019s screams. Elvia Rivera testified that Jackson beat Espina with his baton and that Espina did not resist or fight back in any way. Rivera further testified that Jackson yelled the word \u201cfuck\u201d many times and used a mean and angry voice, and that Jackson shot Espina while he was crouched on the floor. Manuel testified that Jackson repeatedly knocked Espina down when Espina tried to get up. Manuel further testified that he did not see Espina fight back, and that after the shooting, when Manuel asked Jackson to call an ambulance, Jackson responded by saying, \u201cshut the fuck up.\u201d Rivera and Estela both identified Jackson\u2019s voice on the 9-1-1 tape saying \u201cshut the fuck up\u201d and \u201cfuck you.\u201d All of the eyewitnesses, other than Jackson, testified that they never saw a group of five to six men surrounding Jackson. There was also physical, medical, and forensic evidence presented enabling the jury to readily reach a finding of malice. Simply put, we hold that the evidence was more than sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding of malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">G. The jury\u2019s verdict regarding Manuel\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The County next contends that, because the jury found that Jackson did not assault or batter Manuel, its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>finding that Jackson violated Manuel\u2019s rights under Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights is irreconcilably inconsistent. We hold that the verdicts can easily be reconciled.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">The Court of Appeals has explained that irreconcilable inconsistent jury verdicts cannot be allowed to stand in civil cases. <em>Southern Management Corp. v. Taha, </em>378 Md. 461, 487-89, 836 A.2d 627 (2003). In <em>Taha, </em>a jury found a former corporate employer liable to a terminated employee for malicious prosecution but found former coworkers, who were the alleged tortfeasors, not liable. <em>Id. </em>at 495, 836 A.2d 627. The Court of Appeals held that the \u201cjudgments reflected irreconcilably inconsistent jury verdicts,\u201d and accordingly, held that the judgment must be set aside. Unlike <em>Taha, </em>the verdicts in the instant case can be reconciled.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">At trial, there was evidence presented that Manuel was prevented from providing CPR to his dying father because he was handcuffed and arrested.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Manuel was also charged with criminal assault of Jackson, based upon information provided by Jackson.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The jury could have reasonably determined that Manuel\u2019s rights under Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights were violated when he was required to cease providing CPR to his father, and when he was arrested, imprisoned, and charged with a crime for which the jury could have reasonably concluded there was no basis. Accordingly, we do not find that the jury\u2019s verdict is irreconcilably inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">H. The verdict sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The County\u2019s next contention is that the verdict sheet was incorrect as a matter of law because Question 9 (which asked the jury whether Jackson was liable for wrongful death), did not identify the offense that caused Espina\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>We have explained that \u201cthe decision to use a particular verdict sheet \u2018will not be reversed absent abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Applied Indus. Techs. v. Ludemann, </em>148 Md.App. 272, 287, 811 A.2d 845 (2002). We hold that there was no such abuse of discretion in the instant case. Question 1 on the verdict sheet explicitly asked whether Jackson violated Espina\u2019s constitutional rights, to which the jury answered, \u201cyes.\u201d Question 2 explicitly asked whether Jackson acted in self-defense, to which the jury answered, \u201cno.\u201d Question 3 explicitly asked whether Jackson acted with actual malice, to which the jury answered, \u201cyes.\u201d Question 5 explicitly asked whether Jackson assaulted and battered Espina, to which the jury answered, \u201cyes.\u201d The verdict sheet was not required to repeat the same list of torts and defenses in Question 9. The jurors were properly instructed as to the elements of each claim brought on behalf of Espina, Estela, and Manuel, and the record does not reflect that the jury was confused in any way. Indeed, the verdict sheet used by the circuit court was neither legally incorrect nor confusing.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">I. Excessiveness of damages</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The County\u2019s final contention is that the damages were plainly excessive. This issue is moot in light of our conclusion regarding the applicability of the LGTCA damages cap.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">For the reasons noted, the LGTCA damages cap limits the Espinas\u2019 total recovery. The LGTCA cap applies to claims for state constitutional violations. Further, the application of the LGTCA cap to constitutional claims is not a violation of Article 19 nor a violation of the separation of powers doctrine. Applying the cap, the jury verdict, as to Prince George\u2019s County, is reduced from $11,505,000 to $400,000. Finally, we are unpersuaded by any of contentions raised by the County in its cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.

Subsection (c) pertains to punitive damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b659-7\">. The Espinas point to <em>Bennett, supra, </em>in support of their assertion that, as a matter of statutory construction, the damages cap cannot apply to claims involving constitutional violations. In <em>Bennett, supra, </em>in reaching its conclusion that the damages cap was inapplicable to a tort judgment directly against the Housing Authority, the Court of Appeals noted that \"[i]t would not be a reasonable construction of the statutory language ... to apply the monetary caps to tort actions directly against local governments when the bases for such actions are enactments of the General Assembly, state common law, the state constitution, or federal law.\u201d 359 Md. at 373-74, 754 A.2d 367. The Court focused on the dichotomy between locally enacted law and state law in concluding that the legislative intent was that the damages cap applies only to actions against employees under the LGTCA and actions against local governments authorized under locally enacted law. Because the legislature clarified, post <em>-Bennett, </em>that the LGTCA applied to direct claims against the local government as well as to claims against local government employees, we can no longer infer that the legislature intended to differentiate between locally enacted law and state law, including state constitutional law. Rather, we conclude that, by broadening the liability for local governments post <em>-Bennett, </em>the legislature intended the LGTCA damages cap to apply to damages for constitutional violations as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b659-8\">. In <em>Rounds, </em>we held that the LGTCA\u2019s notice requirement applied to claims for state constitutional violations brought against the Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>National Capital Park and Planning Commission, emphasizing that the Commission was both \"a 'local government\u2019 subject to the LGTCA\u201d and \"a State agency entitled to sovereign immunity.\u201d <em>Rounds, supra, </em>214 Md.App. at 106-07 n. 10, 75 A.3d 987.

We observe that \"Maryland law provides no immunity for municipalities and other local government entities from suits based upon violations of state constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Ashton, </em>339 Md. at 101, 660 A.2d 447. Additionally, with respect to local governments other than the Commission, we do not reach our <em>dicta </em>in <em>Longtin I, </em>190 Md.App. at 115-21, 988 A.2d 20, in which this Court observed the \"[ujneasy [flit\u201d between state constitutional torts and the LGTCA notice requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b664-6\">.

We are also unpersuaded by the Espina's separation of powers and judicial admission arguments. The Espinas point to out of state cases in support of their position that the LGTCA cap, as applied to constitutional claims, is an unconstitutional violation of separation of powers. Particularly, the Espinas point to the Illinois case of <em>Best </em>v. <em>Taylor Machine Works, </em>179 Ill.2d 367, 228 Ill.Dec. 636, 689 N.E.2d 1057 (1997), in which the Supreme Court of Illinois struck down a cap on noneconomic damages as an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers doctrine. We explicitly distinguished <em>Best </em>in <em>Owens-Corning v. Walatka, </em>125 Md.App. 313, 335-37, 725 A.2d 579 (1999), <em>abrogated on other grounds by John Crane, Inc. v. Scribner, </em>369 Md. 369, 800 A.2d 727 (2002), finding it inconsistent with the Court of Appeals' opinion in <em>Murphy v. Edmonds, </em>325 Md. 342, 601 A.2d 102 (1992), and quoting Judge Niemeyer's opinion in <em>Franklin v. Mazda Motor Corp., </em>704 F.Supp. 1325, 1331 (D.Md.1989), in which Judge Niemeyer explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-5\">[I]f the legislature can, without violating separation of powers principles, establish statutes of limitations, establish statutes of repose, create presumptions, create new causes of action and abolish old ones, then it also can limit noneconomic damages without violating the separations of powers doctrine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">125 Md.App. at 338-39, 725 A.2d 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">We hold that the same rationale that has been applied to the \u00a711-108 cap applies to the LGTCA cap in the context of a separation of powers argument, and accordingly, we hold that there is no violation of the separation of powers doctrine. <em>See, e.g., Univ. of Md. Med. Sys. Corp. </em>v. <em>Malory, </em>143 Md.App. 327, 355, 795 A.2d 107 (2001) (''[W]e were presented with [the constitutionality of the Cap under a separation of powers analysis] in Murphy and . .. our holding in that case is controlling.\u201d); <em>Edmonds v.

The Espinas contend that, because the County\u2019s counsel argued to the jury that Prince George\u2019s County would be liable for Jackson\u2019s conduct and would \"pay the judgment in the case,\u201d the County is bound to its \"judicial admissions.\u201d The Espinas cite no Maryland case directly on point, and we know of no such case. We hold that the County's counsel's statements were insufficient to establish a binding judicial admission to pay the judgment. Moreover, the County has never disputed that it will pay the judgment, subject to the limits of liability provided by \u00a7 5-303.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b669-9\">. The $200,000 award for the wrongful death claim was to be split, 95% to Estela and 5% to Manuel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b671-7\">. The County's reliance on <em>Ayala v. State, </em>174 Md.App. 647, 923 A.2d 952 (2007) is misplaced. <em>Ayala </em>involved the admission of a criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>defendant\u2019s gang affiliation in order to demonstrate his motive for committing a \"brutal and seemingly senseless killing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 663-64, 923 A.2d 952. We noted that we were establishing \"no bright-line rule as to the admissibility of gang evidence in Maryland\u201d but that in that particular case, the circuit court \"properly exercised its discretion\u201d because \"the evidence was highly probative in establishing motive and was not unduly prejudicial under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 664, 923 A.2d 952. Unlike <em>Ayala, </em>the County here argued the evidence should be admitted not to prove the motive of a criminal defendant, but to prove the possible motive of a victim of excessive force.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b672-8\">. We also observe that, assuming <em>arguendo </em>the knife and immigration status had marginal relevance, the circuit court would have been well within its discretion to exclude the evidence under Maryland Rule 5-403, which provides that relevant evidence may be excluded \"if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d Md. Rule 5-403. Evidence of Espina\u2019s knife and immigration status were likely to cause significant unfair prejudice. Although prejudice was argued to the circuit court, the circuit court determined that the evidence was not relevant and, accordingly, did not reach the balancing test of Rule 5-403.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b674-7\">.
