Following a public hearing at which both Board staff and appellants presented arguments for and against approval of the plan, the Board issued a written Resolution approving the plan, finding that, in accordance with \u00a7 50-29(b)(2) of the Montgomery County Code, the resulting lots would be of the same character as those within the existing neighborhood. After appellants exercised their right to judicial review, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County denied both appellants\u2019 petition for judicial review and appellants\u2019 motion to supplement the administrative record, and affirmed the Board\u2019s approval of the plan of resubdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">On appeal to this Court, appellants present four questions for our review, which we have combined into two:</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">1. Did the circuit court err in denying appellants\u2019 Motion to Supplement the Administrative Record?</p>\n<p id=\"b614-12\">2. Did the Board err in concluding that the resubdivision proposed in the resubdivision plan complied with Montgomery County Code \u00a7 50-29(b)(2)?</p>\n<p id=\"b615-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Finding no error, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">\n<em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">On January 6, 2011, Joav Steinbach,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on behalf of the Tamara Corporation (\u201cTamara\u201d), submitted to the Board Preliminary Plan No. 120110110 for resubdivision of a lot located on Gainsborough Road between Seven Locks Road and Fontaine Street in Montgomery County (\u201cthe Plan\u201d). In the Plan, Tamara sought approval for the resubdivision of the then-undeveloped Lot 17, Block B of the Willerburn Acres Subdivision, containing 1.01 acres, into two lots of roughly equal size, known as \u201cLot 60\u201d and \u201cLot 61,\u201d in order to build two separate single-family houses.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">On March 25, 2011, appellants submitted a letter opposing the resubdivision to the Board. After reviewing the Plan, staff members of the Board (\u201cStaff\u2019) submitted to the Board on April 22, 2011, a detailed memorandum report reviewing and recommending approval of the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">On May 5, 2011, the Board held a public hearing on the Plan. At the hearing, both Staff and representatives of Tamara presented evidence in support of the approval of the Plan. Appellants offered their own testimony and evidence in opposition to the Plan. At the close of the hearing, the Board voted 3-0 in favor of approving the Plan.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Following the hearing, on May 19, 2011, appellants submitted a Petition for Reconsideration by letter to the Board.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The letter voiced appellants\u2019 disapproval of the Board\u2019s May 5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>decision and also included supplemental materials from other resubdivision plans considered previously by the Board. The Board denied appellants\u2019 petition. On May 25, 2011, the Board issued its final Resolution, in which the Board stated in writing its approval of the Plan and explained the reasoning for its decision. In its Resolution, the Board found, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-4\">In accordance with Section 50 \u2014 29(b)(2) of the [Montgomery] County Code, the proposed lots are of the same character as to street frontage, alignment, size, shape, width, area and suitability for residential use as to other lots within the existing neighborhood (as delineated by Staff in the Staff Report) (\u201cNeighborhood\u201d)....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The Resolution concluded by informing all parties that they had thirty days in which to file a petition for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">On June 21, 2011, appellants filed a petition for judicial review in the circuit court. On July 22, 2011, appellants moved to stay the Board\u2019s decision pending judicial review, but the court denied their request on September 13, 2011, following a hearing held on the same day. On September 21, 2011, appellants filed a memorandum of law, along with several attachments, in support of their petition for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">On October 27, 2011, the Board filed a memorandum in response to appellants\u2019 memorandum. Also on October 27, the Board filed a motion to strike, asserting that appellants provided numerous materials to the circuit court, \u201ccontrary to the Maryland Rules of Procedure,\u201d that were not before the Board at the time it approved the Plan. On November 10, 2011, appellants filed an opposition to the motion to strike and a Motion to Supplement the Administrative Record, in the latter of which they sought to include in the administrative record materials that they submitted to the Board with their May 19 Petition for Reconsideration. The Board opposed the motion to supplement, arguing that the materials were not provided to the Board prior to its May 5 decision and, therefore, could not have been a basis for that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">At a hearing on December 1, 2011, the circuit court heard argument from the parties on the Board\u2019s motion to strike, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>appellants\u2019 motion to supplement, and appellants\u2019 petition for judicial review. The court, after reviewing the parties\u2019 written memoranda of law and hearing their arguments, denied all of the motions<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and affirmed the Board\u2019s approval of the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Appellants timely filed a notice of appeal. Additional facts will be set forth below as necessary to resolve the questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Supplementing the Agency Record</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Appellants contend that the circuit court erred in denying their Motion to Supplement the Record. Specifically, appellants assert that the court improperly denied their request \u201cto add to the Administrative Record the homeowners\u2019 May 19 letter and the Staff reports pertaining to previous resubdivision plans.\u201d In support of this argument, appellants claim that they properly submitted the materials to the Board pursuant to its Rules of Procedure. As a result of the court\u2019s refusal to supplement the record, appellants conclude that \u201cthe [circuit] Court was unable to judge if the Board\u2019s judgment was reasonably based on proven facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">The Board responds that \u201c[mjaterials submitted to the [] Board after that agency\u2019s decision should not be considered by this Court in reviewing that decision.\u201d Pursuant to the Board\u2019s Rules of Procedure, the Board argues, \u201cthe record of a proceeding is closed when the [ ] Board votes.\u201d Therefore, the Board concludes, \u201c[i]f this Court were to consider supplemental materials on which the [ ] Board did not rely, the Court could not determine whether the [] Board\u2019s decision was a reasonable conclusion based upon the facts in the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">Appellants\u2019 issue asks this Court to decide whether the <em>circuit court, </em>not the Board, erred by denying their motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>supplement the agency record before the circuit court. In judicial review of administrative proceedings, \u201c[additional evidence in support of or against the agency\u2019s decision is <em>not </em>allowed unless permitted by law.\u201d Md. Rule 7-208(d) (emphasis added). It is clear in the instant case that supplementing an administrative record is not permitted by law. Pursuant to the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, Md. Code (1984, 2009 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 10-222 of the State Government Article (\u201cSG\u201d), a reviewing court may only</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">(1) remand the case for further proceedings;</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">(2) affirm the final decision; or</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">(8) reverse or modify the decision if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision:</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">(i) is unconstitutional;</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">(ii) exceeds the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">final decision maker;</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">(iii) results from an unlawful procedure;</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">(iv) is affected by any other error of law;</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">(v) is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted;</p>\n<p id=\"b618-13\">or</p>\n<p id=\"b618-14\">(vi) is arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-15\">SG \u00a7 10-222(h) (emphasis added). It is clear from the above language that we are limited to reviewing \u201cthe entire record <em>as submitted.\u201d </em>SG \u00a7 10-222(h)(3)(v) (emphasis added); <em>see also Capital Commercial Properties, Inc. v. Montgomery County Planning Board, </em>158 Md.App. 88, 96, 854 A.2d 283 (2004) (\u201c[Ajppellate review of administrative decisions is limited to those issues and concerns raised before the administrative agency.\u201d) The underlying rationale for this principle is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-16\">\u201c \u2018A reviewing court usurps the agency\u2019s function when it sets aside the administrative determination upon a ground not theretofore presented and deprives the [agency] of an opportunity to consider the matter, make its ruling, and state the reasons for its action.\u2019 We do not allow issues to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>be raised for the first time in actions for judicial review of administrative agency orders entered in contested cases because to do so would allow the court to resolve matters <em>ab initio </em>that have been committed to the jurisdiction and expertise of the agency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><em>Capital Commercial Properties, Inc., </em>158 Md.App. at 96-97, 854 A.2d 283 (quoting <em>Delmarva Power &amp; Light Co. v. Public Service Comm\u2019n of Md., </em>370 Md. 1, 32, 803 A.2d 460 (2002)). Because the materials submitted to the circuit court with appellants\u2019 motion to supplement were not part of the record before the Board when it rendered its decision, neither the circuit court nor this Court has authority to review them.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, the circuit court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The Board\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">The Montgomery County Planning Board is \u201cresponsible for planning, platting, and zoning functions primarily local in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>scope,\u201d and has exclusive jurisdiction over \u201cthe administration of subdivision regulations.\u201d Md. Code (2009, 2010 Repl. Vol.) Art. 28, \u00a7 7 \u2014 111(a);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>see also </em>Montgomery County Code (\u201cMCC\u201d) (1994), \u00a7 50-4 (explaining that Chapter 50 of the County Code \u201cshall be administered by the county planning board\u201d). \u201c \u2018Subdivision\u2019 means the division of a lot, tract, or parcel of land into two or more lots ... for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale or building development, and includes re subdivision.\u201d Md.Code Art. 28, \u00a7 7-101(d). A \u201cresubdivision\u201d is \u201c[a] change in any lot line of a recorded lot or parcel of land. Resubdivision includes the assembly of recorded lots or parts of lots.\u201d MCC \u00a7 50-1. The design of lots in a resubdivision is governed by MCC \u00a7 50 \u2014 29(b)(2), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">Lots on a plat for the resubdivision of any lot, tract or other parcel of land that is a part of an existing subdivision previously recorded in a plat book shall be of the same character as to street frontage, alignment, size, shape, width, area and suitability for residential use as other lots within the existing block, neighborhood or subdivision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Appellants contend that the Board\u2019s decision to approve the Plan was erroneous, for two reasons: (1) the Board did not appropriately select the \u201cexisting neighborhood\u201d for the sake of comparing the lots proposed in the Plan; and (2) the Board improperly found that the lots that would result if the Plan were approved would be of the \u201csame character\u201d as the lots in that existing neighborhood. We will discuss each of these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>\n<em>A. Standard, of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">\u201cOn appellate review of the decision of an administrative agency, this Court reviews the agency\u2019s decision, not the circuit court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Halici v.

As the Court of Appeals has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acm\">\u201cA court\u2019s role in reviewing an administrative agency adjudicatory decision is narrow; it is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-5\">In applying the substantial evidence test, a reviewing court decides whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached. A reviewing court should defer to the agency\u2019s fact-finding and drawing of inferences if they are supported by the record. A reviewing court must review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to it; ... the agency\u2019s decision is <em>prima fade </em>correct and presumed valid, and ... it is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence and to draw inferences from that evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-6\"><em>Pautsch v.

In short, in applying the substantial evidence standard, \u201c[t]he test is reasonableness, not rightness.\u201d <em>Alviani v.

Nevertheless,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">\u201cwith regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts. Furthermore, the expertise of the agency in its own field should be respected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-5\"><em>Pautsch, 423 </em>Md. at 253, 31 A.3d 489 (quoting <em>Noland, </em>386 Md. at 572, 873 A.2d 1145).

Legal Interpretation</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">As the Board notes in its Resolution, it used \u201cthe existing neighborhood []as delineated by Staff in the Staff Report[ ]\u201d in reviewing the Plan. The Staff Report stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">Neighborhood Delineation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\">In administering Section 50-29(b)(2) of the Subdivision Regulations, the Planning Board must determine the appropriate \u201cNeighborhood\u201d for evaluating the application. In this instance, the Neighborhood agreed upon by the Applicant and Staff, consists of 54 lots []. The Neighborhood includes all lots with frontage on Gainsborough Road between Seven Locks Road and Fontaine Street. This Neighborhood is consistent with the Neighborhoods accepted by the Planning Board for two other resubdivision application reviews on the same segment of Gainsborough---- The designated neighborhood provides an adequate sample of the lot and development pattern of the area.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-12\">As appellants acknowledge, \u201cMontgomery County Code provides no guideline on what constitutes the \u2018neighborhood\u2019 that is to be used as the basis for determining if the lots in a proposed resubdivision ha[ve] the same character as the existing lots.\u201d Appellants contend, nevertheless, that the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>erred in defining the neighborhood that it used for the proposed resubdivision. Specifically, appellants claim that \u201cthe Board accepted without question the neighborhood proposed by Staff, which consists of lots from two sections of Willerburn Acres ... that differ in their character and history.\u201d Appellants assert that \u201cthe two sections differ widely in character,\u201d because \u201cSection 1 has much larger lots and more trees, wider frontage, and houses set further back,\u201d and because \u201cSection 2 has a curb, but Section 1 does not.\u201d Instead, appellants conclude, the Board should have only defined the neighborhood as Section 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">In response, the Board asserts that, \u201c[a]s the regulatory agency tasked with applying the Subdivision Regulations,\u201d it \u201chas substantial discretion to delineate the \u2018existing neighborhood\u2019 \u201d and \u201cmust be afforded deference when determining the appropriate standards to review preliminary plan applications for conformance to \u00a7 50 \u2014 29(b)(2).\u201d The Board contends that \u201c[i]n the absence of a specific statutory definition of \u2018existing block, neighborhood or subdivision,\u2019 the [ ] Board reasonably interpreted the law as requiring an impact-based test[,]\u201d under which the \u201cexisting neighborhood\u201d includes \u201cthose lots that would be most directly affected by approval of the proposed re subdivision.\u201d In other words, when establishing the boundaries of a neighborhood, the Board \u201cconsiders abutting properties, access to and from the proposed lots, and the consistency of the zoning within the defined boundary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">In <em>Burgess v. 103-29 Ltd. Partnership, </em>the appellants challenged a hearing board\u2019s decision in a zoning case on the issue of whether the board erroneously defined the \u201cneighborhood\u201d of the subject property for purposes of evaluating whether the appellants could obtain a zoning change based on changed conditions in that neighborhood. 123 Md.App. 293, 296-97, 718 A.2d 613, <em>cert. denied, </em>352 Md. 335, 722 A.2d 63 (1998). Collecting Maryland cases on the subject, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">The area constituting the neighborhood of a subject property for the purpose of evaluating change will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. The concept of a neighborhood is a flexible one and will vary according to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>geographical location involved; it being axiomatic that in rural or semi-rural areas ... the neighborhood will be larger and more fluid than in a city or a suburban area. A neighborhood should not be precisely and rigidly defined, but may vary from case to case.... Nevertheless, the neighborhood in any area must be an area which <em>reasonably </em>constitutes the immediate environs of the subject property. As long as the neighborhood delineated by the zoning authority is reasonable, we must give the greatest deference to the zoning authority\u2019s judgment regarding the scope of the neighborhood to be drawn.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 299-300, 718 A.2d 613 (bolded emphasis added) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Although <em>Burgess </em>was a zoning case,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we find the above quoted language instructive in the instant case. Moreover, the absence of a specific definition of \u201cexisting [ ] neighborhood\u201d contained within MCC \u00a7 50-29(b)(2), or as construed by courts, we give \u201cspecial weight\u201d to the agency\u2019s <em>(i.e., </em>the Board\u2019s) interpretation. <em>Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>104 Md.App. at 602, 657 A.2d 372. Therefore, we hold that the Board\u2019s interpretation of \u201cexisting neighborhood\u201d must be reasonable, giving special weight to the Board\u2019s interpretation. Because, in determining the \u201cexisting neighborhood,\u201d the Board considers abutting properties, the access points to and from the proposed lots, and the consistency of the zoning within the defined boundary, we conclude that the Board\u2019s standard is reasonable. Thus the Board did not err, as a matter of law, in adopting such standard in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>2. Substantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Appellants argue that there was not substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s delineation of the existing neighborhood under the Board\u2019s standard. According to appellants, the Staff Report contained two critical pieces of erroneous information regarding the \u201cexisting neighborhood\u201d chosen by the Board as a predicate to reviewing the Plan. First, appellants argue, \u201c[Staff member] Weaver misinformed the Board when he stated that the subject lot is in a transition area between the two sections,\u201d because \u201cthe transition [area] is entirely within Section 2.\u201d Second, appellants claim, the Staff Report erroneously stated that the chosen neighborhood \u201cis consistent with the Neighborhoods accepted by the Board for <em>two other </em>resubdivision application reviews on the same segment of Gainsborough,\u201d (emphasis added) when, in fact, there was only <em>one </em>prior resubdivision application that defined the Neighborhood in that manner. Furthermore, appellants note, the Staff \u201cfailed to mention that there are four other cases where Staff did not extend the neighborhood into Section 2, and in two of them Staff rejected the request by the applicant to so extend the neighborhood.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The Board responds that there was substantial evidence to support its decision to utilize Sections 1 and 2 as the \u201cexisting neighborhood.\u201d First, with regard to the \u201ctransition area\u201d complaint, the Board states that the Staff \u201cwas merely pointing out that the relevant stretch of Gainsborough Road created a transition between the two defined sections of the Willerburn Acres subdivision,\u201d and that appellants\u2019 claim amounts to nothing more than disagreement with the Board\u2019s view that \u201cthe [r]esubdivision will impact both Sections One and Two of the Willerburn Acres subdivision.\u201d Second, the Board responds, \u201c[although there was at least one prior example of a resubdivision in which only Section One was delineated as the \u2018existing neighborhood,\u2019 [S]taff did not bring it to the [] Board\u2019s attention because it was not material to the case before [it].\u201d Moreover, the Board states, it is not bound by the \u201cexisting neighborhood\u201d delineation from previous applications involving nearby lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Even accepting, for the sake of argument only, appellants\u2019 claim that the Board\u2019s \u201cexisting neighborhood\u201d was only used on one previous occasion, rather than two, there is substantial evidence in the record to support the Board\u2019s delineation of the neighborhood.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As the Staff Report explained, the delineated 54-lot neighborhood \u201cincludes all lots with frontage on Gainsborough Road between Seven Locks Road and Fontaine Street.\u201d Because the lots that would result from the Plan being approved are located on Gainsborough Road between Seven Locks Road and Fontaine Street, it is clear that all of the \u201cabutting properties\u201d were included in the \u201cexisting neighborhood.\u201d Moreover, the only access points to the proposed lots, as well as to the abutting properties, are from Seven Locks Road and Fontaine Street. Finally, the Board\u2019s delineation of the \u201cexisting neighborhood\u201d is supported by the Staffs substantial experience with resubdivision in Willerburn Acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">As we have said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">[W]hen the landowners present one definition of the neighborhood and the planning commission presents another, there exists \u201can honest dispute as to what comprises the neighborhood mak[ing] the issue fairly debatable, ... [such that] the city\u2019s choice to accept [one] definition cannot successfully be questioned.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-7\"><em>Burgess, </em>123 Md.App. at 301, 718 A.2d 613 (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Rockville v. Stone, </em>271 Md. 655, 661, 319 A.2d 536 (1974)). In the instant case, as in <em>Burgess, </em>there were differing definitions of the neighborhood offered by the landowners <em>(ie., </em>appellants) on one hand and the \u201cplanning commission\u201d (ie., the Board) on the other hand. In such a situation, the delineation of neighborhood is \u201cfairly debatable;\u201d as a result, the Board\u2019s resolution is a reasonable one. <em>Id.; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number><em>see also Alviani, </em>365 Md. at 108, 775 A.2d 1234 (\u201cThe test is reasonableness, not rightness.\u201d) (citation omitted). Accordingly we conclude that there is substantial evidence supporting the Board\u2019s delineation of the \u201cexisting neighborhood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">\n<em>C. Same Character</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">As discussed above, when evaluating a proposed resubdivision plan\u2019s compliance with MCC \u00a7 50 \u2014 29(b)(2), the Board must make findings that the plan complies with <em>seven criteria. Lee, </em>107 Md.App. at 495, 668 A.2d 980. Here, however, appellants concede in their brief that \u201c[t]he three qualitative criteria (alignment, shape, and suitability for residential use) <em>are not </em>in issue.\u201d (Emphasis added). Therefore, we limit our review to the Board\u2019s consideration of the four so-called \u201cquantitative criteria\u201d \u2014 namely, 1) size, 2) width, 3) street frontage, and 4) area.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">1. Legal Interpretation</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Appellants contend that, even if the neighborhood chosen by the Board was not erroneous, the Board erred in determining that the proposed lots are of the same character as the neighborhood. Relying exclusively on this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Lee, </em>appellants assert that \u201c[f]or a lot to be of the same character as the other lots in the neighborhood, there must be a <em>high correlation </em>with respect to each of the quantitative criteria set forth in \u00a7 50-29(b)(2) of the Montgomery County Code.\u201d (Emphasis added). Appellants argue that \u201chigh correlation\u201d should be defined to mean \u201csomewhere around the median, not near either end of the range.\u201d In addition, appellants contend that the Board should be required to \u201cdivide the lots into three equal groups: the lowest third, the middle third, and the highest third. <em>High correlation would then require that the value he in the middle third with respect to each criterion.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Appellants conclude that the Board\u2019s failure to adopt this process renders its interpretation of MCC \u00a7 50 \u2014 29(b)(2) erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">The Board disagrees with appellants\u2019 proposed interpretation of the \u201chigh correlation\u201d standard set forth in <em>Lee. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Because \u201c[t]his Court must afford the [ ] Board deference in its administration of regulatory tests derived from [the Subdivision Regulations],\u201d the Board contends that under the \u201chigh correlation\u201d standard, \u201ceach relevant characteristic of a resubdivided lot must conform to, or fall <em>within the range </em>for that characteristic of the delineated neighborhood\u2019s lots.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">As this Court explained in <em>Lee, </em>\u201c[t]he term \u2018character\u2019 is not defined in the Montgomery County Code, nor has the word been interpreted by Maryland courts as it relates to the Montgomery County Code.\u201d 107 Md.App. at 494, 668 A.2d 980 (footnote omitted). Applying the general principle that \u201cwe assume that the words used have their ordinary and natural meaning\u201d when interpreting a statute, we relied upon a dictionary definition of \u201ccharacter\u201d for illumination. <em>See id. </em>\u201c \u2018Character,\u2019 \u201d we said, means \u201c \u2018the aggregate of features and traits that form the apparent individual nature of some person or thing.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting WEBSTER\u2019S ENCYCLOPEDIC UNABRIDGED DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 247 (1989)) (emphasis omitted). Thus, we concluded that \u201c[t]he character of a neighborhood [ ] is the aggregate of features and traits that give it its distinctive look and feel.\u201d 107 Md.App. at 494, 668 A.2d 980. Specifically, \u201c[a] neighborhood\u2019s character is a function of the seven criteria specified in section 50 \u2014 29(b)(2).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">We then explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">The Board must not just <em>consider </em>all seven criteria listed in section 50 \u2014 29(b)(2) but must find that a proposed re subdivision <em>complies </em>with all seven criteria. Compliance with the criteria ensures that the lots will be of the same character as existing lots in the neighborhood, block, or subdivision. To prove that the seven criteria have been met, lots need not be cookie cutter matches to existing lots in the neighborhood. The correlation, however, between area, size, shape, street frontage, alignment, width, and suitability for residential use of the proposed resubdivided lots and existing lots must be high in order to meet the requirements of section 50-29.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 495, 668 A.2d 980 (first and second emphases in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Although \u201ccorrelation\u201d is a term of art in the field of statistics, we interpret \u201ccorrelation\u201d in the context of the instant case to have its common meaning. <em>See id. </em>at 494, 668 A.2d 980. \u201cCorrelation\u201d is \u201c[a] causal, complementary, parallel, or reciprocal relationship, especially a structural, functional, or qualitative correspondence between two comparable entities.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary 411 (4th ed. 2000). Two or more entities have a \u201cparallel\u201d relationship when they have \u201ccomparable parts, analogous aspects, or <em>readily recognized similarities.\u201d Id. </em>at 1274, 668 A.2d 980 (emphasis added). Thus, in the context of MCC \u00a7 50-29(b)(2), a resubdivision that has a high correlation to an existing neighborhood is one for which the proposed resubdivided lots have readily recognized similarities to lots in the existing neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Assuming the conceded correlation as to alignment, shape, and suitability for residential use, and addressing only the four quantitative criteria at issue, we agree with the Board, and hold that \u201chigh correlation\u201d exists when all four quantitative criteria of the lots in a proposed resubdivision plan fall <em>within the range </em>established by the respective quantitative criteria possessed by the lots within the exiting neighborhood. In reaching this conclusion, we reject appellants\u2019 invitation to engraft a \u201cmedian\u201d requirement onto MCC \u00a7 50-29(b)(2), because doing so would impermissibly add language to the regulation. <em>See Kushell v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, </em>385 Md. 563, 576, 870 A.2d 186 (2005) (noting that \u201c[a] court may neither add nor delete language so as to reflect intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language\u201d of a statute or regulation) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, we are mindful of the settled principle that we should \u201cgive special weight to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>104 Md.App. at 602, 657 A.2d 372. Adopting the Board\u2019s position, in our view, ensures that the resulting lots from an approved resubdivision will have readily recognizable similarities to neighboring properties without imposing the type of \u201ccookie cutter\u201d restriction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>that the <em>Lee </em>Court expressly rejected. <em>See Lee, </em>107 Md.App. at 495, 668 A.2d 980. Accordingly, the Board did not err in its interpretation of the \u201chigh correlation\u201d standard set forth in <em>Lee.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">2. Substantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Appellants contend that the Board\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence. Specifically, because the proposed resubdivision lots in the instant appeal are \u201cin the lower third with respect to each of the four quantitative criteria,\u201d appellants claim that there is not substantial evidence of a \u201chigh correlation\u201d with the existing neighborhood. Appellants thus conclude that upholding the Board\u2019s decision \u201cwould not be consistent with the intent of Montgomery County Code \u00a7 50 \u2014 29(b)(2) nor with the guidelines of <em>[Lee </em>].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">The Board responds that it \u201csupported its findings for each of the quantitative criteria with substantial evidence.\u201d Specifically, the Board contends that it \u201cfound that the [rjesubdivision complies with all four of the quantitative criteria, noting that the new lots are within the existing range as to each.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">In <em>Lee, </em>this Court reversed the Board, in large part because we found that \u201c[m]any of the Board\u2019s conclusions were not based on substantial evidence.\u201d 107 Md.App. at 498, 668 A.2d 980. In particular, we noted, there was \u201cno information in the record as to the width of any of the proposed resubdivided lots.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496-97, 668 A.2d 980. With regard to the size of the proposed lots, we disagreed with the Board\u2019s finding that the six proposed resubdivided lots were of the same character as the fourteen existing lots in the neighborhood, because \u201cat least two of the lots are smaller than any other lot.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498, 668 A.2d 980. On the issue of frontage, we again conclud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>ed that the Board erred, because there was no information in the record about the length of frontage of the existing lots or three of the six proposed lots. <em>Id. </em>at 499, 668 A.2d 980. Moreover, the three lots for which length of the frontage was clear \u201chad no street frontage on existing streets,\u201d and thus, we reasoned, \u201cclearly do not meet the street frontage criteria.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The case before us is plainly distinguishable from <em>Lee </em>on its facts. First of all, the Staff Report contains a five-page \u201cComparable Lot Data Table\u201d containing precise numerical data concerning all of the seven statutory criteria for each of the existing 54 lots, as well as the two proposed re subdivided lots. In contrast to <em>Lee, </em>the Board <em>did </em>consider, and presented specific quantitative information concerning the size, width, frontage, and area of the proposed lots, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">Size: The lot sizes are in character with the size of existing lots in the neighborhood. The range of Neighborhood lot sizes are [sic] from 9,783 square feet to 54,673 square feet. The lots are at 24,011 square feet for Lot 60 and 20,118 square feet for Lot 61 and within the range of all lot sizes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">Width: The lots will be in character with existing lots in the Neighborhood with respect to width. The two lots will be subject to an established building line (EBL) at the time of building permit. The Applicant has calculated the proposed EBL and measured the lot width at that point. The width of Lot 60 will be 108 feet and the width of Lot 61 will be 99 feet. The lot widths in the Neighborhood range from 82 feet to 203 feet. The lots are within the range of overall lot widths.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-8\">Frontage: The lots will be of the same character as existing lots in the Neighborhood \"with respect to lot frontage. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>lots have frontages of 101 feet and 96 feet for proposed lots 60 and 61, respectively. There is a wide range of frontage widths for the existing lots in the Neighborhood from 25 feet to 204 feet. The lots fit into the middle of this range.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-4\">Area: The lots will be of the same character as other lots in the Neighborhood with respect to buildable area. The building envelope \u201carea\u201d for the lots in the Neighborhood range from 3,437 square feet to 38,736 square feet. Lot 60 and 61 will have buildable areas of 9,454 and 7,604 respectively.[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Therefore, it is clear that the Board applied the \u201cwithin the range\u201d legal standard to the proposed lots in the instant case, and that there was substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s findings that the proposed lots fit within the range of the size, width, frontage, and area of all the lots in the existing neighborhood. Accordingly, we shall uphold the Board\u2019s decision and thus affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED; APPELLANTS TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number><em>Appendix A. </em>The Existing Neighborhood (outlined area).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-9\">.

Appellants cite no authority, however, permitting the Board to re-open the record based on a reconsideration petition. Indeed, the Board's Rules of Procedure, which became effective January 26, 2007 and apply to \u201cany ... Preliminary Plan (of Subdivision or Re-subdivision),\u201d provide that after the Board\u2019s vote, <em>\u201cthe record of proceedings held before the Planning Board shall be closed.\u201d </em>Montgomery Cnty, Md., Planning Board Rules of Procedure, \u00a7\u00a7 1.3, 2.2.3(b), 4.11.2 (emphasis added). Thus, once the Board approved the Plan on May 5, 2011, which was two weeks prior to appellants\u2019 motion being filed, the Board's rules mandated that the record be closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">In addition, appellants take issue with the fact that the Board\u2019s Resolution, which was adopted after its vote to approve the Plan, was included as part of the administrative record. The Board\u2019s Rules of Procedure plainly state that \u201c[t]he adoption of a Resolution <em>does not reopen the record of proceedings^]\u201d Id. </em>at \u00a7 4.11.3 (emphasis added).
