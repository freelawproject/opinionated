KENNEY, III, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A78\">(Retired, Specially Assigned).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-14\">This appeal arises from the denial, without a hearing, of a pro se petition for writ of actual innocence filed by appellant, Brian Han Keyes, on December 27, 2011 in the Circuit Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>for Prince George\u2019s County. In his petition, appellant challenges his convictions in that court related to an attempted armed robbery. For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">On February 14, 1995, a jury convicted appellant of first-degree murder, attempted robbery with a deadly weapon, and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. He was sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility of parole, in addition to consecutive sentences for the other convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A panel of this Court affirmed those judgments in an unreported opinion. <em>Keyes v. State, </em>No. 414, Sept. Term 1995 (filed Nov. 30,1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">In his direct appeal, he raised two allegations of error, one of which is pertinent here; namely, that the trial court erred in unduly inhibiting his cross-examination of a key State\u2019s witness, Lucio Ramirez. We shall briefly set forth facts included in the Court\u2019s earlier opinion to facilitate our analysis of the issue now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">\u201cThe killing was the culmination of two-to-three hours of ethnic conflict between the victim group, consisting of the murder victim and three other Hispanic-Americans, and a group of three or four African-American males,\u201d one of whom was appellant. <em>Keyes v. State, </em>slip op. at 1. Lucio Ramirez and three others, including Abilio Ortez Chavez (the murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>victim), Melvin Chavez, and Jos\u00e9 Moya-Ramirez, had been sitting in front of an apartment building, drinking beer, when they were accosted by the African-American group (including appellant). <em>Id. </em>The Hispanic-American group retreated inside to the safety of the apartment building, locking the door behind them. \u201cThe African-American males knocked on the door and tried to get in but eventually left.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">\u201cHalf an hour later,\u201d the Hispanic-American group ventured outside, only to encounter the African-American group, which by then had returned. <em>Id. </em>at 2. Once again, the Hispanic-Americans retreated inside and the African-Americans tried to force their way inside but were unsuccessful. <em>Id. </em>When the Hispanic-Americans ventured outside a third time, they encountered appellant. <em>Id. </em>The Hispanic-Americans attempted to retreat yet again, but one of them, Abilio Chavez, did not make it. \u201cJust as he reached the front steps\u201d of the apartment building, appellant fired \u201cfour or five shots, fatally wounding\u201d him. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">\u201cEach of the three surviving Hispanic-Americans made both pretrial identifications from photographs and in-trial identifications of the appellant as a member of the group that had approached them on three occasions and specifically as the shooter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In a statement appellant made to a police detective, he \u201cadmitted that he and a friend named Sean had gone to\u201d the scene of the killing on the night in question \u201cto \u2018rob Hispanics.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>He claimed, however, that Sean was the shooter and that Sean had \u201cacknowledged to him that he had shot \u2018one of the Spanish boys.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">At trial, appellant attempted to impeach Lucio Ramirez, based on the commission of a prior bad act, distribution of a controlled dangerous substance (\u201cCDS\u201d). <em>Keyes v. State, </em>slip op. at 3. Maryland Rule 5-608(b) permits, in the trial court\u2019s discretion, \u201cany witness to be examined regarding the witness\u2019s own prior conduct that did not result in a conviction but that the court finds probative of a character trait of untruthfulness.\u201d The Rule further provides that, upon objection, a \u201creasonable factual basis\u201d that the conduct occurred must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>established and that \u201c[t]he conduct may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">When the State objected, pointing out that there had been no conviction for CDS distribution, appellant asserted that a conviction was not required under Rule 5 \u2014 608(b) and that the charging document, under which Ramirez had been charged, indicated CDS distribution, which was an impeachable offense. <em>See State v. Giddens, </em>335 Md. 205, 217, 642 A.2d 870 (1994) (holding that \u201ca prior conviction for distribution of cocaine is relevant to credibility and as such is admissible for impeachment purposes\u201d). \u201cThe State countered that a \u2018mere charging document\u2019 does not establish a conviction, but that the distribution charge had been, prior to trial, \u2018amended down to simple possession.\u2019 \u201d <em>Keyes v. State, </em>slip op. at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">This Court upheld the trial court\u2019s ruling sustaining the State\u2019s objection and prohibited appellant from impeaching Ramirez with the charged CDS distribution activities. The Court reasoned that the trial court was, understandably, concerned that, by permitting the proposed line of cross-examination, \u201cthe situation was rife with the danger that extrinsic evidence,\u201d namely, the charging document, \u201cwould have come in ... through the \u2018back door\u2019 of the questioning itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. Moreover, we observed that the trial court had \u201cdigested the charging document in full detail and concluded that even if the facts contained therein were proved, the result would have been a conviction for simple possession,\u201d which, unlike CDS distribution, is not an impeachable offense. <em>Id. </em>at 5 (citing <em>Morales v. State, </em>325 Md. 330, 339, 600 A.2d 851 (1992) (observing that conviction for possession of PCP is \u201cnot relevant to credibility\u201d and \u201cwould not be admissible for purposes of impeachment\u201d)). The Court also noted that the trial judge, in a sound exercise of discretion, weighed the probative value of that evidence against the unfair prejudice in admitting it and found that the latter \u201cfar outweigh[ed]\u201d the former. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Turning to the instant case, appellant asserts that, in September 2011, \u201cwhile attending a religious service\u201d at North Branch Correctional Institution, he engaged in a conversation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>with Jose Ulloa, another inmate at that facility, and learned that Ulloa possessed two reports, purportedly written by a Montgomery County Police Officer, Karen McNally, that mentioned appellant by name and had been included in the discovery materials that had been provided to Ulloa, prior to his trial. Ulloa permitted appellant to photocopy those reports, and they are now the basis of his petition for writ of actual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">According to appellant, Officer McNally\u2019s reports constitute \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d under Maryland Code, Criminal Procedure Article, \u00a7 8-301 and \u201ccreate[] a substantial or significant possibility that the result [of his trial] may have been different.\u201d He characterizes those reports as Brady<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> material, \u201cwhich the prosecutor suppressed or withheld that would have been favorable to\u201d him, because they were \u201csomewhat exculpatory\u201d and \u201cprovided the basis for impeaching two of the three State\u2019s key witnesses who testified\u201d in his 1995 trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">On January 18, 2012, the circuit court issued an order summarily denying appellant\u2019s petition for writ of actual innocence without a hearing, and appellant noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A1C\">As appellant points out, the Court of Appeals, in <em>Douglas v. State, </em>423 Md. 156, 31 A.3d 250 (2011), held that a person convicted of a crime and eligible to file a petition for writ of actual innocence under Criminal Procedure Article, \u00a7 8-301 \u201cis entitled to a hearing on the merits of\u2019 such a petition that \u201csufficiently pleads grounds for relief under the statute, includes a request for a hearing, and complies with the filing requirements of C.P. \u00a7 8-301(b).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165, 31 A.3d 250. Contending that his petition satisfies all of these require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>ments, appellant complains that the circuit court erred in denying his petition without a hearing. We reject that contention, because, as we explain, the petition does not sufficiently plead grounds for relief under the statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The statute provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">(a) A person charged by indictment or criminal information with a crime triable in circuit court and convicted of that crime may, at any time, file a petition for writ of actual innocence in the circuit court for the county in which the conviction was imposed if the person claims that there is newly discovered evidence that:</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">(1) creates a substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different, as that standard has been judicially determined; and</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">(2) could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Maryland Rule 4-331.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">(b) A petition filed under this section shall:</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">(1) be in writing;</p>\n<p id=\"b688-11\">(2) state in detail the grounds on which the petition is based;</p>\n<p id=\"b688-12\">(3) describe the newly discovered evidence;</p>\n<p id=\"b688-13\">(4) contain or be accompanied by a request for hearing if a hearing is sought; and</p>\n<p id=\"b688-14\">(5) distinguish the newly discovered evidence claimed in the petition from any claims made in prior petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>(c) (1) A petitioner shall notify the State in writing of the filing of a petition under this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">(2) The State may file a response to the petition within 90 days after receipt of the notice required under this subsection or within the period of time that the court orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">(d) (1) Before a hearing is held on a petition filed under this section, the victim or victim\u2019s representative shall be notified of the hearing as provided under \u00a7 11-104 or \u00a7 11-503 of this article.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">(2) A victim or victim\u2019s representative has the right to attend a hearing on a petition filed under this section as provided under \u00a7 11-102 of this article.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">(e) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the court shall hold a hearing on a petition filed under this section if the petition satisfies the requirements of subsection (b) of this section and a hearing was requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">(2) The court may dismiss a petition without a hearing if the court finds that the petition fails to assert grounds on which relief may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">(f) (1) In ruling on a petition filed under this section, the court may set aside the verdict, resentence, grant a new trial, or correct the sentence, as the court considers appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">(2) The court shall state the reasons for its ruling on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">(g) A petitioner in a proceeding under this section has the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-12\">Md.Gode (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol., 2012 Supp.), \u00a7 8-301 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCP\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-13\">Subsection (e)(1) states that, \u201c[ejxcept as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection,\u201d a circuit court \u201cshall\u201d hold a hearing on an actual innocence petition if it \u201csatisfies the requirements of subsection (b) of this section and a hearing was requested.\u201d Paragraph (2) authorizes the circuit court to dismiss an actual innocence petition without a hearing if it finds \u201cthat the petition fails to assert grounds on which relief may be granted.\u201d \u201cGrounds\u201d on which relief may be granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>are set forth in subsection (a): a claim of \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d that both \u201ccreates a substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different, as that standard has been judicially determined\u201d and \u201ccould not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Maryland Rule 4-331.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Here, with the previously noted exception, the form requirements of subsection (b) have been met \u2014 the petition is in writing; it states in detail the grounds on which it is based; it describes in detail the purported newly discovered evidence and attaches that evidence as exhibits to the petition; it contains a request for a hearing; and, as it is appellant\u2019s first such petition under CP \u00a7 8-301, the requirement, under CP \u00a7 8 \u2014 301(b)(5), that it \u201cdistinguish the newly discovered evidence claimed in the petition from any claims made in prior petitions,\u201d is not applicable. <em>See Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 184-85 &amp; n. 16, 31 A.3d 250 (interpreting \u201cprior petitions,\u201d under CP \u00a7 8 \u2014 301(b)(5), as including only petitions brought under the statute and not including postconviction petitions).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Thus, the question before us is whether \u201cthe petition sufficiently pleads grounds for relief under the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165, 31 A.3d 250. CP \u00a7 8 \u2014 301(a)(1)\u2014(2), which defines such \u201cgrounds,\u201d re-frames the question, more specifically, as: does appellant\u2019s petition present \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d that both \u201ccreates a substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different, as that standard has been judicially determined\u201d and \u201ccould not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Maryland Rule 4-331\u201d? Only if this question is answered in the affirmative is a hearing required.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Having construed the petition liberally, as instructed by the <em>Douglas </em>Court, 423 Md. at 182-83, 31 A.3d 250 we conclude that much of the claimed \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d asserted in appellant\u2019s petition is not, in fact, \u201cnewly discovered evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>dence\u201d and that the remainder, even if \u201cnewly discovered,\u201d fails to \u201ccreate[] a substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore the petition does not sufficiently plead grounds for relief under CP \u00a7 8-301.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Because CP \u00a7 8-301 is of recent vintage, we look to cases interpreting and applying Maryland Rule 4-331 (or its federal counterpart, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33), which governs motions for new trial, including motions grounded upon claims of newly discovered evidence. Indeed, CP \u00a7 8-301 directs us to do so. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 (a)(1) (defining the persuasiveness standard as whether newly discovered evidence \u201ccreates a substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different, as that standard has been judicially determined\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 (a)(2) (defining a due diligence standard by express reference to Rule 4-331).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">At the outset, we recognize that, generally, appellate review of a circuit court\u2019s denial of a motion for new trial is limited to whether the trial court abused its discretion, <em>see Campbell v. State, </em>373 Md. 637, 665, 821 A.2d 1 (2003), but, because the issue before us is the legal sufficiency of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>petition, our review is de novo.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That said, caselaw addressing motions for new trial, on the grounds of newly discovered evidence, is instructive in determining what is \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d and when it is sufficiently persuasive so as to \u201ccreate[ ] a substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">We begin with the observation that many of the facts alleged in appellant\u2019s petition took place months after his trial, which concluded on March 15, 1995. For example, according to Exhibit A of the petition, which purported to cover Officer McNally\u2019s observations during the time period from August 19,1995 through August 29,1995,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">Cl informant called and told me that a subject by the name of Alfonso Martinez was at [address redacted] on 8-18-95 at about 1500 hrs. arguing (sic) with Melvin about the fact that he had encroached on other dealers[\u2019] territory, which the Cl claims is the motive for the shootings. Martinez is a dealer and lives at [address redacted]. He also have (sic) a lady friend who lives at [address redacted] in Langley Park.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Later in that report, it states: \u201cWriter observed Tigre at AH Bacon Funeral home on 14th St. on 8-27-95. He came with a group of 8-10 drug seller/gang types.\u201d And, in Exhibit B, dated September 11, 1995, it states that, beginning in April 1995, Lucio Amaya \u201cmoved up quickly to the top with the help of Melvin Chavez\u201d and became a \u201cbig time\u201d drug dealer in Langley Park.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">Even if we assume the authenticity, accuracy, and truthfulness of those reports, it is clear that those events took place after appellant was convicted and sentenced. They could have had no effect on his trial and, thus, do not qualify as \u201cnewly discovered evidence.\u201d Although we found no Maryland authority expressly so holding, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in affirming the denial of a new trial motion, considered a similar issue and reached precisely that conclusion. <em>See United States v. Lafayette, </em>983 F.2d 1102, 1105 (D.C.Cir.1993) (observing that, \u201c[i]n general, to justify a new trial, \u2018newly discovered evidence\u2019 must have been in existence at the time of trial\u201d and that \u201c[ejvents and transactions occurring after the trial obviously could not have been the subject of testimony at the trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">We turn now to those parts of appellant\u2019s petition that are based upon alleged events taking place prior to his trial and sentencing. Exhibit A of the petition states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">Writer is personally familiar with all victims with exception of Jose Amaya. Melvin Chavez, Lucio Amaya and Jos\u00e9 Amicar Moya Ramirez were all eye witnesses to an 0100 in Prince George\u2019s County in August 1994 \u2014 victim Abilio Ortez Chavez (no relation to Melvin Chavez) although all are from same area in Honduras.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] Writer had constant contact with witnesses for six months and throughout the trial of Brian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Han Keyes who was found guilty and got life plus 40 years. The writer, P.G. Detectives and [Assistant State\u2019s Attorney] were aware of the fact that Melvin and Lucio were involved with drugs and that Abilio Ortez \u201cLito\u201d was an innocent victim who was at the wrong place at the wrong time. The writer was responsible for all aspects of witness interviews, Photo arrays, transportation of witnesses and making arrangements for witnesses to return from Honduras and Denver, Colorado for trial. Writer also assisted P.G. County Police in relocating witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">In Exhibit B, it is stated that, according to a confidential informant, \u201cfrom the time of the arrest of Brian Han Keyes in August 94 until approx. Feb. or March of 95,\u201d Ramirez \u201cwas a small time seller in Langley Park.\u201d The informant further stated that \u201cabout two weeks before the 0100\u201d he \u201csaw Lucio in front of the Laundrymat next to Nations Bank in Langley Park at about 1400 hrs.\u201d According to the report, the confidential informant approached Ramirez and engaged in a brief conversation, during which another, unnamed, person approached and \u201cbegan \u2018negotiating\u2019 with [Ramirez]\u201d and that, during that negotiation, \u201cthey discussed prices between $23,000 and $25,000.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">To the extent that these reported events and facts that took place prior to appellant\u2019s trial and sentencing might be generally considered \u201cnewly discovered evidence,\u201d under Maryland Rule 4-331, they would be \u201cmerely impeaching\u201d evidence, which does not satisfy the requirements of CP \u00a7 8 \u2014 301(a)(1). <em>See Argyrou v. State, </em>349 Md. 587, 601, 709 A.2d 1194 (1998) (observing that, to entitle defendant to new trial, newly discovered evidence \u201cmust be more than merely cumulative or impeaching\u201d) (citation and quotation omitted); <em>Love v. State, </em>95 Md.App. 420, 432, 621 A.2d 910 (1993) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">In <em>Jackson v. State, </em>164 Md.App. 679, 697, 884 A.2d 694 (2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>390 Md. 501, 889 A.2d 418 (2006), we considered what we characterized as the \u201cpivotally important\u201d distinction between \u201cimpeaching\u201d and \u201cmerely impeaching\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>evidence, in the context of a motion for new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-4\">Newly discovered evidence that a State\u2019s witness had a number of convictions for crimes involving truth and veracity or had lied on a number of occasions about other matters might have a bearing on that witness\u2019s testimonial credibility, but would not have a direct bearing on the merits of the trial under review. Such evidence would constitute collateral impeachment and would, therefore, be \u201cmerely impeaching.\u201d If the newly discovered evidence was that the State\u2019s witness had been mistaken, or even deliberately false, about inconsequential details that did [not] go to the core question of guilt or innocence, such evidence would offer peripheral contradiction and would, therefore, be \u201cmerely impeaching.\u201d If the newly discovered evidence, on the other hand, was that the State\u2019s witness had actually testified falsely on the core merits of the case under review, that evidence, albeit coincidentally impeaching, would be directly exculpatory evidence on the merits and could not, therefore, be dismissed as \u201cmerely impeaching.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 697-98, 884 A.2d 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Here, with one exception, appellant\u2019s petition presents allegations which, if believed, might have established that a State\u2019s witness was a \u201cbig time\u201d drug dealer rather than a mere drug user. Such conduct by a State\u2019s witness could have established a basis for impeaching his testimony under Maryland Rule 5-608(b), as appellant unsuccessfully attempted to do at his trial. <em>Keyes v. State, </em>slip op at 3. But such evidence falls far short of having \u201ca direct bearing on the merits of the trial under review.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>164 Md.App. at 698, 884 A.2d 694. As the Court of Appeals concluded in <em>Campbell v. State, </em>373 Md. 637, 671-72, 821 A.2d 1 (2003): \u201cEven if the additional evidence \u2018may\u2019 produce a different result at a new trial, there is not a \u2018substantial or significant possibility\u2019 that it would do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">That leaves one remaining allegation. According to appellant, Officer McNally\u2019s reports suggest that a State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>witness received leniency in exchange for his testimony and that fact was not revealed during trial, but appellant\u2019s petition contains no factual support for that allegation. Indeed, and as the State contends, appellant\u2019s contention that \u201cthe newly discovered evidence shows that both Lucio [Ramirez] and Melvin [Chavez]\u201d received \u201csubstantial\u201d benefits in exchange for their testimony against appellant \u2014 that their CDS distribution charges were placed on the stet docket \u2014 is simply a bald assertion. If a conclusory allegation, unsupported by evidence, is deemed sufficient to state grounds for relief under CP \u00a7 8-301(a), then the requirement of CP \u00a7 8 \u2014 301(e)(2) that the petition \u201cassert grounds on which relief may be granted\u201d would be easily circumvented. We conclude that the circuit court was not required to consider a bald, unsupported factual allegation, and, to the extent it may not have done so, it did not err in denying the petition without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF ACTUAL INNOCENCE AFFIRMED.

For first-degree murder, he was sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility of parole. His conviction of attempted robbery with a deadly weapon of the murder victim was merged into the first-degree murder conviction. <em>See Newton </em>v. <em>State, </em>280 Md. 260, 273-74, 373 A.2d 262 (1977) (holding that \"separate convictions and sentences for the felony of attempted robbery and murder committed in the perpetration of that felony constitute, under the required evidence test, double punishment for the same offense in violation of the Fifth Amendment's double jeopardy clause\u201d). For attempted robbery with a deadly weapon of the second, surviving victim, he was sentenced to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. For the handgun conviction, he was sentenced to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment, five years of which was without possibility of parole. All sentences were to run consecutively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b687-9\">. <em>Brady v.

We note that, under Maryland Rule 4-332(d)(9), a petition for writ of actual innocence shall state \"that the conviction sought to be vacated is based on an offense that the petitioner did not commit,\u201d a requirement not included in the petition before us. As indicated in <em>Douglas v. State, </em>423 Md. 156, 182 n. 14, 31 A.3d 250 (2011), Rule 4-332 became effective on October 1, 2011 and applies to all petitions filed on or after that date, as was the petition in this case. Because the circuit court did not grant leave to amend the petition prior to dismissing it, <em>see </em>Md. Rule 4-332(h) (stating that amendments \"shall be freely allowed in order to do substantial justice\u201d), and made no mention in its order as to the reasons it denied the petition, we do not rely upon noncompliance with Rule 4-332 for affirmance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b690-7\">. Appellant filed a petition seeking postconviction relief, under CP \u00a7 7-101 <em>et seq., </em>which was denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b691-7\">. In its brief, the State contends that \"[a]t no point did [appellant] allege, let alone provide a basis upon which the circuit court could find, that the evidence that he claimed to be newly discovered could not have been discovered within the time frame set forth in Rule 4-331.\u201d Appellant, however, asserts in his petition that the State committed a <em>Brady </em>violation in suppressing Officer McNally\u2019s reports and that he did not, in fact, become aware of those reports until September 18, 2011. Contrasted with <em>Douglas v. State, </em>423 Md. 156, 187, 31 A.3d 250 (2011), where the Court of Appeals observed that \"evidence that is known but unavailable does not constitute 'newly discovered evidence,\u2019 \u201d the evidence here is alleged to be both unknown (to appellant) and unavailable. Construing appellant\u2019s pro se petition liberally, <em>see id. </em>at 182-83, 31 A.3d 250 it is reasonable to infer that appellant is asserting that he acted with due diligence, or, in the words of CP \u00a7 8-3 01 (a)(2), that the evidence \"could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Maryland Rule 4-331.\u201d Consequently, in affirming the circuit court\u2019s denial of appellant's petition, we do not rely upon appellant\u2019s failure to plead to or exercise due diligence in discovering the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b692-7\">. <em>Douglas </em>is, thus far, the only reported Maryland opinion addressing the legal sufficiency of an actual innocence petition. Although that opinion does not expressly recite the standard of review it applied, a fair reading indicates that the <em>Douglas </em>Court applied a de novo standard. 423 Md. at 177-88, 31 A.3d 250. For example, at the conclusion of its opinion, the <em>Douglas </em>Court stated that \"decisions on the merits of requests for new trials based on newly discovered evidence, whether filed pursuant to Rule 4 \u2014 331 or ... C.P. \u00a7 8-301, are committed to the hearing court\u2019s sound discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 188, 31 A.3d 250 (emphasis added). By negative inference, it follows that decisions as to the legal sufficiency of an actual innocence petition would be reviewed de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">This conclusion is consistent with decisional law covering a wide range of subjects. <em>See, e.g., United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n v. Riley, </em>393 Md. 55, 67, 899 A.2d 819 (2006) (observing that appellate court reviewing grant of summary judgment \"examines the same information from the record and determines the same issues of law as the trial court\u201d and, thus, applies de novo review); <em>Reichs Ford Rd. Joint Venture v. State Rds. Comm\u2019n, </em>388 Md. 500, 509, 880 A.2d 307 (2005) (observing that appellate court \u201creview[s] the grant of a motion to dismiss <em>de novo \u201d) </em>(citation omitted); <em>Calomiris v. Woods, </em>353 Md. 425, 434, 727 A.2d 358 (1999) (observing that \"the determination of ambiguily [in a contract] is one of law, not fact, and that determination is subject to <em>de novo </em>review by the appellate court\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b693-7\">.
