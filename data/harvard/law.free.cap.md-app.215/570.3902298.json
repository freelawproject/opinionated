On appeal, she challenges the court\u2019s denial of her motion to suppress evidence police discovered during a warrantless search of her vehicle. The State concedes error. We disagree with the State\u2019s conclusion, however,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, for the following reasons, we shall affirm Coley\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Facts and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">On appeal of a court\u2019s decision not to suppress evidence, our review is confined to the record of the suppression hearing. <em>See, e.g., Longshore v. State, </em>399 Md. 486, 498, 924 A.2d 1129, 1135 (2007). The record of that December 19, 2012 hearing reveals the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Deputy William Bodnar of the Caroline County Sheriffs Office testified that, on July 8, 2012, at about 7:00 p.m., he was dispatched to Walker\u2019s Grocery Store, located at 18230 Henderson Road in Marydel. He was assisted by Trooper Norton of the Maryland State Police.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Over a several-day period occurring four or five days prior to July 8, Deputy Bodnar had been called to the store two or three times per day. Employees of the store had reported a white female who would arrive at the store in a black Ford vehicle and loiter in front of the store for short periods of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>time. While she was there, Hispanic males would enter the store, purchase condoms, and leave with the white female in her vehicle. Store employees believed that the female was engaging in prostitution. Deputy Bodnar had made contact and conversed with the female, whom he identified as Coley, multiple times over that several-day period. In one of those conversations, Coley \u201cadvised that she was a prior heroin user and she had been clean for approximately one year, close to a year.\u201d On July 7, Deputy Bodnar had served Coley with a cease and desist letter prohibiting her from loitering in front of Walker\u2019s Grocery Store. According to Deputy Bodnar, she also was served with cease and desist letters pertaining to State Line Gas and \u201cbasically all the businesses in Marydel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">When Deputy Bodnar arrived at Walker\u2019s Grocery Store on July 8, a store employee said that Coley had left within the previous fifteen minutes. The employee believed that Coley had gone to Walker\u2019s Trailer Park, the entrance to which was located 100 feet from the exit to the grocery store parking lot. Deputy Bodnar and Trooper Norton went to the trailer park and located Coley, alone, sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a black Ford Focus, which was parked in front of Lot 30. The vehicle was not running. The driver\u2019s side door of the vehicle was open and Coley\u2019s feet were on the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Deputy Bodnar observed an open beer can \u201cin the cupholder of the center console of the vehicle.\u201d \u201cOn the center console, in front of the gearshifter knob,\u201d he \u201cobserved torn, plastic Ziploc baggies,\u201d one-inch in length, which he \u201cbelieved to be drug paraphernalia, through [his] knowledge, training and experience.\u201d In Deputy Bodnar\u2019s view, the baggies appeared to have been \u201ctorn open.\u201d \u201cThey were, the pieces that you would press together were, mainly was laying in the console and they had been torn open. They weren\u2019t, so to speak, opened up[,] and the contents of the package would have been dumped out. They were actually torn open.\u201d Deputy Bodnar testified that such torn plastic baggies are \u201cused to package suspected heroin. The heroin\u2019s wrapped in wax paper and then the wax paper\u2019s folded into approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>like a, I\u2019ll say a half inch square and it\u2019s placed inside the one inch big Ziploc baggy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">Upon finding the plastic baggies, Deputy Bodnar detained Coley and placed her in handcuffs in front of her vehicle. He then searched Coley\u2019s purse and the interior of the vehicle. In Coley\u2019s purse, Deputy Bodnar found wax paper, a lighter, and Q-tips. In a \u201chidden compartment\u201d in the vehicle, Deputy Bodnar found four syringes and Ziploc baggies containing suspected heroin wrapped in blue wax paper. The State introduced photographs of the interior of Coley\u2019s vehicle and of the items seized from Coley\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">After hearing argument, the suppression court summarized Deputy Bodnar\u2019s testimony and made oral findings of fact. The court did not believe the open beer can was \u201cevidence of anything wrong.\u201d The court found otherwise with regard to the torn plastic baggies.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">\u201c[Deputy Bodnar] did at the same time observe two small plastic baggies and as he said they were about one inch by two inch, which is not the, obviously not a sandwich bag, but has a limited use. Further he noticed that these were not just plastic baggies, but that they had the, they were torn at one end, which to the officer in his training indicates a, something which has been used to contain controlled dangerous substance and in particular heroin. At that time, um, due to the observation of the drug paraphernalia, the officer believed he had probable cause to search the vehicle for related paraphernalia. Now paraphernalia can be in different forms, but when the plastic baggies are such that the corners have been torn off, it would be an indication that they were, had been specifically used to previously contain a controlled dangerous substance and therefore residue could be in place and that would be a charge of possession of a controlled dangerous substance, not just a fineable offense, but an incarcerable offense. He detained the, asked the Defendant to get out. He detained her and then he searched the vehicle and found other controlled dangerous substances and other paraphernalia. I find that there was a reasonable, um, for the officer to believe that there was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>crime being committed in the possession of a controlled dangerous substance and the search of the vehicle without a warrant was not unreasonable. I\u2019ll therefore deny the Motion to Suppress. ... Quite simply on the issues of the prostitution, I don\u2019t agree with you, Mr. [Prosecutor]. ... When I say that, as to the right to search the vehicle, I don\u2019t think the vehicle was being searched for, there was not probable cause at that time for elements of prostitution to search the vehicle. The evidence that he found may be, may be admissible to show prostitution later on in her trial, so it was reasonably seized, but I don\u2019t think that was his reason for searching the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">After waiving a jury trial, Coley, on January 9, 2013, pled guilty on an agreed statement of facts, and was sentenced on February 25, 2013. She noted this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Our standard of review is well settled. \u201c[W]e view the suppression court\u2019s findings of fact, and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to the prevailing party on the motion below, in this case, the State. We do not disturb those findings unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>McCracken v. State, </em>429 Md. 507, 515, 56 A.3d 242, 246 (2012) (citing <em>Crosby v. State, </em>408 Md. 490, 504-05, 970 A.2d 894, 902 (2009)). \u201cAn appellate court, ... under an independent <em>de novo </em>review standard, must consider the application of the law to those facts in determining whether the evidence at issue was obtained in violation of the law, and, accordingly, should be suppressed.\u201d <em>Longshore, </em>399 Md. at 499, 924 A.2d at 1136.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects.\u201d \u201cThe touchstone of our analysis under the Fourth Amendment is always \u2018the reasonableness in all the circumstances of the particular governmental invasion of a citizen\u2019s personal security.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 108-09, 98 S.Ct. 330, 332, 54 L.Ed.2d 331 (1977) (quoting <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 19, 88 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>S.Ct. 1868, 1878-79, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). Warrantless searches are presumptively unreasonable, \u201csubject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u201d <em>See Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S.Ct. 507, 514, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">In <em>Carroll v. United States, </em>267 U.S. 132, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925), the Supreme Court recognized an exception allowing warrantless searches of automobiles upon probable cause to believe that contraband is being concealed and illegally transported in the automobile. <em>See also Wyoming v. Houghton, </em>526 U.S. 295, 300, 119 S.Ct. 1297, 1300, 143 L.Ed.2d 408 (1999). \u201cGiven the nature of an automobile in transit, the Court recognized that an immediate intrusion is necessary if police officers are to secure the illicit substance.\u201d <em>United States v. Ross, </em>456 U.S. 798, 806-07, 102 S.Ct. 2157, 2163, 72 L.Ed.2d 572 (1982). <em>See also Pennsylvania v. Labron, </em>518 U.S. 938, 940, 116 S.Ct. 2485, 2487, 135 L.Ed.2d 1031 (1996) (per curiam) (\u201cIf a car is readily mobile and probable cause exists to believe it contains contraband, the Fourth Amendment thus permits police to search the vehicle without more.\u201d); <em>California v. Carney, </em>471 U.S. 386, 390-91, 105 S.Ct. 2066, 2068-69, 85 L.Ed.2d 406 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Probable cause is merely a practical, common sense determination, given the totality of the circumstances, that \u201cthere is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2332, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). As the Supreme Court reiterated in <em>Maryland v. Pringle,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZQ\">\u201cthe probable-cause standard is a \u2018practical, nontechnical conception\u2019 that deals with \u2018the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.\u2019 \u2018[PJrobable cause is a fluid concept \u2014 turning on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual contexts \u2014 not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of legal rules.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">540 U.S. 366, 370-71, 124 S.Ct. 795, 799-800, 157 L.Ed.2d 769 (2003) (quoting <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 231-32, 103 S.Ct. at 2328-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>29). \u201cThe principal components of a determination of ... probable cause will be the events which occurred leading up to the stop or search, and then the decision whether these historical facts, viewed from the standpoint of an objectively reasonable police officer, amount ... to probable cause.\u201d <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 696, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1661-62, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Coley contends that Deputy Bodnar lacked constitutionally sufficient grounds to search her vehicle, for three reasons. First, his unconfirmed suspicion of prostitution did not authorize a warrantless arrest or search. Second, the presence of an open beer can in the center console of Coley\u2019s car, which was not running and which was parked on private property, did not provide probable cause to search the vehicle. Finally, the presence of plastic baggies did not provide probable cause to search the vehicle because the baggies were not themselves contraband and, even if they were, \u201cthe discovery of some contraband [does not suggest] the likely presence of more contraband, yet to be discovered.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 9 (citing <em>Bell v. State, </em>96 Md.App. 46, 55, 623 A.2d 690, 694 (1993), <em>aff'd, </em>334 Md. 178, 638 A.2d 107 (1994)). Furthermore, Coley argues, possession of paraphernalia is not an arrestable offense that could authorize a search incident to a lawful arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">As we have noted, the State concedes error. The State agrees with Coley that neither Deputy Bodnar\u2019s suspicion of prostitution nor his observation of the open beer can provided probable cause for an arrest or search. The State also submits, based on out-of-state decisions,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">\u201cthat on the facts of this case, Deputy Bodnar\u2019s observation of the torn Ziploc baggies did not furnish probable cause to search the car.... [T]he mere observation of knotted or torn plastic bags by an officer who, in light of his training and experience, believes them to be drug paraphernalia, does not furnish probable cause to search for illegal drugs or other paraphernalia.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>State\u2019s Brief at 5. The State believes that it is precluded from relying on Deputy Bodnar\u2019s knowledge of Coley\u2019s past heroin use as an additional circumstance that could add up to probable cause because the agreed statement of facts that the State submitted as a proffer of proof in support of Coley\u2019s guilty plea \u201cdescribed Coley\u2019s admission as having occurred after she was arrested and after she waived her <em>Miranda </em>rights.\u201d State\u2019s Brief at 8. The State tells us that \u201c[t]he chronology in the Agreed Statement of Facts conforms to the chronology in the police report.\u201d State\u2019s Brief at 8, n. 3.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The agreed statement of facts submitted in support of Coley\u2019s guilty plea has no bearing on our review of the suppression decision made three weeks earlier by a different judge than the one who accepted the plea. Furthermore, the agreed statement of facts and Deputy Bodnar\u2019s testimony at the suppression hearing are not necessarily inconsistent. At the suppression hearing, Deputy Bodnar testified that, during one of the conversations he had with Coley before July 8, 2012, \u201c[s]he advised that she was a prior heroin user and she had been clean for approximately one year, close to a year.\u201d Deputy Bodnar did not testify to whether Coley made any statements after being arrested. The agreed statement of facts did not mention any event or conversation occurring prior to July 8, 2012. According to the statement, after the search of the vehicle,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">\u201cMs. Coley was placed under arrest, read her <em>Miranda </em>rights, which she waived.... She did admit to being a former heroin addict, however, she stated she had been clean for about a year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">Deputy Bodnar\u2019s testimony and the agreed statement of facts are not mutually exclusive. Just as Deputy Bodnar\u2019s testimony at the suppression hearing omitted anything that occurred after his search of the vehicle, the agreed statement of facts omitted anything that occurred prior to the evening of July 8. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Neither source actually contradicts the other. It would be entirely reasonable for us to infer, in the light most favorable to the State, that Coley told Deputy Bodnar of her past drug use prior to July 8, as he testified, and again after she was arrested, as set forth in the agreed statement of facts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">In any event, the fact that the State\u2019s proffer of proof may have differed slightly from Deputy Bodnar\u2019s testimony does not change the record that was before the suppression court. In <em>Trusty v. State, </em>308 Md. 658, 670-72, 521 A.2d 749, 755-56 (1987), the Court rejected the opposite argument to the one the State makes here. In <em>Trusty, </em>the State had attempted on appeal to use evidence adduced at trial to bolster the insufficient evidence adduced at a pretrial suppression hearing. The Court explained that \u201cthis proof came too late, of course, to cure the deficiency at the pretrial hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 670, 521 A.2d at 755. In the case of a suppression motion that was erroneously denied, the rule that the suppression record cannot be bolstered later by evidence adduced at trial protects the defendant by relieving any responsibility</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cto retry before the jury the question which he has previously presented according to law for a final determination of the judge.\u201d Absent notice to the defense that the legality of the search and seizure is somehow an \u201copen\u201d question throughout the trial, the defendant might well not challenge certain trial testimony which bolsters the pretrial suppression ruling but is not particularly damaging on the issue of guilt or innocence.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 671, 521 A.2d at 755-56 (quoting 4 W. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure, </em>\u00a7 11.7(C) (2d ed.1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>With regard to the situation now before us, assuming Coley were the one raising the inconsistency as evidence that the suppression ruling was erroneous, not the State, Professor LaFave explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">\u201cWhat then of the reverse situation, that is, where again there was no renewal of the motion at trial but it is now the defendant who wishes the appellate court to take into account the testimony at trial because he thinks that testimony undercuts the testimony given in the pretrial hearing? Though it has occasionally been said that an appellate court \u2018will look to relevant evidence produced on trial for any adverse effect it might have on admission of disputed items,\u2019 courts have usually declined to do so in these circumstances. The most cogent explanation for this result is that because of the \u2018defendant\u2019s failure to move at that point for a reconsideration of his motion to suppress,\u2019 the trial judge did not err \u2018in not reconsidering its suppression ruling sua sponte.\u2019 As noted earlier, there is some dispute as to whether reconsideration of a pretrial suppression ruling is a matter entirely within the trial judge\u2019s discretion. But even <em>Gouled v. United States </em>[255 U.S. 298, 41 S.Ct. 261, 65 L.Ed. 647 (1921) ], which speaks of the court\u2019s \u2018duty\u2019 to reconsider, described that duty as being \u2018to entertain an objection\u2019 when \u2018in the progress of a trial, it becomes probable that there has been an unconstitutional seizure of papers.\u2019 If there is no such duty when no objection is made, it would seem to follow that there is no reason for the appellate court to consider evidence the trial judge was not required to consider.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">6 W. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment, </em>\u00a7 11.7(d), at 581-82 (5th ed.2012) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">In this case, as the suppression ruling was not actually re-litigated before Coley\u2019s guilty plea was accepted,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Decem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>ber 19, 2012 suppression ruling was binding upon the plea judge<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the record of the plea hearing is not relevant to our review of the suppression ruling. As we have explained, \u201c[i]n reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we look only to the record of the suppression hearing and do not consider the evidence admitted at trial.\u201d <em>See, e.g., In re Tariq A-R-Y, </em>347 Md. 484, 488, 701 A.2d 691, 693 (1997), <em>cert. denied, 522 </em>U.S. 1140, 118 S.Ct. 1105, 140 L.Ed.2d 158 (1998). <em>See also Stokeling v. State, </em>189 Md.App. 653, 661, 985 A.2d 175, 180 (2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 Md. 332, 995 A.2d 297 (2010) (\u201cIn reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress evidence, we look exclusively to the record of the suppression hearing.\u201d). Any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>record that developed in the circuit court after a binding suppression ruling was made is simply immaterial to our review. The suppression judge was not able to consider a possible inconsistency that would not exist until three weeks after he ruled on the motion and that would not be raised by either party until the State filed its appellate brief. We shall not consider it now.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Accordingly, we do consider, as part of the totality of the circumstances, both Deputy Bodnar\u2019s observation, in plain view in Coley\u2019s vehicle, of torn one-inch plastic baggies that he knew from his training and experience to be likely heroin paraphernalia, and Deputy Bodnar\u2019s prior knowledge that, by her own admission, Coley had been a heroin user in the past and had used heroin as recently as one year before. In our independent constitutional appraisal, those two facts constituted probable cause for Deputy Bodnar reasonably to believe that contraband \u2014 either heroin or other heroin paraphernalia \u2014 was present in Coley\u2019s vehicle. The subsequent search of Coley\u2019s purse and the interior of Coley\u2019s vehicle was, therefore, reasonable, and did not violate the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">We recognize that possession of empty plastic bags, by itself, is not necessarily criminal. Items that police officers may recognize from their training and experience as likely drug paraphernalia may also have innocent uses. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Gates, </em>however,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">\u201cprobable cause requires only a probability or substantial chance of criminal activity, not an actual showing of such activity. By hypothesis, therefore, <em>innocent behavior frequently will provide the basis for a showing of probable cause; </em>to require otherwise would be to <em>sub silentio </em>impose a drastically more rigorous definition of probable cause than the security of our citizens demands.... In making a determination of probable cause the relevant inquiry is not whether particular conduct is \u2018innocent\u2019 or \u2018guilty,\u2019 but the degree of suspicion that attaches to particular types of noncriminal acts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>462 U.S. at <em>243 </em>n. <em>13, 103 </em>S.Ct. at 2335 <em>n. 13 (emphasis </em>added). The Court reiterated the same principle, with regard to the lower standard of reasonable suspicion, in <em>United States v. Sokolow:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\"><em>\u201cAny one of these factors is not by itself proof of any illegal conduct and is quite consistent with innocent travel.

Deputy Bodnar observed other characteristics of the baggies that suggested to him, based on his training and experience, that they had previously been used to hold controlled dangerous substances. We may give \u201cconsiderable credit ... to the expertise of law enforcement officers in conducting investigations into illegal drug activity.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Birchead v.

Indeed, we \u201cmust allow the police officers \u2018to draw on their own experience and specialized training to make inferences from and deductions about the cumulative information available to them that \u201cmight well elude an untrained person.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Ransome, </em>373 Md. at 104-05, 816 A.2d at 904 (quoting <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 750-51, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002)). That is not to say that an officer may \u201c \u2018simply assert that innocent conduct was suspicious to him or her.\u2019 Rather, the officer must explain how the observed conduct, when viewed in the context of all of the other circumstances known to the officer, was indicative of criminal activity.\u201d <em>Crosby v. State, </em>408 Md. 490, 508, 970 A.2d 894, 904 (2009) (quoting <em>Bost v. State, </em>406 Md. 341, 357, 958 A.2d 356, 365 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Deputy Bodnar observed that the baggies were approximately one inch long. This size has limited utility for household purposes, and bags of this size are often used to package narcotics. Deputy Bodnar testified that such bags are commonly</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">\u201cused to package suspected heroin. The heroin\u2019s wrapped in wax paper and then the wax paper\u2019s folded into approximately like a, I\u2019ll say a half inch square and it\u2019s placed inside the one inch big Ziploc baggy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The bags also had been torn open at one end. From Deputy Bodnar\u2019s training and experience, he recognized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgW\">\u201c[t]hey were, the pieces that you would press together were, mainly was laying in the console and they had been torn open. They weren\u2019t, so to speak, opened up[,] and the contents of the package would have been dumped out. They were actually torn open.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Deputy Bodnar reasonably believed that the plastic baggies were not intended for innocent use and that they were, in fact, drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">Deputy Bodnar\u2019s suspicion that the plastic baggies were drug paraphernalia was bolstered by his existing knowledge, from Coley herself, that Coley had been \u201ca prior heroin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>user and she had been clean for approximately one year, close to a year.\u201d \u201cThe Supreme Court case law makes it clear that not only prior convictions but also prior arrests and <em>even a criminal reputation may be significant factors in the probable cause equation.\u201d State v. Amerman, </em>84 Md.App. 461, 484, 581 A.2d 19, 30 (1990) (emphasis added) (citing <em>Brinegar v. United States, </em>338 U.S. 160, 162, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 1304, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949) (Brinegar had \u201ca reputation for hauling liquor\u201d); <em>Carroll, </em>267 U.S. 132, 45 S.Ct. 280 (police had observed two of the suspects selling bootleg liquor three months earlier)). <em>See also Malcolm v. State, </em>70 Md.App. 426, 432, 521 A.2d 796, 799 (1987) (\u201cOn the street, if not at the trial table, an individual carries with him inextricably the burden of his reputation[.]\u201d), <em>aff'd in part, vacated in part on other grounds, </em>314 Md. 221, 550 A.2d 670 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Coley\u2019s claim that she was no longer a heroin user (and whether Deputy Bodnar or the suppression court believed that she was no longer a heroin user) is irrelevant. The important fact is that Deputy Bodnar knew that she at least had been a heroin user. Deputy Bodnar\u2019s observation of something that he believed, based on his training and experience, to be heroin paraphernalia, in the vehicle of a person who had admitted to him several days earlier that she had used heroin in the past, combined to form a fair probability that heroin or other paraphernalia would be found in the vehicle. In other words, there was probable cause justifying Deputy Bodnar\u2019s subsequent search of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Coley\u2019s reliance on <em>Bell v. State, </em>96 Md.App. 46, 55, 623 A.2d 690, 694 (1993), <em>aff'd, </em>334 Md. 178, 638 A.2d 107 (1994), is misplaced. In <em>Bell, </em>officers patrolling a high crime area in Baltimore City observed a group of four or five young men, including Bell, who scattered at their approach. The officers observed Bell walk over to a nearby car and make \u201c \u2018a hand movement as [if he were] placing something in the vehicle.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 623 A.2d at 692-93. The officers continued their patrol. When they returned ten minutes later, they observed Bell drop \u201c \u2018a vial, a white object\u2019 \u201d into an open window of the car. <em>Id. </em>at 52, 623 A.2d at 693. The officers then got out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>their vehicle and arrested Bell. After Bell denied consent to search the car, an officer \u201cobserved a vial of white powder lying in open view on the floor of the front passenger seat.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Pursuant to the <em>Carroll </em>doctrine, the officers opened the car door and retrieved the vial. The officers then conducted what they described as an inventory search of the car and found a duffel bag between the front seats containing several baggies, each containing multiple vials of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">On appeal, we upheld with \u201cno difficulty\u201d the initial police intrusion into the vehicle to retrieve the vial of white powder. <em>Id. </em>at 53, 623 A.2d at 693. Nevertheless, as \u201c[t]he only probable cause asserted by the police was probable cause to believe that the single vial observed lying on the floor in front of the passenger seat contained contraband narcotics,\u201d we held that the justification for the <em>Carroll </em>search ended as soon as the vial was retrieved. <em>Id. </em>at 54, 623 A.2d at 694. We further held that the search of the duffel bag was not a <em>bona fide </em>inventory search. We left open the possibility that \u201can argument might someday be made for extending a <em>[Carroll </em>] search such as this based upon some almost Newtonian proposition that the discovery of <em>some </em>contraband suggests the likely presence of more contraband yet to be discovered,\u201d but did not consider such argument, as it had not been raised in the circuit court or on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 55, 623 A.2d at 694. Rather, at the suppression hearing, the State had insisted that the initial search and the search of the duffel bag were two distinct searches with separate justifications. The Court of Appeals affirmed our discretionary decision not to consider the unpreserved argument that the search of the duffel bag was part of the initial <em>Carroll </em>search. 334 Md. at 186-91, 638 A.2d at 112-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Contrary to Coley\u2019s assertion in her brief, in <em>Bell </em>we did not \u201ccriticize\u201d the \u201cproposition that the discovery of some contraband suggests the likely presence of more contraband yet to be discovered.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 9. Rather, we simply explained that that proposition was not before us in that case. In <em>Bell, </em>the police officers asserted only probable cause to believe that the one vial that they had seen Bell drop into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>car contained cocaine. They did not assert that their discovery of that one vial provided probable cause to believe that they would find others.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">By contrast, that argument was raised at the suppression hearing in this case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Deputy Bodnar\u2019s observation of plastic baggies in plain view that had been \u201ctorn open,\u201d suggesting that they previously had been used to contain heroin, plus his knowledge that Coley had been a heroin user, provided probable cause to believe that he would find concealed elsewhere in the vehicle other plastic baggies that still contained heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CAROLINE COUNTY AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-12\">.
