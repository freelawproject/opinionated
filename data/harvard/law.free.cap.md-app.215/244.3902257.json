Bert, appellant, seeks further judicial review of the decision of the Maryland Tax Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The circuit court affirmed the decision of the Tax Court, which in turn had upheld tax assessments and penalties regarding the income tax years of 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2004. Appellant, aggrieved by the decision of that court, seeks our review of a host of issues.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Recast to facilitate and clarify appellate review, the pertinent issues on appeal are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b271-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>1. Whether the Maryland Tax Court erred by concluding that Mr. Bert was not entitled to exclude from his income for tax year 2004 compensation that he had received from his employers, and whether the Maryland Tax Court erred by affirming the assessment of frivolous return penalties for tax years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">2. Whether the Maryland Tax Court abridged appellant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination or due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>rights, or otherwise erred in the conduct of its statutory review.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">This dispute between appellant and the Comptroller of Maryland involves appellant\u2019s filings for tax years 1999 through 2002 and 2004.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We set forth pertinent facts related to each year.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\"><em>Tax Years in Question </em>1999</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">On July 31, 2000, appellant filed a Maryland Tax Form 503 for calendar year 1999. He attached a Form W-2 from the OAO Corporation in Greenbelt that reported wages in the amount of $79,043.25, and a Form 1099-G that reported unemployment compensation in the amount of $250 from the State of Maryland. On the 1999 tax filing, appellant repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>sented that his reportable net income was \u201c$0.00.\u201d On October 3, 2005, appellant filed an amended Maryland Tax Form 502X for the calendar year 1999, accompanied by an IRS Form 4852, \u201cSubstitute for Form W-2,\u201d that reported his wages from OAO Corporation to be \u201c$0.00.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant represented on the Form 502X that the adjusted gross income from the federal return was also \u201c$0.00.\u201d On the Form 4852, appellant explained the change in income:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-4\">Company provided records and statutory language behind IRC sections 3401 and 3121 and others. Request, but the company refuses to issue forms correctly listing payments of \u201cwages as defined in 3401(a) and 3121(a)\u201d for fear of IRS retaliation. The amounts listed withheld on the W-2 it submitted are correct, however.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\">To explain his amended Maryland 1999 return, appellant represented:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">Submitting Form 4852. Original W-2 submitted with return was in error. Employer issued forms incorrectly listing payments of wages as defined in IRC Sections 3401(a) and 3121(a). However, withholding amounts on W-2 are correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>2000</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">On April 15, 2004, appellant filed a Maryland Tax Form 503 for calendar year 2000. The Form 503 listed appellant\u2019s federal adjusted gross income from the federal tax return for that year as $2,000.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellant then filed an amended Form 502X for calendar year 2000 on a Form 502X that was signed on October 4, 2005. This filing was accompanied by four W-2 forms that reported a total of $81,680.69 in salary or wages for 2000.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellant also received $2,000 in unemployment compensation in calendar year 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">On October 4, 2005, appellant filed what purported to be an amended Maryland Tax Return on Form 502X for calendar year 2000. This filing was accompanied by four self-generated Forms 4852, each of which reported wages in the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>\u201c$0.00.\u201d On the Form 502X filing, appellant represented that his federal adjusted gross income for calendar year 2000 was $2,000, the amount he received as unemployment compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">2001</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">On October 5, 2005, appellant signed a purported Maryland Tax Return for calendar year 2001 and filed the Form 502 on that date or thereafter. He reported his adjusted gross income for that year as \u201c$0.00,\u201d and claimed a tax refund of $5,504.12. For 2001, the Data Computer Corporation reported that appellant had received compensation in the amount of $87,091.12 as reflected in the Form W-2 that was issued by that employer. Notwithstanding, appellant\u2019s self-generated Form 4852 reported his wages from Data Computer Corporation as \u201c$0.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">2002</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">On October 7, 2005, appellant filed a Maryland Tax Form 502 for the calendar year 2002 and reported on this form an adjusted gross income from the federal return of \u201c$0.00.\u201d He also claimed a tax refund of $5,985.71 and attached a self-generated Form 4852 that represented that his wages from Data Computer Corporation were \u201c$0.00.\u201d The Data Computer Corporation W-2 for this period reported that appellant\u2019s wages were $91,031.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">2004</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">This pattern repeated itself on October 12, 2005, when appellant signed and, shortly thereafter, filed a Maryland Tax Form 503 for calendar year 2004. Although the W-2 form that had been issued by Data Computer Corporation reported appellant\u2019s wages at $93,577.88, his self-generated Form 4852 represented that he had received no wages from this company that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">\n<em>Comptroller\u2019s Actions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">In 2006, the Comptroller acted on appellant\u2019s tax filings. On March 27, 2006, the Comptroller sent appellant a notice of income tax assessment with respect to the 2004 tax year, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>followed on March 31 by a similar assessment notice that addressed the tax years of 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2004.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In these assessments, the Comptroller advised appellant that the tax returns in question were each incorrect and assessed a $500 frivolous return penalty for each tax year in question.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Comptroller also recomputed appellant\u2019s 2004 income.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Appellant objected to these assessments and the Comptroller convened an informal hearing on July 10, 2006. On July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>23, 2007, the Comptroller issued a \u201cNotice of Final Determination\u201d with respect to the tax assessments for Tax Years 1999 through 2002. In this Notice, the Comptroller also upheld the adjustments to appellant\u2019s 2004 filing. The Notice of Final Determination relevantly provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-4\">This is the Comptroller\u2019s final determination, on your request for revision of the income tax assessments, issued on March 31, 2006 for tax years 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002, and on March 27, 2006 for tax year 2004, pursuant to Tax General Article, Section 13 \u2014 508(c) of the Annotated Code of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">On July 10, 2006, an informal hearing was held regarding the above referenced assessments. At issue is the imposition of frivolous return penalties by the Comptroller for all years, and for tax year 2004, also the recomputation of tax due.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">Rita Bormuth, of the Compliance Division, appeared on behalf of the Comptroller of Maryland. She testified that Mr. Bert filed amended returns for tax years 1999 and 2000 showing only interest and unemployment income. For tax years 2001 and 2002, Mr. Bert filed original returns reporting zero income. On March 31, 2006, Ms. Bormuth sent Mr. Bert a Notice of Income Tax Assessment which assessed a frivolous return penalty of $500.00 for each of the years 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002. For tax year 2004, Mr. Bert filed a return reporting zero income and requesting a refund of his withholding in the amount of $7,076.13. Ms. Bormuth testified that she recomputed the return including the wages in the amount of $93,578.00 reported on the W2 from Data Computer Corp. of America. Based on that recomputation, she calculated a tax refund due in the amount of $39.43. She assessed a $500.00 frivolous return penalty, and applied the refund amount toward that penalty, resulting in a balance due on the 2004 assessment of $460.57.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">The Comptroller outlined appellant\u2019s arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">Mr. Colvin Bert appeared on his own behalf at the hearing. Mr. Bert disputed the imposition of the frivolous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>return penalties. As to the amended returns, he stated that he was required by law to amend his Maryland returns because he had amended his federal returns for tax years 1999 and 2000. However, he also stated that the federal amendments had no effect on his Maryland liability. With regard to the amounts reported on all of the returns, Mr. Bert stated that he felt his Maryland returns were filed in accordance with applicable Maryland law. As directed by Tax-General Article \u00a7 10-204, he reported the same federal adjusted gross income on his Maryland return that he reported on his federal returns. He further argued that by reporting these amounts, as well as the amounts he calculated on his substitute W2s, the information reported on the returns was not substantially incorrect on its face. With regard to tax year 2000, Mr. Bert also disputed the imposition of the frivolous return penalty with regard to the amended return, since he had already been assessed a frivolous return penalty when he filed his original 2000 Maryland return.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-4\">Mr. Bert also questioned Ms. Bormuth\u2019s authority to issue the assessments and the legality of those assessments. He referred to Ms. Bormuth\u2019s job description and argued that nowhere in that description did he find authority to issue assessments or penalties. Mr. Bert\u2019s position is that because Ms. Bormuth\u2019s job description does not specifically list assessing tax or penalty as one of the duties of her position, Ms. Bormuth acted outside the scope of her authority in issuing these assessments, thereby rendering the assessments illegal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The Comptroller then overruled appellant\u2019s demand for copies of \u201coriginal assessments\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">Throughout the hearing, Mr. Bert demanded copies of \u201coriginal assessments,\u201d referring to assessments issued with regard to tax deficiencies discovered in tax years 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002. Liabilities have been finalized with regard to those years which are outside the scope of this matter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>which for tax years 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002, is limited to the appeal of the frivolous return penalties imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">The Notice of Final Determination concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">Pursuant to Tax-General Article \u00a7 10-102, a tax is imposed on the Maryland taxable income of each individual. \u201cMaryland taxable income\u201d is defined at Tax-General Article \u00a7 10-101(1) for an individual as \u201cMaryland adjusted gross income, less the exemptions and deductions allowed under this Title.\u201d Tax-General article \u00a7 10-203 provides that \u201cthe Maryland adjusted gross income of an individual is the individual\u2019s federal adjusted gross income for the taxable year as adjusted under this Part II of this subtitle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AS4\">\u201cGross income\u201d is defined in Internal Revenue code (IRC) \u00a7 61(a) as \u201c... all income from whatever source derived, including (but not limited to) [cjompensation for services.\u201d IRC \u00a7 3401(a) defines the term \u201cwages\u201d as \u201c... all remuneration (other than fees paid to a public official) for services performed by an employee for his employer ...\u201d Moreover, the courts have consistently found that wages are included in gross income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">Mr. Bert was compensated, in the form of wages, for the services he performed for Data Computer Corp. of America, and those wages are income. The Taxpayer has not met his burden of proving that his wages are not subject to federal and state income tax. Accordingly, I find that the adjustments to Mr. Bert\u2019s 2004 return resulting in tax refund $39.43 were correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">Mr. Bert\u2019s complaint challenging Ms Bormuth\u2019s authority to issue the assessments is without merit. The September 28, 2004 memorandum that Mr. Bert referred to as \u201cMs. Bormuth\u2019s job description\u201d begins with the following summary of Ms. Bormuth\u2019s position: \u201cThe main purpose of this position is to audit questionable individual income tax returns to determine if the information on the return is correct and to adjust the returns when necessary based on the audit findings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>A tax collector who in the course of examination or audit of a return finds a deficiency is required by \u00a7 13-401(a) to assess the deficiency. The language is unequivocal. Therefore, Ms. Bormuth, like any employee of the Comptroller who examines and audits returns, is required by the statute to assess a deficiency when she finds one. Being statutorily mandated, there is no question that issuing an assessment after finding a deficiency was within the scope of her employment. As an employee of the Comptroller acting within the scope of her employment, I find that the deficiency discovered by Ms. Bormuth with regard to tax year 2004 (the variance between the refund claimed by Mr. Bert and the much lower refund calculated by Ms. Bormuth) was lawfully assessed. Likewise, the language of \u00a7 13-705, \u201cshall assess a penalty,\u201d is language of requirement. Based upon the findings of her investigation, Ms. Bormuth was compelled to assess the frivolous penalties at issue in this appeal for tax years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2004. Accordingly, I reject Mr. Bert\u2019s claim that the assessments were issued unlawfully. Based on the evidence presented, I agree that the returns filed by Mr. Bert that are at issue in this appeal contain information that, on its face, indicated the tax reported is incorrect, and that this position for each year is frivolous because it has no basis in law or fact, is patently unlawful, and does not involve a legitimate dispute or reflect an inadvertent mathematical or clerical error. Mr. Bert acknowledged working for Computer Data Corp. of America and that he received wages for his work, despite his erroneous argument that the employer issued W2 is incorrect. As Mr. Bert has been made aware by the outcome of other appeals, those wages are taxable as income, and for him to take a contrary position is indeed frivolous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\">Mr. Bert\u2019s assertion that he was required \u201cunder Maryland law\u201d to file amended returns for tax years 1999 and 2000 because he filed amended federal returns for those years is also incorrect. In the case where the Internal Revenue Service issues a final determination increasing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>federal taxable income, Tax-General Article \u00a7 13 \u2014 409(b) requires the individual to file a statement of the amount of increase within 90 days of the date of the Service\u2019s determination. However, there is no legal requirement to file an amended return simply because an amended federal return was filed when the requested federal change would not result in an increase to federal taxable income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-4\">Accordingly, the assessments are affirmed in the amounts stated above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">On August 23, 2007, appellant petitioned the Maryland Tax Court to review the Comptroller\u2019s \u201cFinal Determination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\n<em>Tax Court Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The Tax Court conducted a hearing on appellant\u2019s petition on March 13, 2008. The Tax Court denied appellant\u2019s petition and explained its ruling from the bench:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-8\">Mr. Bert, I\u2019m going to rule that you do in fact owe frivolous penalties for each and every one of your returns.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-9\">Your arguments, if I can best summarize them, are that you had no taxable income in any one of those years because of your reading of the Tax Code that you fall within one or possibly more than one code section which would render every dollar that you earned as non-taxable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-10\">[T]he one that I find as frivolous as it could possibly be was the argument that there\u2019s a Code section that says income earned out of the United States is exempt, and that your income would be exempt because at least some of your income was earned outside the United States. And then you pointed to the fact that you earned some income in the State of Maryland, which is not part of the United States. Patently frivolous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-11\">... I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s possible that there can be a sincere belief that earned income in the State of Maryland is exempt from State and Federal income tax because it was earned outside of the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-12\">You then pointed to another section that defined some people as employees. The Code section on its face does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>say these are the only employees. It does say, the term employee shall include. But it doesn\u2019t say those are the only employees, or the only possible employees, and it\u2019s a fairly restrictive list. I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any decisions anyplace that say that those are the only individuals that have taxable income from wages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-4\">And then you referred to some other sections with even less description as to how they might possibly apply to you. And then you came to the amazing decision that every single dollar of wage that you earned in every one of those years was exempt from Federal and Maryland income tax. This is frivolous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">Not one of these possible positions have any basis in fact, have any basis in law____But, in fact, you were asking for a refund of every penny that had been withheld and suggested that you had no income whatsoever, no taxable income whatsoever. This is frivolous. This on its face is impeding the process of the tax collection. Individuals, the Comptroller\u2019s Office, are wasting their time trying to come to an understanding of what your taxable income should be because you are providing incorrect information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">The Tax Court then addressed the substitute W-2 Forms that depicted his income as \u201c0\u201d and the \u201czero\u201d returns:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-9\">... the W-2 that you created has the same zero and the same zero on the Maryland return, so since they\u2019re all three zeros they must be correct \u2014 no, they just all three zeros are the same \u2014 and provided no information, none at all, as to why any one of those zeros would be correct other than the fact that the State of Maryland is not part of the United States so your earnings in this State should not count.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-10\">You stated before that no court has ever ruled against you, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. I know the Tax Court has ruled against you any number of times. Zeros for income for you are not appropriate, and it is not right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>The Tax Court then addressed and rejected appellant\u2019s argument with respect to the assessment of penalties <footnotemark>11</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-4\">[JUDGE SILBERG:] Just by accident, is there any issue that I haven\u2019t addressed in my decision? Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">MR. LANGBAUM: I don\u2019t think so, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">MR. BERT: You haven\u2019t addressed the 13-705(b) statute that says if there\u2019s no tax due then \u2014 13\u2014705(b) claims that the penalty is an additional penalty of 13-701. And so therefore ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">JUDGE SILBERG: Okay. Under the 13-705 return it says, does not contain information on which substantial correctness of the tax can be determined. If you\u2019re suggesting to me that putting a zero down is substantially allowing anyone to determine the correctness of the tax, I just don\u2019t follow it. It\u2019s clearly, at best, just confusing the whole issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">MR. BERT: No, I\u2019m referring to 13-705(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">JUDGE SILBERG: That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m reading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-10\">MR. BERT: No, (b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-11\">JUDGE SILBERG: Additional to other penalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-12\">MR. BERT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-13\">JUDGE SILBERG: The penalty under subsection (a) is in addition to any other penalty assessed under this Code section. That\u2019s certainly true. I don\u2019t know if anybody on any of these returns has assessed any additional penalties, but this would be in addition to those. I don\u2019t think this section would require there be a penalty otherwise. But this is in addition to, not a substitute for.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-14\">On April 25, 2008, the Tax Court issued an Order affirming the Comptroller\u2019s decision. The Order incorporated the reasons set forth by the opinion the Tax Court rendered from the bench at the conclusion of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>\n<em>Judicial Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">On May 23, 2008, appellant petitioned for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Howard County. On December 8, 2009, the court conducted a hearing on appellant\u2019s petition and ruled in favor of the Comptroller:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">[THE COURT:] Essentially, the four issues that are before the Court today are whether the Tax Court properly concluded the Petitioner was not entitled to exclude from income the wages he received from his employer in 2004.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">I find the record does contain substantial evidence to support the Tax Court\u2019s decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">Number Two, the question is whether the Maryland Tax Court properly affirmed the assessment of frivolous return penalties against the Petitioner for '99 through 2002 and for 2004, because Petitioner excluded wages from reported income when he filed his Maryland income tax.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\">Again, I do find that the record is replete with substantial evidence to support the Tax Court\u2019s conclusions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-9\">The third issue is whether the Tax Court properly allocated the burden of proof to the Petitioner in his claims for abatement of frivolous return penalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-10\">I do find that the Tax Court properly allocated the burden of proof to the Petitioner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-11\">And the fourth question is sort of a catch-all: did the Maryland Tax Court commit any other clear errors, and I find that they did not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">The circuit court issued an order reflecting this holding on December 11, 2008.

In his view, the compensation from his employers for this period is not subject to taxation. As noted above, appellant presents a variety of questions in his challenge to the decision by the Tax Court. <em>See </em>n. 2, <em>ante. </em>We have carefully reviewed his arguments and shall address his salient points below. At this juncture, however, we consider the core issue presented, <em>ie., </em>we determine whether the Tax Court erred in ruling that appellant was not entitled to exclude from taxable wages the compensation he received from employers in 2004 and whether the frivolous return penalties assessed against him for the 1999 up to and including 2002 and 2004 were unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\"><em>Comptroller\u2019s Calculation of 2004 Income and \u201cAdjustment of Return </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">As best can be determined, appellant complains that the Comptroller unlawfully adjusted his returns. Essentially, he asserts that the federal adjusted gross income is conclusive and binds the Comptroller, and that the Comptroller employee who made the adjustment and issued the assessment acted beyond her authority.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>In <em>Comptroller v. Colonial Farm Credit, ACA, ante, </em>the Comptroller appealed the allowances by the circuit court of the refund claims of an Agricultural Credit Association (ACA) taxpayer that were based on amended tax returns. At issue was whether the Comptroller was bound by a settlement between the taxpayer and the Internal Revenue Service. We concluded that the Comptroller was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Writing for this Court, Judge Kenney pointed out that, while \u201cMaryland tax law looks only to the total federal taxable income generated on the federal tax return,\u201d he further observed that \u201cother aspects of federal law that might ultimately affect the taxpayer\u2019s federal tax liability\u201d such as certain federal deductions do not enter into the Maryland tax calculus. <em>Comptroller v. Colonial Farm Credit, ACA, </em>173 Md.App. at 182, 918 A.2d 514. We then emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">[T]he Comptroller is not required to accept the federal taxable income figure provided on a taxpayer\u2019s federal tax return merely because that figure was accepted by the IRS. To the contrary, the doctrine of conformity presupposes a truthful and accurate federal taxable income figure: \u201cObviously the Maryland law contemplates the truthful reporting of income on the federal return; otherwise a defrauding taxpayer, while subject to federal prosecution, would escape state prosecution, a result hardly contemplated by the legislature.\u201d <em>Winters v. State, </em>301 Md. 214, 236, 482 A.2d 886 (1984).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">The Comptroller therefore has the authority to adjust a taxpayer\u2019s taxable income to ensure that it is truthful and accurate under the IRC:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">If a taxpayer failed to report certain income on its federal tax return that the I.R.C. mandated it to report, and the IRS accepted that figure, [the Comptroller] should be permitted to recalculate the Maryland modified income because the federal taxable income figure it relies on would be incorrect. Likewise, if the IRS exercised its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>discretion to create mandatory regulations that required the taxpayer to report certain income, and the taxpayer failed to do so, [the Comptroller] could follow those IRS regulations in recalculating the Maryland modified income. In both cases, the statute or regulation are rigid and objective in their determination of what is taxable income. If we were to hold that [the Comptroller] could never apply such provisions, then taxpayers who evade their federal income taxes would be free, without considering criminal sanctions, to evade their Maryland income tax obligation as well. We should not attribute such an illogical intent to the Legislature\u2019s 1967 revision of the state tax code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><em>Comptroller v. Colonial Farm Credit, </em>173 Md.App. at 183-84, 918 A.2d 514 (quoting <em>Comptroller v. Gannett Co., </em>356 Md. 699, 716, 741 A.2d 1130 (1999) (footnote omitted)). <em>Cf Katzenberg v.

Appellant\u2019s claim that his Maryland return is necessarily compelled by a federal filing is without merit. The federal adjusted gross income is not binding on the Comptroller if that figure is demonstrably incorrect. The Comptroller\u2019s audit power is not constrained by an incorrect or fraudulent federal adjusted gross income.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\n<em>Authority of Comptroller Employee</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Appellant insists that the employee of the Comptroller who assessed his frivolous return penalties lacked the authority to do so. He asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\">[Ms.] Gorman\u2019s conclusion [in the Notice of Final Determination] concerning [Ms.] Bormuth\u2019s authority to issue an assessment is erroneous because nowhere in [Ms.] Bor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>muth\u2019s job description does it state that an auditor making an adjustment to a tax return is a Tax Collector that can assess a tax or penalty. As a matter of fact her job description specifically states that she will attend appeal hearings regarding adjustments made as a result of an audit or a tax protestor case. [Ms.] Bormuth did not submit any evidence to support Gorman\u2019s contention that an audit was conducted of [Mr.] Bert\u2019s 2003 tax return and [Mr.] Bert is unaware of being identified as a tax protestor by [Ms.] Bormuth. Therefore, [Ms.] Bormuth may testify at a hearing as to why an adjustment is warranted, but nowhere does her job description state she has assessment authority. It appears [Ms.] Gorman accomplishes the assessment authority in [Mr.] Bert\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">This argument is without merit. We agree with the analysis, as set forth by Ms. Gorman in the \u201cNotice of Final Assessment,\u201d that Ms. Bormuth possesses the authority to assess a frivolous return penalty. The statutory definition of \u201cComptroller\u201d embraces an employee acting within the scope of employment and also an \u201cagent or representative of the Comptroller acting within the scope of the Comptroller\u2019s authority.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> TG \u00a7\u00a7 1-101(e)(2)(i), (ii). The fact that Ms. Bormuth is authorized to \u201cattend appeal hearings\u201d does not, as apparently suggested by appellant, undermine her authority to assess penalties. TG \u00a7 13 \u2014 101(c)(2)(ii) defines \u201ctax collector\u201d to include the \u201cComptroller,\u201d and we conclude that the term \u201cComptroller\u201d embraces any employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">TG \u00a7 13-401(a) provides that, \u201cif a tax collector examines or audits a return and determines that the tax due exceeds the amount shown on the return, the tax collector shall assess the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>deficiency.\u201d TG \u00a7 13-705(a) authorizes the Comptroller to assess a frivolous return penalty. In each instance, we conclude that the Tax-General Article authorizes the Comptroller, and employees to whom the tax collection authority is delegated, to render necessary assessments. We note in passing that, while the Tax-General Article does not define the term \u201cassessment,\u201d the Supreme Court has recognized in a case that addressed the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, that \u201c[i]n ... tax law generally, an assessment is closely tied to the collection of a tax, <em>i.e., </em>the assessment is the official recording of liability that triggers levy and collection efforts.\u201d <em>Hibbs v. Winn, </em>542 U.S. 88, 101, 124 S.Ct. 2276, 159 L.Ed.2d 172 (2004). According to a job description, the \u201cpurpose\u201d of Ms. Bormuth\u2019s position as a Revenue Specialist \u201cis to audit individual income tax returns to determine if the information on the return is correct and to adjust the returns when necessary based on the audit findings.\u201d Rendering an assessment, in our view, falls within the scope of Ms. Bormuth\u2019s work.

The Tax Court rejected appellant\u2019s various theories as to why he should be allowed to avoid his tax obligations and upheld the Comptroller\u2019s recalculation of appellant\u2019s income for 2004.

This position has specifically been disapproved by the Internal Revenue Service:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">Section 3401(a) provides that \u201cwages\u201d include all remuneration for services performed by an employee for his employer. Section 3121(a) provides a similar definition of wages for FICA tax purposes. The argument that only federal employees and persons residing in Washington, D.C. or federal territories and enclaves are subject to tax is based on a misinterpretation of section 3401(c), which defines \u201cemployee\u201d and states that the term \u201cincludes an officer, employee or elected official of the United States, a State, or any political subdivision thereof----\u201d Section 31.3401(c)-l of the Employment Tax Regulations provides that the term \u201cemployee\u201d includes every individual performing services if the relationship between that individual and the person for whom he performs such services is the legal relationship of employer and employee. Section 7701(c) states that the use of the word \u201cincludes\u201d \u201cshall not be deemed to exclude other things otherwise within the meaning of the term defined.\u201d Thus, the word \u201cincludes\u201d as used in the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d under \u00a7 3401(c) is a term of enlargement, not of limitation.

One of the six issues raised on Latham\u2019s direct appeal from the judgments of conviction and sentence was that the district court erred by refusing to propound various jury instructions. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit rejected Latham\u2019s claim of error with respect to two theories that are similar to appellant\u2019s interpretation of the Internal Revenue Code; the court\u2019s comment is instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">The other jury instructions proffered by the defendant are equally inane.

Life Assurance Co. v. United States, </em>678 F.2d 180, 183 (Ct. Cl.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">One of appellant\u2019s main contentions was that, for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code, Maryland was not part of the United States. This claim is without merit. In <em>United States v. Sloan, </em>939 F.2d 499, 500-01 (7th Cir.1991) (citations and internal quotations omitted), the Seventh Circuit rejected the theory that an individual, for purposes of the IRC, was not subject to federal tax:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Also basic to Mr. Sloan\u2019s \u201cfreedom from income tax theory\u201d is his contention that he is not a citizen of the United States, but rather, that he is a freeborn, natural individual, a citizen of the State of Indiana, and a \u201cmaster\u201d \u2014 not \u201cservant\u201d \u2014 of his government. As a result, he claims that he is not subject to the jurisdiction of the laws of the United States. This strange argument has been previously rejected as well. \u201cAll individuals, natural or unnatural, must pay federal income tax on their wages,\u201d regardless of whether they requested, obtained or exercised any privilege from the federal government.... An individual is a \u201cperson\u201d under the Internal Revenue Code. Moreover, the tax code imposes a direct nonapportioned [income] tax upon United States citizens throughout the nation, not just in federal enclaves, such as postal offices and Indian reservations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">As one commentator observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">The Internal Revenue Code imposes an income tax on the income of every individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States. Many protesters contend that they are not citizens of the United States but rather are one of the following: (1) freeborn, natural individuals; (2) citizens of State X; or (3) nonresident aliens. As a result, protesters claim they are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\u2019 tax laws. This claim is based upon an interpretation of the 1913 Internal Revenue Act which defined the words \u201cstate\u201d and \u201cUnited States\u201d to \u201cinclude\u201d United States territories and the District of Columbia. Protesters argue the word \u201cinclude\u201d is a term of limitation rather than of definition, and thus conclude that the term \u201cindividual\u201d within the Internal Revenue Code only applies to persons within such jurisdictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">The protesters\u2019 argument is meritless. \u201cWhile the Fourteenth Amendment does not create a national citizenship, it has the effect of making that citizenship \u2018paramount and dominant\u2019 instead of \u2018derivative and dependent\u2019 upon state citizenship.\u201d Thus, all natural born individuals are United States citizens, irrespective of where they reside in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>United States. Accordingly, all citizens are subject to the Internal Revenue Code and therefore, to the federal income tax.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">Christopher S.

Bell concedes that section 861 itself does not exempt domestically earned wages of U.S. citizens. No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>doubt Bell makes this concession because section 861 plainly provides that \u201c[c]ompensation for labor or personal services performed in the United States ...\u201d shall be treated as income from sources within the United States. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 861(a)(3).

Bell\u2019s clients typically file zero income tax returns with an \u201casseveration of claimed income\u201d attached, disputing the gross income indicated on the taxpayer\u2019s W-2 forms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><em>United States v.

According to a recent opinion by another federal district court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6Q\">Section 861 of the IRC is part of Subchapter N, which makes explicit that \u201c[c]ompensation for labor or personal services performed in the United States\u201d is income from within the United States, and thus not foreign income which may be exempt or excepted from computation of a taxpayer\u2019s income for federal income tax purposes. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 861(a)(3). As the Honorable Norman H. Wolfe, United States Special Trial Judge for the United States Tax Court, noted: \u201cThe rules of sections 861-865 have significance in determining whether income is considered from sources within or without the United States.

Again, Mr. Langbaum says because \u2014 or the Comptroller says because it\u2019s zero, on its face, is saying that it\u2019s incorrect. But that number matches my Federal return, it matches my W-2, okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">Then it goes on and says, And the conduct of the individual is due to a desire, apparent on the face of the return, to delay or impede the administration of the provisions of Title 10. I filed my return according to the law. I\u2019m not trying to delay or impede. I just filed my returns according to the law. That\u2019s all I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">They say, it has no basis in law or fact.

I understand. So all in all, Your Honor, I filed my returns according to the law verbatim, you know, what I did on my Federal return, how I determined the W-2 return, and then from that I put that information on my Maryland Tax Return. That\u2019s what I did for all these years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">Contesting the Tax Court\u2019s ruling with respect to the frivolous return penalty, appellant insists that both the Comptroller and Tax Court misapplied the return penalty. He challenges their interpretation of TG \u00a7 18-705, which provision, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>argues, \u201cis concerned with the status of the income tax return filed by appellant and does not state that an \u2018alleged exclusion\u2019 of wages paid by employer is grounds for a frivolous return penalty.\u201d Appellant contends that the Comptroller incorrectly modified his federal adjusted gross income, an amount that, he insists, he had been \u201crequired by law\u201d to carry over to his Maryland return. He also maintains that, because the Comptroller adjusted his Maryland tax return, then he is no longer responsible for that return so as to be subject to a penalty for filing a frivolous return. Appellant also reasons that, because of the Comptroller\u2019s adjustments, he bears no responsibility for the adjusted return.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Asserting that the question of the validity of a tax return is one of law, appellant maintains that his return, based on the entry of his adjusted gross income from his federal return, is valid, and refers us to the opinions of federal intermediate appellate courts that purport to validate a \u201czero return.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>See United States v.

Moore, </em>627 F.2d at 834. The United States Tax Court in <em>Beard v. Comm\u2019r, </em>82 T.C. 766, 777-79 (1984), articulated a four-part test to gauge whether a filing constituted a \u201creturn\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">The Supreme Court test to determine whether a document is sufficient for statute of limitations purposes has several elements: First, there must be sufficient data to calculate tax liability; second, the document must purport to be a return; third, there must be an honest and reasonable attempt to satisfy the requirements of the tax law; and fourth, the taxpayer must execute the return under penalties of perjury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-7\"><em>Beard v. Comm\u2019r, </em>82 T.C. 766, 777 (1984), <em>aff'd, </em>793 F.2d 139 (6th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>We have previously rejected the assertion that the Comptroller is bound to accept the figure, even a \u201czero,\u201d that is reflected as the adjusted gross income on appellant\u2019s federal filings. We now conclude that the Tax Court did not err in ruling that the \u201czero\u201d returns were frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">In <em>United States v. Long, </em>the Ninth Circuit held that a \u201czero return\u201d filed by the taxpayer presented sufficient \u201cinformation relating to the taxpayer\u2019s income from which the tax can be computed.\u201d <em>Long, </em>618 F.2d at 75. In <em>Moore, </em>the Seventh Circuit observed in <em>dicta </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">The Ninth Circuit is clearly correct in stating that a tax liability could be computed from zeroes, or from small amounts. The fact that the information is inaccurate only means that the tax owed, if any, will be wrong, not that it cannot be calculated. When the income information is incomplete, a more difficult problem is presented, but as long as a total income figure is given, the I.R.S. could compute the tax.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-6\"><em>United States v. Moore, </em>627 F.2d at 835.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s theory, and reliance on <em>Long </em>and <em>Moore, </em>appears to be that, as long as his tax liability can be computed from zeros, he cannot be viewed as not filing a return.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding in <em>Long </em>has not convinced many other courts. In <em>In re McKay, </em>430 B.R. 246, 250-51 (Bankr. M.D.Fla.2010), the bankruptcy court expressed its disagreement with <em>Long, </em>finding the Ninth\u2019s Circuit\u2019s reasoning \u201cunpersuasive.\u201d The United States Tax Court, relying on a decision by the Tenth Circuit, similarly rejected the holding in <em>Long.

Mosel, \u201csubmitted to the government a Form 1040 tax return ... on which he indicated that he had zero income from wages ... that he had no income taxes, and that he was entitled to a refund on all the taxes which had been withheld[.]\u201d <em>Mosel, </em>738 F.2d at 158. The government, of course, disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Mosel was prosecuted and convicted, <em>inter alia, </em>on two counts of willfully failing to file income tax returns. In his defense, one of his claims was that his convictions were improper \u201cbecause he did submit a return indicating that he owed no taxes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mosel relied on <em>Long </em>to buttress this argument. The Sixth Circuit was not persuaded when it entertained Mosel\u2019s direct appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">Upon consideration, we reject the position of the Ninth Circuit and hold instead that the Form 1040 submitted was properly construed as no return because of its failure to include any information upon which tax could be calculated. Accordingly, we align ourselves with those circuits which have specifically considered and rejected the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Long. United States v. Rickman, </em>638 F.2d 182 (10th Cir.1980); <em>United States v.

By hearing evidence and argument, the Tax Court was fulfilling its obligation to conduct a <em>de novo </em>hearing. Indeed, Tax-General \u00a7 15-523 dictates that \u201c[a]n appeal before the Tax Court shall be heard de novo and conducted in a manner similar to a proceeding in a court of general jurisdiction sitting without a jury.\u201d For this reason, the Tax Court heard testimony and argument in the same manner as a nonjury trial, with the attendant testimony, admission of evidence, argument and opportunity for cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\"><em>Admission of Evidence </em>\u2014 Due <em>Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Appellant complains that evidence from the administrative record was not forwarded to the Tax Court, as required by TG \u00a7 13-520. He asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">Judge Silberg did not benefit from the expertise of an administrative body at the pre-judicial stage because the administrative record was not provided by the Comptroller as required by TG \u00a7 13-520 and Judge Silberg refused to consider the final determination issued by the Comptroller during the MTC hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-9\">Clearly, Judge Silberg did not rely on the agency\u2019s fact-finding results and admittedly made his decision on evidence presented at the MTC hearing. Therefore, in the absence of an administrative record and Judge Silberg\u2019s admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>independent ruling, the MTC did not provide petitioner with a <em>de novo </em>review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">He then complains that the \u201cacceptance of this new evidence by the MTC was a clear violation of MD Rule 5-103(a)(l).\u201d This contention is without merit. Our discussion of the Tax Court\u2019s role and the nature of its <em>\u201cde novo </em>\u201d function and responsibility to create a record forecloses appellant\u2019s argument. Moreover, we note, appellant\u2019s citation to Maryland Rule 5 \u2014 103(a)(1) is misplaced because the \u201cTax Court is not bound by the technical rules of evidence.\u201d TG \u00a7 13-524.

The Supreme Court has observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">The Fifth Amendment declares in part that \u201cNo person * * * shall be compelled in any Criminal Case to be a witness against himself\u2019. This guarantee against testimonial compulsion, like other provisions of the Bill of Rights, \u201cwas added to the original Constitution in the conviction that too high a price may be paid even for the unhampered enforcement of the criminal law and that, in its attainment, other social objects of a free society should not be sacrificed.\u201d ... This provision of the Amendment must be accorded liberal construction in favor of the right it was intended to secure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">The privilege afforded not only extends to answers that would in themselves support a conviction under a federal criminal statute but likewise embraces those which would furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the claimant for a federal crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-7\"><em>Hoffman v. United States, </em>341 U.S. 479, 485-86, 71 S.Ct. 814, 95 L.Ed. 1118 (1951) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The Court in <em>Hoffman </em>pointed out, however, that there are instances where the privilege does not come into play:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">But this protection must be confined to instances where the witness has reasonable cause to apprehend danger from a direct answer.... The witness is not exonerated from answering merely because he declares that in so doing he would incriminate himself \u2014 his say-so does not of itself establish the hazard of incrimination---- To sustain the privilege, it need only be evident from the implications of the question, in the setting in which it is asked, that a responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><em>Hoffman, </em>341 U.S. at 486-87, 71 S.Ct. 814 (citations omitted). The \u201cwitness must be subject to a real danger of self-incrimination, not merely remote and speculative possibilities.\u201d <em>Burns v.

We are mindful that a civil tax matter can ripen into a criminal prosecution, and so a Fifth Amendment issue is a reasonable concern. Notwithstanding, as noted by the Eleventh Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa\">We stress, however, that it is the role of the district court, not the taxpayer, to evaluate the taxpayer\u2019s claim of incrimination and determine whether it is reasonable. \u201cThe witness is not exonerated from answering merely because he declares that in so doing he would incriminate himself \u2014 his say-so does not of itself establish the hazard of incrimination.

Verkuilen, </em>690 F.2d 648, 654 (7th Cir.1982), the Seventh Circuit rejected \u201cblanket\u201d claim of privilege and stated that the \u201ctaxpayer must make a colorable showing that he is involved in some activity for which he could be criminally prosecuted in order to validly claim the Fifth Amendment privilege on his income tax return.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Appellant has made no such demonstration. Aggrieved at being given the choice between the dismissal of his appeal to the Tax Court, in which he shoulders the burden of moving forward and making a record, and actually substantiating his challenge to the Comptroller\u2019s assessment, appellant chose to testify. We consider the following observation by the United States Tax Court to be instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">Moreover, upon considering the innocuous character of the questions, which merely requested admissions regarding petitioner\u2019s places of employment and amount of gross wages received from each, we are unable to ascertain any basis for petitioner\u2019s Fifth Amendment objection. Aside from his naked assertion of the privilege, there is no indication that petitioner had any legitimate concern regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>criminal prosecution. Although petitioner cannot be held to a standard of specificity that would surrender the protection provided by the Fifth Amendment, we do not believe that he was subject to any danger of self-incrimination and find that his Fifth Amendment claim was wholly frivolous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><em>Burns v. Comm\u2019r, </em>76 T.C. 706, 708 (1981) (citations omitted). We discern no basis for relief based on appellant\u2019s Fifth Amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\n<em>Burden of Proof</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Citing IRC \u00a7 6703, appellant insists that the Comptroller has not satisfied its burden of proof. He contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">IRC \u00a7 6702 is the federal frivolous income tax return penalty that is synonymous with Maryland\u2019s TG \u00a7 13-705(a). However, IRC \u00a7 6703(a) Burden of proof states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWT\">In any proceeding involving the issue of whether or not any person is liable for a penally under section 6700, 6701, or 6702, the burden of proof with respect to such issue shall be on the Secretary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">Therefore, likewise, Bormuth has the burden of proving that Bert has filed a frivolous return that has no basis in law or fact, is patently unlawful, and does not involve a legitimate dispute or reflect an inadvertent mathematical or clerical error. Hence, Gorman\u2019s Final Determination is in err when she says Bert has failed his burden of proof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">We are not persuaded. In this case, the Comptroller has met its burden of demonstrating that appellant either filed frivolous returns or understated his tax liability. In the hearing before the Tax Court, the Comptroller introduced both the original Maryland Tax Form 503 for 1999, the amended Form 502X for that year, the federal Form 1040X for 1999, the original Maryland Form 503 for 2000, as well as copies of various W-2 Forms. In addition, the Comptroller introduced computer records for tax years 2001, 2002 and 2004. Pamela Porter, a \u201cliaison between the Comptroller\u2019s Office and the Attorney General\u2019s Office,\u201d in income tax matters, authenticated these computer printouts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>[COMPTROLLER\u2019S COUNSEL:] Ms. Porter, can you identify Exhibit 8?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\">A. Yes, sir. This is an excerpt from the Comptroller\u2019s computer records. It\u2019s W-2 information for Mr. Bert for the years 2001 and 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">Q. How is this information obtained by the Comptroller? A. It is submitted to the Comptroller by the employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">Q. In what format?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-7\">A. In an electronic format.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Comptroller\u2019s Exhibit 9 was similarly authenticated. When appellant objected, Ms. Porter testified that the documents \u201ccome from the employer electronically\u201d and that they are then printed out. She responded \u2018Tes\u201d when asked whether \u201cthe information that is submitted electronically by an employer [is] maintained by the Comptroller in the ordinary regular course of business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">In <em>Kloes v. United States, </em>578 F.Supp. 270, 274 (W.D.Wis. 1984), for example, the district court upheld the assessment of frivolous penalties, and determined that the \u201cgovernment has satisfied its burden ... by submission of [taxpayer\u2019s] return and the letter which accompanied it. On their face, these documents clearly show the frivolous nature of plaintiffs objections.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">The decision in <em>Podhola v. United States, </em>585 F.Supp. 1305 (E.D.Mich.1984) is instructive. The taxpayers in that case \u201cdeleted the word \u2018income\u2019 and substituted the word \u2018receipts\u2019 on the printed form.

Although the taxpayer conduct, in <em>Podhola, </em>differs from that before us, the court\u2019s rationale applies with equal force to the case where the evidence, and argument pressed by the taxpayer, are the kinds of actions that substantiate the imposition of a frivolous return penalty. <em>See Brown v.

One commentator has defined \"a tax protestor ... as a taxpayer-litigant who, in disputing his or her liability for taxes or seeking to delay or prevent collection of taxes, raises arguments based on discredited or irrational premises about the tax laws.\u201d John B. Snyder, III, <em>Barbarians at the Gate?: The Law of Frivolity As Illuminated by Pro Se Tax Protest Cases, </em>54 Wayne L. Rev. 1249, 1270 (2008). A more recent view has been to characterize such individuals as \u201ctax defiers.\u201d <em>See </em>Nathan J. Hochman, <em>Tax Defiers and the Tax Gap: Stopping \"Frivolous </em>Squared\u201d <em>Before It Spreads, 20 </em>Stan. L. &amp; Pol'y. Rev. 69 (2009) (\"Over the last fifty years, the <em>term </em>'tax protestor\u2019 has devolved from describing those individuals engaged in legally valid and protected conduct to those individuals engaged in illegitimate tax defiance!.]\u201d). Appellant may not style himself as either a \"protestor\u201d or \"defier,\u201d but his use of language and arguments that have been unsuccessfully advanced by those embracing these characteristics places him firmly within their company. Indeed, the Maryland Tax Court observed during appellant's appeal hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">You stated that you talked to some individual that you met at some function who assured you that what you were doing was a hundred percent right, but you can\u2019t remember his name. I think that this person is misleading you at best.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">This suggests that appellant found common cause with another person who holds similar views and has spread the \"gospel\u201d of tax defiance. In his article on tax defiance, Mr. Hochman observes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">The tax defiers have evolved their distribution network for their positions over the years, from initially peddling their products to a relatively small audience in books, then audiotapes, videotapes, and DVDs, to reaching out to mass audiences through websites and blogs on the Internet that can be accessed with the click of a mouse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhH\"><em>Tax Defiers and the Tax Gap </em>at 70.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b270-8\">. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1988, 2010), \u00a7 13-510 of the Tax General Article (\"TG\u201d) (authorizes appeals to the Tax Court).

Did the Notice of Final Determination issued by the Comptroller\u2019s Hearing Officer deny Bert his due process rights when it affirmed the assessments of the Comptroller?</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">2. Did the MTC deny the petitioner (Bert) his due process rights when the MTC failed to review the final determination of the Comptroller at a <em>de novo </em>hearing pursuant to TG \u00a7 13-510?</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">3. Did the MTC deny Bert his due process rights when the MTC threatened to dismiss Bert's appeal if he didn\u2019t agree to testify before the MTC, despite the fact that none of the parties who made the determination against Bert were in court to testify?</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">4. Did the MTC erroneously interpret TG \u00a7 13 \u2014 705(b) when it orally ruled that a TG \u00a7 13-701 penalty was not a prerequisite to a TG \u00a7 13-705 (a) penalty?</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">5. Did the MTC err when it ordered on April 25, 2008 that the assessment levied by the Comptroller of the Treasury is affirmed for the tax years in question?</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">6. Did the MTC err when it issued a generic order (lacking applicable law and conclusions of fact) affirming an anonymous decision of a Comptroller employee?</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">7. Did Comptroller employee, Bormuth[,] have authority to adjust petitioner\u2019s state income tax returns and assess frivolous return penalties?</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">8. Did Comptroller present clear and convincing evidence to support his claim that petitioner filed frivolous returns for tax periods 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2004 pursuant to TG \u00a7 13-705(a)?</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">9. Did the Circuit Court err when it affirmed the order of the MTC?</p>\n<p id=\"b271-14\">10. Was the Circuit Court judge bias and prejudicial when he summarily ignored or dismissed all of Bert's preliminary motions?</p>\n<p id=\"b271-15\">This latter contention is not unusual. \u201cIf a court rejects a tax protest argument, tax protestors are as likely to blame the judge as to blame the government litigant opposing the argument.\u201d John B.
