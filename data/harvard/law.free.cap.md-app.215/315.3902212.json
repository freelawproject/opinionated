The appellants are PNC Bank, N.A. (\u201cPNC\u201d) and Sidney S. Friedman, Jeffrey M. Lippman, and William H. Thrush, Jr. (the \u201cSubstitute Trustees\u201d). PNC was the beneficiary of a deed of trust encumbering the property in question and the Substitute Trustees, acting on behalf of PNC, were plaintiffs in an action to foreclose the deed of trust. The appellee is Braddock Properties, LLC (\u201cBraddock\u201d), the purchaser of the property at tax sale and the plaintiff in the redemption foreclosure action.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Appellants raise six questions for our review, which we have consolidated and reworded:</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">I. Did the circuit court have jurisdiction over PNC when it issued the decree foreclosing the equity of redemption on the property?</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">II. Was PNC a mortgagee of the tax sale property and thus entitled to be identified as a named defendant pursuant to Md.Code (1985, 2012 RepLVol.) \u00a7 14-836(b) of the Tax \u2014 Property Article (\u201cTP\u201d)?</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">III. Did the circuit court err in denying the appellants\u2019 post-judgment motions?</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>We conclude that the circuit court had jurisdiction over PNC. PNC was not a mortgagee as that term is used in the tax sale statute. The post-judgment motions at issue are (1) appellants\u2019 motion to stay enforcement of the judgment pending appeal; (2) their motion to require Braddock to permit them to redeem the property; and (3) their motion for what in effect would have been a declaratory judgment as to their rights in the property. The circuit court did not err when it denied these motions. We will affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The property at issue is a 14.3 acre tract located in Frederick County. In 2006, BBR Properties, L.L.C. (\u201cBBR Properties\u201d) borrowed $395,000 from Farmers and Merchants Bank (\u201cF &amp; M Bank\u201d) to purchase the property. Repayment of the loan was secured by a deed of trust on the property recorded in the land records of Frederick County. The deed of trust recited that F &amp; M Bank was the beneficiary of the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">In 2007, PNC acquired F &amp; M Bank by merger, thereby succeeding to F &amp; M\u2019s status as beneficiary. Subsequently, BBR Properties went into default on the loan and stopped paying taxes on the property. From this point, the record establishes the following sequence of events:</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\u2022 May 10, 2010: Frederick County sold the property to appellee Braddock Properties L.L.C. (\u201cBraddock\u201d) at a tax sale, subject to the equity of redemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">\u2022 August 16, 2010: PNC filed in the Land Records of Frederick County a deed of appointment appointing the Substitute Trustees for the purpose of foreclosing the deed of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">\u2022 October 25, 2010: the Substitute Trustees filed a foreclosure action on behalf of PNC against the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">\u2022 At some point (the exact date cannot be determined by the material in the Record Extract), PNC filed a collec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>tion action against BBR Properties and obtained a judgment. This judgment was a lien against the property.</p>\n<p id=\"AV_\">On June 3, 2011, Braddock filed an action to foreclose the equity of redemption. The complaint named as defendants BBR Properties, Frederick County, and \u201call persons or entities that have or claim to have any interest in the property....\u201d but did not name either PNC or the Substitute Trustees. The complaint did, however, mention both PNC and F <em>&amp; </em>M Bank, stating, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-4\">A complete search of the Land Records of Frederick County, and the records of the Register of Wills for Frederick County, and of the Circuit Court for Frederick County ... discloses the following: title is vested in BBR Properties LLC ... by Deed dated June 6, 2006 ... Deed of Trust among BBR Properties, LLC and Farmer\u2019s and Mechanic\u2019s Bank recorded in the Land Records of Frederick County ...; * * * Judgment Lien in favor of PNC Bank (Formerly Farmer\u2019s and Mechanic\u2019s Bank) as reflected in Frederick County, Maryland Circuit Court Case Number 10-C-10-002364 CJ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The complaint made no reference to the pending foreclosure proceedings or to the Substitute Trustees. No summons was issued to PNC, although it did receive a copy of the complaint by certified mail. The Substitute Trustees were not named as defendants in the complaint, nor was a summons or a copy of the complaint served on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">On August 30, 2011, the circuit court entered a judgment foreclosing the equity of redemption on the property and instructing the Treasurer of Frederick County to convey the property to Braddock in fee simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">On September 6, 2011, PNC and the Substitute Trustees filed a joint motion to vacate, alter, or amend judgment, arguing that (formatting altered):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">[Appellants] were deprived of their interest in the subject property without due process of law; the Court never obtained jurisdiction over the [Appellants]; defects in the Decree and Complaint are fraud in these proceedings; pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>suant to Maryland statute, [Appellants\u2019] rights should not be affected by these proceedings; if the decree, as entered, is allowed to stand, then the rights of the [Appellants] will be irreparably prejudiced; [Appellants] are ready, able and willing to pay the amounts due to redeem the property from tax sale.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">A hearing on the motion was held on October 20, 2011. The circuit court then issued a memorandum opinion and order on November 8, 2011 denying the motion as to PNC but granting it as to the Substitute Trustees. In denying relief to PNC, the circuit court stated (citations to the record omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">PNC Bank (\u201cPNC\u201d) was not specifically named in the Complaint. BBR Properties and Frederick County were identified as specific defendants; all other persons and entities were identified as \u201call persons or entities that have or claim to have any interest ...\u201d On its face, this fails to comply with [Tax Property Article (\u201cTP\u201d) ] Section 14-836(b)(iii).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">PNC was served with the Complaint pursuant to [TP] \u00a7 14-839(a)(4). PNC Bank is specifically listed as a party in interest ... despite not being named a defendant. An attorney representing PNC called Plaintiff regarding] redeeming the property in July 2011, requesting the amount of money necessary for redemption. The parties also exchanged at least one email about the right of redemption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">Proper service of process provided actual notice to PNC of the ongoing proceedings. Plaintiff provided a return receipt from the certified mail that was sent to PNC as well as an affidavit of service____ However, PNC admits that it did have actual notice of the proceedings and w[as] fully aware of its interest in the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-10\">The notice\u2019s purpose is to assure that all parties with an interest in or right to property are given the opportunity to redeem the property before that right is foreclosed. In this case, although PNC was not named as a defendant as required by the Rules, it was provided with actual notice. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>To place form over substance in this case would not be equitable. Defendant PNC Bank\u2019s Motion is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">The circuit court vacated the judgment as to the Substitute Trustees because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">Unlike PNC, the Substitute Trustees were neither named as defendants nor properly served with notice.... The Substitute Trustees were not served the Complaint, named in the Complaint, or otherwise notified as required by the Rules. The Court also notes that the Plaintiff was aware that a foreclosure action was docketed against this property, but chose not to notify the Substitute Trusteefs]. Because the Substitute Trustees were neither named as defendants nor properly served with actual notice, their Motion is granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Accordingly, the circuit court vacated \u201cthe Decree foreclosing the Trustee\u2019s Right to Redemption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">PNC and the Substitute Trustees filed a motion for reconsideration. In substance, PNC asserted that it was a mortgagee and, as such, was entitled to be named as a defendant pursuant to TP \u00a7 14-836 and that, because PNC was not served with a summons, the circuit court had no jurisdiction over it. The Substitute Trustees faulted the circuit court for failing to amend the judgment \u201cto specify the rights of the [Substitute] Trustees,\u201d noting that \u201c[Braddock] has refused to allow the [Substitute] Trustees to redeem the subject property, despite proper tender of redemption payment.\u201d This motion was denied without discussion on December 16, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">On November 21, 2011, the Substitute Trustees filed what they termed a \u201cMotion to Compel,\u201d asserting that despite their proper tender of redemption payment and their request for an (otherwise unspecified) \u201cLetter of Release\u201d from Braddock\u2019s counsel, Braddock had refused to accept payment and refused to provide the letter. The Substitute Trustees further alleged that Braddock\u2019s counsel had refused to provide the \u201cLetter of Release\u201d because \u201che did not believe that the Substitute Trustees had standing to redeem the property in light of this Court\u2019s ruling.\u201d The Substitute Trustees stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>that \u201c[Braddock\u2019s] refusal to provide a Valid Letter of Release, despite proper tender of payment, is in contravention of this Court\u2019s Opinion and Order, of Maryland statue [sic], and of the Substitute Trustee\u2019s rights in the property.\u201d Two days later, the Substitute Trustees filed a motion to stay enforcement of the judgment until the resolution of the above-detailed issues. Braddock opposed the motion to stay on the basis that: \u201cPNC ... no longer has rights to the subject property.... The Substitute Trustees cannot have a greater interest in the property than the beneficiary, PNC.\u201d Both of these motions were denied without discussion on January 5, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the circuit court\u2019s application of the law to the undisputed facts before it. <em>Schisler v. State, </em>394 Md. 519, 535, 907 A.2d 175 (2006) (\u201c[W]here an order involves an interpretation and application of Maryland constitutional, statutory or case law, our Court must determine whether the trial court\u2019s conclusions are \u2018legally correct\u2019 under a de novo standard of review.\u201d). We will provide a brief overview of the pertinent aspects of the tax sale process in Maryland in order to place the parties\u2019 contentions in context.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">I. The Statutory Overview<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">In Maryland, when an owner fails to pay <em>ad valorem </em>taxes levied upon real property, the taxing authority for the political subdivision within which the property is located must sell the property at auction. <em>See </em>TP \u00a7 14-808; <em>St. George Antiochian Orthodox Christian Church v. Aggarwal, </em>326 Md. 90, 91, 603 A.2d 484 (1992). After the sale, the owner of the property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>and any other person having an equitable interest in the property, has the right to \u201credeem\u201d title to the property by reimbursing the successful bidder (the \u201ctax sale purchaser\u201d) for the taxes and other expenses paid. TP \u00a7 14-827; <em>see Aggarwal, </em>326 Md. at 91, 603 A.2d 484; <em>Voltolina, </em>198 Md. App. at 598-99, 18 A.3d 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">After a period of six months, the tax sale purchaser has the right to acquire fee simple title by filing a complaint in the circuit court to \u201cforeclose all rights of redemption of the property.... \u201d TP \u00a7 14-833. This action not only gives the record owner and any other interest holders in the property an opportunity to raise procedural or other challenges to the taxes and the tax sale, <em>see </em>TP \u00a7 14-842, but also serves as a means to give those persons one last opportunity to redeem the property. <em>See Stewart v. Wheatley, </em>182 Md. 455, 457, 35 A.2d 104 (1943) (interpreting predecessor statute). The right to redeem is effective until the circuit court enters final judgment. TP \u00a7\u00a7 14-827 and 833(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">As a precondition to filing a complaint to foreclose the equity of redemption, a tax sale purchaser is required to conduct a title search on the property. Based upon the results of the title examination, the tax sale purchaser is required to identify the following parties as defendants and include them in the caption of the complaint (emphasis added):</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">\u2022 the \u201crecord title holder,\u201d TP \u00a7 14 \u2014 836(b)(1)(i);</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">\u2022 the \u201crecord title holder\u201d of any ground rents encumbering the property, TP \u00a7 14-836(b)(l)(ii);</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">\u2022 \u201cany mortgagee [under a recorded and unreleased mortgage on] the property or any assignee of the mortgage,\u201d TP \u00a7 14-836(l)(iii);</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">\u2022 \u201cthe trustee under any deed of trust recorded against the property or any holder of a beneficial interest in a deed of trust who files notice of the interest, which notice shall include identification of the deed of trust, the book and page where the deed of trust is recorded, and the address at which the holder may be served with a summons,\u201d TP \u00a7 14-836(l)(iv); and</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>\u2022 the county within which the property is located and, under some circumstances, the State, TP \u00a7 14-836(l)(v) and (vi).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">To be consistent with the terminology employed by the Court of Appeals in <em>Royal Plaza Cmty. Ass\u2019n v. Bonds, </em>389 Md. 187, 199, 884 A.2d 130 (2005), we will refer to this category of potential parties as \u201cnecessary defendants\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Necessary defendants are to be served with a summons and a copy of the complaint and other papers filed in the case in the same manner as in other civil actions, TP \u00a7 14-839(a)(3), that is, by personal service or by certified mail, restricted delivery. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-121 (a). Unless a necessary defendant is specifically identified in the complaint in the manner required by \u00a7 14 \u2014 836(b)(1), that party\u2019s interest in the property is not affected by the redemption foreclosure proceeding. TP \u00a7 14-836(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">There is a universe of other possible persons who may have interests in the property, <em>e.g., </em>judgment creditors, other lien holders etc. These parties need not be specifically identified in the complaint, nor mentioned in the caption. Instead, the complaint may refer to them generically as \u201call persons that have or claim to have any interest in property....\u201d TP \u00a7 14-836(b)(3). We will refer to this class of potential parties as \u201cother interest holders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">To the extent that other interest holders can be identified by reasonable investigation, due process considerations require that they be given actual notice. <em>See Dillow v. Magraw, </em>102 Md.App. 343, 359 n. 9, 649 A.2d 1157 (1994) (citing <em>Aggarwal, </em>326 Md. at 92, 603 A.2d 484). This can be done by certified mail. TP \u00a7 14-839(a)(4); <em>Royal Plaza, </em>389 Md. at 199-200, 884 A.2d 130. Other interest holders need not be served with a summons; rather, the tax sale purchaser must mail them a copy of the order of publication issued by the circuit court. TP \u00a7 14-839(a)(4). To the extent that these persons cannot be identified, they are given constructive notice through publication. TP \u00a7 14-840. <em>See also Voltolina, </em>198 Md.App. at 600-01,18 A.3d 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>The circuit court may enter final judgment after the expiration dates for answering the complaint. TP \u00a7 14-844. The distinction between \u201cnecessary defendants,\u201d as identified in \u00a7 14 \u2014 836(b)(1), and other interest holders \u2014 the former entitled to be specifically identified as defendants in the complaint and to be served with summons and the latter entitled only to receive a copy of the notice of publication \u2014 is critical because, as we have noted, a judgment foreclosing the equity of redemption does not apply to a necessary defendant unless the party has been properly identified in the complaint and properly served.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Returning to the facts before us, it is clear that PNC had two distinct interests in the property that are protected in different ways by the tax sale statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">First, PNC was a judgment creditor. A judgment creditor is an \u201cother interest holder.\u201d All that is necessary to such a party to an action to foreclose the equity of redemption is to include the generic reference to \u201call persons that have or claim to have any interest in property____\u201d TP \u00a7 14-836(b)(3). Section 14-839(a)(4) provides that the plaintiff may provide notice to such parties by mailing a copy of the order of publication to them by certified mail. It is undisputed that Braddock mailed a copy of the order of publication and the complaint to PNC and that one of PNC\u2019s lawyers, asserting that she was representing \u201cPNC Bank, N.A., a mortgage lien holder on this property,\u201d contacted Braddock\u2019s counsel regarding redeeming the property, although PNC ultimately did not do so.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Second, PNC was the holder of a promissory note whose performance was secured by a deed of trust encumbering the property. PNC asserts that, as the beneficiary of a deed of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>trust, it is a \u201cmortgagee\u201d of the property and therefore entitled to \u201cnecessary party\u201d status. <em>See </em>TP \u00a7 14-836(b)(l)(iii) (requiring \u201cany mortgagee of the property or any assignee of the mortgagee of record, named as such in any unreleased mortgage recorded in the land records of the county\u201d to be named as a defendant). As we will later explain, PNC is wrong on this score. This does not mean that its interest as a beneficiary of a deed of trust is bereft of statutory protection. TP \u00a7 14-836(b)(l)(iv) requires that \u201cthe trustee under any deed of trust recorded against the property\u201d be identified as a defendant. As \u201cnecessary defendants,\u201d the Substitute Trustees were entitled to be served with a summons, together with a copy of the complaint, any exhibits and other papers filed in the case. TP \u00a7 14-839(a)(3); Md. Rule 2-112(a). Because Braddock did not include the Substitute Trustees as defendants, their rights to the property were not affected by the proceedings. TP \u00a7 14-836(b)(2). We now turn to the parties\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">II. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">PNC argues that, as the holder of the note secured by the deed of trust, it was a mortgagee. It points out that TP \u00a7 14-836(b) requires mortgagees to be named as defendants and to be served with a summons. Because no such service occurred, PNC argues that the circuit court never acquired personal jurisdiction over it. As we will explain in Part III, PNC\u2019s premise, namely, that it is a mortgagee of the property, is incorrect. PNC\u2019s argument also conflates somewhat constitutional limitations upon the exercise of jurisdiction in <em>in person-am </em>and <em>in rem </em>actions, and the conceptually distinct restrictions imposed by statute upon the authority of circuit court in tax sale proceedings. We will discuss this matter first.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\u201cTraditionally, when a state court based its jurisdiction upon its authority over the defendant\u2019s person, personal service was considered essential for the court to bind individuals who did not submit to its jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Mennonite Bd. of Missions v. Adams, </em>462 U.S. 791, 796 n. 3, 103 S.Ct. 2706, 77 L.Ed.2d 180 (1983) (citing <em>Hamilton v. Brown, </em>161 U.S. 256, 275, 16 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>585, 40 L.Ed. 691 (1896)); <em>Arndt v. Griggs, </em>134 U.S. 316, 320, 10 S.Ct. 557, 33 L.Ed. 918 (1890); <em>Pennoyer v. Neff, </em>95 U.S. 714, 726, 733-734, 24 L.Ed. 565 (1878).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">In contrast,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">in <em>in rem </em>or <em>quasi in rem </em>proceedings in which jurisdiction was based on the court\u2019s power over property within its territory, constructive notice to nonresidents was traditionally understood to satisfy the requirements of due process. In order to settle questions of title to property within its territory, a state court was generally required to proceed by an <em>in rem </em>action since the court could not otherwise bind nonresidents. At one time constructive service was considered the only means of notifying nonresidents since it was believed that \u201c[process] from the tribunals of one State cannot run into another State.\u201d <em>Pennoyer v. Neff, supra, </em>at 727.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">\n<em>Mennonite Bd. of Missions, supra.</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>3</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Maryland retains the concept that a summons is necessary in an <em>in personam </em>action to bring a party under the jurisdiction of the court. <em>See, e.g., Flanagan v. Dep\u2019t of Human Res. et al., </em>412 Md. 616, 623-24, 989 A.2d 1139 (2010); <em>Hagler v. Bennett, </em>367 Md. 556, 561, 790 A.2d 6 (2002) (\u201cIt is true, of course, that, even if the other procedural rules are followed, a court may not enter a valid judgment against a person unless it has acquired personal jurisdiction over that person, which ordinarily is obtained by validly serving the defendant with process.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>The instant case was not, however, an <em>in personam </em>proceeding. A court\u2019s resolution of questions of title and ownership to real property is a paradigmatic exercise of <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction and it has long been the law of this State that redemption foreclosure actions are <em>in rem. See, e.g., Royal Plaza Cmty. Ass\u2019n v. Bonds, </em>389 Md. 187, 199, 884 A.2d 130 (2005) (\u201c \u2018The law is established that tax foreclosure proceedings are in rem and not in personam.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Sanchez v. James, </em>209 Md. 266, 270, 120 A.2d 836 (1956))); <em>Gathwright v. Baltimore, </em>181 Md. 362, 367, 30 A.2d 252 (1943) (\u201cWe regard this proceeding as one strictly against the property on which taxes are due and in arrear.\u201d). As long as a court has jurisdiction over the <em>res </em>in question \u2014 a question not at issue in this case \u2014 the court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction in an <em>in rem </em>proceeding is binding upon a party with an asserted interest in the <em>res </em>when the party has received \u201cnotice reasonably calculated to apprise\u201d it of the pending action. <em>Mennonite Bd. of Missions, </em>462 U.S. at 798, 103 S.Ct. 2706. This constitutional principle is reflected in TP \u00a7 14-839(a)(5) (\u201cNotice to a defendant may be made in any other manner that results in actual notice of the pendency of the action to the defendant.\u201d). Under certain circumstances, such notice may be constructive, <em>see Royal Plaza, </em>389 Md. at 206, 884 A.2d 130, but in this case, PNC indisputably had actual knowledge and received a copy of the complaint to boot (albeit without the summons which it claims was its due).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The Due Process provisions of the United States and Maryland constitutions are not the only limitations upon the authority of a court to bind parties to judgments entered in tax sale cases. As we have noted, TP \u00a7 14 \u2014 836(b)(1) requires a plaintiff in a tax sale action to specifically name \u201cnecessary parties\u201d (as the term is used in <em>Royal Plaza) </em>as defendants and to serve them with a summons and a copy of the complaint. If a plaintiff fails to do so, the court is without jurisdiction over such a party, <em>Royal Plaza, </em>389 Md. at 193-94, 884 A.2d 130, and any tax sale judgment does not affect its property interest. TP \u00a7 14 \u2014 836(b)(2) (\u201cThe plaintiff may choose not to include as a defendant any [necessary party]. However, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>rights of any person not included as a defendant are not affected by the proceedings.\u201d). PNC asserts that it was a mortgagee of the property because it was the holder of the note secured by the deed of trust on the property. As a result, continues PNC, it was a necessary party and the circuit court never obtained jurisdiction over it. We now turn to this contention.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">III. PNC\u2019s Asserted Status as a Mortgagee</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Before both the circuit court and this Court, PNC has contended that it is a mortgagee of the property and thus a necessary defendant to the complaint to foreclose the equity of redemption pursuant to TP \u00a7 14-836(b)(l)(iii).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To an extent, the circuit court agreed, deciding, as an initial matter, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Braddock\u2019s failure to name PNC as a defendant in the complaint to foreclose the equity of redemption \u201c[o]n its face\u201d violated TP \u00a7 14-886(b)(1)(iii).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">We disagree with the circuit court\u2019s application of the statute. PNC was not a mortgagee and Braddock was not required to name it as a defendant in the redemption foreclosure action.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">We begin with the Court of Appeals\u2019 explanation of the two types of security instruments in <em>Fagnani v. Fisher, </em>418 Md. 371, 382-83,15 A.3d 282 (2011):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">One who borrows money from a lender/creditor or mortgagee is designated as a borrower/debtor or mortgagor. In order to ensure repayment, a lender or creditor may require the debtor to convey property to the creditor to be held as collateral to secure the debt. The conveyance ensures that the creditor will either be repaid the loan or retain ownership of the collateral. Where the legal relationship exists between only the debtor and the lender, it is evidenced by a mortgage document; however, where the debtor conveys the property to a third party trustee rather than the lender, it is evidenced by a deed of trust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">(Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">While the beneficiary of a deed of trust and a mortgagee both have security interests in property encumbered by the respective instruments, and the means for enforcement are now largely identical,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> there remains at least one important distinction between the two types of instruments.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>A mortgage is transferred by recordation of an assignment in the land records of the county in which the mortgage was originally recorded. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1974, 2010 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 3-106 of the Real Property Article (\u201cRP\u201d); <em>Baltimore American Ins. Co. v. Ulman, </em>165 Md. 630, 642, 170 A. 202 (1934) (Until an assignment of a mortgage is recorded in the land records, \u201cthe assignee assume[s] ... the risk of the mortgage debt being conclusively presumed to be in the person or corporation holding the title of record to such mortgage deed.\u201d); <em>Nussear v. Hazard, </em>148 Md. 345, 350-351, 129 A. 506 (1925) (\u201c[T]he title to any promissory note or other evidence of debt secured by mortgage shall be conclusively presumed to be in the person holding the record title under such a conveyance.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">The beneficiary of a deed of trust is the entity that has the right to enforce the note whose performance is secured by the deed of trust. <em>See Anderson v. Burson, </em>424 Md. 232, 246, 35 A.3d 452 (2011) (\u201c \u2018The deed of trust cannot be transferred like a mortgage; rather, the corresponding note may be transferred, and carries with it the security provided by the deed of trust.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Le Brun v. Prosise, </em>197 Md. 466, 474-75, 79 A.2d 543 (1951)). Deed of trust notes are usually negotiable instruments and the right to enforce them is governed in Maryland by the provisions of Title 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code, codified in Maryland as Md.Code (1975, 2002 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7 3-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Commercial Law Article (\u201cCL\u201d). As a general rule, the right to enforce a negotiable instrument is transferred with possession of the instrument. <em>See </em>CL \u00a7 3-301.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>As a result, the identity of a mortgagee, as well as the identity of an assignee of a mortgage, can readily be determined by an examination of the land records. In contrast, land records typically do not disclose whether a deed of trust note has been transferred and, if so, to whom. <em>See Simard v. White, </em>383 Md. 257, 289, 859 A.2d 168 (2004) (\u201cMultiple bond holders, multiple creditors, the need for the identity of the ultimate beneficiaries to remain unknown, etc. are all practical in a deed of trust format and impracticable, or impossible, under a mortgage format.\u201d); <em>see also Anderson v. Burson, </em>196 Md.App. 457, 459 n. 1, 9 A.3d 870 (2010), <em>aff'd, </em>424 Md. 232, 252, 35 A.3d 452 (2011) (discussing the Mortgage Electronic Registration System (\u201cMERS\u201d) as a means of avoiding recording assignments of mortgages).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">The difference in the ways that beneficial interests in mortgages and deeds of trust are transferred is reflected in the notice and pleading requirements for complaints to foreclose the equity of redemption. As previously discussed, TP \u00a7 14-836(b)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> categorizes potential defendants according to the significance of their interest in the tax sale property. The necessary defendants are afforded the most protection and must be named as defendants in the complaint and must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>served with a summons. This class includes: the record owner (\u00a7 14-836(b)(1)(i)); any mortgagee of an unreleased mortgage, or the assignee of record of such a mortgage (\u00a7 14-836(b)(l)(iii)); and the trustees of an unreleased deed of trust against the property or any beneficiary of a deed of trust \u201cwho files notice of the interest, which notice shall include identification of the deed of trust, the book and page where the deed of trust is recorded, and the address at which the holder may be served with a summons\u201d (\u00a7 14 \u2014 836(b)(1)(iv)). These statutory distinctions reflect the fact that a title examination of a property will disclose the property\u2019s owner, whether there are any mortgages encumbering the property, and, if so, who owns them, and whether there are any deeds of trust and, if so, the identities of the trustees appointed by those instruments. On the other hand, a title examination will not disclose the identity of the current beneficiary of a deed of trust unless the beneficiary files notice of its status in the land records.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">Returning to the facts of the case before us, when BBR borrowed money from F &amp; M Bank, it executed a deed of trust to secure repayment of the loan. PNC is the successor-in-interest to F &amp; M Bank. The loan is unpaid so PNC certainly has an interest in the tax sale property but it is neither as a mortgagee nor as an assignee of a mortgage of record. As the beneficiary of the deed of trust, PNC would obtain \u201cnecessary party\u201d status as to the property only if it filed the appropriate notice pursuant to subsection \u00a7 14-836(b)(l)(iv). However, it failed to take this precautionary step. Under \u00a7 14-836, PNC\u2019s interest in the tax sale property is adequately protected because the tax sale purchaser is required to join the trustees \u2014 or the substitute trustees as the case may be \u2014 of the deed of trust as necessary defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">In short, accepting PNC\u2019s contention that it is a mortgagee would require us to disregard settled Maryland law as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>differences between mortgages and deeds of trust. We see no reason to do this, particularly as doing so would make the task of plaintiffs in tax sale actions materially more difficult, a result at odds with Maryland\u2019s public policy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Finally, were we to agree with PNC, we would render meaningless \u00a7 14-836(b)(l)(iv)\u2019s provision that a deed of trust beneficiary can entitle itself to named defendant status by filing an appropriate notice in the land records. This we also decline to do. <em>See, e.g., Ray v. State, </em>410 Md. 384, 404, 978 A.2d 736 (2009) (courts \u201cread[ ] the statute as a whole to ensure that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">IV. The Post Judgment Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Appellants argue that the circuit court erred in denying several motions they filed after the circuit court\u2019s entry of its order vacating its judgment as to the Substitute Trustees. None of these contentions has any merit and only one deserves anything other than the most cursory of discussions.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">First, we see no error in the court\u2019s denial of the motion to stay enforcement of the judgment pending appeal because such a stay is normally granted upon the filing of a supersedeas bond or similar security. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-422(a). Appellants\u2019 motion to stay enforcement was not accompanied by a supersedeas bond and stated that \u201ca bond should not be necessary\u201d because the \u201cSubstitute Trustees tendered attorneys fees and costs to Plaintiffs attorney in order to redeem the property, however, he has refused to provide a Letter of Release\u201d and \u201cbecause there was no monetary judgment en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>tered in this matter.\u201d These assertions ignore Rule 8-422(b)(2), which states that, in order to stay enforcement of a judgment deciding title to, or possession of, property, including real property, \u201cthe bond shall be the sum that will secure the amount recovered for the use and detention of the property, interest, costs and damages for delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Second, appellants assert that the circuit court erred in denying the Substitute Trustees\u2019 so-called \u201cmotion to compel\u201d Braddock to accept their proffer of the amount necessary to redeem the property. The motion recites that, after the court\u2019s order vacating the judgment as to the Substitute Trustees was filed, they proffered what \u2014 but for the fact the court had entered a judgment foreclosing BBR\u2019s right to redeem the property \u2014 would have been the amount necessary to redeem the property to Braddock\u2019s lawyer, who refused to accept it. The Substitute Trustees asserted that, because the court had vacated its judgment as to them, they \u201cstill have an interest and associated rights in the subject property, and, as such, the right to ... redeem the property from tax sale.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">This argument is a bit puzzling. The court\u2019s judgment (i) foreclosed the equity of redemption and (ii) vested in Braddock \u201cabsolute and indefeasible title in fee simple in the property,\u201d <em>see </em>\u00a7 14-844(b), except for the interests of the Substitute Trustees. In other words, Braddock\u2019s failure to properly plead and serve the Substitute Trustees did not render the foreclosure proceeding a nullity; rather, Braddock took title subject to the Substitute Trustees\u2019 interests. Because there was no longer any equity to redeem, payment of taxes and expenses would not would not have restored title to BBR Properties. The circuit court did not err in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">This leaves us with the Substitute Trustees\u2019 contention that the circuit court erred by failing to \u201cspecify[ ] the rights of the Trustees\u201d in the property, either by separate order or by granting the motion discussed in the preceding paragraph. We see no error on the court\u2019s part. It was under no obligation to respond in detail to the fusillade of appellants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>post-judgment motions. Nonetheless, we will address one issue because it is likely to rise again.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">In its brief, Braddock contends that the circuit court denied the \u201cmotion to compel\u201d because it accepted Braddock\u2019s contention that the Substitute Trustees had no right to redeem because their interest in the property derived solely from PNC and PNC had forfeited its right to redeem by failing to do so in a timely manner even though it had actual knowledge of the foreclosure action. Braddock asserts that the court was correct. We are extremely doubtful that this line of reasoning was the basis of the circuit court\u2019s ruling. In any event, application of the law to the facts of this case does not lead to Braddock\u2019s desired result.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">As we have previously explained, TP \u00a7 14 \u2014 836(b)(l)(iv) provides that, in order to foreclose the equity of redemption of a beneficiary under a deed of trust, a plaintiff in an equity redemption action must join either the trustees of the deed of trust or the beneficiary of the deed of trust if the beneficiary files the notice required by subsection (b)(l)(iv). No such notice was filed, so it was clearly incumbent upon Braddock to name the Substitute Trustees and serve them with summons. Braddock failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Section 14 \u2014 836(b)(2) sets out the consequences of the failure to join one or more of the subsection (b)(1) \u201cnecessary defendants\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">The plaintiff may choose not to include as a defendant any of the persons enumerated in paragraph (1) of this subsection. However, the rights of any person not included as a defendant are not affected by the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">In <em>Smith v. Lawler, </em>93 Md.App. 540, 552, 613 A.2d 459 (1992), we construed \u00a7 14-836(b)(2) in a factual context similar \u2014 in most but not all respects \u2014 to the case before us. In <em>Lawler, </em>the title examination of the property in question failed to disclose that it was subject to a deed of trust. As a result, the complaint to foreclose the equity of redemption failed to designate either the trustees or the beneficiary of the deed of trust as a defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 543, 613 A.2d 459. In holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>that the judgment foreclosing the equity of redemption did not affect the rights of the beneficiary under the deed of trust, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-4\">Appellants in the case <em>sub judice </em>were persons entitled to be named as defendants under the provisions of section 14-836(b)(1). When the appellees in the instant case failed to name appellants as defendants in the tax sale redemption case, they ultimately took the Property subject to the rights of appellants. Appellants retained the rights they had under the instrument of indebtedness. These rights are not limited to the right to intervene in the tax foreclosure cases but include all rights of holders of the instrument of indebtedness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 551-52, 613 A.2d 459.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">What distinguishes the case before us from <em>Lawler </em>is that PNC had actual notice of the redemption foreclosure proceeding while the necessary defendant in <em>Lawler </em>did not. 93 Md.App. at 551, 613 A.2d 459. Braddock argues, in effect, that the deficiency in the complaint was cured because PNC, in its status as a judgment creditor, received actual notice of the redemption foreclosure action and made an attempt to redeem the property. It is true that, in this case, the party secured by the deed of trust note also happened to be a judgment creditor but we are not persuaded that this coincidental happenstance should relieve Braddock of its obligation to frame its complaint, identify the necessary parties, and serve them as required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">This Court considered a very close variation on the facts presented in the present case in <em>Bailey v. Stouter, </em>66 Md.App. 180, 192, 502 A.2d 1125 (1986). In <em>Bailey, </em>the property sold at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>tax sale was owned by a trust. The beneficiaries of a trust were given constructive notice of the redemption action and at least one of the beneficiaries had actual notice. Although the trustees, who had legal title to the property, were properly identified in the complaint, they were never served. <em>Id. </em>at 184, 502 A.2d 1125. After engaging in an analysis similar to that in <em>Smith v. Lawler, </em>this Court concluded that the foreclosure proceeding did not affect the trustees\u2019 interest in the property \u201cby reason of appellee\u2019s failure to comply with [the applicable statute] as to [the trustees], the court had neither the right nor the power to proceed against their interest in the property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192, 502 A.2d 1125 (internal quotation marks removed).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">We believe that much the same analysis is applicable here\u2014 that PNC, the beneficiary of the deed of trust, had actual notice, does not obviate the failure to plead and serve the Substitute Trustees. To hold otherwise, in our view, would not be consistent with the plain meaning of \u00a7 14-836(b)(2), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">The plaintiff may choose not to include as a defendant any of the persons enumerated in paragraph (1) of this subsection. However, the rights of any person not included as a defendant are not affected by the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">When a statute is clear and unambiguous, \u201cours is an ephemeral enterprise. We need investigate no further but simply apply the statute as it reads.\u201d <em>Stanley v. State, </em>390 Md. 175, 185, 887 A.2d 1078 (2005) (citations omitted). There is nothing in the statute that suggests that a beneficiary\u2019s actual notice trumps the clear mandates of \u00a7 14-836(b)(l) and (2), and our analysis in <em>Bailey v. Stouter, </em>albeit based on a prior version of the current statute, is to the contrary. Moreover, were we to adopt Braddock\u2019s position, we would, in effect, write out of the statute the explicit distinction between \u201cnecessary defendants,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 14-836(b)(1), and persons having or claiming an interest in the property. This we will not do. <em>See Fisher v. Eastern Corr. Inst., </em>425 Md. 699, 709-10, 43 A.3d 338 (2012) (stating that \u201cvarious statutory provisions covering the same subject matter are to be construed, if at all possible, so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>that together the sections harmonize with one another and no section is rendered nonsensical or nugatory.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">We conclude in the present case, as we did in <em>Smith v. Lawler, </em>that \u00a7 14-836(b)(2) means exactly what it says and that Braddock\u2019s title to the property is subject to the deed of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FREDERICK COUNTY IS AFFIRMED. APPELLANTS TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-9\">. For more detailed discussions of aspects of this process, see <em>St. George Antiochian Orthodox Christian Church v.

PNC asserts, in effect, that Braddock\u2019s lawyer stonewalled PNC by refusing to respond to PNC's requests for information. Braddock disputes this. The record sheds little light on the controversy. To the extent that PNC wished to assert that Braddock\u2019s actions were wrongful, it was PNC\u2019s responsibility to present evidence to the circuit court, which it did not do.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b349-8\">.

Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950), which \u201crecognized that prior to an action which will affect an interest in life, liberty, or property protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, a State must provide 'notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.' \u201d 462 U.S. at 795, 103 S.Ct. 2706.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b351-6\">. There is another possible problem with PNC\u2019s jurisdictional argument. PNC\u2019s initial motion before the circuit court was its Motion to Vacate, Alter or Amend Judgment. In that motion and its supporting memorandum, PNC asserted that the circuit court had no jurisdiction over it because it should have been a named party to the action. However, in addition to this jurisdictional challenge, PNC contended that the complaint to foreclose the equity of redemption was defective and a fraud on the court because the title report attached to the complaint pursuant to TP \u00a7 14-838 and Md. Rule 14-502 was unsigned. As part of the relief requested in the motion, PNC asked the court to declare the judgment void.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">By joining a contention that went to the merits of the case to its jurisdictional challenge, PNC may have waived its right to contest the circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction over it. <em>See McCormick v. St. Francis de Sales Church, </em>219 Md. 422, 428, 149 A.2d 768 (1959) (\u201cA person who denies that a court has jurisdiction and asks relief on that ground cannot ask anything of the court which is inconsistent with the want of such jurisdiction.\u201d); <em>LVI v.
