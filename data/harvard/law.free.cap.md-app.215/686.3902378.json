The court sentenced appellant to a total of thirty-two years imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>On appeal, appellant presents eight questions for our review, which we have rephrased slightly, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">1. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in admitting into evidence emails that were not properly authenticated?</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">2. Was the evidence sufficient to support appellant\u2019s convictions for e-mail harassment?</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">3. Do the convictions for e-mail harassment merge?</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">4. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in restricting defense counsel\u2019s closing argument?</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">5. Did the trial court err in admitting a letter seized during the execution of a search warrant on appellant\u2019s residence?</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">6. Did the trial court err in permitting witnesses to identify appellant\u2019s voice on a 911 call?</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">7. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in accepting Detective Heverly as an expert in digital forensic examinations?</p>\n<p id=\"b717-12\">8. Did the trial court err in denying appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b717-13\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b717-15\">This case involves appellant\u2019s sustained attempts to harass and intimidate Mr. Zeppos, one of the owners of Growlers Pub (\u201cGrowlers\u201d) in Olde Towne Gaithersburg, and Mr. Alen, owner of the security company that had a contract with Growlers, after an incident that occurred at Growlers on April 10, 2011. Appellant had approached one of Mr. Alen\u2019s employees, Daniel Duncans, and offered to sell him marijuana. Mr. Alen removed appellant from the bar with the help of Mr. Duncans, Mr. Zeppos, and Growlers\u2019 chef, and Mr. Zeppos <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>called the police. Mr. Allen alleged that, while he attempted to restrain appellant, appellant punched, bit, and pushed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Rodney Campbell, an officer with the Montgomery County Police Department, received a dispatch to respond to Growlers. When he arrived, he arrested appellant for CDS violations. Officer Campbell recovered, from the ground next to appellant, a large sandwich bag, which contained 10 smaller bags of marijuana, as well as three hand-rolled marijuana cigarettes. Appellant subsequently was charged with various offenses relating to this incident. Trial was set in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County for October 19, 2011, and Mr. Zeppos was scheduled to be a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">On April 20, 2011, Marcus Jones, a lieutenant with the Montgomery County Police Department,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> received an e-mail forwarded from Commander Willie Parker-Loan, a captain with the Montgomery County Police. The e-mail was from Robert Fox, at \u201cbarsecurityl23@gmail.com\u201d and it alleged that someone in the Gaithersburg area was involved in growing and selling marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">That same day, Darien Manley, Chief of the Maryland-National Capital Park Police (\u201cMNCPP\u201d), received an e-mail tip from Robert Fox, at \u201cbarsecurityl23@gmail.com,\u201d regarding marijuana grow operations in Seneca Creek State Park and Black Hills Regional Park. He responded to the e-mail, stating that he would pass the information to an MNCPP investigator.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">Chief Manley forwarded the e-mail to Detective Greg Worsey, a detective in the MNCPP Marijuana Eradication Unit. Detective Worsey and his partner, Detective Price, began an investigation. They walked through the parks, investigated locations where they had discovered grow operations in the past, and requested flight time with a National Guard helicopter that does flyovers to find suspected grow operations, but they did not find anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>On April 23, 2011, at 2:25 a.m., a man who declined to identify himself called 911, stating that he would \u201clike to report a drug dealer.\u201d The man reported that his neighbor on Sioux Lane, Mr. Allen, was selling drugs to individuals who drove to his house. The caller stated that Mr. Allen had \u201cmarijuana plants growing on the outside of his house on the steps ... in gray pots,\u201d and Mr. Allen had put a bag on \u201cthe outside of his house on the steps, [into] black shoes.\u201d The caller further stated that Mr. Allen was growing marijuana in Seneca Creek State Park and Black Hills Regional Park, and there was fencing in Mr. Allen\u2019s yard that he used around plants.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">At approximately that same time, Mark Norris, a detective with the Montgomery County Police Department who was off-duty at the time, drove down Sioux Lane in his unmarked car. He observed a dark colored, older model minivan sitting on Sioux Lane \u201cpartially blocking the roadway.\u201d Detective Norris was very familiar with the area, and he found the presence of the van unusual because people generally were not out in that area at that time of night. Detective Norris was aware that there had been increasing crime in the neighborhood, and in his experience, older model minivans often were used by burglars. Based on his concerns, he pulled up behind the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The driver of the van then pulled out and began to drive down Sioux Lane, going approximately 10 miles per hour. Detective Norris followed behind and then pulled over and turned his lights off. A few minutes later, he observed the van drive back down Sioux Lane at a slow rate of speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">At that point, Officer Nicholas Jerman, who was training a rookie police officer, Gregory Hollis, drove down Sioux Lane in a marked police car. Detective Norris signaled him, told Officer Jerman about the van, and indicated that they should pull the driver over to investigate. Officer Jerman stopped the vehicle, and Detective Norris pulled up three car lengths away.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>Officer Hollis made contact with the driver of the van and asked him to step out of his vehicle. Both he and Officer Jerman identified appellant at trial as the driver of the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Officer Hollis asked appellant for his identification, and he asked appellant why he was in the neighborhood. Appellant responded that he was looking for something to eat. Officer Jerman noted that, \u201cbeing in a neighborhood, you\u2019re not going to find a place to eat, unless you know somebody\u2019s house to go to.\u201d Officer Hollis observed a police scanner in appellant\u2019s car, which was tuned to the Sixth District channel for police radios.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">After completing a field interview report and obtaining appellant\u2019s contact information, Officers Jerman and Hollis responded to the address on Sioux Lane referenced in the 911 call. Two other officers, John Ceresini and Rick Goodale, who had heard the detailed dispatch regarding the alleged activity at the house, also responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Officer Goodale observed a plastic bag in the driveway containing \u201ca green leafy substance.\u201d Based on his training, he recognized the substance as marijuana. He also observed, consistent with the information from the 911 call, a pair of work boots on the front steps that contained a bag of marijuana. Officer Goodale then looked in the garden area by the front door and found two small live marijuana plants and a roll of green fencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">Officer Goodale approached the front door to make contact with the homeowner. Based on the 911 call, he believed that the suspect was a white man, 5'7\" to 5'8\", named Jason. The man who opened the door was a large black male; he stated that he was not Jason, but Jason was at home. As soon as the front door opened, Officer Goodale smelled a strong odor of marijuana coming from inside the house. The man who opened the door admitted that he had just smoked a joint. A man who identified himself as Jason Allen then came to the door, and Officer Goodale asked him to step outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">Officer Goodale and the other police officers told Mr. Allen that they had received an anonymous call regarding his resi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>dence, and Officer Goodale showed him what they had observed in front of the house. Officer Goodale asked Mr. Allen if he would consent to a search of the residence, which Mr. Allen did. Officers Goodale and Hollis searched the residence and found no evidence of a marijuana grow operation or distribution. Officer Goodale explained that the police did not arrest Mr. Allen because, \u201cbased on what we found at the house, we did not believe that he was involved in any narcotics distribution or possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Before leaving the house, the officers asked Mr. Allen whether he had any ongoing disputes or issues with anyone, and Mr. Allen answered in the negative. They asked him whether he knew appellant. Mr. Allen expressed surprise at hearing appellant\u2019s name, stating that he did know him and explaining how.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">After leaving Sioux Lane, Officers Jerman and Hollis went to the Emergency Communications Center (\u201cECC\u201d), where the 911 dispatchers are located, and they listened to the tape of the earlier 911 call. They listened to the tape twice, a little more than an hour after stopping appellant and speaking to him. At appellant\u2019s trial, Officer Hollis testified that appellant\u2019s voice was on the 911 call.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Officer Ceresini called ECC to determine the phone number used to make the 911 call. He subsequently determined that the call came from a pay phone in front of a Giant store. Officer Hollis reviewed the security footage from the Giant store parking lot and recognized the dark van as the one driven by appellant that he and Officer Jerman had stopped on Sioux Lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">On April 23, 2011, Mr. Zeppos received an e-mail through the Growler\u2019s website, addressed to \u201cAlex,\u201d from \u201cThe Don,\u201d at \u201cpleasuredaddyl23456@gmail.com.\u201d The e-mail read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-9\">You[r] security staff are all dirty, Alex. That is why Jason was arrested yesterday, and the rest of them will be arrested soon enough. I would get rid of Dunkin, and the rest of them ASAP, and hire new staff. Distance yourself from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>them while you can. Hire staff that do not try to rough up the customers, because if you try to rough up the wrong one, you may have more problems than you would want, Alex. In fact, you\u2019re [sic] establishment may disappear over night. Then what would you do to make money?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">On April 24, 2011, Mr. Zeppos received another communication from \u201cpleasuredaddyl23456@gmail.com.\u201d This e-mail, sent to his individual account, also referenced the incident at Mr. Allen\u2019s house and stated: \u201cI also heard that the cops, and the IRS are looking at you really strong now because they think you are the organizer. You need to disassociate yourself from your security staff, and get some new people who will not get you busted, and put in jail, Alex.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">On May 2, 2011, Chief Manley received an e-mail from \u201cMr. Tipster,\u201d at \u201cmrtpstr83@gmail.com.\u201d The e-mail referenced the incident at Mr. Allen\u2019s home on April 23, 2011, alleging that Mr. Allen was selling drugs, and he was involved in a marijuana grow operation in Seneca Creek Park. That same day, Detective Worsey received an e-mail from \u201cMr. Tipster,\u201d at \u201cmrtpstr83@gmail.com,\u201d that stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-7\">We gave a tip to the officers of the 6th District of the Montgomery County Police on April 23rd. We know they responded to the residence of a fellow named Jason Allen. He is one of the growers, and more importantly is one of the marketers. He markets it in the Ga[i]thersburg club scene, and he works at [G]rowlers. Officers responded to the address on Sioux Lane in Gaithersburg, MD near Seneca Creek Park. He had plants growing in pots on his porch, and had just conducted a series of marijuana deals and was so high he dropped a bag on his driveway, and then dropped one in his black running shoes on his fixmt porch on the outside of his house. He even has the plastic green deer fencing on his porch which he uses when he plants in the park. All the evidence was right there for the police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-8\">* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-9\">If the officers of the 6th [District did not arrest Allen on the 23rd, I don\u2019t know why. There was marijuana every<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>where. Simply everywhere. The plants on his porch were two he forgot to take to the park when he went out to plant that day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">On May 17, 2011, Theodore Vaughan, a police officer with the State Comptroller\u2019s Office, Field Enforcement Division, was assigned to investigate Growlers as a result of an e-mail sent to the Comptroller, who then forwarded the e-mail to the Field Enforcement Division. The initial e-mail complaint came from \u201cMr. Tipper,\u201d at the address \u201cmrtipper008@gmail. com.\u201d The e-mail alleged that Growlers was selling untaxed alcoholic beverages and transporting untaxed cigarettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">On May 19, 2011, Agent Vaughan conducted an inspection at Growlers, along with Agent David Hollingsworth. During their investigation, Agents Vaughan and Hollingsworth found no problems with alcohol or cigarette sales at Growlers.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">On June 21, 2011, Agent Vaughan received an e-mail from \u201cMike,\u201d at \u201cbourbonstband@gmail.com,\u201d which contained a link that purported to contain photos of marijuana growing operations for which \u201cZepo \u2014 the owner of Growlers\u201d was responsible. The author of the e-mail stated that he got the pictures from Mr. Allen, who \u201cdirects the operation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">On June 22, 2011, Agent Vaughan received a second e-mail from bourbonstreetband@gmail.com, which also contained a link to photos of marijuana plants. Shortly thereafter, he received a third e-mail alleging that Growlers\u2019 employees were laundering illegal drug money through the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">As follow-up to the e-mails, Agent Vaughan called the complainant, who identified himself as Mike, and spoke to him about Growlers for approximately an hour. Agent Vaughan also forwarded the e-mails regarding marijuana grow operations in state parks to the MNCPP.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">On August 15, 2011, Mr. Zeppos received an e-mail from \u201cMr. Tipper,\u201d at \u201cmrtipper@yahoo.com,\u201d pertaining to the Agent Vaughan\u2019s visit to Growlers on May 19. The e-mail read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>I was in your club on Saturday, and I overheard the guys at the next table talking about the fact that they worked for the Maryland Comptrollers [sic] Office located in Baltimore, MD. I did not pay much attention to the conversation until I heard one of them say that they would, \u201cOwn the club after the audit is complete\u201d, [sic] I am not sure what they were talking about, but thought you guys might want to know what I heard. I really do not know if I should be telling you this or not, or if I could get into trouble for doing so. You know how the IRS is. Only reason I am telling you this is because I visit you [sic] club weekly, and like [the] place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">On August 20, 2011, Detective Worsey was working in Black Hills Regional Park, in uniform, assisting with patrol and road coverage. Lieutenant Meixsell, an MNCPP patrol commander, received an e-mail advising that he would find evidence on the front door of the park manager\u2019s office, specifically a stem from a marijuana plant that was intended for Chief Manley. When Detective Worsey arrived at- the office, he observed a three-foot long branch from the top of a marijuana plant hanging on a piece of brown twine.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">On September 28, 2011, Lieutenant Jones received an e-mail from Clayton Thomas, III, at \u201ccthomas08@hotmail.com,\u201d which stated that Growlers was \u201cdeeply involved in the drug trade,\u201d including \u201cgrowing operations\u201d and \u201cselling it v.i.a. mail order.\u201d It also stated that Growlers \u201creceive[s] marijuana shipments at the bar from growers in VA to blend with their marijuana grown in the County Parks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Lieutenant Jones replied to the e-mail, expressing his interest in additional information. Mr. Thomas responded that he \u201ccould give you the tracking number of packages of drugs that Alex Zeppos \u2014 owner of Growlers \u2014 has shipped to him from Virginia to mix with his weed.\u201d He further stated: \u201cI know that Darran [sic] Manley (Chief of Park Police), and some people with the MCPD already know about Growlers\u2019 grow operation, and what goes on in the club. Why they haven\u2019t busted them is beyond me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>Lieutenant Jones continued to receive e-mails regarding a marijuana grow operation run through Growlers. He did not believe that the information regarding Growlers and Mr. Zeppos was legitimate information.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">On September 30, 2011, Richard Grapes, a detective with the Montgomery County Police Department, received an email from Mr. Essex, at \u201cmr.essex@ymail.com,\u201d which stated that Growlers \u201creceive[s] shipments of marijuana from a grow operation in Virginia, and blend[s] it with the Maryland Marijuana for taste.\u201d It cautioned that Detective Grapes would be remiss if he did not act on the information \u201clike in the case of the Park Police.\u201d Later that day, Detective Grapes received another e-mail from Mr. Essex, stating that he would \u201cbe getting tracking numbers ... pertaining to the marijuana shipments being sent to Alex Zeppos, and Jason Allen.\u201d Mr. Essex asserted that the shipments \u201care coming from Virginia, and while the two people just mentioned grow marijuana, the[y] blend it with what is being shipped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">On October 2, 2011, Mr. Essex sent an e-mail stating that he had provided Detective Grapes with information regarding the shipment from Virginia for free, but \u201c[t]he latest info is not gratis.\u201d The e-mail stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-7\">You will need to do something for me. Zeppos and his security gang get people in his club to approach customers, talk about weed, and if they show an interest he has them point out the guys who sell it (usually security guys). If they don\u2019t want to do it for Zeppos, he is usually pretty cool, and just says he was joking. There was one fellow in April that he approached, but the guy did not want to sell ... Zeppos had his security guys set him up.... The guy was charged. I was not there but my friend was, and everybody knows what happened, [Detective Grapes]. We all feel bad for the guy, and he goes to trial this month on the 19th for Possession with intent, and ass[]ault____You will have a deal worked out with the State\u2019s Attorney saying that all charges will be dropped as soon as you find this grow. All parties will sign it, and it will be legally binding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>They call this guy who was busted Montana. Some people call him Mike.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Detective Grapes responded to Mr. Essex\u2019s e-mail, stating that he would look into a deal for Mr. Essex\u2019s friend, Mike. He testified that he was trying to gain more information from Mr. Essex and attempting to get Mr. Essex to continue to work with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">On October 3, 2011, Mr. Essex sent an e-mail to Detective Grapes asserting that he \u201c[j]ust got wind of a shipment going out tomorrow sometime. As soon as it does I will have some tracking numbers for you.\u201d They continued to exchange emails regarding the shipment, as well as Detective Grapes\u2019 efforts to reach a deal for Mr. Essex\u2019s friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">On October 4, 2011, Mr. Essex sent an e-mail to Detective Grapes indicating that he would have a map of the grow operations for him later that day, and \u201c[t]he guy working with me on this (i.e. mole) has been to the grows, and will mark it out with bright ribbon so you will not get lost.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Meanwhile, Detective Grapes and members of the Metropolitan Area Drug Task Force had been conducting surveillance of appellant, at appellant\u2019s residence and throughout Montgomery County. They began looking for appellant\u2019s maroon minivan, anticipating that appellant \u201cwould be in the process of being out in the woods marking a path with bright ribbon.\u201d They spread out looking for his van, \u201cin parks, highway ramps, park and rides,\u201d and other locations where they believed the grow might be located based on his e-mails.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">Detective Grapes saw appellant\u2019s van parked across the street from appellant\u2019s house. He got out of his vehicle and walked past the van. On the floor of the van, Detective Grapes observed \u201ca Home Depot bag that contained a new roll of bright marking tape.\u201d Detective Grapes alerted his team that he had located appellant\u2019s van, and they were to follow the van to see if appellant used the tape to mark grow operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>Three minutes after Detective Grapes sent out the radio call to the task force, he received an e-mail from Mr. Essex stating that Mr. Zeppos had been tipped off, he could no longer work with Detective Grapes, and he would take his information \u201cto the FEDs.\u201d Detective Grapes realized that the sender of the emails was monitoring the police radio. He then sent out a call over the radio stating that he \u201creceived an email, this wasn\u2019t going to work out, that we could go ahead and leave, and that I\u2019d follow up on it later.\u201d He further stated that a tow truck would come and tow the van, and they would obtain a search warrant for it later. A few moments later, appellant left his residence and walked to his van, at which point Detective Grapes and other members of the task force placed him under arrest. Detective Grapes received no further e-mail communication from Mr. Essex.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">After appellant\u2019s arrest, Detective Grapes obtained a warrant to search appellant\u2019s residence, which he and other members of the task force executed a few hours later. In a room in the basement, which was locked with a padlock, they found a desk with documents and notepads. Included among the documents seized were three sheets of paper with numerous e-mail addresses listed on them. A sheet labeled \u201cSpecial emails\u201d included the following addresses: \u201ctaxman86@ hotmail.com,\u201d \u201ccthomas03@hotmail.com,\u201d \u201cmr.essex@ymail. com,\u201d \u201cms.watcher@ymail.com,\u201d \u201cjrkellyl23@hotmail.com,\u201d \u201cmr.yo_daddy@yahoo.com,\u201d \u201cthebomb00769@yahoo.com,\u201d and \u201cbackdoor.greeky.greekyfinder@hotmail.com.\u201d A sheet labeled \u201cNormal emails\u201d included the following address: \u201cbourbonst band@gmail.com.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">The investigators also found a video camera, an electric cord, and a bag containing videotapes. One of the tapes, admitted into evidence as State\u2019s Exhibit 55, depicted a heating pad, \u201cgrowth media\u201d in the form of a \u201csemi-clear plastic container,\u201d and bags of soil, items that Detective Grapes observed in the basement during the execution of the warrant. The tape contained a narration, which began as follows: \u201cThis is a short film. It will show you the (unintelligible) of getting your plants started, transplanting to outdoor areas, and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>structing outdoor growing sites.\u201d The tape then depicted an outdoor area, which Detective Grapes identified as the backyard of appellant\u2019s house. Detective Grapes identified the voice on the tape as appellant\u2019s voice.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Investigators also seized a computer and other items from the home. William Heverly, the technical leader of the Montgomery County Police Department electronic crimes unit and an expert in digital forensic examination, examined the computer items. He determined that the computer was registered as \u201cBourbon St Band\u201d and contained one user account named \u201cMontana.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While searching the hard drive of appellant\u2019s computer, Detective Heverly found a series of e-mails between Mr. Essex, at \u201cmr.essex@ymail.com,\u201d and Detective Grapes. He also found a fragment of an e-mail from \u201cMr. Tipper\u201d addressed to Chief Manley, as well as a Hotmail account for Mr. Tipper.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Mr. Zeppos testified regarding the series of e-mails that he received, beginning on April 23, 2011, directed to either his personal e-mail account or the Growlers account. The e-mails escalated from \u201ca little threatening\u201d to \u201cvery threatening,\u201d and they contained personal attacks. The last such e-mail he received was on October 3, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Jason Fair, appellant\u2019s former roommate, testified that he moved in with appellant in November 2010 and lived with him, appellant\u2019s wife, and three other roommates. There were plants in the common areas of the home, including the kitchen, the living room, and the upstairs hallway. Mr. Fair had never seen marijuana in the home, but on several occasions, appellant had asked Mr. Fair if he would like to smoke a joint with him. Mr. Fair always declined due to his employment and his personal preference.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">Mr. Fair\u2019s bedroom was on the main floor of the home, and he also used a portion of the basement to build model planes. There was a small room in the basement that belonged to appellant, which contained computer equipment. Mr. Fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>had been in the room only when appellant invited him, and the door was kept locked with a padlock. Appellant showed Mr. Fair photographs of marijuana grows on his computer, and he told Mr. Fair that \u201cthe owner at Growlers was planting all that out there.\u201d Appellant further stated that \u201che knew where a lot of stuff was out there and, if they, the police, were smart enough, they would drop the charges against him and he could tell them where all the fields were at.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">On October 4, 2011, when the police executed the search warrant for appellant\u2019s home, Mr. Fair went into appellant\u2019s basement room. He noticed that there was an additional room, of which he had not been aware. That room contained plants, \u201csilver reflector shades,\u201d a humidifier, and potting materials. He also saw gardening equipment in the room, including a shovel and a rake, and he described the room as having an odor like a cat litter box.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Mr. Fair recalled that appellant had visited area parks for the purpose of tracking deer. When appellant went out to track deer, he would leave the house in full camouflage clothing and come back a few hours later. In addition to wearing camouflage pants, shirt or jacket, and boots, appellant also wore several pairs of gloves. On several occasions, Mr. Fair noticed that appellant wore cotton gloves under the camouflage gloves, and once appellant wore \u201ca latex glove, a cotton glove, and then a regular glove.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Mr. Fair\u2019s rental agreement with appellant was set to expire in mid-October 2011, when he was scheduled to leave for a new construction job in Tennessee. Mr. Fair and appellant had discussions regarding the return of Mr. Fair\u2019s security deposit and prorating his remaining rent, but they initially reached an impasse. Appellant then proposed a solution to Mr. Fair; if Mr. Fair would mail a package for him, \u201cit would be no problem getting [his] deposit and prorated moneys back.\u201d Appellant wanted Mr. Fair to mail the package on his way to Tennessee in mid-October, requesting that he send it from Virginia and give appellant the tracking number. Appellant explained his request to Mr. Fair as follows: \u201cHe said it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>was tax reasons for his home business, it had to be mailed from Virginia.\u201d Mr. Fair told appellant that he had no interest in sending the package for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Additional facts will be discussed herein as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">Admissibility of E-mails</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">Appellant\u2019s first contention is that the circuit court abused its discretion by admitting e-mails that were not properly authenticated. The Maryland appellate courts have addressed the authentication of other forms of electronically stored information, <em>see Griffin v. State, </em>419 Md. 343, 358, 19 A.3d 415 (2011) (pages printed from a social networking site); <em>Dickens v. State, </em>175 Md.App. 231, 239, 927 A.2d 32 (2007) (text messages), but the parties did not cite, and we did not find, a reported opinion in Maryland addressing specifically the authentication requirements for the admissibility of e-mail messages.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We shall address that issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b730-12\">Determinations regarding the admissibility of evidence are generally left to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Hajireen v. State, </em>203 Md.App. 537, 552, 39 A.3d 105 <em>cert. denied, </em>429 Md. 306, 55 A.3d 908 (2012). This Court reviews a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Simms, </em>420 Md. 705, 724-25, 25 A.3d 144 (2011). A trial court abuses its discretion only when \u201c \u2018no reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court,\u2019 \u201d or \u201cwhen the court acts \u2018without reference to any guiding rules or principles.\u2019 \u201d <em>King v. State, </em>407 Md. 682, 697, 967 A.2d 790 (2009) (quoting <em>North v. North, </em>102 Md.App. 1, 13, 648 A.2d 1025 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Authentication Requirements</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Maryland Rule 5-901 addresses the requirements to authenticate evidence, including electronically stored evidence. It provides as follows: \u201cThe requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\u201d Md. Rule 5-901(a). Subsection (b) of Rule 9-501 provides examples of how to authenticate evidence. It states, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">(b) Illustrations. By way of illustration only, and not by way of limitation, the following are examples of authentication or identification conforming with the requirements of this Rule:</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">(1) Testimony of witness with knowledge. Testimony of a witness with knowledge that the offered evidence is what it is claimed to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">(3) Comparison with authenticated specimens. Comparison by the court or an expert witness with specimens that have been authenticated.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">(4) Circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial evidence, such as appearance, contents, substance, internal patterns, location, or other distinctive characteristics, that the offered evidence is what it is claimed to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">(10) Methods provided by statute or rule. Any method of authentication or identification provided by statute or by these rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Rule 9 \u2014 501(b), by its express language, which is derived from Federal Rule of Evidence 901, makes clear that the authentication methods listed in this Rule are not exhaustive. <em>See Lorraine v. Markel Am. Ins. Co., </em>241 F.R.D. 534, 544 (D.Md.2007) (\u201cthe methods identified by Rule 901(b) are nonexclusive\u201d). In <em>Lorraine, </em>Judge Paul W. Grimm discussed the \u201cmany ways\u201d in which e-mail evidence may be authenticated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-4\">\u201c[E]-mail messages may be authenticated by direct or circumstantial evidence. An e-mail message\u2019s distinctive characteristics, including its \u2018contents, substance, internal patterns, or other distinctive characteristics, taken in conjunction with circumstances[,]\u2019 may be sufficient for authentication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\">Printouts of e-mail messages ordinarily bear the sender\u2019s e-mail address, providing circumstantial evidence that the message was transmitted by the person identified in the email address. In responding to an e-mail message, the person receiving the message may transmit the reply using the computer\u2019s reply function, which automatically routes the message to the address from which the original message came. Use of the reply function indicates that the reply message was sent to the sender\u2019s listed e-mail address.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-6\">The contents of the e-mail may help show authentication by revealing details known only to the sender and the person receiving the message.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-7\">E-mails may even be self-authenticating. Under Rule 902(7), labels or tags affixed in the course of business require no authentication. Business e-mails often contain information showing the origin of the transmission and identifying the employer-company. The identification marker alone may be sufficient to authenticate an e-mail under Rule 902(7). However, the sending address in an email message is not conclusive, since e-mail messages can be sent by persons other than the named sender. For example, a person with unauthorized access to a computer can transmit e-mail messages under the computer owner\u2019s name. Because of the potential for unauthorized transmission of e-mail messages, authentication requires testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>from a person with personal knowledge of the transmission or receipt to ensure its trustworthiness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 554 (quoting Jack B. Weinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein\u2019s Federal Evidence \u00a7 900.07[3][c] (Joseph M. McLaughlin ed., Matthew Bender 2d ed. 1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Judge Grimm further noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-7\">Courts ... have approved the authentication of e-mail by the above described methods. <em>See, e.g., [United States v.] Siddiqui, </em>235 F.3d [1318,] 1322-23 [(11th Cir.2000) ] (Email may be authenticated entirely by circumstantial evidence, including its distinctive characteristics); <em>[United States v.] Safavian, </em>435 F.Supp.2d [36,] 40 [ (D.D.C.2006) ] (recognizing that e-mail may be authenticated by distinctive characteristics 901(b)(4), or by comparison of exemplars with other e-mails that already have been authenticated 901(b)(3)); <em>Rambus [Inc. v. Infineon Technologies AG </em>], 348 F.Supp.2d 698 [ (E.D.Va.2004) ] (E-mail that qualifies as business record may be self-authenticating under 902(11)); <em>In re F.P., </em>878 A.2d [91,] 94 [ (Pa.Sup.Ct.2005) ] (E-mail may be authenticated by direct or circumstantial evidence).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AW0\"><em>Id. </em>at 554-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">Specific E-mails at Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">Appellant objects to the admission of numerous State\u2019s exhibits, collectively containing dozens of e-mails. He argues on appeal, as he did below, that these e-mails were unauthenticated and improperly admitted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The exhibits at issue are as follows: (1) State\u2019s Exhibit 23, admitted during Chief Manley\u2019s testimony, containing e-mails originating from several different addresses between April 20, 2011, and September 26, 2011, all but one of which were either sent or received by Chief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Manley; (2) State\u2019s Exhibit 24, admitted during Detective Worsey\u2019s testimony, all of which were either sent or received by Detective Worsey; (3) State\u2019s Exhibit 57, admitted during Lieutenant Jones\u2019 testimony, containing e-mails originating from several different addresses between April 20, 2011, and October 2, 2011, all but two of which were either sent or received by Lieutenant Jones; (4) State\u2019s Exhibit 73, admitted during Detective Grapes testimony, containing e-mails originating from \u201cMr. Essex,\u201d that were all either received or sent by Detective Grapes between September 30, 2011, and October 4, 2011; and (5) State\u2019s Exhibits 28 through 54, admitted during Mr. Zeppos\u2019 testimony, each of which contained an email, sent from a variety of different e-mail addresses between April 23, 2011, and October 3, 2011, to either Mr. Zeppos\u2019 personal work e-mail address or the e-mail address for Growlers that Mr. Zeppos monitored. As explained below, we agree with the circuit court that the e-mails were properly authenticated.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The most direct method of showing the authenticity of an e-mail is testimony by someone with personal knowledge that the evidence is what it is claimed to be, i.e., an e-mail sent to or from a particular person. Thus, the proponent could admit the e-mail through the testimony of the author of the email or a person who saw the author compose and send the email. <em>See Devbrow v. Gallegos, </em>735 F.3d 584, 587 (7th Cir. 2013). <em>Accord Lorraine, 241 </em>F.R.D. at 555 (one of \u201c[t]he most frequent ways to authenticate email evidence\u201d is through a \u201cperson with personal knowledge\u201d pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 901(b)(1)); <em>Safavian, </em>435 F.Supp.2d at 42 (the author of an email \u201cmay testify as to his or her personal knowledge of any particular e-mails he or she sent or received\u201d); Christopher B. Mueller and Laird C. Kirkpatrick, 5 Federal Evidence \u00a7 9:9 (4th ed. 2012) (\u201cA witness can authenticate an e-mail as one sent by that witness merely by identifying it as such.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Here, many of the e-mails were admitted by direct evidence, i.e., through testimony of witnesses who were the authors of the e-mails. Specifically, Chief Manley, Detective Worsey, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>Detective Grapes, and Lieutenant Jones each testified regarding the content of emails that they authored and sent. Accordingly, these e-mails were properly authenticated by witnesses \u201cwith knowledge that the offered evidence is what it is claimed to be.\u201d Md. Rule 5 \u2014 901(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">To be sure, many of the e-mails were not supported by direct evidence. As indicated, however, e-mails may be authenticated by circumstantial evidence that allows a finder of fact to determine that the e-mails are what the State claims them to be. <em>See United States v. Fluker, </em>698 F.3d 988, 999 (7th Cir.2012) (\u201cOnly a prima facie showing of genuineness is required; the task of deciding the evidence\u2019s true authenticity and probative value is left to the jury.\u201d); Lynn Mclain, Maryland Evidence, \u00a7 901:1 (3d Ed. 2013) (an item \u201cwill be properly authenticated if its proponent has offered foundation evidence that the judge finds would be sufficient to support a finding by a reasonable trier of fact that the item is what it is purported to be\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Maryland Rule 5-901(b)(4) gives examples of the type of circumstantial evidence that will authenticate evidence, \u201csuch as appearance, contents, substance, internal patterns, location, or other distinctive characteristics, that the offered evidence is what it is claimed to be.\u201d Circumstantial evidence that has been used to authenticate e-mail messages includes forensic evidence connecting a computer to an internet address for the computer from which the e-mails were sent. <em>Bobo v. State, </em>102 Ark. App. 329, 335, 285 S.W.3d 270 (2008). Other circumstances have included an e-mail reference to the author with the defendant\u2019s nickname, where the context of the e-mail revealed details that only the defendant would know, and where the defendant called soon after the receipt of the e-mail, making the same requests that were made in the e-mail. <em>Siddiqui, </em>235 F.3d at 1322-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Here, there was sufficient circumstantial evidence authenticating the e-mails as being what the State claimed them to be, e-mails sent by appellant. This evidence included email addresses found on a paper in appellant\u2019s home and on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>his computer, as well as the common theme of the e-mails from various addresses. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Starting with Exhibit 23, the following names and e-mail addresses, other than those used by Chief Manley, included: (1) \u201cRobert Fox\u201d at \u201cbarsecurityl23@gmail.com\u201d; (2) \u201cJohn Fox\u201d at \u201cbarsecurityl2345@gmail.com\u201d; (3) \u201cMr. Tipster\u201d at \u201cmrtpstr83@gmail.com\u201d; (4) \u201cMr. Tipper\u201d at \u201cmrtipper008@ gmail.com\u201d; (5) \u201cHenry Clay\u201d at \u201chclay3508@gmail.com\u201d; (6) \u201cMr. Tipper\u201d at \u201cmr.tipper@hotmail.com\u201d; (7) \u201cMr Tipper\u201d at \u201cmrtppr48@gmail.com\u201d; (8) \u201cMr. Tipper\u201d at \u201cmr.tipper2@ hotmail.com\u201d; (9) \u201cMr. Tipper\u201d at \u201cmrtipper2011111@hotmail. com\u201d; (10) \u201cMr. Tipper\u201d at \u201cweedlocator@hotmail.com\u201d; (11) \u201cStanley Skimmerhorn\u201d at \u201cstanleyskimmerhorn@yahoo. com\u201d; and (12) \u201cMr. Essex\u201d at \u201cmr.essex@ymail.com.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">As indicated, the name \u201cMr. Essex\u201d was listed on a piece of paper found in appellant\u2019s basement. And Detective Heverly found a fragment of an e-mail from \u201cMr. Tipper\u201d addressed to Chief Manley, as well as a Hotmail account for Mr. Tipper. Thus, these names, and the e-mails containing those names, were linked to appellant. Moreover, the context of the e-mails from Mr. Essex and Mr. Tipper linked all the other e-mails to appellant because they all referenced the same subject matter, a marijuana grow in State parks operated by the staff of Growlers. For example, the e-mail from John Fox, the name used after Robert Fox was abandoned, begins by stating: \u201cI contacted you yesterday about a person I know who grows marijuana in Seneca Creek State Park, and Black Hills.\u201d Similarly, e-mails from \u201cMr. Tipster\u201d and \u201cMr. Tipper\u201d begin as follow, respectively: \u201cI am the guy who\u2019s been contacting you about the marijuana grows in your park\u201d and \u201cI have been in touch with regard to the marijuana grows in the parks.\u201d The e-mail from Mr. Essex clearly tied it to the other e-mails, stating, in pertinent part, as follows: \u201cOh well. The cheese is all gone Mr. Manning. Maybe next year then. Perhaps by then you will have the money to afford my help.... Zeppos is a little smarter than you, however, because you never got him. He did manage to harvest some of his weed, but not all of it.\u201d Given the circumstantial evidence tying the e-mails in Exhibit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>23 to appellant, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in determining that this Exhibit was properly authenticated.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">The e-mails in State\u2019s Exhibit 24, which were sent to Detective Worsey, came from two named authors and addresses: (1) \u201cMr. Tipster\u201d at \u201cmrtpstr83@gmail.com\u201d; and (2) \u201cMr. Tipper\u201d at \u201cmrtipper008@hotmail.com.\u201d The first e-mail contained information about Mr. Allen\u2019s involvement in cultivating marijuana in state parks and stated: \u201cIf you want the cheese to catch this rat you need to do something for me.\u201d A subsequent e-mail from \u201cMr. Tipster\u201d demanded help for a \u201cfriend\u201d whom Growlers\u2019 staff had \u201cbeat up\u201d and then \u201chad ... busted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Subsequent e-mails from \u201cMr. Tipster\u201d referred to information that the author could provide as \u201cthe Cheese,\u201d similar to the final e-mail from \u201cMr. Essex\u201d to Chief Manley. The last e-mail sent from the \u201cmrtpstr83 @gmail.com\u201d address on May 4, 2011, began as follows: \u201cMr. Worsey, [d]ue to the length of time you are taking to respond, and our need for security, this e-mail address will no longer exist.... I\u2019ll be in touch through another email address in a week or two.\u201d On May 19, 2011, \u201cMr. Tipper\u201d at \u201cmrtipper008@gmail.com\u201d e-mailed Detective Worsey, and stated: \u201cI found the attorney\u2019s name for the guy we saw get set up by the Growlers!\u2019] security staff\u2019; the end of the e-mail contained a link to the website of an attorney referred to in an e-mail to Chief Manley. Based on the information contained in the previously admitted e-mails, and the clear similarities between the e-mails contained in Exhibit 23 and 24, there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to indicate that, not only was the author of the e-mails contained in both exhibits the same person, but that person was appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Appellant next contends that the circuit court erred in admitting the e-mails to Mr. Zeppos. For the reasons discussed, <em>infra, </em>the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in admitting State\u2019s Exhibits 28 through 54 because there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to establish that the e-mails were sent by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>State\u2019s Exhibit 57 consists of e-mails forwarded to, sent to, or sent by Lieutenant Jones. As indicated, Lieutenant Jones could authenticate the e-mails he sent. With respect to the other e-mails, we hold that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to authenticate those e-mails as communications from appellant. Initially, several of the e-mails were sent by \u201cClayton Thomas III\u201d at \u201ccthomas03@hotmail.com.\u201d As indicated, \u201ccthomas03@hotmail.com\u201d was one of the e-mail addresses listed on the piece of paper seized from appellant\u2019s basement. This evidence was sufficient to authenticate these e-mails as coming from appellant. Moreover, the context of those emails, which referred to Growlers being \u201cdeeply involved in the drug trade,\u201d and offering to help \u201cstop this group,\u201d involved the same subject matter as the other e-mails. There was sufficient circumstantial evidence to establish that the emails contained in Exhibit 57 were authenticated as being authored by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Finally, we turn to State\u2019s Exhibit 73. That exhibit contained an e-mail exchange between Detective Grapes and \u201cMr. Essex\u201d at \u201cmr.essex@ymail.com.\u201d As indicated, this e-mail address was found written on a piece of paper in a locked room in appellant\u2019s basement. The contents of the e-mails touched on the themes contained in e-mails to the other law enforcement officers, and they discussed Detective Grapes talking to the Montgomery County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office on behalf of the author\u2019s friend \u201cMike,\u201d who also went by the nickname \u201cMontana,\u201d to have assault and drug charges against \u201cMike\u201d dropped.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Moreover, as indicated, three minutes after Detective Grapes sent out a call to the Drug Task Force on the police radio that he had found appellant\u2019s van, he received an e-mail from \u201cMr. Essex\u201d stating that he could no longer work with Detective Grapes. Detective Grapes then sent out a second call indicating that the officers were to seize appellant\u2019s van, and appellant left his house and walked quickly toward his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>vehicle. The circuit court did not err in finding that State\u2019s Exhibit 73 was properly authenticated, as there was sufficient circumstantial evidence that appellant was the author of the emails contained therein.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Appellant\u2019s next contention is that the evidence was insufficient to support his fifteen convictions for e-mail harassment. At the time the e-mails at issue were sent, Maryland Code (2002) \u00a7 3-805 of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cC.L.\u201d) provided, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">(a) <em>\u201cElectronic mail\u201d defined. </em>\u2014 In this section, \u201celectronic mail\u201d means the transmission of information or a communication by the use of a computer or other electronic means that is sent to a person identified by a unique address and that is received by the person.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">(b) <em>Prohibited. </em>\u2014 A person may not use electronic mail with the intent to harass:</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">(1) one or more persons;</p>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">(2) by sending lewd, lascivious, or obscene material.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b739-12\">Appellant\u2019s sufficiency challenge is based solely on his claim that there was not sufficient evidence to show that he \u201cwas in fact the person sending messages to [Mr.] Zeppos.\u201d The State disagrees. It contends that the circumstantial evidence presented was sufficient to enable a rational trier of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>fact to find beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was the author of the harassing e-mails sent to Mr. Zeppos.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">The test of appellate review of evidentiary sufficiency is whether, \u201c \u2018after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Coleman, </em>423 Md. 666, 672, 33 A.3d 468 (2011) (quoting <em>Facon v. State, 375 </em>Md. 435, 454, 825 A.2d 1096 (2003)). The Court\u2019s concern is not whether the verdict is in accord with what appears to be the weight of the evidence, \u201cbut rather is only with whether the verdicts were supported with sufficient evidence-that is, evidence that either showed directly, or circumstantially, or supported a rational inference of facts which could fairly convince a trier of fact of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 479, 649 A.2d 336 (1994). \u201cWe \u2018must give deference to all reasonable inferences [that] the fact-finder draws, regardless of whether [the appellate court] would have chosen a different reasonable inference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cox v.

Further, we do not \u201c \u2018distinguish between circumstantial and direct evidence because [a] conviction may be sustained on the basis of a single strand of direct evidence or successive links of circumstantial evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Montgomery v.

For real. Everything about it sucks ... especially the funny fate [sic] cook with the pussy hair on his chin.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-12\">Appellant\u2019s contention that there was insufficient evidence for a jury to find that he was the sender of the e-mails is without merit. Initially, we note that ten of the e-mails at issue were sent from addresses that were written down on the piece of paper seized from appellant\u2019s basement. These addresses were as follows: \u201ctaxman86@hotmail.com,\u201d \u201cms. watcher@ymail.com,\u201d \u201cjrkellyl23@hotmail.com,\u201d \u201cmr.yo_ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>daddy@yahoo.com,\u201d \u201cthebomb00769@yahoo.de,\u201d and \u201cbackdoor.geeky.greekyfinder@hotmail.com.\u201d Additionally, a Hotmail account for Mr. Tripper with respect to the e-mail from \u201cmr.tipper@yahoo.com,\u201d was found in the hard drive of appellant\u2019s computer. Thus, there clearly was evidence connecting appellant to the 11 e-mails submitted from these addresses.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">With respect to the remaining e-mails, which were from \u201cpleasuredaddyl2345@gmail.com,\u201d \u201ce.zbar@yahoo.com,\u201d and \u201cmontanablueslblues@yahoo.com,\u201d the content of the e-mails provided sufficient circumstantial evidence for the jury to determine that appellant was the author. Specifically, the emails from \u201cpleasuredaddyl2345@gmail.com,\u201d sent on April 23 and 24, 2011, both made claims that the security staff at Growlers was \u201cdealing\u201d and made reference to the arrest of the owner of the security company, Jason. The April 24, 2011, e-mail also referenced an IRS investigation at Growlers, a theme throughout the e-mails sent by \u201ctaxman86@gmail.com\u201d and \u201cMr. Tipper.\u201d The e-mail from \u201ce.zbar@yahoo.com,\u201d contained content very similar to the first e-mail from \u201cpleasuredaddyl2345@gmail.com\u201d; both e-mails referenced the alleged involvement of Growlers\u2019 security staff with drugs, both insinuated that something might happen to Growlers (it \u201cmay disappear over night\u201d and it \u201cwill not be around much longer\u201d), and both referenced Growlers security staff interfering with customers. Finally, the e-mail address \u201cmontana blueslblues@yahoo.com,\u201d contained appellant\u2019s nickname, and it also referred to the IRS getting Growlers.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Given the connection between the e-mails and items found in appellant\u2019s house, as well as the content of the e-mails, the jury could conclude that appellant was the author of the 15 emails. The evidence was sufficient to support appellant\u2019s convictions of e-mail harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">Merger of E-mail Harassment Convictions</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in failing to merge his fifteen convictions for e-mail harassment. Specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>cally, he asserts that, under C.L. \u00a7 3-805, \u201cthe unit of prosecution is the pattern of harassing e-mails, not the individual emails,\u201d and therefore, the circuit court imposed an illegal sentence by imposing separate, consecutive sentences for each conviction. In support, appellant argues that the e-mail harassment statute was \u201cmodeled off the telephone misuse statute,\u201d which this Court held, in <em>von Lusch v. State, </em>39 Md.App. 517, 524, 387 A.2d 306, <em>cert. denied, </em>283 Md. 740 (1978), prohibited a pattern of harassing phone calls, not individual calls. Additionally, he asserts that amendments to C.L. \u00a7 3-805 in 2012, which explicitly prohibit a \u201ccourse of conduct,\u201d show the original intent \u201cthat the unit of prosecution [for e-mail harassment] is the same as that for telephone misuse: a pattern of harassment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">The State argues that the plain language of C.L. \u00a7 3-805 at the time of appellant\u2019s offenses makes clear that the unit of prosecution for a violation of the e-mail harassment statute is one e-mail. It asserts that, because there is no ambiguity in the language in the statute, appellant\u2019s reliance on legislative history to support his argument is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">\u201cThe key to the determination of the unit of prosecution is legislative intent.\u201d <em>Moore v. State, </em>198 Md.App. 655, 680, 18 A.3d 981 (2011). <em>Accord Purnell v. State, </em>375 Md. 678, 692, 827 A.2d 68 (2003) (\u201c \u2018whether a particular course of conduct constitutes one or more violations of a single statutory offense ... turn[s] on the unit of prosecution of the offense and this is ordinarily determined by reference to legislative intent\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Brown v. State, </em>311 Md. 426, 432, 535 A.2d 485 (1988)). In determining legislative intent, we look \u201c \u2018first to the words of the statute, read in light of the full context in which they appear, and in light of external manifestations of intent or general purpose available through other evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moore, </em>198 Md.App. at 680,18 A.3d 981 (quoting <em>Cunningham v. State, </em>318 Md. 182, 185, 567 A.2d 126 (1989)). In doing so, we \u201c \u2018must always be cognizant of the fundamental principle that statutory construction is approached from a \u201ccommonsensical\u201d perspective. Thus, we seek to avoid constructions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>are illogical, unreasonable, or inconsistent with common sense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Della Ratta v. Dyas, </em>414 Md. 556, 567, 996 A.2d 382 (2010) (quoting <em>Frost v. State, </em>336 Md. 125, 137, 647 A.2d 106 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">\u201cIf the statutory language is unambiguous when construed according to its ordinary and everyday meaning, then [we] \u2018will give effect to the statute as it is written,\u2019 and we will not add or delete words from the statute.\u201d <em>Melton v. State, </em>379 Md. 471, 477, 842 A.2d 743 (2004) (citation omitted). \u201cOnly if the statutory language is ambiguous will [we] look \u2018beyond the statute\u2019s plain language in discerning the legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Clyde\u2019s of Chevy Chase, Inc., </em>377 Md. 471, 483, 833 A.2d 1014 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">As indicated, at the time that appellant committed the offenses, and at the time of his trial and sentencing, C.L. \u00a7 3-805(b) prohibited the use of \u201celectronic mail with the intent to harass: (1) one or more persons; (2) by sending lewd, lascivious, or obscene material.\u201d The statute defined \u201celectronic mail\u201d as \u201cthe transmission of information or a communication by the use of a computer or other electronic means that is sent to a person identified by a unique address and that is received by the person.\u201d C.L. \u00a7 3-805(a). A person who violated this section was \u201cguilty of a misdemeanor\u201d and \u201csubject to imprisonment not exceeding 1 year or a fine not exceeding $500 or both.\u201d C.L. \u00a7 3-805(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Pursuant to the language of the statute, the unit of prosecution is <em>\u201cthe transmission of information </em>or <em>a communication.\u201d </em>C.L. \u00a7 3-805(a) (emphasis added). Neither of these terms are defined in the statute, so we look to the dictionary definitions of these terms. <em>See Lowery v. State, </em>430 Md. 477, 491, 61 A.3d 794 (2013) (where \u201cthe terms are not defined by the statute ... we turn to a dictionary that is contemporaneous with the drafting and enacting of the language in the statute giving rise to the obligation\u201d); <em>Marriott Employees Fed. Credit Union v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>346 Md. 437, 447, 697 A.2d 455 (1997) (\u201cAlthough dictionary definitions do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>provide dispositive resolutions of the meaning of statutory terms ... \u2018dictionaries ... do provide a useful starting point for determining what statutory terms mean, at least in the abstract, by suggesting what the legislature could have meant by using particular terms.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Norman J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 47.28 (1996 Supp.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">Transmission is defined as \u201can act, process, or <em>instance </em>of transmitting.\u201d Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary 1255 (10th Ed. 1999) (emphasis added). Communication is defined as \u201can act or instance of transmitting,\u201d \u201cinformation communicated,\u201d and \u201ca verbal or written message.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233. Both terms contemplate one instance, i.e., a singular act.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">When the General Assembly intends to make the unit of prosecution a course of conduct, it has made that intent clear. For example, two statutes in effect at the time the email statute was enacted in 1998<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> specifically referred to \u201crepeated calls\u201d or a \u201ccourse of conduct.\u201d <em>See </em>Md.Code (1996 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27 \u00a7 555A (prohibiting the use of telephone facilities to make repeated calls with the intent to harass); Md.Code (1996 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27 \u00a7 121A (prohibiting a person from engaging in a \u201ccourse of conduct that alarms or seriously annoys another person\u201d with the intent to harass that person). The legislature did not use this language in the statute prohibiting harassment by electronic mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">We agree with the State that the language of the statute here is unambiguous. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to infer a different meaning based on the legislative history. <em>See Coleman v. State, </em>281 Md. 538, 546, 380 A.2d 49 (1977) (\u201ca court may not as a general rule surmise a legislative intention contrary to the plain language of a statute or insert exceptions not made by the legislature\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>We may, however, \u201c \u2018[i]n the interest of completeness ... look at the purpose of the statute and compare the result obtained by use of its plain language with that which results when the purpose of the statute is taken into account.' \u201d <em>Smith v. State, </em>399 Md. 565, 578, 924 A.2d 1175 (2007) (quoting <em>Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 146, 626 A.2d 946 (1993)). In this instance, our \u201cresort to legislative history is a confirmatory process; it is not undertaken to seek contradiction of the plain meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The legislative history of C.L. \u00a7 3-805 makes clear, as appellant contends, that the intent of House Bill 140 was to create legislation relating to e-mails that was similar to the telephone misuse statute. <em>See, e.g., </em>Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, Senate Bill 222, Synopsis (Feb. 24, 1998) (\u201cThis legislation simply treats e-mail in the same manner that Article 27 treats telephone communication.\u201d); House Judiciary Committee, Bill Analysis, House Bill 140 (\u201cWhile Art. 27, 555A prohibits a person from using telephone facilities or equipment for harassing another person, this bill is intended to prohibit harassment through e-mail communications.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">The initial version of the statute contained language virtually identical to that of the telephone misuse statute in effect at the time, in that it prohibited the use of electronic mail:</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">(1) for an anonymous communication if in a manner reasonable to be expected to annoy, abuse, torment, harass, or embarrass one or more persons; or</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">(2) for repeated communications, if with intent to annoy, abuse, torment, harass, or embarrass one or more persons; or</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">(3) for any comment, request, suggestion or proposal which is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent, if with intent to annoy, abuse, torment, harass, or embarrass one or more persons.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>During the amendment process, however, the language of House Bill 140 was changed to replace \u201crepeated communications\u201d with \u201ca communication.\u201d <em>See </em>Conf. Comm., Amdt. to House Bill No. 140 (Apr. 13, 1998). The version of \u00a7 555C ultimately enacted in 1998 provided as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">(c) A person may not use electronic mail for <em>a communication </em>with intent to harass:</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">(1) one or more persons; or</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">(2) by sending lewd, lascivious, or obscene material.</p>\n<p id=\"Adn\">(Emphasis added).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">This legislative history indicates that the intent of the legislature in 1998 was that <em>a </em>communication, a single e-mail, was the unit of prosecution under the statute. <em>Pleasants Investments Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Dep\u2019t of Assessments &amp; Taxation, </em>141 Md.App. 481, 494, 497-99, 786 A.2d 13 (2001) (noting that \u201cthe indefinite article \u2018a\u2019 is implied to mean \u2018one\u2019 or \u2018each,\u2019 subject to context\u201d). The legislative history confirms our interpretation of the plain language of the statute that the unit of prosecution under this statute is one e-mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">Appellant argues, however, that a more recent amendment to the statute indicates otherwise. As appellant notes, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>General Assembly amended C.L. \u00a7 3-805, effective on October 1, 2012, to provide:</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">(b) <em>Prohibited. </em>\u2014 (1) A person may not maliciously <em>engage in a course of conduct, </em>through the use of electronic communication, that alarms or seriously annoys another:</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">(i) with the intent to harass, alarm, or annoy the other;</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">(ii) after receiving a reasonable warning or request to stop by or on behalf of the other; and</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">(iii) without a legal purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">C.L. \u00a7 3-805 (2013 Supp.) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">The legislative history for Senate Bill 175, the bill seeking to amend \u00a7 3-805<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> indicates that the purpose for the amendment was to broaden the scope of the statute to include text messages, internet postings, and other forms of electronic exchange, and therefore, the term \u201celectronic mail\u201d was changed to \u201celectronic communication.\u201d <em>See, e.g., </em>Letter from Women Legislators of the Maryland General Assembly, Inc. to Brian E. Frosh, Chair, Judicial Proceedings Committee (Feb. 8, 2012) (expressing support for SB 175, which was \u201cintended to modernize Maryland\u2019s existing electronic harassment statute, to include modes of communication other than electronic mail\u201d); Letter from Governor\u2019s Office of Crime Control and Prevention to Brian E. Frosh, Chair, Judicial Proceedings Committee (Feb. 2, 2012) (\u201cBy expanding the crime of harassment to encompass electronic communication, the law is now able to expose criminals and prosecute crimes involving text messaging, social networking, website publications and any other form of electronic exchange as a type of harassment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">The American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland (\u201cACLU\u201d) subsequently opposed SB 175. It argued that the statute, as written, \u201cprovide[d] no definition of or limitations on the applicability of the term \u2018harass,\u2019 thereby leaving the decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>of what constitutes harassment in the discretion of police and prosecutors, without guidance to Maryland residents.\u201d Testimony [of the ACLU] for the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee (Feb. 2, 2012). It distinguished C.L. \u00a7 3-803, \u201cHarassment,\u201d which required the State \u201cto prove that defendant engaged \u2018in a persistent pattern of conduct, composed of a series of acts over a period of time\u2019 that \u2018alarms or seriously annoys another person ... after reasonable warning or request to desist by or on behalf of the other person.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The General Assembly then amended the proposed change to C.L. \u00a7 3-805 to mirror the language in \u00a7 3-803. Nothing in the legislative history of the 2012 amendment to C.L. \u00a7 3-805 indicates an intent to clarify existing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Accordingly, we hold that the unit of prosecution for e-mail harassment, prior to the 2012 amendment, was each e-mail sent. This holding is based on the plain language of the statute, which is supported by the legislative history.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s argument, the rule of lenity does not require merger of his convictions. As the Court of Appeals has explained, when legislative intent can be determined, \u201cthat intent will be enforced, and the concept of lenity does not become an operable factor.\u201d <em>Richmond v. State, </em>326 Md. 257, 269, 604 A.2d 483 (1992). \u201cSince the legislative intent is clear, the rule of lenity is inapplicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>circuit court properly imposed separate sentences for each of the convictions of electronic mail harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Closing Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Appellant contends that the circuit court abused its discretion \u201cby impermissibly limiting defense counsel\u2019s closing argument.\u201d He asserts that the court \u201cquashed defense counsel\u2019s legitimate efforts to attack the credibility of [Mr.] Allen and others working at or for Growlers,\u201d and in doing so, violated his right to a fair trial. Specifically, he argues that the court invaded the province of the jury by: \u201c(1) dismissing the significance of [Mr.] Allen\u2019s prior conviction, and (2) by inhibiting comment on possible illicit activities engaged in by Grow[l]ers, where an important question for the jury was whether the anonymous allegations against the establishment were actually false.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">The State argues that \u201cthe trial court properly confined defense counsel\u2019s closing argument to the evidence presented at trial and to the facts and inferences that may be drawn from the evidence.\u201d Moreover, it asserts that, despite the State\u2019s numerous objections, \u201cthe record evidences that the court\u2019s rulings failed to curtail defense counsel\u2019s argument,\u201d as \u201cdefense counsel ignored the court\u2019s rulings and simply refused to stop making the improper argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">The Court of Appeals discussed the boundaries of permissible closing argument in <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 412-13, 326 A.2d 707 (1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-9\">As to summation, it is, as a general rule, within the range of legitimate argument for counsel to state and discuss the evidence and all reasonable and legitimate inferences which may be drawn from the facts in evidence; and such comment or argument is afforded a wide range. Counsel is free to use the testimony most favorable to his side of the argument to the jury, and the evidence may be examined, collated, sifted and treated in his own way. Moreover, if counsel does not make any statement of fact not fairly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>deducible from the evidence his argument is not improper, although the inferences discussed are illogical and erroneous. Generally, counsel has the right to make any comment or argument that is warranted by the evidence proved or inferences therefrom; the prosecuting attorney is as free to comment legitimately and to speak fully, although harshly, on the accused\u2019s action and conduct if the evidence supports his comments, as is accused\u2019s counsel to comment on the nature of the evidence and the character of witnesses which the (prosecution) produces....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-5\">While arguments of counsel are required to be confined to the issues in the cases on trial, the evidence and fair and reasonable deductions therefrom, and to arguments of opposing counsel, generally speaking, liberal freedom of speech should be allowed. There are no hard-and-fast limitations within which the argument of earnest counsel must be confined \u2014 no well-defined bounds beyond which the eloquence of an advocate shall not soar. He may discuss the facts proved or admitted in the pleadings, assess the conduct of the parties, and attack the credibility of witnesses. He may indulge in oratorical conceit or flourish and in illustrations and metaphorical allusions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Although \u201cattorneys are afforded great leeway in presenting closing arguments to the jury,\u201d <em>Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 429, 722 A.2d 887 (1999), there are limits on the scope of a proper closing argument. Counsel is not permitted \u201cto state and comment upon facts not in evidence,\u201d <em>Wilhelm, </em>272 Md. at 413, 326 A.2d 707, and comments \u201cthat invite the jury to draw inferences from information that was not admitted at trial are improper.\u201d <em>Lee v. State, </em>405 Md. 148, 166, 950 A.2d 125 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">The determination and scope of closing argument is within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Wise v. State, </em>132 Md.App. 127, 142, 751 A.2d 24, <em>cert. denied, </em>360 Md. 276, 757 A.2d 811 (2000). An appellate court should not \u201c \u2018interfere with that judgment unless there has been an <em>abuse of discretion </em>by the trial judge of a character likely to have injured the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>complaining party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Washington v. State, </em>180 Md.App. 458, 473, 951 A.2d 885 (2008) (quoting <em>Wilhelm, </em>272 Md. at 413, 326 A.2d 707).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Here, during defense counsel\u2019s closing argument, he attempted to raise questions regarding the credibility of Growlers\u2019 employees. The argument proceeded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\">We do know that [appellant] was beaten up because Jason Fair testified that he came home from that incident with injuries. So we know that something happened. And we also know, and I\u2019m going to get back to this in a second when I impeached, that means caught in a lie, Mr. Zeppos about his involvement in whatever happened that caused those injuries. What happened at Growlers? Well, we don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-7\">But is Growlers a place where you can buy marijuana if you\u2019re a patron? Just asking a question. Do the bouncers up there have a little side business going on where they sell marijuana? Could be. So what\u2019s happening at Growlers is not defined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-8\">Now, ask yourself some questions. If Growlers people, and that includes this group of security staff or bouncers, they bounce people right out. Let\u2019s say something is happening up at Growlers a little bit on the side. Let\u2019s say they meet an older guy who happens to be a very, very talented gardener, someone with expertise in horticulture, someone who can grow herbs, spices, plants, tropical plants, exotic plants, someone who really knows how to do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-9\">Maybe Growlers younger guys are interested in recruiting somebody into helping them with their conspiracy, or their side business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-11\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: These are questions that you may want to ask yourself based upon the evidence in this case. Based upon the evidence that you\u2019ve heard in this case, you may have some questions about what happened up there. And did something happen that, you know, was it a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>little scheme or plot hatched in order to plant some marijuana?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-6\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: We know that there is a lot of talk about marijuana grows. That we know. And I don\u2019t think anyone will object to that. But you have to ask yourself what\u2019s really going on here, and who knew what, and why did, why did [appellant] get beaten up? [PROSECUTOR]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-8\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">The colloquy above shows that the court did not, as appellant asserts, \u201cdeflat[e] defense counsel\u2019s argument about possible illicit activities conducted by Growlers.\u201d Rather, the court merely controlled the scope of the argument to the issues at trial. The court sustained the State\u2019s objection to defense counsel\u2019s speculation about the incident at Growlers on April 10, 2011, and whether the security staff at Growlers had solicited appellant with respect to marijuana, issues that were not before the jury. The court did not abuse its discretion in controlling the scope of argument in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">The next portion of closing argument at issue on appeal involves arguments regarding Mr. Allen. The argument at issue is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The only marijuana that we\u2019ve actually seen or heard testimony of that anyone had was on Allen\u2019s property. Inside, outside. And now let\u2019s talk about, let\u2019s talk a little about Mr. Allen\u2019s character. Who is the only person that you heard from this whole week who was impeached by a prior conviction?[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>] That\u2019s one of the instructions. The only witness, and you\u2019ve got an instruction specifically on that, 322, impeachment by prior conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>You have heard evidence that Jason Allen has been convicted of a crime. And what was that crime? Does anyone remember? Did you write that down? Impersonating a police officer. Pretending to be somebody you\u2019re not. Taking on a false identity. What kind of person is convicted of that crime? He has got to be a dishonest person, deceitful, deceptive\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-6\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">At that point, the prosecutor asked the court to approach the bench. He argued that, although defense counsel had a lot of leeway during argument, counsel was \u201cgoing overboard.\u201d He asked the court to \u201cstrike the statements ... elaborating on about what sort of dishonest person would do that. It\u2019s improper.\u201d The court agreed that what defense counsel was \u201csaying about Mr. Allen____ I think that\u2019s a little bit extreme.\u201d It stated that counsel could argue that \u201chis veracity is in question and so on, but not the extreme that you were going to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">Counsel then continued his closing argument, making the following remarks with respect to Mr. Allen:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-10\">This man was convicted, convicted of impersonating a police officer. You can consider that when it comes to the truthfulness of his testimony, and that is exactly what the pattern jury instruction says. You may consider this evidence in deciding whether the witness is telling the truth. Right there. You\u2019re going to get a copy of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-11\">So, was he telling the truth when those police officers banged on his door about the marijuana? Was he telling the truth about smoking marijuana inside his house? Question mark. That\u2019s up to you to decide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-12\">Based on the above, we disagree with appellant\u2019s assertion that the court \u201cquashed defense counsel\u2019s legitimate efforts to attack the credibility of Jason Allen.\u201d We perceive no abuse of discretion by the trial court in controlling the scope of defense counsel\u2019s closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">Admissibility of Message Found in Appellant\u2019s Basement</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Appellant\u2019s next contention addresses a typed message recovered from appellant\u2019s locked room in the basement of his house. The message stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-6\">Al,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-7\">Here is your order of Virginia Prime Shake (Table Cuttings). If you need any more let us know. We should have this in supply until January or February.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-8\">Sorry to hear about your crops that got ripped off this fall. Thank God you did find some unharmed. Someone on the inside must have helped these guys rob you, Al. Don\u2019t worry, I can fill the supply void for you until spring. Dean Cook</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">Appellant argues that the circuit court erred in admitting the message into evidence. Specifically, he contends that it was irrelevant and \u201cconstituted inadmissible bad-acts evidence.\u201d We will address each of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-11\">Relevance</p>\n<p id=\"b757-12\">Appellant contends that the message was irrelevant because it was not clearly linked to other evidence in the case. Specifically, he asserts that the name \u201cDean Cook\u201d was not linked with any other evidence, the name \u201cAl\u201d was mentioned only once, in an e-mail to Growlers that dealt with a different subject matter, and \u201cVirginia Prime Shake\u201d was not described to be a known entity. Accordingly, appellant contends that \u201cthe exhibit as a whole failed to make any fact of consequence more or less probable,\u201d and therefore, the exhibit \u201cshould have been excluded as irrelevant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-13\">The State disagrees, stating that \u201c[t]he relevance of the exhibit is patent.\u201d It argues that the exhibit was consistent with e-mails sent to Detective Grapes and Lieutenant Jones, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>and therefore, it was relevant to establish that appellant was the author of those e-mails.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Relevant evidence is \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Md. Rule 5-401. \u201c[T]he relevancy determination is not made in isolation. Instead, the test of relevance is whether, in conjunction with all other relevant evidence, the evidence tends to make the proposition asserted more or less probable.\u201d <em>Snyder v. State, </em>361 Md. 580, 592, 762 A.2d 125 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">As the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Simms, </em>we review a trial court\u2019s decision to admit evidence for abuse of discretion, but we conduct an independent analysis of whether evidence is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-7\">It is frequently stated that the issue of whether a particular item of evidence should be admitted or excluded \u201cis committed to the considerable and sound discretion of the trial court,\u201d and that the \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard of review is applicable to \u201cthe trial court\u2019s determination of relevancy.\u201d Maryland Rule 5-402, however, makes it clear that the trial court does not have discretion to admit irrelevant evidence.... [T]he \u201cde novo\u201d standard of review is applicable to the trial judge\u2019s conclusion of law that the evidence at issue is or is not \u201cof consequence to the determination of the action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">420 Md. at 724-25, 25 A.3d 144 (quoting <em>Ruffin Hotel Corp. of Md. v. Gasper, </em>418 Md. 594, 619-20, 17 A.3d 676 (2011)) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">Here, the message was relevant to connect appellant as the author of the e-mails to Lieutenant Jones and Detective Grapes, a fact of consequence to determining appellant\u2019s guilt with respect to: (1) the charge of false statement to Lieutenant Jones; and (2) the charge of obstruction of justice, based on appellant\u2019s e-mails to Detective Grapes attempting to broker a deal for himself in the case stemming from the April 10, 2011, incident at Growlers. The message, allegedly from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>marijuana supplier in Virginia, connects appellant with the emails sent to Lieutenant Jones from \u201cClayton Thomas III.\u201d E-mails sent in September 2011 informed Lieutenant Jones that Growlers \u201creceive[s] marijuana shipments at the bar from growers in VA to blend with their marijuana\u201d and offered to provide tracking numbers for the shipments. An e-mail to Lieutenant Jones in October 2011 asserted that \u201cZeppos was ripped off for a lot of his harvest, and will be buying from some growers out of Virginia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">The message also connects appellant with the September emails to Detective Grapes from \u201cMr. Essex,\u201d which also stated that Growlers \u201creceive[s] shipments of marijuana from a grow operation in Virginia\u201d and offered to provide Detective Grapes with information about the shipment in exchange for the charges against his \u201cfriend\u201d being dropped. Because the message contained content consistent with e-mails sent to Lieutenant Jones and Detective Grapes, it had a tendency to prove appellant\u2019s identity as the author of these emails. The circuit court did not err in determining that the message was relevant evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Bad Act Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Appellant next contends that the court erred in admitting the message because it was inadmissible bad acts evidence. He argues that the court erred in admitting the message because its probative value was substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">The State argues that this contention is not preserved for our review because appellant did not object below that the message constituted alleged bad acts evidence. We agree. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a) (\u201cOrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide [an] issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>In any event, even if preserved, we would find the argument to be without merit. Maryland Rule 5-404(b) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-5\">(b) Other Crimes, Wrongs, or Acts. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, common scheme or plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Pursuant to this Rule, \u201c[propensity evidence, or evidence suggesting that because the defendant is a person of criminal character it is more probable that he committed the crime for which he is on trial, is not admissible into evidence.\u201d <em>Wagner v. State, </em>213 Md.App. 419, 458, 74 A.3d 765 (2013) (quoting <em>Hurst v. State, </em>400 Md. 397, 407, 929 A.2d 157 (2007)). Evidence of other crimes may be admissible, however, if the evidence has \u201c \u2018special relevance, i.e. is substantially relevant to some contested issue in the case and is not offered simply to prove criminal character.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hurst, </em>400 Md. at 408, 929 A.2d 157).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">To determine the admissibility of other crimes evidence, the court must engage in a three-step analysis. <em>State v. Westpoint, </em>404 Md. 455, 489, 947 A.2d 519 (2008). First, the evidence must fall within one of the exceptions listed in Rule 5-404(b), or otherwise have special relevance to some contested issue in the case. <em>Id. </em>Second, after determining whether the contested evidence falls within an exception to the general bar on the use of other crimes evidence, the court must find that the accused\u2019s involvement in the other crimes is established by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Id. </em>Third, if that requirement is met, the trial court then must weigh the necessity for, and probative value of, the other crimes evidence against any undue prejudice likely to result from its admission. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">As indicated, the message here was relevant to appellant\u2019s identity as the author of the e-mails that were the subject of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>the charges against him. And we are not persuaded that any prejudice from the admission of the message outweighed its probative value.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accordingly, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the message.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Voice Identification</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Appellant\u2019s next contention is that the circuit court abused its discretion by allowing several witnesses to identify his voice. Specifically, Officer Hollis testified that he recognized appellant\u2019s voice on the taped 911 call reporting that Mr. Allen was growing and selling marijuana and that marijuana could be found in front of his home. Mr. Fair and Detective Grapes also testified that they recognized appellant\u2019s voice as the narrator in the videotape found in appellant\u2019s basement, which addressed how to cultivate marijuana plants. Appellant argues that this testimony was inadmissible \u201cbecause, prior to the in-court identifications, the State failed to lay an adequate foundation as to the reliability of the identifications.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">The State disagrees. It contends that the circuit court \u201cproperly exercised its discretion when it allowed witnesses familiar with [appellant\u2019s] voice to identify [his] voice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">As indicated, Md. Rule 5-901 (a) provides that \u201c[t]he requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\u201d With respect to voice identifications, the Rule provides, \u201c[b]y way of illustration only,\u201d the following examples of authentication: \u201cIdentification of a voice, whether heard firsthand or through mechanical or electronic transmission or recording, based upon the witness having heard the voice at any time under circumstances connecting it with the alleged speaker.\u201d Md. Rule 5-901(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>In <em>Hopkins v. State, 352 </em>Md. 146, 158, 721 A.2d 231 (1998), the Court of Appeals addressed, for the first time, the admissibility of in-court voice identification evidence. The Court stated that the issue generally was left to the discretion of the trial court. <em>Id. </em>In exercising this discretion, however, the court must assess whether the evidence is relevant and reliable. <em>Id. </em>at 159, 721 A.2d 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Appellant\u2019s sole contention here involves the reliability of the evidence. Reliability is assessed using the five-factor test set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 199, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972): \u201c(1) the ability of the witness to hear the assailant speak, (2) the witness\u2019s degree of attention, (3) the accuracy of any prior identifications the witness made, (4) the period of time between the incident and the identification, and (5) how certain the witness was in making the identification.\u201d <em>Hopkins, 352 </em>Md. at 160-61, 721 A.2d 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">In <em>Hopkins, </em>the circuit court permitted the State to obtain a voice exemplar from Hopkins, asking Hopkins to say something the person who robbed the victim said to her. <em>Id. </em>at 152-53, 721 A.2d 231. The victim identified Hopkins\u2019 voice as that of her assailant, who had made several demands of her during the course of the robbery. <em>Id. </em>at 150, 152, 721 A.2d 231. The Court of Appeals held that the identification \u201cwas sufficiently reliable,\u201d noting that, although nine months had passed between when the victim heard the perpetrator\u2019s voice and the trial, this period of time was not too lengthy. <em>Id. </em>at 166, 169, 721 A.2d 231. It further noted that the victim had heard the perpetrator \u201csay many things,\u201d he spoke close to where she stood, and the victim stated that the perpetrator was \u201carticulate,\u201d such that \u201c[h]er identification of [Hopkins\u2019] voice was based, at least in part, on this distinctive aspect of his speech.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164-65, 721 A.2d 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Here, Officer Hollis testified that, after listening to a recording of the 911 call, he recognized appellant\u2019s voice. Officer Hollis\u2019 ability to identify appellant\u2019s voice was based on his 15-minute conversation with appellant after he pulled over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>appellant\u2019s vehicle, and the five-to ten-minute conversation he had with appellant at appellant\u2019s residence later that evening. These conversations took place an hour before Officer Hollis\u2019s identification, and he expressed no hesitancy in his identification. That Officer Hollis did not comment on distinct characteristics about appellant\u2019s voice does not render the identification unreliable. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this identification into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Mr. Fair\u2019s identification of appellant\u2019s voice from the video discussing how to grow and transplant plants also was reliable. Mr. Fair had lived with appellant for a year, and during that time, appellant had invited him to spend time in his basement room and to smoke marijuana, and the two had engaged in extensive discussions regarding the return of Mr. Fair\u2019s security deposit. The record contained ample evidence that two interacted on numerous occasions, and the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Detective Grapes\u2019 testimony identifying the voice narrating the video as that of appellant similarly was reliable.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Detective Grapes testified that he spoke to appellant for twenty minutes on October 4, 2011, when he placed him under arrest, and he spoke to appellant for another twenty minutes at the police station. Moreover, the court stated that there was \u201csome type of an intonation\u201d in the video that the court \u201cthought was rather distinctive.\u201d Under these circumstances, the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this testimony identifying appellant\u2019s voice.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">Appellant argues that the circuit court \u201cabused its discretion in accepting Detective Heverly as an expert in digital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>forensic examinations.\u201d He contends that the State failed to establish that Detective Heverly had the requisite qualifications to give expert testimony. The State argues that the record contained \u201cample evidence\u201d of Detective Heverly\u2019s qualifications, and the court acted within its discretion in qualifying him as an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">\u201cGenerally, a trial court has \u2018wide latitude in deciding whether to qualify a witness as an expert or to admit or exclude particular expert testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shemondy v. State, </em>147 Md.App. 602, 611, 810 A.2d 36 (2002) (quoting <em>Massie v. State, </em>349 Md. 834, 850-51, 709 A.2d 1316 (1998)), <em>cert. denied, </em>373 Md. 408, 818 A.2d 1106 (2003). <em>Accord MEMC Elec. Materials, Inc. v. BP Solar Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>196 Md.App. 318, 355, 9 A.3d 508 (2010). The admissibility of expert testimony is within the discretion of the trial court, and therefore, the circuit court\u2019s decision to admit expert testimony \u201cwill seldom constitute a ground for reversal.\u201d <em>Bryant v. State, </em>393 Md. 196, 203, 900 A.2d 227 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Pursuant to Md. Rule 5-702, \u201c[e]xpert testimony may be admitted, in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if the court determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d The court must assess various factors in that regard, including: \u201c(1) whether the witness is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, (2) the appropriateness of the expert testimony on the particular subject, and (3) whether a sufficient factual basis exists to support the expert testimony.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Here, appellant\u2019s challenge is to Detective Heverly\u2019s qualifications. \u201c \u2018To qualify as an expert, one need only possess such skill, knowledge, or experience in that field or calling as to make it appear that [the] opinion or inference will probably aid the trier [of fact] in his search for the truth.\u2019 \u201d <em>Morton v. State, </em>200 Md.App. 529, 545, 28 A.3d 98 (2011) (quoting <em>Thanos v. State, </em>330 Md. 77, 95, 622 A.2d 727 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">Detective Heverly testified that he had completed more than 240 hours of training in computer forensics, as a result of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>which he had been \u201ccertified by the Department of Defense as a computer forensic examiner.\u201d He was a member of the \u201cNational White Collar Crime Center,\u201d the \u201cInternational Association of Computer Investigative Specialists,\u201d the Department of Defense \u201cCyber Investigative Training Academy,\u201d and he was a deputized member of the \u201cUnited States Secret Service, Washington Metro Electronic Crimes Task Force.\u201d In addition, he took a Windows Forensic Examinations course and a mobile forensic examination course for cell phones, GPS, and other mobile devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">Although Detective Heverly did not have post-graduate degrees in computer science, and he had not testified previously, the qualifications he did have supported the circuit court\u2019s decision to accept him as an expert witness. There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Motion for a New Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Appellant\u2019s final contention is that the circuit court erred in denying his <em>pro se </em>motion for a new trial. He asserts that the motion \u201cwas based in part upon [his] contention that he learned on March 9, 2012, two days after the verdict, that the State did not, as part of its discovery obligations, disclose an exculpatory e-mail message and no longer possessed the email message.\u201d He does not explain the context of the e-mail, or how the court prevented him \u201cfrom fully developing the issue at the June 18 hearing.\u201d Instead, he merely asserts that he \u201cpreserves for further review\u201d his contention that the circuit court abused its discretion in denying his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">Because appellant has not presented sufficient legal or factual argument for this Court to address this claim, we decline to consider it. <em>See Bradley v. Hazard Tech. Co., Inc., </em>340 Md. 202, 206, 665 A.2d 1050 (1995) (appellant bears burden of establishing error in the lower court); <em>Honeycutt v. Honeycutt, </em>150 Md.App. 604, 618, 822 A.2d 551, <em>cert. denied, </em>376 Md. 544, 831 A.2d 4 (2003) (where a party does not adequately brief an argument, appellate court need not address it); <em>Van </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number><em>Meter v.
