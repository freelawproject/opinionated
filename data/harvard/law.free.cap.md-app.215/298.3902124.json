FREDERICK SHARER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq8\">(Retired, Specially Assigned).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">In this appeal from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Worcester County we are asked to review the propriety of an arbitration award of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">Seeking review of the circuit court\u2019s affirmance of the arbitration award, including punitive damages, appellant, Kathy J. Gordon, poses a single question, which, as slightly rephrased, asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-11\">Did the circuit court properly confirm an arbitration award of punitive damages that included an express finding of willful and wanton conduct?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-14\">We shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-15\">FACTUAL and PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b323-16\">Because this appeal implicates only a question of law, we need not provide a detailed explication of the dealings between the parties that gave rise to this litigation. <em>Washington v. State, </em>190 Md.App. 168, 988 A.2d 61 (2010). Nonetheless, we shall provide an overview of those facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-17\">Gordon, one of several defendants below,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> began doing business with appellees, Tammie L. Lewis and William E. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Lewis, Jr., in 1990, initially as a tax preparer. Later, in 2004, she became their financial and investment advisor. Tammie Lewis is a stay-at-home mother with a high school education; William Lewis works as a construction foreman. It is not disputed that the Lewises were unsophisticated investors.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">During a prior employment, Tammie Lewis was exposed to asbestos. She developed mesothelioma, for which she received a settlement of $1,467,000. For the benefit of the Lewis children, Gordon established the Tammie L. Lewis Revocable Trust (\u201cthe Trust\u201d), funded in large part by the proceeds of the asbestos settlement. Tammie Lewis and William E. Lewis, Jr. served as trustees of the Trust, as did Gordon until her removal in 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">On September 26, 2008, the Lewises, individually and as Trustees, filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Worcester County against Gordon and the other defendants. The complaint alleged that as a result of defendants\u2019 fraud and misrepresentations, appellees invested several hundred thousand dollars in an unsecured, high-risk business venture owned and operated by Gordon\u2019s son. The investment consisted of high risk notes in Pomfret Plantation, LLC, a development property that was then in poor financial condition. Pomfret subsequently filed for bankruptcy, causing appellees to lose then-entire investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The complaint alleged that at all relevant times, Gordon was employed by the other defendants and acted as an agent, employee, and representative of each of those entities. The claims asserted by the Lewis parties were: fraudulent misrepresentation, constructive fraud, concealment or non-disclosure,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> negligent misrepresentation, and negligence. The complaint sought both compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Appellees alleged specifically that, relying on the advice of Gordon, they purchased two $100,000 notes investing in Pom-fret Plantation, which falsely stated that they were secured by 520 acres of land in Somerset County. Further, Tammie Lewis made a loan to Pomfret Plantation of $50,000, which Gordon personally guaranteed. On November 21, 2005, Tammie Lewis received a $100,000 promissory note from Pomfret Plantation, assuring payment by June 30, 2006. Appellees never received payment on the Pomfret notes, although Gordon made repeated promises that high interest was being earned on investments in Pomfret Plantation. After June 30, 2006, Gordon\u2019s promises of payment continued, but payment was not forthcoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">What appellees were never told by Gordon, and did not know, was that on May 22, 2006, Pomfret had filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition. Appellees filed timely claims in the bankruptcy case but, because their notes were unsecured, they were treated as unsecured creditors. After foreclosure on the Pomfret assets, there were no excess funds to satisfy appellees\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">In response to appellees\u2019 suit in the Circuit Court for Worcester County, Gordon and the other defendants with whom Gordon had a mutuality of interest, moved to dismiss and filed petitions to compel arbitration before the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellees op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>posed the petition to compel arbitration. Ultimately, on August 21, 2009, the circuit court granted the petition to compel arbitration and referred all claims to FINRA for arbitration. Proceedings pending in the circuit court were stayed, pending the completion of arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Appellees re-filed their statement of claim before FINRA, in which they asserted the same factual allegations as in the complaint previously filed: fraudulent misrepresentation, constructive fraud, concealment or non-disclosure, negligent misrepresentation, negligence and negligent supervision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Both compensatory and punitive damages were sought.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The essence of appellees\u2019 complaint before FINRA is found in Count III, concealment or non-disclosure:</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">77. As the claimants\u2019 financial advisors and investment advisors, the respondents had a duty to disclose material facts to the Lewises regarding their investments.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">78. The respondents failed to disclose material facts regarding the level of risk associated with investing in Pomfret Plantation and Pomfret Plantation\u2019s poor financial condition. Specifically, the respondents failed to disclose that the investments were unsecured, that there was a high level of risk associated with the investments, that there was a possibility that the Bills and the Note would not be repaid, and that Pomfret Plantation was struggling financially at the time the investments were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">79. The respondents failed to disclose these material facts with the intent to deceive the claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">80. In failing to disclose these material facts, the respondents acted with actual malice, evil motive, an intent to injure claimants, ill will, and an intent to deceive claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>81. The respondents knew or should have known that the claimants would not have invested in Pomfret Plantation if they had known of the existence of the undisclosed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">82. The claimants justifiably relied upon the respondents\u2019 misrepresentations because the respondents were their investment advisors and had established a relationship of trust and confidence with the claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">83. The claimants suffered economic and noneconomic damages as a direct result of respondents\u2019 fraudulent concealment of material facts. Under Maryland law, the claimants are entitled to recover noneconomic damages that result from the fraud. <em>Hoffman v. Stamper, </em>385 Md. 1, 38 [867 A.2d 276] (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">FINRA conducted a dispute resolution arbitration hearing from August 2-5, 2010. On August 9, 2010, the FINRA arbitration panel issued its award, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">\n<em>AWARD</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-9\">After considering the pleadings, the testimony and evidence presented at the hearing, the Panel has decided in full and final resolution of the issues submitted for determination as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-10\">Respondents Gordon, GFS, MISI, TMG and TMAS are found jointly and severally liable and shall pay to Claimants compensatory damages in the amount of $250,000.00, plus interest at the rate of 6% per annum from December 31, 2005 until the date of payment of the award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-11\">Respondents Gordon, GFS, MISI, TMG and TMAS are found jointly and severally liable and shall pay to Claimants punitive damages in the amount of $25,000.00. The majority of the Panel found that Respondent Gordon\u2019s actions were willful and wanton as she withheld information she knew about the investment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-12\">Respondents Gordon, GFS, MISI, TMG and TMAS are found jointly and severally liable and shall pay to Claimants the sum of $600.00 representing reimbursement of the non<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>refundable portion of the claim filing fee previously paid by Claimants to FINRA Dispute Resolution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">Any and all relief not specifically addressed herein, including Claimants\u2019 request for attorneys\u2019 fees, is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AF5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Neither Gordon nor the other responsible parties moved to modify or correct the arbitration award. However, on August 31, 2010, Gordon and Gordon Financial Services filed a petition to vacate the award in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County, which, as subsequently noted by the trial court,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was not the proper venue. Gordon subsequently filed for bankruptcy, and on September 9, 2010, filed a suggestion of bankruptcy in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County, resulting in a stay of all proceedings, pursuant to Section 362 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362. On March 25, 2011, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland issued an order lifting the automatic stay solely to permit appellees to go forward with proceedings \u201cto confirm the arbitration award in their favor\u201d against Gordon, as well as any appeals therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Appellees filed a petition to confirm the arbitration award and enter judgment against Gordon on March 29, 2011, in the Circuit Court for Worcester County, the proper venue.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Gordon timely responded by opposing confirmation of the award. They also moved to vacate the arbitration award. Appellees maintained that the arbitration award should be entered pursuant to Md.Code, Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings (\u201cCJP\u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>\u00a7 3-227(b) (2006 RepLVol.) which provides: \u201cThe court shall confirm the award, unless the other party has filed an application to vacate, modify, or correct the award.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The court conducted a dispositive hearing on the respective motions, the primary focus being Gordon\u2019s motion to vacate the punitive damages awarded by the FINRA arbitration panel. Gordon argued that the FINRA arbitration panel exceeded its authority in awarding punitive damages. Gordon contended before the circuit court, as she does now, that the withholding of information does not provide grounds for an award of punitive damages. Her counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUU\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Now, as I indicated a moment ago, sir, there were six different counts that the \u2014 that were in front of the arbiters. Several of them were counts that could support an award of punitive damages, fraudulent \u2014 there was fraud that could, but there were other counts, constructive misrepresentation, concealment, negligent misrepresentation, and negligence, that really cannot support a finding of punitive damages. And, indeed, in two of the counts, negligent misrepresentation and negligence, punitive damages were not even pled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">Now, what we have is an award.... [T]his case arose from the investment by the Plaintiffs, by the Lewises, in a failed real estate venture. They invested money in 2005 and 2006. They invested a total of $250,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">When that money was lost, they filed suit, that later went into arbitration, against people who were involved in the investment, but also against Ms. Gordon, who was their investment adviser. And some of the counts were negligence counts, that she didn\u2019t give them good advice, and then there was a count that was a fraud count. And the fraud count, of course, is that there is an intentional misrepresentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">The arbiters\u2019 award does not say what count they\u2019re deciding on. Rather, they granted an award of $250,000, which was the amount of the original investment. They denied the further claims that were made for noneconomic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>damages. And, on a two-to-one vote, they entered an award of $25,000 of punitive damages because they said that Ms. Gordon withheld information that she knew about the investment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">And that is the particular language that this argument, that this question, turns upon. Because withholding \u2014 to withhold information is not a basis under Maryland law for a punitive \u2014 for a fraud finding or for punitive damages to be awarded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">(Emphasis added). Gordon asserted that the punitive damage award exceeded the authority of the arbiters \u201cbased on the clear language of the arbiters\u2019 award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">In response, appellees argued that \u201cconcealment of a material fact when there is a duty to disclose is ... a sister tort to fraud by affirmative misrepresentation[,]\u201d so the FINRA award was appropriate. Appellees also argued that the award should be confirmed on the basis of <em>respondeat superior, </em>given that the punitive damages award against GFS had already been confirmed. Counsel maintained that GFS was simply the \u201ccorporate veil\u201d for Gordon, pointing out, among other facts, that they were represented by the same counsel throughout arbitration. The court, not willing to imply any facts beyond those stated in the award, and making clear that it did not \u201chave any transcript of the arbitration in front of [it],\u201d rejected appellees\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">After considering the arguments of both parties, and the FINRA award, the court issued the following ruling from the bench:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-9\">Well, the Court has before it Ms. Gordon\u2019s petition, Motion to Vacate the Arbiters\u2019 Award as to the $25,000 which was entered against her for punitive damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-10\">The only evidence the Court has as to the arbitration proceeding was the award itself, which the Court has taken judicial notice of. And that makes clear that one of the claims that was lodged against Ms. Gordon was a claim of fraud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>The arbiters say that, under the award, that Ms. Gordon and others were found jointly and severally liable and shall pay to claimants punitive damages in the amount of $25,000. The majority of the panel found that Respondent Gordon\u2019s actions were willful and wanton and she withheld information she knew about the investment. Willful, of course, is another way of saying deliberate, intentional withholding of information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">The basis upon which the Court can vacate an arbitrator\u2019s award, or part of an arbitrator\u2019s award, is set forth in the Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Article 3-224(b). And the one upon which Ms. Gordon is relying is (b)(3), as I understand it, which says that the arbitrators exceeded their powers. Ms. Gordon has the burden of proof with respect to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">And the argument is that the \u2014 the award as to punitive damages was neither factually, nor legally, correct, without any factual or legal basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">The Court doesn\u2019t know the factual basis of the arbitrators\u2019 award inasmuch as there\u2019s no transcript of the arbitration presented. The Court knows that, at least in summarizing their award for punitive damages, they indicated that they found that Ms. Gordon\u2019s actions were willful in withholding information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\">The Court doesn\u2019t find that that rises to the level of proof, even by a preponderance of the evidence, that the arbitrators exceeded their powers, that there\u2019s \u2014 the evidence upon which the arbitrators relied is simply not before the Court. And the simple summary of the award is an insufficient basis, in the Court\u2019s judgment, to find that the arbitrators exceeded their powers with respect to the award of punitive damages against Ms. Gordon in the amount of $25,000. The motion or petition to vacate the punitive damages portion of the award is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">The court granted the petition to confirm and entered judgment against Gordon. The court issued written rulings in an Order dated July 1, 2011. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">As the trial court correctly recognized, this matter is governed by the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), codified in Md.Code (2006 Rep. Vol.) (\u201cCJP\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 3-201 <em>et seq. </em>The Act, which contemplates an extremely limited role for courts in reviewing an arbitration award, sets forth clear procedures and standards designed to encourage parties to seek \u201can informal, expeditious, and inexpensive alternative to conventional litigation.\u201d <em>Birkey Design Group, Inc. v. Egle Nursing Home, Inc., </em>113 Md.App. 261, 265, 687 A.2d 256 (1997). The Act provides that a court may not vacate an award, or refuse to confirm an award, \u201con the ground that a court of law or equity could not or would not grant the same relief.\u201d CJP \u00a7 3-224(c). Rather, the Act sets forth five grounds upon which a \u201ccourt shall vacate\u201d an arbitration award:</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">(1) if the \u201caward was procured by corruption, fraud, or other undue means;\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">(2) if there was \u201cpartiality by an arbitrator appointed as a neutral, corruption in any arbitrator, or misconduct prejudicing the rights of any party;\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">(3) if the \u201carbitrators exceeded their powers;\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">(4) if the arbitrators committed certain procedural errors in the conduct of the hearing, \u201cas to prejudice substantially the rights of a party;\u201d or</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">(5) if there was no agreement to arbitrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">CJP \u00a7 3-224(b). As we shall discuss, our focus in this appeal is on CJP \u00a7 3 \u2014 224(b)(3)\u2014whether the arbitrators exceeded their powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">\u201cJudicial review of an arbitrator\u2019s decision is extremely limited, and a party seeking to set it aside has a heavy burden.\u201d <em>Letke Sec. Contractors, Inc. v. United States Sur. Co., </em>191 Md.App. 462, 472, 991 A.2d 1306 (2010). \u201cIn fact, the standard of review of arbitral awards \u2018is among the narrowest known to the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Litvak Packing Co. v. United Food &amp; Commercial Workers, Local Union No. 7, </em>886 F.2d 275, 276 (10th Cir.1989)). <em>See Southern Maryland Hosp. Ctr. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number><em>v. Edward M. Crough, Inc., </em>48 Md.App. 401, 407, 427 A.2d 1051 (1981) (stating that \u201cthe courts\u2019 function in confirming or vacating a commercial award is \u2018severely limited.\u2019 \u201d). The role of a court is to \u201cdetermine only whether the arbitrator did his job \u2014 not whether he did it well, correctly, or reasonably[.]\u201d <em>Mountaineer Gas Co. v. Oil, Chem. &amp; Atomic Workers Int\u2019l Union, </em>76 F.3d 606, 608 (4th Cir.1996). Conclusions of an arbitrator \u201care reviewed using a deferential standard on the far side of the spectrum away from a usual, expansive <em>de novo </em>standard.\u201d <em>Mandl v. Bailey, </em>159 Md.App. 64, 92, 858 A.2d 508 (2004). Appellate discipline mandates that we give deference to the decision of the arbitrator, and this Court does not speculate about the arbitrator\u2019s reasons for making an award. Rather, it is required that we \u201cassume the arbitrator acted properly.\u201d <em>Birkey Design Group, </em>113 Md.App. at 267, 687 A.2d 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">As recently made plain by the Court of Appeals, reviewing courts defer to the arbitrator\u2019s findings of fact and applications of law. \u201c \u2018[M]ere errors of law and fact [do] not ordinarily furnish grounds for a court to vacate or refuse enforcement of an arbitration award.\u2019 \u201d <em>Downey v. Sharp, </em>428 Md. 249, 266, 51 A.3d 573 (2012), (quoting <em>Board of Education v. Prince George\u2019s Co. Educators\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>309 Md. 85, 98-99, 522 A.2d 931 (1987)). \u201cWe will not vacate an arbitration award simply because the court would not have made the same award as the arbitrator, or for mere legal error.\u201d <em>Letke, </em>191 Md.App. at 472-73, 991 A.2d 1306. As the Court held in <em>Downey, </em>manifest disregard of the law does not fall within one of the statutory grounds for which a court may vacate an arbitrator\u2019s award. 428 Md. at 249, 51 A.3d 573.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Appellant posits that the arbitration panel exceeded its powers by issuing an award of punitive damages because the award was in \u201cmanifest disregard of the law.\u201d She contends that, because the award provides only that Gordon\u2019s action\u2019s were \u201cwillful and wanton as she withheld information she knew about the investment,\u201d but provides no further findings of fact and does not state which counts upon which the award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>is based, the court committed error by confirming it. Appellant argues further that the withholding of information by a financial professional with a fiduciary duty to her clients may be the basis for an award of compensatory damages, but not punitive damages. In her reply brief she makes the argument that: \u201cAn award of punitive damages in a cause of action for fraud must <em>always </em>be supported by clear and convincing evidence of an assertion of a known, material falsehood \u2014 not the mere withholding of. information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Gordon maintains that constructive fraud cannot support a claim for punitive damages, and \u201cconcealment or non-disclosure, as plead in Count III of the Statement of Claim, is not fraud at all.\u201d She thus concludes that, because limitation of punitive damages to cases involving actual malice that is clearly and convincingly proven is a well-defined public policy, the award of damages for just \u201cwillful and wanton\u201d actions is in violation of such policy, so the arbiters\u2019 award was, on its face, based on an impermissible standard and must be reversed. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">\u201cBefore an award can be vacated on the ground that an arbitrator exceeded his authority, the record must objectively disclose that the arbitrator exceeded that authority in some respect.\u201d <em>Birkey Design Group, </em>113 Md.App. at 266-67, 687 A.2d 256. \u201cIf, on its face, the award represents a plausible interpretation of the contract, judicial inquiry ceases and the award must be enforced.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Graceman v. Goldstein, </em>93 Md.App. 658, 675, 613 A.2d 1049 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>329 Md. 336, 619 A.2d 546 (1993). The award must be confirmed even if the basis for the arbitrator\u2019s award is ambiguous. <em>Id. </em>Where an arbitration panel is bound to settle all disputes, it does not exceed its powers by issuing an award of punitive damages. <em>See, Raytheon Co. v. Automated Business Sys., Inc., </em>882 F.2d 6,10 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The Act requires that arbitrators\u2019 decisions be in writing and signed by the arbitrators who joined in the award, CJP \u00a7 3-219(a); however, the Act does not require that arbitrators issue opinions or memoranda containing full explanations for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>their decisions. <em>Birkey Design Group, </em>113 Md.App. at 267, 687 A.2d 256 (\u201cThe arbitrator was not obligated to explain his award.\u201d). In confirming the decision of the arbitrators, the court relied solely upon the award itself as evidence, noting that appellant failed to provide the court with a transcript of the FINRA proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Appellant argued before the circuit court that there was no factual or legal basis for the punitive damages award, but the court, noting that Gordon bore the burden of proof, observed: \u201cwillful, of course, is another way of saying deliberate, intentional withholding of information.\u201d This Court has recognized that \u201cwillful and wanton\u201d is another manner of describing outrageous behavior conducted with actual intent or actual malice. <em>Mech v. Hearst Corp., </em>64 Md.App. 422, 440, 496 A.2d 1099 (1985) (citing <em>Medina v. Meilhammer, </em>62 Md.App. 239, 241, 489 A.2d 35 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">In three of their counts, appellees claimed that Gordon had fraudulently violated her relationship with them, that all of her actions were taken with the intent to deceive, and amounted to actual malice, evil motive, and an intent to injure. Punitive damages may be awarded for fraudulent actions. <em>Ellerin v. Fairfax Savings, F.S.B., </em>337 Md. 216, 232, 652 A.2d 1117 (1995). Appellees claimed that Gordon failed to disclose material facts that she had a duty to disclose. A person can be liable for fraud either for knowingly making a false statement of material fact, or for concealing material facts when that person has a duty to disclose. <em>Hoffman v. Stamper, </em>385 Md. 1, 28 n. 12, 867 A.2d 276 (2005) (\u201cIt has long been clear that \u2018[f]raud may consist in a suppression of the truth as well as in the assertion of a falsehood.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Schnader v. Brooks, </em>150 Md. 52, 57, 132 A. 381 (1926)). The Court of Appeals described the elements of an action based on fraudulent concealment of material facts in <em>Green v. H &amp; R Block, Inc., </em>355 Md. 488, 525, 735 A.2d 1039 (1999):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">(1) the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff to disclose a material fact; (2) the defendant failed to disclose that fact; (3) the defendant intended to defraud or deceive the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>tiff; (4) the plaintiff took action in justifiable reliance on the concealment; and (5) the plaintiff suffered damages as a result of the defendant\u2019s concealment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-5\"><em>See also Levin v. Singer, </em>227 Md. 47, 64, 175 A.2d 423 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Before the circuit court, counsel for appellant complained that \u201c[t]he arbiters\u2019 award does not say what count they\u2019re deciding on.\u201d We reiterate that an arbitrator need not explain the reasoning underlying an award. Moreover, appellant did not provide the trial court with a transcript of the arbitration proceeding. That failure cannot support an attempt to convert the lack of detail to her advantage. <em>Wicomico County Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Board of Educ., </em>59 Md.App. 564, 567, 477 A.2d 279 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Moreover, a party to an arbitration who opposes confirmation on the grounds of lack of clarity, has the option to seek a full explanation of the award pursuant to CJP \u00a7 3-222(c) (\u201cThe arbitrators may modify or correct an award ... for the purpose of clarity.\u201d). Appellant did not seek modification or clarification from the arbitration panel. In <em>Birkey Design Group, </em>we ruled that a party may not benefit from its decision not to seek clarification through the Act by arguing on appeal that the arbitrator\u2019s award is unclear. 113 Md.App. at 271, 687 A.2d 256 (\u201cParty waives the right to argue that an arbitrator\u2019s award is unclear if a party fails to file a petition for clarification.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">As appellant\u2019s counsel acknowledged before the circuit court, several of the allegations against Gordon \u201cwere counts that could support an award of punitive damages.\u201d Fraudulent conduct may give rise to an award of punitive damages, and FINRA was careful to note in its award that Gordon had engaged in \u201cwillful and wanton\u201d conduct by withholding relevant information she knew about the investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">On this record, we find nothing to indicate that the arbitrators exceeded their powers by awarding punitive damages. We are further satisfied that, after applying the standards set forth in the Act, the court properly confirmed FINRA\u2019s award of punitive damage award. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WORCESTER COUNTY AFFIRMED;</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">COSTS ASSESSED TO APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-18\">.

In Count 3, appellees asserted that as their financial and investment advisor, defendants had a duty to disclose several material facts to the Lewises regarding their investments, which they failed to do. \"Defendants failed to disclose these facts with the intent to deceive,\" and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>failing to disclose these material facts, \"defendants acted with actual malice, evil motive, an intent to injure plaintiffs, ill will and an intent to deceive plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b325-8\">. Prior to filing suit, appellees, in November 2007, filed a complaint with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d), resulting in Gordon\u2019s being disciplined. Gordon also entered into a consent order with the Maryland Securities Commissioner on December 12, 2008, in which she agreed, <em>inter alia, </em>to cease and desist from selling unregistered securities or offering investment advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">FINRA is an independent, non-governmental, securities industry \"watchdog.\u201d It is a not-for-profit organization authorized by Congress to protect investors by assuring that the securities industry operates fairly and honestly.

The court initially granted this motion on April 11, 2011, but, during the dispositive hearing on June 29, 2011, vacated the order on the basis that it had been prematurely entered.
