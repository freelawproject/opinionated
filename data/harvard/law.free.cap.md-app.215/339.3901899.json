The court sentenced appellant to concurrent 20 year terms for each count, with all but five years suspended, followed by five years of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">On October 26, 2011, appellant filed a Petition for Writ of Error Coram Nobis, alleging that the convictions subjected him to a potentially greater sentence in pending federal court charges. The circuit court granted appellant\u2019s petition with respect to the robbery conviction and his handgun conviction in Case Number 97-1477B. It denied, however, his petition with respect to the handgun conviction in Case Number 97-1468B.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">On appeal from the denial of his petition with respect to Case Number 97-1468B, appellant presents three questions for our review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which we have reordered, reworded, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>consolidated into the following questions<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>:</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">1. Did the circuit court err in finding that appellant waived his right to coram nobis relief?</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">2. Did the circuit court err in denying appellant\u2019s petition for writ of error coram nobis because his guilty plea was involuntary?</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">For the reasons set forth below, we answer both questions in the affirmative, and therefore, we shall reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">At the March 10, 1998, plea hearing, appellant and his co-defendant, Jeffery McDowney, pleaded guilty to several charges involving robberies of restaurants in Prince George\u2019s County. Mr. McDowney entered his pleas prior to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">With respect to Case Number 97-1468,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the conviction at issue here, which involved a robbery of a Little Caesar\u2019s Pizza restaurant, the prosecutor read the following facts that would have been adduced at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-11\">[T]he evidence would show that on June 15th, 1997 approximately 2055 hours Mr. McDowney and co-defendant Mr. Graves entered Little Caesar\u2019s Pizza restaurant on Silver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Hill Road, Suitland, Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. Mr. McDowney threatened to smack one of the employees in the face with a gun if she didn\u2019t shut up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">The witness ran to the back of the establishment to call 911. The defendant Mr. McDowney displayed the handgun, and demanded funds from a Tekia Govan. The co-worker Mr. Reid was told to open the register, and he complied. And Mr. McDowney and Mr. Graves fled with fifty-five dollars in U.S. currency from the restaurant located at the aforesaid address[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">In that case the State would call Vincent Reid and co-employee Tekia Govan, Alphonso Hayes, and Terrell Jones of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">After the prosecutor read the facts underlying the co-defendant\u2019s and appellant\u2019s additional pleas, which are not at issue here, the court accepted Mr. McDowney\u2019s pleas and sentenced him.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Immediately thereafter, the court began its plea colloquy with appellant. The court asked appellant: \u201cNow, you were here when [the prosecutor] was reading off all the facts of those different individual robberies. Did you hear what he said?\u201d Appellant responded in the affirmative. Appellant also agreed that he had \u201ctalked this matter over\u201d with his attorney, that his attorney had answered all his questions about the case, that he had \u201cread over the sheet that talks about your rights that [he] would have had, had [he] gone to trial,\u201d and that he understood those rights and he was giving them up.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">Appellant\u2019s attorney then informed the court that appellant would</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-10\">enter pleas in case 97-1468B, Count 2, the handgun charge, 20 years, suspend all but 5. As to case 97-1477B, Count number 2, 20 years, suspend all but 5, another handgun charge. And as to case 97-1476B, 20 years suspend all but 5. Five years probation, and all the pleas are to run concurrently.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">Appellant acknowledged that he understood the agreement he was making, that he was making the plea because he \u201creally [was] guilty of the[] charges,\u201d and that no one made any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>promises or forced him to enter his plea. The court determined that there was \u201ca factual basis on which to accept the plea, and the plea [was] freely, voluntarily, understanding^ made.\u201d It then accepted the plea and sentenced appellant to concurrent 20 year terms for each count, with all but five years suspended, followed by five years of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">On October 26, 2011, appellant filed a Petition for Writ of Error Coram Nobis, requesting that the court vacate his convictions on all three counts. He argued that the pleas must be vacated for three reasons: (1) \u201cin the plea colloquy, there [wa]s no mention of the elements of the charges, no description of the nature of the charges,\u201d and \u201cno mention that [appellant] and his attorney discussed the nature or elements of the charges\u201d; (2) \u201cthe court failed to examine [him] on the record that he understood his rights under <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969), and as required under Maryland Rule 4-242(c)(1);\u201d and (3) the statements of facts proffered by the State was insufficient as a matter of law to find him guilty of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Appellant filed a declaration asserting that, before he entered his pleas, his attorney did not review with him the elements of the offenses and did not explain his appellate rights. He stated that he did not understand \u201cthat it was the responsibility of the judge and my attorney to make sure I understood these things.\u201d He contended that, had his attorney \u201cadvised [him] that there was not a sufficient factual basis to prove the elements of the charged crimes, [he] would not have accepted the plea offer and pleaded guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Appellant stated that he was facing significant collateral consequences as a result of his conviction, asserting that he was scheduled to go to trial the next week in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland on robbery charges. He asserted that, if his state convictions were \u201cnot vacated, they will dramatically increase his federal sentence.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>On December 7, 2011, the State filed its Response in Opposition to Writ of Error Coram Nobis. It argued that coram nobis relief was unavailable to appellant because he waived his right to seek such relief by failing to file an application for leave to appeal the judgments of conviction. On the merits, the State asserted: \u201c[T]he record more than adequately shows that, based on the totality of the circumstances, [appellant\u2019s] plea was entered voluntarily and intelligently, with an understanding of his trial rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">On January 6, 2012, the court held a hearing on appellant\u2019s petition. At the outset of the hearing, the State conceded that coram nobis relief was warranted for two of the convictions. With respect to Case Number 97-1476B, the prosecutor agreed that the record did not indicate the charge to which appellant was pleading. With respect to Case Number 97-1477B, the prosecutor acknowledged that appellant pled guilty to a handgun charge, but the facts in the record indicated that appellant had used a knife in the robbery associated with that charge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Based on these admitted deficiencies, the court granted appellant\u2019s petition relating to those convictions, Case Numbers 97-1476B and 97-1477B, vacating the convictions and ordering a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">With respect to Case Number 97-1468B, appellant\u2019s counsel argued that there was \u201cnothing on the record to reflect the specific offense\u201d to which appellant pleaded guilty, and there was nothing to indicate that appellant understood the nature of the offense, which was described at the hearing only as a handgun charge. Counsel also asserted that the factual basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>offered by the State in support of the charge was inadequate, as the facts \u201cmerely reflected] that [he] was present\u201d during the robbery and \u201calmost all the facts concern what the co-defendant Mr. McDowney did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">The State responded: \u201c[U]nfortunately this is a case where trial counsel only put on the record that [appellant] was pleading to the handgun charge,\u201d and \u201cthe State is not in a good position to argue that on the record [appellant] was advised of the nature and elements of the offenses as required\u201d under Maryland law. The State argued, however, that it was \u201changing [its] hat on\u201d the argument that appellant waived his right to coram nobis relief by not filing an application for leave to appeal from his guilty plea. Regarding the sufficiency of the statement of facts, the State argued that appellant\u2019s act of \u201centering the establishment while the co-defendant committed the crime and then fleeing with the co-defendant and the money is sufficient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Appellant\u2019s trial counsel testified at the coram nobis hearing that, prior to the guilty plea on March 10, 1998, he discussed with appellant the elements of the crime of use of a handgun during the commission of a crime of violence. He stated that, after the plea was entered, appellant did not indicate that he wanted to appeal the plea, as \u201c[h]e seemed very happy with the terms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the court denied appellant\u2019s petition for coram nobis relief with respect to Case Number 97-1468B for the following reasons: (1) the trial court \u201cexplicitly determined] that there was a factual basis on which to accept the plea\u201d; (2) the plea was \u201cfreely, voluntarily, and understandingly made\u201d; and (3) appellant waived his right to pursue coram nobis relief because he did not file an application for leave to appeal his convictions within thirty days of his sentence. With respect to the references by appellant\u2019s attorney and the court to Case Number 97-1468B as the \u201chandgun\u201d charge or use of a handgun charge, the court found that, although appellant\u2019s claim was waived, this reference was adequate, noting: \u201cThere is reference to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>handgun____to use of a handgun. As I indicated, the only-handgun charge is use of a handgun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">The writ of coram nobis is a collateral challenge to a criminal conviction, an \u201c \u2018extraordinary remedy\u2019 \u201d that is justified \u201c \u2018only under circumstances compelling such action to achieve justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Skok v. State, </em>361 Md. 52, 72, 760 A.2d 647 (2000) (quoting <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>346 U.S. 502, 74 S.Ct. 247, 98 L.Ed. 248 (1954)). It is a \u201cremedy for a convicted person who is not incarcerated and not on parole or probation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78, 760 A.2d 647. To be eligible for coram nobis relief, several requirements must be met: (1) \u201cthe grounds for challenging the criminal conviction must be of a constitutional, jurisdictional or fundamental character,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 78, 760 A.2d 647; (2) the \u201ccoram nobis petitioner must be suffering or facing significant collateral consequences from the conviction,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 79, 760 A.2d 647; (3) the claim for which coram nobis relief is sought cannot be waived or finally litigated, <em>id.; </em>and (4) the petitioner must show prejudice. <em>Miller v. State, </em>196 Md.App. 658, 681, 11 A.3d 340 (2010), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>423 Md. 474, 32 A.3d 1 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">In the present case, appellant raises a constitutional challenge to his guilty plea, which he contends entitles him to coram nobis relief. Specifically, he argues that his plea was involuntary for three reasons: (1) \u201cthe convicting court failed to apprise him of the nature of the charges and the elements of the offenses to which he was pleading guilty\u201d; (2) \u201cthe court failed to apprise him of his right to a jury trial and the corollary rights associated with such trial\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe facts presented to the court were insufficient to establish his guilt of the charged offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">The State argues that the circuit court properly denied the petition for coram nobis. Initially, it contends that the court properly found that appellant waived his right to coram nobis \u201cby not filing an application for leave to appeal the entry of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>plea and sentence and by not pursuing post conviction relief.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On the merits, the State argues that appellant failed to meet his burden of establishing that he was entitled to coram nobis relief because: (1) he \u201cfailed to establish that he was suffering significant collateral consequences from his conviction\u201d; and (2) he \u201cfailed to establish a defect in his plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">We begin with the issue of waiver. The State argues that the circuit court properly found that appellant waived his right to challenge his conviction because he failed to file an application for leave to appeal his guilty plea. Appellant contends that he did not waive his right to coram nobis relief, noting that, subsequent to the hearing in this case, the General Assembly enacted legislation providing that a failure to seek an appeal does not waive the right to seek coram nobis relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">At the time of the hearing in this case, <em>Holmes v. State, </em>401 Md. 429, 445-46, 932 A.2d 698 (2007), was the prevailing law on the issue of waiver. In that case, the Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\">[I]f an individual who pleads guilty, having been informed of his right to file an application for leave to appeal from his conviction and sentence, does not file such an application for leave to appeal, a rebuttable presumption arises that he has waived the right to challenge his conviction in a subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>corara nobis proceeding, and defendant\u2019s right to challenge his conviction and sentence through a petition for writ of coram nobis was waived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">In an apparent reaction to <em>Holmes, </em>the Maryland General Assembly enacted Maryland Code (2013 Supp.) \u00a7 8-401 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCP\u201d), which provides as follows: \u201cThe failure to seek an appeal in a criminal case may not be construed as a waiver of the right to file a petition for writ of error coram nobis.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The State contends, however, that this statute does not apply to this case because it went into effect October 1, 2012, after the circuit court issued its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Whether \u201ca statute operates retrospectively, or prospectively only, ordinarily is one of legislative intent.\u201d <em>Langston v. Riffe, </em>359 Md. 396, 406, 754 A.2d 389 (2000) (quoting <em>Spielman v. State, </em>298 Md. 602, 607, 471 A.2d 730 (1984)). In determining this intent, \u201c[statutes are presumed to operate prospectively; consequently, absent manifest legislative intent to the contrary, statutes may not be given retrospective or retroactive application.\u201d <em>Gregg v. State, </em>409 Md. 698, 714, 976 A.2d 999 (2009). The Court of Appeals has explained, however, that there are \u201cexceptions to the presumption that legislation is to be applied prospectively.\u201d <em>Gregg, </em>409 Md. at 714, 976 A.2d 999. For example, \u201c \u2018a statute effecting a change in procedure only, and not in substantive rights, ordinarily applies to all actions whether accrued, pending or future, unless a contrary intention is expressed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 714-15, 976 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>999 (quoting <em>Mason v. State, </em>309 Md. 215, 219-20, 522 A.2d 1344 (1987)). Another exception to the general principal that statutes apply prospectively are \u201c[l]egislative enactments that have remedial effect and do not impair vested rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 715, 976 A.2d 999. Remedial statutes generally are those that \u201c \u2018provide a remedy or improve or facilitate remedies already existing for the enforcement of rights and the redress of injuries.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Langston, </em>359 Md. at 408, 754 A.2d 389).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">In <em>Gregg, </em>409 Md. at 715, 976 A.2d 999, the Court of Appeals addressed whether an amendment to CP \u00a7 8-201, which permits the filing of a petition for post-conviction DNA testing, should be given retrospective effect. <em>Id. </em>The Court noted that the amendment \u201cprescribes the standard by which the court assesses a petitioner\u2019s entitlement to post[-]conviction DNA testing and it improves the existing remedy by making it easier for qualifying petitioners to establish entitlement to such testing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, it held that the statute was \u201cprocedural in nature\u201d and \u201calso a remedial statute, as its purpose is to provide a remedy for persons convicted of serious crimes of which they are actually innocent.\u201d <em>Id.Accord State v. Matthews, </em>415 Md. 286, 296, 999 A.2d 1050 (2010) (CP \u00a7 8-301, creating a Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence, is both procedural in nature and remedial and may be applied retroactively); <em>Thompson v. State, </em>411 Md. 664, 680, 985 A.2d 32 (2009) (right to appeal in CP \u00a7 8-201(k)(6) was remedial in nature because it allowed defendants \u201cto reach the substantive issue of guilt by lowering the bar to obtaining a new trial and according greater access to this Court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Similarly, here, CP \u00a7 8-401 is both procedural and remedial in nature. As indicated, it appears to have been a \u201cremedy\u201d to the holding in <em>Holmes, </em>and it removes a procedural impediment to a coram nobis claim of error. <em>See Langston, </em>359 Md. at 419, 754 A.2d 389 (legislation that alters only \u201cthe procedural machinery involved in the enforcement\u201d of substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>rights will operate retroactively).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, we hold that CP \u00a7 8-401 operates retroactively and appellant did not waive his right to seek coram nobis relief by faffing to challenge his guilty plea in an application for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The State argues, however, that \u201ceven if Section 8-401 applied retroactively to [appellant\u2019s] case, the waiver ruling of the coram nobis court in this case should still prevail.\u201d Specifically, it contends that CP \u00a7 8-401 \u201capplies only to situations where a finding of waiver was founded solely on a defendant\u2019s failure to file a direct appeal,\u201d and here, appellant also failed to move to withdraw his plea or seek relief pursuant to the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act during the time he was incarcerated. In support of this argument, the State cites to the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Skok, </em>361 Md. at 79, 760 A.2d 647, for the proposition that \u201c[b]asic principles of waiver are applicable to issues raised in coram nobis proceedings,\u201d such that the same body of law governing waiver in the Maryland Post Conviction Procedure Act context is applicable in coram nobis proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The State raises this issue for the first time on appeal; it failed to raise this argument before the circuit court. Accordingly, it is not properly before us. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a) (An appellate court ordinarily will not decide an issue \u201cunless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Collateral Consequences</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The State next contends that the circuit court properly denied appellant coram nobis relief because he \u201cfailed to establish that he was suffering significant collateral consequences from his conviction.\u201d Specifically, it argues that the collateral consequence alleged by appellant was the prospect of enhanced sentencing on his federal charges, but \u201cat the time [his] petition was filed, heard, and decided by the circuit court, [appellant] had not been tried on the federal criminal charges.\u201d Accordingly, it asserts, at the time appellant filed his petition, \u201cthe significant collateral consequences he alleged below were speculative if not illusory.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">As this Court recently explained, \u201cin order to be entitled to <em>coram nobis </em>relief, the petitioner must prove that he or she is \u2018suffering or facing significant collateral consequences from the conviction\u2019 from which he seeks relief.\u201d <em>Gross v. State, </em>186 Md.App. 320, 332, 973 A.2d 895, <em>cert. denied, </em>410 Md. 560, 979 A.2d 708 (2009). The collateral consequences must be actual, not merely theoretical. <em>See Parker v. State, </em>160 Md.App. 672, 687-89, 866 A.2d 885 (2005) (remanding case to circuit court to determine if convictions affected length of subsequent federal sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">If the State wants to raise the lack of proof of collateral consequences as a defense to a coram nobis petition, however, it must raise this issue in the circuit court. In <em>Gross, </em>186 Md.App. at 332-33, 973 A.2d 895, we confronted a similar scenario, where Mr. Gross contended that the state conviction subjected him to a longer federal sentence, and the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>argued that Mr. Gross failed to prove this, merely alleging such consequences in his brief, as opposed to proving them at the hearing. We held that, although \u201cthe State\u2019s argument might well have been grounds for an affirmance,\u201d it was not properly before us because it was neither raised nor decided below. <em>Id. </em>at 333, 973 A.2d 895. We noted that, \u201cif the issue had been raised in the circuit court there is a good chance that the <em>coram nobis </em>[c]ourt would have granted Gross permission to reopen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the issue was not raised, we held that the State\u2019s argument was waived for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Similarly, here, the State failed to raise below its present contention regarding appellant\u2019s failure to establish collateral consequences of his conviction. Thus, as in <em>Gross, </em>we decline to address this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Alleged Defects in Appellant\u2019s Plea</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">At this point, we turn to the merits of appellant\u2019s claim. As indicated, to be eligible for coram nobis relief, a petitioner must raise a ground \u201cof a constitutional, jurisdictional or fundamental character.\u201d <em>Skok, </em>361 Md. at 78, 760 A.2d 647. Appellant\u2019s challenge, that his guilty plea was involuntary, clearly is an issue that may be raised in a coram nobis petition. <em>Id. </em>at 80-81, 760 A.2d 647 (\u201c[T]he scope of a coram nobis proceeding encompasses issues concerning the voluntariness of a guilty or nolo contendere plea, and whether the record shows that such plea was understanding^ and voluntarily made under the principles of <em>Boykin, </em>[395 U.S. at 242, 89 S.Ct. 1709].\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Appellant contends that his plea was involuntary for three reasons: (1) the court failed to apprise him of the nature of the charge and the elements of the offense to which he was pleading guilty; (2) the court failed to apprise him of his right to a jury trial, and related rights; and (3) the facts were insufficient to establish his guilt for the charged offense. As discussed below, we agree with the first argument and hold that appellant established that his plea was involuntary based on the court\u2019s failure to advise him of the elements of the charge of use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence. Based on that holding, we need not address the other two issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">In <em>Henderson v. Morgan, </em>426 U.S. 637, 644-45, 96 S.Ct. 2253, 49 L.Ed.2d 108 (1976), the Supreme Court held that a guilty plea is not \u201cvoluntary in the sense that it constituted an intelligent admission that [the defendant] committed the offense unless the defendant received \u2018real notice of the true nature of the charge against him, the first and most universally recognized requirement of due process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 645, 96 S.Ct. 2253 (quoting <em>Smith v. O\u2019Grady, </em>312 U.S. 329, 334, 61 S.Ct. 572, 85 L.Ed. 859 (1941)). \u201cReal notice\u201d gives a defendant \u201can understanding of the law in relation to the facts.\u201d <em>McCarthy v. United States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 466, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">In <em>State v. Priet, </em>289 Md. 267, 288, 424 A.2d 349 (1981), the Court of Appeals held that an understanding of the nature of the offense requires \u201ca basic understanding of its essential substance, rather than of the specific legal components of the offense to which the plea is tendered.\u201d The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahx\">The nature of some crimes is readily understandable from the crime itself. Necessarily, the required determination can only be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the relevant circumstances in their totality as disclosed by the record, including, among other factors, the complexity of the charge, the personal characteristics of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>accused, and the factual basis proffered to support the court\u2019s acceptance of the plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-5\"><em>Id. </em>The test \u201cis whether, considering the record as a whole, the trial judge could fairly determine that the defendant understood the nature of the charge to which he pleaded guilty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 291, 424 A.2d 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">In <em>Bradshaw v. Stumpf, </em>545 U.S. 175, 125 S.Ct. 2398, 162 L.Ed.2d 143 (2005), the Supreme Court again addressed the issue of the voluntariness of a guilty plea. The Court reiterated that, \u201c[w]here a defendant pleads guilty to a crime without having been informed of the crime\u2019s elements ... the plea is invalid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183, 125 S.Ct. 2398. It stated, however, that: \u201cWhere a defendant is represented by competent counsel, the court usually may rely on that counsel\u2019s assurance that the defendant has been properly informed of the nature and elements of the charge to which he is pleading guilty.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Following <em>Bradshaw, </em>this Court made clear that, without express assurance on the record, a court cannot presume that \u201cdefense counsel has sufficiently explained to the defendant the nature of the offense to which he or she is entering a guilty plea.\u201d <em>Abrams v. State, </em>176 Md.App. 600, 622-23, 933 A.2d 887 (2007). We explained that \u201cthe trial judge must either (1) explain to the defendant on the record the nature of the charge and the elements of the crime, or (2) obtain on the record a representation by defense counsel that the defendant has been \u2018properly informed of the nature and elements of the charge to which he [or she] is pleading guilty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 623, 933 A.2d 887 (quoting <em>Bradshaw, </em>545 U.S. at 183, 125 S.Ct. 2398). <em>Accord Miller v. State, </em>185 Md.App. 293, 295, 307, 309, 970 A.2d 332 (Where \u201cdefense counsel did not represent that he had explained the nature and elements of the crime to the appellant,\u201d and neither the judge, defense counsel, or the prosecutor explained on the record the nature and elements of first-degree burglary, Mr. Miller\u2019s statement that he understood the plea agreement \u201cwas not tantamount to acknowledging that he understood the nature and elements of first-degree burglary.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 Md. 166, 978 A.2d 246 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>More recently, in <em>State v. Daughtry, </em>419 Md. 35, 42, 18 A.3d 60 (2011), the Court of Appeals stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au\">allowing a trial court, in ensuring that a guilty plea is knowing, voluntary, and entered intelligently, to rely essentially on nothing more than a presumption that \u201cin most cases defense counsel routinely explain the nature of the offense in sufficient detail to give the accused notice of ... what he is being asked to admit\u201d runs contrary to Rule 4-242\u2019s requirement that there be an adequate examination \u201con the record in open court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">In that case, the Court noted that \u201cthe only portion of the plea colloquy\u201d that related to \u201cascertaining whether the plea was knowing and voluntary was Daughtry\u2019s affirmative response to the trial judge\u2019s question, \u2018Have you talked over your plea with your lawyer?\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70, 18 A.3d 60. The Court held that, \u201cwhere the record reflects nothing more than the fact that a defendant is represented by counsel (as in the present case) and that the defendant discussed generically the plea with his or her attorney, such a plea colloquy is deficient under Rule 4-242(c), and the plea must be vacated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 71, 18 A.3d 60. The Court stated that its holding applied retrospectively, noting that it did not announce a new rule because \u201c[t]he law of this State with respect to the voluntariness of guilty pleas has been the same over the past thirty years since we decided <em>Priet.\u201d Id. </em>at 79, 81,18 A.3d 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Applying this law to the present case, it is clear that appellant\u2019s guilty plea to the charge of use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or a crime of violence was not voluntary.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Here, as in <em>Daughtry, </em>the only portion of the plea colloquy that related to whether the plea was knowing and voluntary was appellant\u2019s affirmative response to the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>inquiry whether appellant had \u201ctalked this matter over with [his] attorney.\u201d Neither the court, the prosecutor, nor appellant\u2019s attorney stated on the record the nature and elements of the crime of use of a handgun in a felony or crime of violence. Defense counsel did not indicate at the plea hearing that he had explained the nature and elements of the crime to the appellant, and the appellant did not represent that he understood the charge.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Under these circumstances, the prosecutor at the coram nobis hearing acknowledged that \u201cthis is a case where trial counsel only put on the record that [appellant] was pleading to a handgun charge,\u201d and therefore, the State was \u201cnot in a good position to argue that on the record [appellant] was advised of the nature and elements of the offenses as required.\u201d On appeal, however, the State argues that \u201c[t]he plea record establishes that [appellant] fully understood that he was pleading guilty to the crime of using a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence\u201d because the crime is \u201creadily understandable from the label of the crime itself.\u201d This contention is without merit for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Initially, the Court of Appeals has indicated that the crime is not \u201creadily understandable.\u201d In <em>Daughtry, </em>419 Md. at 74, n. 20, 18 A.3d 60 the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">Although the phrase \u2018use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence\u2019 appears readily understandable from the charge itself ... where one is charged specifically with the \u201cuse of a handgun in the commission of a felony,\u201d such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>charge is not readily understandable from the charge itself, as we think the average citizen does not know what crimes are considered felonies versus misdemeanors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">Moreover, the record of the plea hearing in this case indicates that the full name of the crime was not even mentioned. The court and appellant\u2019s counsel referred to the charge merely as \u201cthe handgun charge,\u201d \u201cthe handgun onef ],\u201d or simply \u201cthe handgun.\u201d Thus, even if there was merit to the argument that the elements of the offense were \u201creadily understandable from the label of the crime itself,\u201d this label was not even used during the plea colloquy.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Under these circumstances, the record does not reflect that appellant understood the nature and elements of the crime to which he entered his plea. Accordingly, we hold that appellant\u2019s plea was not knowing and voluntary, and the circuit court erred in denying appellant\u2019s petition for writ of error coram nobis, and appellant\u2019s plea must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY REVERSED AND REMANDED FOR PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. COSTS TO BE PAID BY PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-12\">. Appellant\u2019s original questions presented are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b364-13\">1. Were [appellant\u2019s] guilty pleas involuntary because the convicting court failed to apprise him of the nature of the charges and the elements of the offenses to which he was pleading guilty?</p>\n<p id=\"b364-14\">2. Were [appellant\u2019s] guilty pleas involuntary because the convicting court failed to apprise him of his right to a juiy trial and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>corollaiy rights associated with such trial, along with the presumption of innocence, the State\u2019s burden of proof, and the standard of proof?</p>\n<p id=\"b365-14\">3. Were [appellant\u2019s] guilt pleas involuntary because the facts presented to the convicting court were insufficient to establish his guilt of the charged offenses?</p>\n<p id=\"b365-15\">4. Did the court below err in finding that [appellant] waived his right to pursue coram nobis relief?</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b365-16\">. Appellant\u2019s questions presented and his argument headings address the validity of his guilty pleas, plural. Only one conviction is at issue, however, appellant\u2019s plea to the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence, Case Number 97-1468B. As discussed, the circuit court granted appellant's petition for coram nobis relief on the other two convictions and vacated those convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b365-17\">. Mr. McDowney was defendant <em>\"A\u201d </em>in case 97-1468, and appellant was defendant \u201cB.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b367-8\">. He asserted that the state convictions would: (1) subject him \"to mandatory life imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c), the federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>'three-strikes\u2019 statute\u201d; (2) increase the mandatory minimum sentence he faced to 15 years, with a maximum of life, as opposed to a maximum of ten years; and (3) contribute to his status as a \"career offender\u201d under the United States Sentencing Guidelines, such that, even if he \"is not subject to a mandatory life term,\u201d he would face \"an advisory sentence of 30 years to life,\u201d as opposed to a recommended sentence of 154-171 months as a non-career offender.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b368-8\">. As indicated, <em>supra, </em>the robbery underlying Case Number 97-1477B occurred at a Subway sandwich shop, and was a separate incident from the robbery which gave rise to Case Number 97-1468B, at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b371-10\">. The State also contends that, due to appellant\u2019s 13-year delay in seeking to set aside his guilty plea, his claim is barred by the doctrine of laches. <em>See Moguel v. State, </em>184 Md.App. 465, 471, 478, 966 A.2d 963 (2009) (\"the doctrine of laches is a defense to a petition for writ of error coram nobis\u201d if there was an unreasonable delay in the assertion of rights, and the delay results in prejudice to the State). The State, however, did not raise this issue below, and there is no evidence showing how the State was prejudiced, such as a loss of witnesses or evidence. Accordingly, we will not address this issue. <em>See Leake </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>204 Md.App. 387, 406, 40 A.3d 1127 (2012) (\"Ordinarily, an appellate court will not decide an issue \u2018unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>General Motors Corp. v.

The bill file for House Bill 1418, which became CP \u00a7 8-401, contains a letter from an attorney to Joseph Vallario, Esq., the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, relating to the need for a legislative enactment to modify the effect of <em>Holmes v. State, </em>401 Md. 429, 445-46, 932 A.2d 698 (2007), asserting that the \"pernicious decision\u201d in <em>Holmes </em>\"must be undone.\u201d Letter from George Harper to the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee (Jan. 29, 2012). The attorney asserted: \"All that is necessary to vitiate <em>[Holmes] </em>is to legislate the following: 'The failure to petition for leave to file an appeal shall not be construed as a waiver of the right to file a petition for writ of error coram nobis.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis omitted). This language is very similar to the language contained in CP \u00a7 8-401.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b374-7\">. The State\u2019s sole argument in support of its assertion that the General Assembly intended this statute to apply prospectively only is the Editor\u2019s Note to the statute, which states that \u201cthe act shall take effect October 1, 2012.\u201d We are not persuaded. As appellant notes, almost every statute has an effective date. The State points to no legislative history or precedent to support its contention that the legislature intended that the statute, which we have held to be both procedural and remedial in nature, would not apply retroactively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b374-8\">. Even if the issue was preserved for review, the State does not explain how appellant\u2019s failure to raise his claim in a post-conviction proceeding precludes his present coram nobis action, nor does it cite any Maryland case that so holds. We note that CP \u00a7 7-106, on which the State relies, provides that an error is waived when a petitioner \"could have made but intelligently and knowingly failed to make the allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>tion\u201d \u201cin a prior petition under this subtitle\u201d or \"in any other proceeding that the petitioner began.\u201d CP \u00a7 7-106(b)(1)(i).

In his brief to this Court, appellant asserts that, on June 8, 2012, he was \u201cconvicted in the U.S. District Court of the four offenses with which he had been charged in April 2010,\u201d and he was sentenced to 30 years, followed by five years supervised release.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b376-9\">. At the time of appellant\u2019s conviction in 1998, Maryland Rule 4-242(c) provided, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-10\">(c) <em>Plea of guilty. </em>The court may accept a plea of guilty only after it determines, upon an examination of the defendant on the record in open court conducted by the court, the State\u2019s Attorney, the attorney for the defendant, or any combination thereof, that (1) the defendant is pleading voluntarily, with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea; and (2) there is a factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>basis for the plea. The court may accept the plea of guilty even though the defendant does not admit guilt.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b379-7\">. At the time of appellant\u2019s conviction, Maryland Code Article 27, Section 36(B) (1998 Supp.), provided, in pertinent part, that \"[a]ny person who shall use a handgun ... capable of being concealed on the person in the commission of any felony or any crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 441 of this article shall be guilty of a separate misdemean- or.\u201d Section 441(e) defined \"crime of violence\u201d to include sixteen different offenses, including robbery and robbery with a deadly weapon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b380-8\">. As the State notes, appellant\u2019s counsel testified at the coram nobis hearing that he recalled going over the elements of each charge with appellant. This testimony, however, does not change the fact that, at appellant's plea hearing, neither appellant nor his counsel made a statement on the record indicating that such a discussion of the elements of the crime had occurred. <em>See State v.
