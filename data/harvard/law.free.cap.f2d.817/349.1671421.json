Zeledon appeals the assessment of attorney\u2019s fees against him under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927. We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">Zeledon\u2019s client, Alter Financial Corporation (\u201cAlter\u201d) sued Citizens and Southern International Bank of New Orleans (\u201cCitizens\u201d) alleging that Citizens failed to secure payment of six promissory notes executed in favor of Alter. In June 1985 Alter\u2019s attorneys withdrew as counsel of record and Alter did not replace them. In January 1986 Citizens moved for summary judgment. Alter did not respond or appear and the district court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">Zeledon then became Alter\u2019s counsel of record and filed an appeal of the summary judgment. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the summary judgment and granted Citizens motion that double costs and attorney\u2019s fees be assessed against Alter as a sanction for filing a frivolous appeal. <em>Alter Financial Corporation v. Citizens and Southern International Bank of New Orleans, </em>795 F.2d 83 (5th Cir.1986). On remand the district court assessed $8,503.30 in attorney\u2019s fees against Alter and Zeledon in solido, and $258.00 in double costs against Alter.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">Zeledon asserts that the district court exceeded the scope of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s mandate by assessing attorney\u2019s fees against him as well as Alter. The Fifth Circuit panel opinion stated \u201cpursuant to Fed.R.App.P. 38 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927, we assess double costs against Alter. We also award attorney\u2019s fees to [Citizens]____\u201d Zeledon points out that the panel opinion does not mention him and does not state fees should be assessed against Alter\u2019s counsel. He asserts that the reference to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927, a statute which <em>only </em>refers to sanctions against counsel, was cited by mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-15\">We decline to make the assumption that the citation to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 was an error. The panel opinion discussed the fact that Alter\u2019s response to Citizen\u2019s motion for sanctions was repetitive and referred to facts not in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-16\">We have allowed sanctions when an appeal, which is not arguable on the merits and is therefore frivolous, is brought unreasonably and vexatiously. <em>E.g., Olympia Co., Inc. v. Celotex Corp., </em>771 F.2d 888, 893 (5th Cir.1985). As the prior panel opinion discussed, Zeledon failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact in his appeal of the summary judgment and presented facts and issues never presented to the district court. The assessment against Zeledon was certainly permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-17\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-18\">As his second point, Zeledon asserts the district court erred by allowing Citizens to include work done by paralegals and a law clerk in its assessment of fees. Under other attorney\u2019s fee statutes we have allowed the award of fees for work that was traditionally performed by an attorney. <em>See, e.g., Richardson v. Byrd, </em>709 F.2d 1016, 1023 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Jones v. Armstrong Cork Co., </em>630 F.2d 324, 325 n. 1 (5th Cir.1980). The same result should obtain under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-19\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b436-20\">We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
