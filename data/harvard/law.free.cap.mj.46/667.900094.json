WYNNE, JJ.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b752-13\">McLAUGHLIN, Senior Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b752-14\">At a general court-martial before a mili- \u25a0 tary judge alone, the appellant pled guilty to the rape of his then-6-year-old daughter, a violation of Article 120(a), Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 920(a)(1994)[hereinafter UCMJ].<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The appellant was sentenced to 1 year of confinement, reduction to the pay grade of E-5, and to forfeit $830.00 pay per month for 12 months. The convening authority approved the sentence, but suspended forfeiture of pay in excess of $500.00.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The appellant has assigned two errors to the case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-20\">The first assignment of error was extensively briefed and argued before the military judge at the court-martial. The offense occurred in December 1987. The charge was preferred and received by the summary court-martial convening authority on 21 October 1993. The military judge ruled that the statute of limitations did not bar trial for the rape. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-21\">Currently, and at the time of appellant\u2019s offenses and trial, the statute of limitations provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-22\">(a) A person charged with ... any offense punishable by death, may be tried and punished at any time without limitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-23\">(b) Except as otherwise provided in this section (article), a person charged with an offense is not liable to be tried by court-martial if the offense was committed more than five years before the receipt of sworn charges and specifications by an officer exercising summary court-martial jurisdiction over the command.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-24\">Art. 43, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 843.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-25\">The punishment for rape <em>authorized by Congress </em>is that the guilty person \u201cshall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>punished, by death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct.\u201d Art. 120(a), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 920(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">We decline the invitation of the defense to apply a hypothetical constitutional analysis \u201cand decide whether this particular Article 120(a) offense would subject appellant to a sentence \u2018punishable by death.\u2019 \u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 6; <em>see United States v. Sykes, </em>32 M.J. 791 (N.M.C.M.R.1990). We decide this case irrespective of the effect, if any, of <em>Coker v. Georgia, </em>433 U.S. 584, 97 S.Ct. 2861, 53 L.Ed.2d 982 (1977)(holding that <em>imposing </em>the death penalty for the unaggravated rape <em>of </em>an adult is unconstitutional) on military justice practice. Article 120(a), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. 920(a), provides that any rape is <em>punishable </em>by death. We conclude that the actual availability of <em>imposition </em>of the death penalty is not relevant to validation of the statute of limitations established by Congress for offenses made punishable by death by Congress. <em>Sykes, </em>32 M.J. at 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The statute of limitations is a substantive right of the appellant that, if not properly waived, bars trial. <em>United States v. Troxell, </em>12 U.S.C.M.A. 6, 30 C.M.R. 6,1960 WL 4619 (1960). As such, it is substantive law. <em>United States v. Wesley, </em>19 M.J. 534, 537 (N.M.C.M.R.1984). In that regard, we note that while the President may limit punishments for offenses and establish procedures by which punishments may by adjudged, under Articles 36 and 56, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 836, 856, not even the President can alter substantive law. <em>See Ellis v. Jacob, </em>26 M.J. 90, 92-93 (C.M.A.1988). Therefore, the President cannot affect the statute of limitations by lawfully limiting the actual availability of the death penalty to aiding the enemy, some espionage offenses, some murders, or to narrowly defined instances of rape.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Similarly, the President\u2019s subordinates, such as the convening authority in the appellant\u2019s case, cannot change the legislatively mandated statute of limitation for a case in which \u201ca person [is] charged with ... any offense punishable by death,\u201d by referring the ease as noncapital or to a special court-martial, which can never adjudge the death penalty. Art. 43(a), UCMJ; 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(a). We conclude that the expansive language of Congress, adopting a change to the statute of limitations in 1986, which substituted the phrase \u201ccharged with ... any offense punishable by death____\u2019\u2019for the then-existing list of specifically enumerated charges, expresses the intent of Congress that any offense for which the Congress has authorized the death penalty \u201cmay be tried and punished at any time without limitation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b753-13\">If a charge is preferred that is \u201cpunishable by death,\u201d and that charge is ultimately referred to a court-martial, there is no statute of limitations bar to trial. This is true even if the charge is referred with an instruction that it be tried as a noncapital case or to a special court-martial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>32 M.J. 170, 171 n. 1 (C.M.A.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-14\">The second assignment of error is also without merit. The appellant has not presented evidence of demonstrable prejudice as required by law for relief. <em>See United States v. Jenkins, </em>38 M.J. 287 (C.M.A.1993); <em>United States v. Dupree, </em>37 M.J. 1089 (N.M.C.M.R. 1993); <em>United States v. Dunbar, 28 </em>M.J. 972, 980 n. 5 (N.M.C.M.R.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Accordingly, the findings of guilty and the sentence, as approved on review below, are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">SEFTON and WYNNE, JJ., concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-15\">. Although changes have been made to Article 120, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 920, since the offense, they have no bearing on the appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b752-16\">. Both Government and defense briefs incorrectly state the convening authority\u2019s action as suspending forfeiture of pay in excess of $500.00 pay <em>per month </em>when actually <em>all </em>forfeiture of pay in excess of $500.00 was suspended.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b752-17\">. I. THE MILITARY JUDGE ERRED WHEN HE DENIED DEFENSE COUNSEL\u2019S MOTION TO DISMISS THE REMAINING CHARGE OF RAPE BECAUSE THE FIVE-YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS UNDER ARTICLE 43 OF THE U.C.M.J. HAD RUN.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-18\">II. APPELLANT WAS DENIED HIS RIGHT TO SPEEDY POST-TRIAL REVIEW AND SUBJECTED TO PREJUDICE IN THE FORM OF A ONE-YEAR SENTENCE TO CONFINEMENT WHEN EIGHT MONTHS ELAPSED FROM THE DATE OF TRIAL BEFORE THE CONVENING AUTHORITY TOOK HIS ACTION AND APPROXIMATELY TWENTY-TWO MONTHS ELAPSED FROM TRIAL BEFORE THE RECORD WAS FINALLY FORWARDED TO THIS COURT FOR APPELLATE REVIEW. (Footnote omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b752-27\">. Prior to 1986 the statute of limitations under the UCMJ read, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-28\">(a) A person charged with desertion or absence without leave in time of war, or with aiding the enemy, mutiny, or murder, may be tried and punished at any time without limitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-29\">(b) Except as otherwise provided in this article, a person charged with desertion in time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>peace or of any offenses punishable under articles 119-132 is not liable to be tried by court-martial if the offense was committed more than three years before the receipt of sworn charges and specifications by an officer exercising summary court-martial jurisdiction over the command.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">Art. 43, <em>UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 843 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b753-9\">. See R.C.M. 1004, Capital cases, for the procedures in courts-martial in which the death penalty may be adjudged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b753-10\">. We note that in the jurisdictional portions of the UCMJ, i.e., Articles 17, 18, 19, and 20, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 817, 818, 819, and 820, cases in which the charge may be punished by death are referred to as capital cases. Capital cases are commonly tried at general court-martial, but can be tried at special courtmartial under proper circumstances. <em>See </em>Art. 19, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 819 (capital cases may be tried at special court-martial if permitted by President); R.C.M. 201(f)(2)(C)(ii), (iii) (general court-martial convening authority may permit trial at special court-martial for capital offense); <em>Sykes, </em>32 M.J. at 792 (holding that a special court-martial for rape held without the permission of a general court-martial convening authority was without jurisdiction).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
