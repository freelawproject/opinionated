The adjudged and approved sentence, imposed by a panel of officer and enlisted members, provides for a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for 3 months, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and sentence in an unpublished opinion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-20\">We granted review of the following issue:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-21\">WHETHER THE MILITARY JUDGE ERRED TO THE SUBSTANTIAL PREJUDICE OF THE APPELLANT WHEN SHE ERRONEOUSLY DETERMINED THAT THE DEFENSE HAD \u201cOPENED THE DOOR\u201d FOR THE ADMISSION OF A SECOND POSITIVE, BUT COMMAND DIRECTED, URINALYSIS DURING SENTENCING.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-22\">We resolve the issue against appellant and affirm the decision of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-23\">The charges against appellant were based on the results of a random urinalysis on November 10, 1993, that tested positive for cocaine. In February 1994, appellant submitted to a command-directed urinalysis that also tested positive for cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-24\">During sentencing trial counsel offered the testimony of Captain (Capt) Glenn Martinez, an Air Force phaimacist, concerning the effects of cocaine on the human body. The military judge overruled a defense objection to the testimony but gave a defense-requested limiting instruction that \u201cthe expert testimony of this witness is admitted only as to the general effects of the use of cocaine and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>not to any effect of Sergeant Johnson\u2019s 1-time use of cocaine.\u201d Trial counsel objected to the reference to only one use in the limiting instruction. The military judge overruled the objection but remarked, \u201cObviously, if the door is opened, the government may be trying to bring that other one in, but I believe it\u2019s appropriate for me to instruct, and I will instruct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Capt Martinez testified, preceded by the military judge\u2019s limiting instruction. During the prosecution\u2019s direct examination of Capt Martinez, the military judge sustained defense objections to questions about the effects of cocaine use \u201con a long-term basis\u201d and \u201cstreet use of cocaine.\u201d The military judge interrupted Capt Martinez when he began to describe the effects of \u201ccontinued use\u201d of cocaine and immediately instructed the members to disregard any testimony beyond the effects of a single use of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">The defense cross-examination of Capt Martinez included the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">DC: Captain Martinez, you\u2019ve never treated Sergeant Johnson for any kind of drug abuse or drug addiction or anything like that \u2014 correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">WIT: No, I haven\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">DC: In fact, you\u2019ve never seen Sergeant Johnson before today \u2014 is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-10\">WIT: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-11\">DC: Okay, and there\u2019s no evidence of addiction whatsoever that you know of \u2014 correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-12\">WIT: No, Ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-13\">DC: There\u2019s no evidence whatsoever of more than the one use that Sergeant Johnson has admitted to \u2014 is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-14\">WIT: Correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-15\">At an Article 39(a), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 839(a), session, trial counsel argued that defense counsel\u2019s question about \u201cno evidence whatsoever of more than the one use\u201d opened the door to rebuttal evidence of the second positive urinalysis. The military judge agreed and remarked, \u201c[N]ot only did the defense open the door, but the fact that there is another test out there positive, means that that question left in front of the members, as it stands, would tend to be misleading them, if not perpetrating a fraud upon the court.\u201d Thereafter, evidence of the second positive urinalysis was presented to the members through a stipulation of fact. The stipulation of fact included the following statement: \u201cBecause a command-directed urinalysis is not based on consent or probable cause, the results may not be used to support a charge of wrongful use of the drug under the UCMJ.\u201d Before the stipulation was presented to the members, the military judge instructed them that \u201cthe evidence which the government is about to offer has been admitted for the limited purpose of rebutting the answer given by Captain Martinez that there was evidence of only one use of cocaine, and it is not to be used for the prohibited purpose of punishing Staff Sergeant Johnson for an offense for which he is not on trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-17\">The military judge prohibited trial counsel from including in his sentencing argument any comment on the second urinalysis \u201cas a rehabilitative matter.\u201d Trial counsel did not mention the second urinalysis at all during his sentencing argument. To the contrary, he referred eight times to appellant\u2019s offense as a one-time use.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-18\">In her sentencing instructions the military judge instructed the members that \u201cyou must bear in mind that the accused is to be sentenced only for the offense of which he has been found guilty.\u201d She repeated her earlier limiting instruction that the evidence of the second urinalysis \u201cwas admitted for the limited purpose of rebutting the answer given by Captain Martinez that there was evidence of only one use of cocaine and not for the prohibited purpose of punishing Staff Sergeant Johnson for an offense for which he is not on trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-19\">Appellant now argues that the military judge erred, because the second positive urinalysis \u201crebutted nothing.\u201d The Government asserts that defense counsel opened the door by suggesting during the cross-examination of Capt Martinez that there was \u201cno evidence whatsoever\u201d of more than a one-time use of cocaine. The Government argues that the \u201cprosecution need not suffer an accused who seeks to gull the trier of fact with misinformation, either directly or by implication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>The court below held that the defense opened the door to evidence of a second positive urinalysis. The court further held that any error was harmless in light of the stipulation that the urinalysis results would not support punitive action under the UCMJ, the military judge\u2019s limiting instructions, and the trial counsel\u2019s avoiding any mention of the second urinalysis in his sentencing argument. Unpub. op. at 4. We agree with the harmless-error analysis of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">A military judge\u2019s ruling on admissibility of evidence is reviewed for abuse of discretion. His or her decision to admit evidence will not be overturned on appeal \u201cabsent a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Redmond, </em>21 MJ 319, 326 (CMA 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The record in this case suggests that counsel for both sides attempted to overplay their hands. The prosecution sought to introduce evidence about the effects of multiple uses of cocaine and addiction, even though it had admissible evidence of only a single use. The prosecution was unsuccessful because the military judge would not permit any testimony about \u201clong-term\u201d or \u201ccontinued\u201d use of cocaine, and she used limiting instructions to refocus the members on the one offense before the court. Notwithstanding the military judge\u2019s curative measures, the defense asked an ambiguous question suggesting that there was \u201cno evidence whatsoever\u201d of more than a single use, even though appellant had tested positive a second time. This Court has not been sympathetic to such cleverness. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Clark, </em>35 MJ 98 (CMA 1992) (refusing to allow appellant to benefit from gamesmanship to preclude testimony of key prosecution witness); <em>United States v. Trimper, </em>28 MJ 460 (CMA 1989) (upholding admission of evidence that appellant\u2019s in-court testimony was false, notwithstanding prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose the evidence); <em>see also United States v. Banks, </em>36 MJ 150, 162 (CMA 1992) (party may open door to rebuttal evidence \u201cby introducing potentially misleading testimony\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">We need not decide if the military judge abused her discretion by permitting the rebuttal evidence, because we hold that any error was harmless, for the reasons found by the court below: (1) the stipulation of fact recited that the command-directed urinalysis could not be used to support disciplinary action under the UCMJ; (2) the military judge repeatedly instructed the members concerning the limited purpose for which they could consider the evidence; and (3) the trial counsel did not exploit the evidence, but instead referred repeatedly to appellant\u2019s one-time use of cocaine. <em>See United States v. Holt, </em>33 MJ 400, 408 (CMA 1991) (members presumed to follow military judge\u2019s instructions).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">The decision of the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">Chief Judge COX and Judges</p>\n<p id=\"A5-\">SULLIVAN, CRAWFORD, and EFFRON concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
