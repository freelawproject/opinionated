We affirm appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence to a dishonorable discharge, 25 years confinement, and reduction to E-l.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-27\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b728-28\">In the fall of 1992, Mrs. N noticed a dramatic change in her daughter H\u2019s behavior as she entered second grade. \u201cShe was restless in her sleep. She started having nightmares. She was unhappy all the time and cried a lot. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>She was always whining.\u201d Mrs. N attributed H\u2019s problems to a new baby in the family and the death of two grandparents. However, H\u2019s behavior \u201creally, got bad in 1994\u201d when Mrs. N caught her masturbating. According to Mrs. N, H began masturbating \u201call the time,\u201d wet the bed, had trouble academically, and was antisocial.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">With H\u2019s behavior deteriorating, Mrs. N took her to a local mental health clinic for therapy in mid-September 1994. Around Thanksgiving of that year, H began to reveal that appellant had touched her inappropriately about 2 years before when she played at his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Ultimately, H revealed a sordid story of sexual abuse at appellant\u2019s hands, and testified about it at trial. She described playing \u201cpeek-a-boo\u201d and \u201chide-and-go-seek\u201d with appellant and other neighborhood children at his house. If they found appellant during a game of \u201chide-and-go-seek, they had \u201cto give him a hug.\u201d For \u201cpeek-a-boo,\u201d \u201che would flash open his bathrobe and say \u2018peek-a-boo, I see you.\u2019 \u201d Since appellant never wore any clothing under his bathrobe, H and the other children would see his penis \u201ca lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">While watching TV one day at appellant\u2019s house \u201caround the end of the first grade and the beginning of the second grade\u201d (1992), appellant told H to stand up and take off her pants and panties. She complied and appellant handcuffed and tied her to a chair. After taping her mouth shut, he fondled and probed her vagina with his fingers. When appellant\u2019s wife came home, appellant took H upstairs to the bedroom, tied her to the bed, and had sexual intercourse with her. He threatened to kill her if she told anyone. According to H, appellant\u2019s wife and daughter were not aware of incident, and she went to the daughter\u2019s bedroom afterward to play. She continued to visit the house to see appellant\u2019s daughter until the end of 1992 or beginning of 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">Dr. Cooper, a well-qualified pediatrician with extensive experience in diagnosing and treating child sexual abuse, examined H in December 1994. She found H had a \u201cclearly and unmitigatingly abnormal\u201d hymenal tissue \u201cvery characteristic of a tearing injury which may be associated with a penetrating injury.\u201d This penetrating injury was consistent with penile or attempted penile penetration, and would not have resulted from masturbation or some straddling type trauma like riding a bike.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">Dr. Cooper also observed that H exhibited common behaviors associated with sexually abused children of the 6 to 11 age group, such as delayed reporting, recurrent nightmares, bed-wetting, low self-esteem, poor school performance, antisocial behavior, and excessive masturbation. Dr. Cooper opined that like most child victims, H had been consistent in certain \u201ccore elements\u201d of her report, that is, facts she did not change. According to Dr. Cooper, H was consistent that there was only one \u201cperpetrator\u201d at one place who had exposed himself, used a \u201cbondage modus operandi,\u201d and threatened to kill her.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-11\">Finally, H was also not alone in her description of appellant\u2019s fondness for playing children\u2019s games while clad only in a bathrobe. Ten-year-old Jake, another neighborhood playmate, testified that he often played with appellant\u2019s son. Appellant would join in games of \u201chide-and-go-seek,\u201d exposing his penis when the robe would \u201cfly back.\u201d Jake believed he saw appellant\u2019s penis \u201ceverytime [he] went there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-12\">BOLSTERING OF VICTIM\u2019S CREDIBILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b729-14\">\n<em>Expert Witness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b729-15\">Appellant argues, as he did at trial, that Dr. Cooper became a human lie detector in his case, stating \u201cin no uncertain terms that LH] had been sexually abused consistent with her allegations\u201d and offered inadmissible prior consistent statement evidence. We disagree. First off, we review a military judge\u2019s decision to admit expert testimony under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Raya, </em>45 M.J. 251, 252 (1996). This trial judge was keenly alert to the line in the sand appellate courts have drawn on the admissibility of expert testimony comparing a victim\u2019s behavior to that of an identified class of abuse victims. <em>See United States v. Cacy, </em>43 M.J. 214 (1995). Not once, but twice, he <em>sua sponte </em>instructed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>the members that they had the responsibility to determine a witness\u2019s credibility and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJN\">[n]o expert witness nor any other witness can testify that the alleged victim\u2019s account of what occurred is true or credible, that the expert believed the alleged victim, or that a sexual encounter occurred. To the extent that you believe that any witness testified or implied that she believed the alleged victim, that a crime occurred, or that the alleged victim is credible, you may not consider this as evidence, that a crime occurred or that the alleged victim is credible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">The military judge\u2019s ruling admitting Dr. Cooper\u2019s testimony, as well as his limiting instruction, hit the bull\u2019s-eye. Dr. Cooper never specifically testified that she believed H was truthful or that appellant committed the offenses charged. Instead, she stayed within the bounds the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces established for experts in child sexual abuse cases. \u201cAn expert may testify as to what symptoms are found among children who have suffered sexual abuse and whether the child-witness has exhibited these symptoms; discuss patterns of consistency in the stories of victims and compare those patterns with patterns in the victim\u2019s story; and testify about a child\u2019s ability to separate truth from fantasy.\u201d <em>Cacy, </em>43 M.J. at 217 (citations omitted). The judge kept Dr. Cooper\u2019s testimony within these limits, even directing Dr. Cooper to refer to \u201calleged perpetrator\u201d instead of \u201cperpetrator.\u201d Moreover, his instruction required the members to keep the expert\u2019s testimony in its proper context.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">\n<em>Mrs. N</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">H\u2019s mother, Mrs. N, testified on direct examination as a prosecution witness about H\u2019s nightmares. On cross-examination, defense counsel tried to explore whether-someone else, such as appellant\u2019s son Jonathan, was responsible for the offenses, asking Mrs. H if she recalled telling investigators that H would scream out in her sleep, \u201cstop get off me, it hurts Jonathan.\u201d The judge sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objection to the question, ruling it beyond the scope of direct, but allowed defense counsel to recall Mrs. N in the defense case-in-chief to explore that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">As a defense witness, Mrs. N modified her testimony somewhat, stating H would scream \u201cstop, it hurts, get off me\u201d and then say the name of either appellant\u2019s daughter or son. On cross, the prosecutor explored the defense attempt to shift blame to Jonathan, asking Mrs. N if H ever said anyone other than appellant had abused her. Defense counsel failed to object to the question or the reply, which was no. Now, appellant argues Mrs. N improperly bolstered H\u2019s testimony with inadmissible prior consistent statements of the identity of her abuser. <em>See </em>Mil.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(B). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">The prosecutor did not question Mrs. N to elicit a prior consistent statement under Military Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B), rather, he wanted to part the bushes to show defense counsel\u2019s rabbit trail wouldn\u2019t lead the members anywhere. Defense counsel may not plant a weed in the government\u2019s evidence garden and then prevent the prosecutor from trying to pull it out. <em>See Raya, 45 </em>M.J. at 254. In any event, appellant forfeited the prior consistent statement issue by failing to object at trial, and we do not find plain error which would excuse the forfeiture. Mil.R.Evid. 103; <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>44 M.J. 475, 480 (1996); <em>cf. United States v. Pagel, </em>40 M.J. 771 (A.F.C.M.R.1994) (admission of profile evidence from prosecution expert witness was not plain error), <em>affd, </em>45 M.J. 64 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">RIGHT TO PRESENT A DEFENSE</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">An accused has a constitutional right to present legally and logically relevant evidence at trial that someone else had the motive, knowledge, and opportunity to commit the offense charged. Furthermore, the identity of the perpetrator is an element of proof that the accused has a fundamental constitutional right to rebut. <em>See Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973); <em>United States v. Wool-heater, </em>40 M.J. 170 (C.M.A.1994); <em>cf. United States v. Buenaventura, </em>45 M.J. 72 (1996) (admission of \u201crape shield\u201d evidence to show that another committed the offenses).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>Appellant claims he was denied the right to present a defense that his son Jonathan may have committed the offenses. We conclude appellant\u2019s argument is grounded in wishful thinking rather than fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">As outlined above, defense counsel explored H\u2019s nightmare statements about Jonathan. Also in response to defense cross-examination, Mrs. N testified that Jonathan's \u201cbehavior in the neighborhood\u201d was \u201cnot quite right\u201d at times. Moreover, appellant, who testified on the merits, pointed out that his son had learning disabilities. The only question the judge prohibited in this area was whether Jonathan had received \u201cany treatment relative to his disabilities.\u201d The judge sustained the prosecutor\u2019s relevance objection and defense counsel did not ask for argument or otherwise question the ruling, but immediately moved on to another area.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">To preserve a ruling excluding evidence, defense counsel must make an offer of proof of the \u201csubstance of the evidence\u201d unless it is \u201capparent from the context within which questions were asked.\u201d Mil.R.Evid. 103(a)(2); <em>United States v. Dorsey, </em>16 M.J. 1 (C.M.A.1983) (four-part test to determine admissibility of constitutionally required evidence). When the evidence concerns an individual\u2019s mental or behavioral problems, the offer should clearly identify the significance of the testimony and theory of admissibility as expert testimony is often required to link such evidence to the issues in the case. <em>See United States v. Sanchez, </em>40 M.J. 782 (A.F.C.M.R.1994), <em>aff'd, </em>44 M.J. 174 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Here, we fail to see how a learning disability or its treatment, in and of itself, is relevant to proving whether appellant, or his son, committed the offenses charged. It did not have \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Mil.R.Evid. 401. Therefore, defense counsel needed to make an offer of proof to preserve the issue, and probably needed expert testimony to show relevance.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">In any event, appellant planted the seed that his son committed the offense against H through Mrs. N\u2019s testimony, and his counsel unsuccessfully presented that theory to the members in closing argument. Granted, the military judge sustained an objection to defense counsel\u2019s argument when he quoted Mrs. N as testifying H screamed, \u201cget off me, stop, stop, get off of me Jonathan.\u201d However, the judge was right on the mark since counsel misstated Mrs. N\u2019s testimony that H would scream \u201cstop, it hurts get off me\u201d and say the name of either appellant\u2019s son or daughter. Counsel who wants to attribute a direct quote to a witness in closing argument had better get it right.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">IMPEACHMENT OF APPELLANT</p>\n<p id=\"A0q\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">Appellant testified in his own behalf. On direct examination, he admitted wearing only a bathrobe while playing with his children\u2019s playmates. He explained the robe came open only once and he retied it immediately. Besides just denying that he committed the offenses charged, he offered that \u201cit is not my character\u201d to sexually abuse a child, he had never been \u201cin any type of trouble,\u201d and he had never had \u201cany complaints\u201d about him \u201cconcerning improper conduct with respect to children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">On cross-examination, the prosecutor leapt on appellant\u2019s broad denials like a pit bull. The prosecutor grilled appellant on whether he was aware that his daughter had complained to investigators about appellant fondling her vagina, and whether he told investigators that he had \u201cdifferent ideas about sexuality,\u201d had visited nude beaches, gone \u201cskinny dipping,\u201d and \u201cstreaked\u201d while in Germany. Appellant denied telling investigators about any of those subjects or being aware of his daughter\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-13\">In rebuttal, the prosecutor called Agent Barnes, the investigator who interviewed appellant, to \u201cimpeach\u201d appellant\u2019s testimony. Over defense objection, Agent Barnes painted a picture totally opposite appellant\u2019s version of the interview. Agent Barnes recalled advising appellant that he was suspected of abusing his daughter as well as H. When he confronted appellant about wearing only a bathrobe while playing with neighbor children, appellant replied, \u201che was more sexual<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>ly open than the average person.\u201d Appellant then went on to describe to Agent Barnes how he visited a nude beach and was investigated by the security police for skinny dipping.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">The military judge advised the members that \u201c[e]vidence as to what allegations the [investigators] told the accused they were investigating, and evidence that the accused swam nude in Germany or attended nude beaches, may be considered by [them] for the limited purpose of its tendency, if any, to rebut the testimony of the accused.\u201d The judge cautioned them that they could not use the evidence \u201cfor any other purpose,\u201d such as concluding that appellant was a bad person, had criminal tendencies, or committed the charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The Military Rules of Evidence recognize that the accused who elects to testify is subject to impeachment just like any other witness. Mil.R.Evid. 404(a)(8), 607, 608, 609; <em>United States v. Pruitt, </em>43 M.J. 864, 868-869 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App.1996). The prosecutor may directly attack the testifying accused\u2019s character for truthfulness with opinion or reputation evidence, or cross-examine the accused about specific instances of conduct probative of truthfulness. However, other than conviction of a crime, the prosecutor is bound by an accused\u2019s denial in response to the prosecutor\u2019s question of a specific instance of conduct, and may not prove the denied conduct by extrinsic evidence unless the conduct shows bias, prejudice or a motive to misrepresent. Mil.R.Evid. 608; <em>Pruitt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">On the other hand, ease law recognizes that the prosecutor may impeach, by contradiction, the testifying accused who denies committing certain misconduct on direct examination, such as \u201cI have never done __\u201d Also, the prosecutor may use contradiction to impeach an accused who volunteers a broad denial when confronted with a narrow cross-examination question. When impeaching by contradiction, the prosecutor may prove the denied conduct by extrinsic evidence. <em>United States v. Trimper, </em>28 M.J. 460, 466-67 (C.M.A.1989), <em>cert, denied, </em>493 U.S. 965, 110 S.Ct. 409, 107 L.Ed.2d 374; <em>Pruitt, </em>43 M.J. at 869.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">Here, appellant opened the door to the areas in question through his broad denials in direct examination which included comments concerning his character, previous \u201ctroublefree\u201d life, and lack of knowledge of children\u2019s complaints. He can\u2019t complain on appeal because the prosecutor marched through it. By his cautionary instruction, the military judge placed this evidence in its proper context as impeachment evidence, the theory offered by the prosecutor. Granted, the military judge didn\u2019t instruct on the \u201cstreaking\u201d aspect of the problem; however, extrinsic evidence was not offered on that issue and defense counsel waived a more expanded instruction by failing to request one. <em>See Trimper, </em>28 M.J. at 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">REMAINING ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b732-11\">For the first time, appellant complains that the prosecutor inflamed the member\u2019s passions and misstated both the law and the evidence. The short answer here is appellant forfeited the issue at trial by failing to object and we do not find plain error to excuse the forfeiture. R.C.M. 919(c); <em>United States v. Ruppel, </em>45 M.J. 578 (A,F.Ct.Crim. App.1997) and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-12\">Finally, appellant claims he was represented by an inept civilian and military defense team. We disagree. As we stated in <em>United States v. Simoy, </em>\u201cToday, a convicted military defendant rarely passes on an opportunity to lay the blame for his predicament at his lawyer\u2019s doorstep \u2014 this case is no different.\u201d 46 M.J. 592 (A.F.Ct.Crim. App.1996). Trial lawyers are neither magicians nor alchemists \u2014 a bad case is a bad case. Here, appellant\u2019s trial team did the best with what appellant gave them: an adult male who admitted to investigators that he routinely played games with neighborhood children clad only in his bathrobe, exposing his penis at least once. Furthermore, counsel can hardly be blamed for appellant\u2019s attempt to lie his way out of pretrial statements that he made to investigators which sent his case spiraling into an unrecoverable tailspin. In summary, we find appellant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>represented effectively by counsel and was not deprived of a fair trial. <em>See Simoy </em>and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The findings and sentence are correct in law and fact, and no error prejudicial to appellant\u2019s substantial rights occurred. Accordingly, the findings and sentence are</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">Judges MORGAN, C.H., II, and MORGAN, J.H. concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
