The adjudged and approved sentence provides for a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for 60 days, partial forfeitures for 2 months, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and sentence in an unpublished opinion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-9\">We granted review of the following issue:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-10\">WHETHER THE MILITARY JUDGE ERRED TO THE PREJUDICE OF APPELLANT BY DENYING THE CHALLENGES FOR CAUSE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">Two challenges for cause are at issue in this case. The first involved a defense challenge of a lieutenant colonel who had previously served as a judge advocate and area defense counsel. The second, on which we turn our decision, involved Major (Maj) B, the wife of Office of Special Investigations Special Agent B, one of the agents responsible for investigating the crimes for which appellant was tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-14\">During <em>voir dire, </em>Maj B stated that she and her husband \u201cdon\u2019t discuss cases.\u201d She initially said that she had not heard her husband \u201cmake any references at all to this case.\u201d When asked, however, if she had \u201cheard him make any references at all that could be applied to this case,\u201d she answered, \u201cYes.\u201d Asked to elaborate, she testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-15\">It was a conversation on the telephone but I don\u2019t know who he was talking to because I didn\u2019t answer the telephone when we were at home. He made a comment like, \u201cMore money?\u201d So when he got off the phone I said, \u201cWhat are you talking about, \u2018more money\u2019?\u201d I didn\u2019t know who he was talking to. He said, \u201cOh, it is a case that is being worked on. Somebody said that this guy took more money.\u201d That would be something that I might associate with this ease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-16\">Defense counsel challenged Maj B for cause on the ground that she \u201cis the wife of one of the case agents or the assistant case agent.... In this case, if for no other reason, we would think that the appearance aspect of this: the agent whose name is throughout this case file.\u201d Defense counsel argued that Maj B should not sit on the court panel in order to keep the court-martial \u201cfree from substantial doubt as to reality [sic], fairness and impartiality.\u201d Trial counsel did not dispute Special Agent B\u2019s role in the investigation of this case, but informed the military judge that the prosecution \u201cdoes not anticipate Agent [B]\u2019s name coming up even once in this case.\u201d The military judge denied the challenge, remarking that Maj B\u2019s \u201canswers were significantly direct, sincere, and that they reflected that she keeps apart then-two particular professional careers; that she knows nothing about this particular ease; [and] that she has not formed any opinion whatsoever in this particular case.\u201d The military judge also ruled, \u201cI don\u2019t see a challenge for cause for ... [Maj B] based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>fact that she is the spouse of that particular agent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">The record before us is unambiguous. Contrary to the assertion of our dissenting colleague that \u201cthere is no evidence in the record that ... [Special Agent B] was involved with appellant\u2019s case,\u201d 46 MJ at 235, counsel for both sides agreed, on the record, that Special Agent B was an assistant case agent in the investigation of the charges before the court-martial.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">RCM 912(f)(1)(N), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.), codifies a general ground for challenge applicable when a member \u201c[s]hould not sit as a member in the interest of having the court-martial free from substantial doubt as to legality, fairness, and impartiality.\u201d We have said that \u201c[t]his general ground includes actual bias as well as \u2018implied bias.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Daulton, </em>45 MJ 212, 217 (1996), citing <em>United States v. Harris, </em>13 MJ 288, 292 (CMA 1982). \u201cThe focus of the rule is on the perception or appearance of fairness.\u201d <em>United States v. Dale, </em>42 MJ 384, 386 (1995). The rule \u201creflects the President\u2019s concern with avoiding even the perception of bias, predisposition, or partiality.\u201d <em>United States v. Lake, </em>36 MJ 317,323 (CMA 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The issue in this case involves implied bias rather than actual bias. Although our standard of review is abuse of discretion for challenges based on actual bias as well as those based on implied bias, we give less deference to the military judge when implied bias is involved. <em>See generally United States v. White, </em>36 MJ 284 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">\u201cA challenge for cause based on actual bias is \u2018essentially one of credibility.\u2019 \u201d Because of the military judge\u2019s superior \u201copportunity to observe the demeanor of court members and assess their credibility during <em>voir dire,\u201d </em>a military judge\u2019s ruling on a challenge based on actual bias is given \u201cgreat deference.\u201d <em>Daulton, </em>45 MJ at 217. \u201cImplied bias,\u201d on the other hand, \u201cis reviewed under an objective standard____ Implied bias is not viewed through the eyes of the military judge or the court members, but through the eyes of the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217. \u201c[T]he military judge\u2019s assessment of ... credibility ... is not dispositive on the issue of implied bias.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">We hold that the military judge abused his discretion in denying the challenge of Maj B. Under an objective standard, there is a \u201csubstantial doubt\u201d about the \u201clegality, fairness, and impartiality\u201d of a court-martial when a court member sits in judgment of a case investigated by her husband. Like the participation of the security police officer in <em>Dale </em>and the participation of the member whose sister and mother were victims of sexual abuse in <em>Daulton, </em>Maj B\u2019s participation in a case investigated by her husband does not pass the test of public confidence contemplated by RCM 912(f)(1)(N). <em>See </em>RCM 912(f), Discussion (example of basis for challenge is that \u201cthe member ... is closely related to ... a witness in the case\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Glenn, </em>25 MJ 278, 280 (CMA 1987) (\u201cWe find it difficult to believe that either appellant or the public could be convinced that he received a fair trial when he was not apprised of the fact that a member of the staff judge advocate\u2019s family was sitting on his court-martial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-13\">Contrary to our dissenting colleague\u2019s assertions, this decision is not a reflection on Maj B\u2019s integrity, \u201ca rejection of rehabilitation of potential court members,\u201d 46 MJ at 232, or a holding that law enforcement personnel and their spouses are <em>per se </em>ineligible to sit as court members. We do not suggest that Maj B\u2019s responses on <em>voir dire </em>were anything but completely honest and sincere. We are not holding that law enforcement personnel and their spouses are <em>per se </em>disqualified from sitting on courts-martial.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-14\">This case is not based on Maj B\u2019s relationship with a person who happens to be in law enforcement. It is based on her relationship to a criminal investigator who investigated the charges in the specific ease before her. We hold only that Maj B\u2019s participation in a case investigated by her husband would cause a reasonable member of the public to have \u201csubstantial doubt as to legality, fair<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>ness, and impartiality\u201d of the proceedings. ROM 912(f)(l)(N).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">The decision of the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals is reversed. The findings and sentence are set aside. The record of trial is returned to the Judge Advocate General of the Air Force. A rehearing may be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Judges SULLIVAN and EFFRON concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b320-12\">. We also granted review of the issue \"[w]hether the military judge erred to the prejudice of appellant by instructing the members that a mistake of fact must be both honest and reasonable to be a defense to the specific-intent crimes of larceny and wrongful appropriation.\u201d In light of our decision on the challenges for cause, we do not decide this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b322-6\">COX, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AGe\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">I write only because of the doomful, apocalyptic dissent of my learned colleague. This case is simple. The wife of a policeman who investigated the case was allowed to sit in judgment of the man her husband accused of committing the crime. I would allow neither the fox nor the vixen to guard the hen house.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">With all due respect, we are not talking abstractly about a policeman or a policeman\u2019s wife. We are talking about \u201cthe\u201d policeman and \u201chis\u201d wife. <em>See </em>RCM 912(f)(1)(N), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b322-9\">CRAWFORD, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AdG\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">Despite their assertion to the contrary, the majority\u2019s decision is either a reflection on the integrity of the court member or a rejection of rehabilitation of potential court members. Neither is appropriate. Additionally, it misapplies our \u201cclear-abuse-of-discretion\u201d standard of review, <em>United States v. White, </em>36 MJ 284, 287 (CMA 1993). For these reasons I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">This case is similar to others we have seen. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Roane, </em>43 MJ 93 (1995) (accused used roommate\u2019s telephone jack); <em>United States v. Reed, </em>34 MJ 282 (CMA 1992) (accused used roommate\u2019s ATM card). The issue is whether appellant had permission to use his friend's American Express card for charges totaling nearly $5,000. No law enforcement officers testified in this case either at trial or at the investigation under Article 32, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 USC \u00a7 832. Appellant\u2019s friend, Airman First Class John R. DiRoma, Jr., testified, along with an auditor from American Express, for the Government. The only witness for the defense was appellant. The issue centered around appellant\u2019s belief that he could lawfully take and use his friend\u2019s ATM card.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-14\">The court members were placed under oath for the <em>voir dire. </em>During the <em>voir dire </em>of the court members, it was learned that Lieutenant Colonel (LtCol) B was previously an area defense counsel, while Major (Maj) B was married to an OSI agent.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-15\">Maj B testified on <em>voir dire </em>as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-16\">TC: Thank you. Major [B], I just want to ask you a couple of questions about your association with OSI. I understand your husband is an agent for them, and it was also my understanding that he was involved in some way on this particular case. Are you aware of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-17\">MEMB MAJ [B]: No. I had no idea. We don\u2019t discuss eases. If he ever gave me any information at all \u2014 if he ever did \u2014 I would want to know more. So, I just don\u2019t want to know. We don\u2019t discuss any eases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-18\">TC: Have you heard him make any references at all to this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-19\">MEMB MAJ [B]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-20\">TC: Let me ask you an even more specific question. Have you heard him make any references at all that could be applied to this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-21\">MEMB MAJ [B]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-22\">TC: If I could ask, what references would those be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-23\">MEMB MAJ [B]: It was a conversation on the telephone but I don\u2019t know who he was talking to because I didn\u2019t answer the telephone when we were at home. He made a comment like, \u201cMore money?\u201d So when he got off the phone I said, \u201cWhat are you talking about, \u2018more money\u2019? I didn\u2019t know who he was talking to. He said, \u201cOh, it is a case that is being worked on. Somebody said that this guy took more money.\u201d That would be something that I might associate with this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-24\">TC: Did he say anything about that case? MEMB MAJ [B]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>TC: So you have a standing rule in your house not to discuss cases?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-4\">MEMB MAJ [B]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">TC: Just one last general thing. Is there anything about your marriage to your husband or in your relationship to your husband that would cause you to have any problems in sitting in a court-martial? MEMB MAJ [B]: No. I mean since he has worked in OSI, it has always been his work and mine has been mine. I don\u2019t really get involved with what he does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">The judge later questioned Maj B, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">MJ: Just to clarify for the record, you had no association with this case based on your relationship with your husband?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">MEMB MAJ [B]: Absolutely not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-9\">MJ: Or his professional association with OSI?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-10\">MEMB MAJ [B]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-11\">MJ: And you heard none of the details of this particular case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-12\">MEMB MAJ [B]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-13\">MJ: And you have not formed any opinions in regards to the charge and specifications in this case based on your husband\u2019s professional occupation with the Air Force?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-14\">MEMB MAJ [B]: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-15\">Both members articulated their ability to remain impartial, listen to the evidence, and follow the judge\u2019s instructions. There was no questioning of Maj B as to the other witnesses in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-16\">During argument on the challenge for cause against Maj B, defense counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-17\">Despite her protestations that they do not discuss things, I find that highly unusual. That would be a unique case in which one\u2019s profession did not bleed over into their personal lives, and that there were no theoretical discussions as to the value or the procedures or processes of people they deal with in their jobs. In this case, if for no other reason, we would think that the appearance aspect of this: the agent whose name is throughout this case file.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-19\">The defense did not call her husband in rebuttal of her testimony.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-20\">The prosecutor argued the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-21\">The United States does not anticipate Agent [B]\u2019s name coming up even once in this case. Certainly, we have no plans for bringing it up and we are not aware of any reason that it would come up as he was the assistant case agent and merely derived for some support for the main case agent. The Defense Counsel\u2019s concern is based solely on the fact that she happens to be married to that individual. As she stated, there has been no bleedover and it wouldn\u2019t affect her at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-22\">The judge found that Maj B\u2019s \u201canswers were significantly direct, sincere, and that they reflected that she keeps apart their two particular professional careers; that she knows nothing about this particular case; that she has not formed any opinion whatsoever in this particular case; and in regards to her particular answers, she has nothing to state as an effect, either for her or for her husband in regards to her particular participation in this ease or the results of this particular case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-23\">Subsequently, both challenges for cause against these two members were denied, and the defense used the peremptory challenge against LtCol B.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-24\">In seeking to preserve the challenge for cause, the defense stated that \u201cbut for the denial of the challenge for cause as to Major [B], we would have challenged yet another member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-25\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b323-26\">Our standard of review is whether the judge clearly abused his discretion. <em>White, </em>36 MJ at 287. This Court does not appear to distinguish between different \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standards depending on the alleged errors. In <em>United States v. Travers, </em>25 MJ 61, 63 (CMA 1987), quoting <em>Renney v. Dobbs House, Inc., </em>275 S.C. 562, 274 S.E.2d 290, 291 (1981), the Court notes that \u201c[a]n abuse of discretion arises in cases in which the judge was controlled by some error of law or where the order, based upon factual, as distinguished from legal, conclusions, is without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>evidentiary support.\u201d <em>Travers </em>applies a stringent abuse-of-discretion standard: \u201cTo reverse for \u2018an abuse of discretion involves far more than a difference in ... opinion---The challenged action must ... be found to be \u2018arbitrary, fanciful, clearly unreasonable,\u2019 or \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 in order to be invalidated on appeal.\u2019 \u201d 25 MJ at 62, quoting <em>United, States v. Yoakum, </em>8 MJ 763, 768 (ACMR 1980), <em>ajfd on other grounds, </em>9 MJ 417 (CMA 1980); <em>see also Haney v. Rose, </em>642 F.2d 1055, 1060 (6th Cir.l981)(\u201c[A] trial judge\u2019s finding of impartiality should be set aside only upon a showing that prejudice is manifest.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">This Court has stressed the Sixth Amendment right to \u201can impartial jury.\u201d <em>Voir dire </em>is the method to weed out members who may be biased. The Manual sets forth specific grounds for challenges for cause plus the catchall mentioned by the majority. RCM 912(f)(1), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.). Neither the Manual nor 28 USC \u00a7 1870 prohibits police officers from sitting as jurors. \u201cBias and prejudice will not be presumed from the fact that a juror is engaged in law enforcement work.\u201d <em>United States v. LePera, 443 </em>F.2d 810, 812 (9th Cir.1971) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The question of \u201cpartiality\u201d of a court member is \u201cplainly one of historical fact: did a juror swear that he could set aside any opinion he might hold and decide the case on the evidence, and should the juror\u2019s protestation of impartiality have been believed.\u201d <em>Patton v. Yount, </em>467 U.S. 1025, 1036, 104 S.Ct. 2885, 2891, 81 L.Ed.2d 847 (1984). Consequently, \u201cthe trial court\u2019s resolution of such questions is entitled, even on direct appeal, to \u2018special deference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1038, 104 S.Ct. at 2892. This \u201cdetermination is essentially one of credibility, and therefore largely one of demeanor\u201d that should be determined by the trial judge. <em>Id. </em>Judges are in the best position to evaluate both the verbal and non-verbal communication, including the raised eyebrow, the hesitancy, and movement as to whether the court member is being honest during <em>voir dire. </em>The judge in this case recognized that he had to make the credibility decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">Initial questioning of a court member may establish a ground for challenge for cause, <em>see, e.g., Patton, supra </em>at 1038, 104 S.Ct. at 2892-93; such as views on the death penalty, <em>see, e.g., Wainwright v. Witt, </em>469 U.S. 412, 105 S.Ct. 844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (1985); pretrial publicity, <em>United States v. Curtis, </em>44 MJ 106, 138-140 (1996), <em>rev\u2019d as to sentence on recon., </em>46 MJ 129 (1997); or inflexibility on sentence in a case, <em>United States v. Heriot, </em>21 MJ 11,13 (CMA 1985)(\u201cjudge may wish to give the member additional instructions and ask him some clarifying questions\u201d). These initial responses usually lead to rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">The majority\u2019s decision undermines the practice of rehabilitation in Federal, state, and military courts. When the juror indicates that he or she will follow the judge\u2019s instructions, keep an open mind, and weigh all the evidence, absent disbelief by the judge, the member is \u201cmentally free to render an impartial finding and sentence based on the law and the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Parker, </em>6 USCMA 274, 284-85, 19 CMR 400, 410-11, (1955); <em>see also United States v. Tippit, </em>9 MJ 106 (CMA 1980); <em>United States v. McGowan, </em>7 MJ 205 (CMA 1979); <em>United States v. Findlay, </em>7 MJ 931 (ACMR 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">The fact that the court member\u2019s husband was involved with investigating a crime against a person\u2019s property does not disqualify the member, just as \u201ca mere distaste for a crime does not disqualify a member.\u201d <em>United States v. Karnes, </em>1 MJ 92, 94 (CMA 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">The Supreme Court has not disqualified a juror based on implied bias. <em>See, e.g., Smith v. Phillips, </em>455 U.S. 209, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982); <em>Dennis v. United States, </em>339 U.S. 162, 172-73, 70 S.Ct. 519, 524, 94 L.Ed. 734 (1950) (Reed, J., concurring) (\u201cimplied bias\u201d may be applied in appropriate circumstances); <em>United States v. Wood, </em>299 U.S. 123, 57 S.Ct. 177, 81 L.Ed. 78 (1936). <em>Cf. Gonzales v. Thomas, </em>99 F.3d 978 (10th Cir.1996)(court did not find actual or implied bias because the juror\u2019s answers were honest and the juror\u2019s date rape was unlike the charged rape offense); <em>Burton v. Johnson, </em>948 F.2d 1150 (10th Cir.1991)(found implied bias). Justice O\u2019Connor wrote separately in <em>Phillips </em>to state that \u201cimplied bias\u201d might be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>applied \u201cin appropriate circumstances.\u201d 455 U.S. at 221, 102 S.Ct. at 948. She stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">Some examples might include a revelation that the juror is an actual employee of the prosecuting agency, that the juror is a close relative of one of the participants in the trial or the criminal transaction, or that the juror was a witness or somehow involved in the criminal transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 222,102 S.Ct. at 948-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in <em>Hunley v. Godinez, </em>975 F.2d 316, 319, 320 (1992), stated that presumed bias or implied bias should be reserved for \u201cextreme\u201d or \u201crare\u201d circumstances. This is not that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">The prosecutor asked Maj B if she knew that her husband was involved with this case. She said that she was unaware of any involvement. Indeed, there is no evidence in the record that he was involved with appellant\u2019s case. The majority points only to the argument of counsel, but that is not evidence. As the Supreme Court has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-9\">It [the challenge to the array] consists exclusively of counsel\u2019s statements, un-sworn and unsupported by any proof or offer of proof. The Government did not explicitly deny those statements. But it was under no necessity to do so. The burden was upon the petitioner as moving party \u201cto introduce, or to offer, distinct evidence in support of the motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-10\">Of itself this failure in tender of proof would require denial of the motion____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-11\"><em>Frazier v. United States, </em>335 U.S. 497, 503, 69 S.Ct. 201, 205, 93 L.Ed. 187 (1948) (citations omitted); <em>see Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). There is neither a proffer nor evidence in this case. It may be that Maj B\u2019s husband is the evidence custodian or would sign off in a perfunctory way on all investigations. <em>See United States v. Dinatale, </em>44 MJ 325 (1996)(denied challenge for cause against the President of the court-martial who had signed off on the report of Dinatale\u2019s mental responsibility board).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">In any event, upon being questioned, Maj B said that she would remain impartial, listen to the evidence, and follow the judge\u2019s instructions. Additionally, she stated that she had formed no opinion in this case. Defense counsel did not ask for a session under Article 39(a), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 839(a), to call the member\u2019s husband to explore his involvement with the case. Now, the majority assumes the worst, even though there is not the slightest appearance of unfairness based on the facts presented. <em>Cf. United States v. Dinatale, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">As I warned in <em>United States v. Dale, </em>42 MJ 384, 386-88 (1995), the Court seems to be establishing a <em>per se </em>rale against law enforcement personnel sitting as court members. Now a majority has extended that rale to spouses of law enforcement agents. Where goest thou? As Chief Judge Everett echoed in <em>United States v. Stuckey, </em>10 MJ 347, 359 (CMA 1981), quoted in <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>35 MJ 35, 44 (CMA 1992) (Cox, J., concurring with modest reservations), \u201c[a] military commander has responsibilities for investigation and for law enforcement that a magistrate does not possess.\u201d This same thought was echoed in <em>Lopez </em>by then-judge Cox, observing that a commander cannot be detached and neutral because of this role. <em>Id. </em>at 45. If we complete the majority\u2019s' circle of reasoning, it only follows that any connection with law enforcement will disqualify a servieemember, maybe even a commander, from serving as a court member.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-14\">The majority formulates a new standard to be applied retroactively. The opinion does not set forth a single standard to be applied in cases concerning challenges for cause. Maybe this issue is not susceptible to a single standard and we should have multiple standards. If that is the case, what other standards will we adopt in the future? This issue will continue to bedevil us. However, the issue could be avoided if trial judges would liberally grant challenges for cause. But they should not be required to grant them based on arguments versus evidence in a case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
