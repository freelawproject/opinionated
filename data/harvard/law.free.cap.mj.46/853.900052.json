Appellant does not appear to question his convictions on the other offenses before this court. We find each of them, as well, supported by legal and competent evidence beyond a reasonable doubt based upon our own independent analysis under Article 66, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b938-21\">SEFTON, Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b938-22\">Appellant was convicted, contrary to his pleas, by a court consisting of officer and enlisted members, of conspiracy to commit larceny, premeditated murder in the stabbing death of a fellow Marine, Corporal Brent Arthurs; and larceny of a trailer, motorcycle, and various motorcycling apparel in violation of Articles 81, 118, and 121, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 881 918, and 921 (1994) [hereinafter UCMJ]. Referred as a capital-murder case, the trial proceedings spanned the period between 14 September 1992 and 17 March 1993. Appellant was represented by both individual military counsel and detailed counsel at all sessions of the trial. Each of appellant\u2019s counsel professionally represented him throughout the proceeding. Following a hard-fought trial on the merits, appellant was convicted as charged, and sentenced to a dishonorable discharge, reduction to pay grade E-l, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for life. The convening authority approved the sentence as adjudged.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-23\">We have examined the record of trial, the eight assignments of error,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>ment\u2019s response thereto, and appellant\u2019s reply to the Government\u2019s response. We have also heard extensive and enlightening oral argument by counsel for appellant and the Government. Based upon our careful consideration of these matters, we conclude that the findings and sentence are correct in law and fact and that no error materially prejudicial to the substantial rights of the appellant was committed. We will discuss each of the assigned errors in turn, after first providing our ruling on the collateral matter of appellant\u2019s petition for a new trial under Article 73, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 873, and Rule for Courts-Martial 1210, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.) [hereinafter R.C.M.].</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">The Petition for a New Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">Based on our resolution of the matters raised by appellant in his briefs and in oral argument before this court, and following our careful consideration of the entire record of proceedings and allied papers, appellant\u2019s request for a new trial under Article 73, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 873 is without merit, and is therefore denied. Because of the extreme seriousness of the charged misconduct of which appellant stands convicted, and the resultant sentence to life imprisonment, we have interpreted as generously as possible those materials submitted in support of appellant\u2019s arguments, despite the objection in the brief by Government counsel. Those matters included an even more detailed attack on the credibility of Mr. Rod Englert, the Government\u2019s blood-spatter analyst, than was mustered at trial. We are mindful of the caution exercised by our Air Force brethren in the area of post-trial evidentiary considerations, and concur in their basic reasoning. <em>United States v. Toro, </em>34 M.J. 506, 521 (A.F.C.M.R.1991), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>37 M.J. 313 (C.M.A.1993) (where the Air Force Court declined to permit supplementation of the record to further contest the credibility of the witnesses at trial), but we specifically find that <em>no </em>fraud upon the court has been demonstrated. Even if the materials proffered by appellant during the appellate process had been available to the triers of fact below, they would not have \u201cprobably produce[d] a substantially more favorable result for the accused,\u201d and we likewise find that the fraud now alleged is not demonstrated as likely to have had \u201ca substantial contributing effect on a finding of guilty\u201d of the premeditated murder charge. R.C.M. 1210(f)(2)(C), (3). <em>See also Toro, </em>34 M.J. at 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-11\">We find that the great breadth of litigation emphasis on the luminol testing of the jeans does not by its bulk make it critical to the findings of guilty at issue here. That testing forms but a minuscule part of the case against appellant, a case which we find staggering in its scope and depth. Seldom do we find an accused in possession of goods belonging to a recently deceased person in circumstances similar to those found in this case. Appellant was riding the decedent\u2019s prized motorcycle, wearing the decedent\u2019s equally prized leather riding suit and helmet \u2014 which the decedent was not known to have willingly loaned to others. Appellant emerges, through the testimony of several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>witnesses of varying strengths and relationships to the overall picture, as an unrepentant murderer of an acquaintance who enjoyed recounting the act of homicide. In fact, he pointed out to more than one person that the jeans which form the center of the luminol controversy were worn by him as he killed Corporal Arthurs. While we feel compelled to deal <em>seriatim </em>with appellant\u2019s assignments of error, we are not moved by his attempts to shift our focus through a straw to ignore the larger realities of the evidence presented at trial against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">The Luminol Evidence (Assignments I and II)</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">The Government, in its ease-in-chief, proffered the testimony of Mr. Rod Englert as an expert in the area of blood-spatter pattern analysis. Additionally, R.A. Grimsbo, Ph.D., testified concerning his forensic analysis of the jeans seized from appellant and purportedly worn during the murder of Corporal Arthurs, Prosecution Exhibit 9 (hereinafter \u201cjeans\u201d), in conjunction with a request by Mr. Englert. The controversy in this regard centers on their joint use of luminol<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as the method of enhancing the visibility of otherwise invisible blood in order to attempt to determine if there was a telltale spatter pattern. Appellant contends before us both that luminol is not a widely accepted scientific process, and that spatters enhanced with luminol cannot form an appropriate basis for blood-spatter analysis. He is mistaken and, in fact, his theories fly in the face of evidence the defense team adduced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">The defense expert, Mr. Y. Parker Bell, who had extensive background and credentials in blood-spatter analysis, testified at length concerning luminol testing. Among his comments were' support for the longstanding use of the procedure, first noted by him in 1968-69 while at college; the fact that he has used the procedure in \u201chundreds\u201d of tests over the years; and that it is most useful where blood is not visible, perhaps in an instance where a crime laboratory has already reviewed the evidence using an alternative light source and detected nothing. Record at 2474.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mr. Bell reviewed the lu-minoled jeans, photographed during their testing by Englert and Grimsbo, and responded affirmatively to questions regarding whether they could be \u201cconsistent with a person wearing those jeans who had been in proximity to a stabbing,\u201d or whether they could be consistent with a great number of other things. Record at 2485. This nearly echoes the conclusions of the Government experts which appellant now decries.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-10\">We first note our agreement with the Government that appellant\u2019s attempt to rely on an appellate attack on the scientific reliability of luminol as a presumptive test for the presence of blood comes late. At trial he offered no objection to the testimony of Government witnesses on the scientific reliability of luminol and, indeed, as we illustrate in detail below, offered his own witnesses who supported the widespread use and acceptance of the technique he now questions. Whether we characterize the state of the case as a waiver or as a forfeiture under the analysis mandated by <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993), our conclusion is the same: as part of his trial strategy, appellant intentionally declined to object to the scientific basis for luminol use at trial. Since we find no error in the proceedings below, and certainly no \u201cplain error\u201d of constitutional dimension, no relief is warranted. <em>See generally Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770; Art. 59(a), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 859(a). Our rationale is explained in the analysis below.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">No one testified that proximity to a stabbing was the sole possible source of blood on appellant\u2019s jeans, but all testified that the patterns on the jeans were \u201cconsistent with\u201d such an event. Even CWOS Mills, who appeared for the defense below, could not state that the spatter pattern in question could not have been from a stabbing. Record at 2223. We note as well that the defense expert, Mr. Bell, referring to the jeans, spoke in terms of \u201cdifferent events to cause the blood to get on there.\u201d Record at 2485. He likewise acknowledged that the luminol-enhanced photographs (Prosecution Exhibits 12 \u2014 14) were consistent with what the Government expert earlier stated. In particular, he did not dispute the conclusions that the pocket <em>may </em>have had a bloody hand inserted in it; the right leg <em>may </em>have been in proximity to a stabbing, and that \u201cclassical blood spatter patterns\u201d were possibly viewable. <em>Id. </em>at 2487-88. Mr. Bell clarified his testimony on redirect examination by stating: \u201cI\u2019m saying that we cannot say that it is inconsistent with any other theory____ We would include a stabbing within the field of consistent possibilities ____\u201d Record at 2528.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">Further, the defense expert \u201ccriminalist,\u201d Ms. Carol Hunter, testified at length concerning her own use of luminol on the jeans, with results generally consistent with those attained by Dr. Grimsbo. <em>Id. </em>at 3028-52.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She also testified that the positive results obtained by both she and Dr. Grimsbo with luminol were only \u201cpresumptive\u201d for the presence of blood, and that an actual determination that blood was present could be made only following a \u201cconfirmatory\u201d test. <em>Id. </em>at 3046.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-9\">We are therefore unable to ascertain a rational basis of support for the great weight accorded by appellant to the possible \u201cfalse positive\u201d associated with luminol. Luminol was accepted by all experts who appeared at trial, and the scientific community as a whole, as a viable, routinely used, and extremely sensitive \u201cpresumptive\u201d test for the presence of blood. In this case, not only luminol, but also a second testing process using phenolphthalein, another accepted test for the presence of blood, demonstrated a presumptive presence which corroborated the luminol findings in question by appellant. Record at 2173-75; Paul C. Giannelli &amp; Edward J. Imwinkelried, Scientific Evidence, Volume 1, 532 (2d ed.1993). Beyond the fact that these two presumptive tests indicated the likely presence of blood, the record reflects statements by appellant which also corroborate that fact. Record at 1078 (testimony of Private Sprenger) and 1290-92 (testimony of Lance Corporal Sheldon).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-17\">Were the positive luminol and phenolphthalein presumptive tests alone in evidence, perhaps appellant\u2019s argument would be more persuasive. Unfortunately for appellant\u2019s position, one of the commonly accepted confirmatory tests, the \u201ccrossover electrophoresis\u201d test, was done by Dr. Grims-bo, and it ultimately determined human blood to be present on the jeans. Dr. Grimsbo was, however, unable to <em>farther </em>specify the type, or match it to a particular human source. <em>Id. </em>at 2173-75. <em>See also </em>Giannelli &amp; Imwinkelried, <em>supra, </em>at 533-35 (stating that electrophoresis is an accepted confirmatory test, and further indicating that qualified expert testimony that blood is from a human source is generally judicially admissible). We note also that CW03 Mills, called by the defense in its case-in-ehief, also indicated that the crossover electrophoresis test is a valid and widely accepted confirmatory test for the presence of human blood. Record at 2235-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>We remain convinced that even absent <em>any </em>luminol evidence from appellant or the Government \u2014 sufficient foundational bases for the admissibility of the jeans are evident under appropriate analyses under Mil. R. Evid. 401-403, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.). We likewise find no <em>destruction </em>of the jeans to any significant extent which precluded appellant\u2019s experts from either appropriate review of Government testing or independent testing in their own right. If that were to be found, it would trigger relief under the theory propounded by appellant arising from the dicta found in <em>United States v. Garries, </em>22 M.J. 288, 293 n. 6 (C.M.A.1986). We concur in the military judge\u2019s considered resolution of these issues below based on our own independent analysis of the evidence, and find no basis in fact or law to exclude the evidence of luminol testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">We are not faced with the same dilemma which confronted the court in <em>United States v. Nimmer, </em>43 M.J. 252 (1995), as it contemplated the effect of <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786,125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), on admissibility of the testing of a hair follicle for evidence of cocaine use as a matter of scientific evidence in military cases \u2014 a novel scientific issue. <em>See also United States v. St. Jean, </em>45 M.J. 435, 444 (1996), <em>and United States v. Youngberg, </em>43 M.J. 379 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\"><em>Daubert </em>is interpreted by our superior court as a refinement on its earlier pronouncement in <em>United States v. Gipson, </em>24 M.J. 246 (C.M.A.1987), that the older <em>Frye </em>Rule of admissibility of scientific evidence was supplanted in favor of a determination of \u201cscientific validity\u201d as the measure of eviden-tiary reliability. <em>Nimmer, </em>43 M.J. at 256-57. <em>See Frye v. United States, </em>54 App. D.C. 46, 293 F. 1013 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">Luminol testing is simply not a new or novel scientific evidentiary process, and has been accepted by the single military appellate court to consider it \u2014 even under a post-<em>Daubert </em>analysis. <em>United States v. Hill, </em>41 M.J. 596, 600-01 (Army Ct.Crim.App.1994). We believe that the trial judge in this instance performed a correct analysis under the Military Rules of Evidence and the existing precedent of our superior court. To adopt appellant\u2019s suggestion that <em>Nimmer </em>requires an automatic reversal for consideration under <em>Daubert </em>criteria seems beyond the pale of reason. We believe, as the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals recently said, that: \u201c[T]he judge\u2019s first responsibility is to filter from the triers of fact \u2018junk science.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Bush, </em>44 M.J. 646, 651-52 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App.l996)(concerning a <em>Daubert </em>analysis of a similar issue to that confronting the <em>Nimmer </em>court). We believe the trial judge effectively performed this function, and upon review find his actions should remain undisturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">Although we understand that <em>Nimmer </em>mandates a remand in those cases still in the appellate chain where a novel scientific evi-dentiary situation was encountered at trial, we find that the military judge applied the appropriate balancing under Mil. R. Evid. 401-403 in admitting the testimony. There was simply nothing novel involved here. Notwithstanding our firm belief in the rulings below, we are also cognizant of the fact that appellant never once questioned the validity of the luminol process as a scientific process. He shall not now be heard to complain of a failure to apply <em>Daubert </em>from the position he now occupies.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">We understand that appellant questions specifically the use of luminol as a basis for Mr. Englert\u2019s blood-spatter analysis, but find no evidence that would support the exclusion of that testimony since both presumptive tests and the confirmatory test mentioned above indicated the presence of human blood in the areas tested on the jeans. While the defense experts couched their opinions differently, and much effort was devoted to the true terminal velocity of blood droplets, we find no logical disconnect in considering the evidence presented by Mr. Englert. He was qualified only as a blood-spatter expert, and did not cross the line into analysis of the nature of the substance highlighted by lumi-nol. He was also corroborated by the testing and testimony of the \u201ccriminalists,\u201d and despite all that may have been said about him, Mr. Englert\u2019s unquestioned background and qualifications in the area about which he testified remain. In short, no showing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>novelty in the scientific evidence being offered was made, and no more stringent analysis by the trial court was mandated or appropriate. We believe the upshot of Mr. Englert\u2019s testimony to be as the Government proffered in its reply brief to this court: \u201cEnglert\u2019s testimony, reduced to its simplest terms, was that the results of his test and analysis of spots on appellant\u2019s jeans was consistent with appellant\u2019s statement that he stabbed Arthurs to death. Englert\u2019s testimony was circumstantial evidence that tended to corroborate appellant\u2019s admissions.\u201d Government Brief at 9-10 n. 7. By admissions, we mean both his actions in showing the jeans to two different persons, and his statements made during questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">We further note that blood-spatter analysis is admissible scientific evidence in military jurisprudence. <em>United States v. Mustafa, </em>22 M.J. 165, 168 (C.M.A.1986). Thus, if the <em>Mustafa </em>admissibility criteria are met, the only remaining issue is that of the weight given the evidence, not its admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>an element of novelty in this instance, we find no utility in a remand on this matter for a further eviden-tiary hearing and rulings of law. The blood-spatter analysis in question was but a small part of an overwhelming array of physical and other evidence establishing appellant\u2019s guilt of the premeditated murder<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> beyond a reasonable doubt, and both it and the luminol testing served only to corroborate a small portion of appellant\u2019s several admissions of guilt. <em>See, e.g., </em>Record at 1291 (Lcpl Sheldon\u2019s testimony about being shown what became of the jeans, along with appellant\u2019s statements that he had killed Arthurs and that the pants had his blood on them).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">We are ultimately convinced that the admission of the luminol test results here, and the subsequent use of them to form the basis of Mr. Englert\u2019s blood-spatter analysis was not error. Further, even if error in the admission is found, any such error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); <em>see also United States v. Miller, </em>46 M.J. 63 (1997)(harmless error in the context of an indecent acts case). The luminol issue is, as we have stated earlier, only a very small part of a very large body of overwhelming evidence of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">The Nexus Between Prosecution Exhibit 9 and Appellant (Assignment III)</p>\n<p id=\"b943-12\">Appellant asserts that the Government failed to prove a nexus between him and the jeans ultimately introduced at trial as P.E. 9. First, we believe appellant\u2019s untimely assertions of the lack of a nexus to him are inconsistent with the posture of the case before us. He offered no objection when the military judge offered him the opportunity to do so early in the proceedings when the exhibit was identified and authenticated by Private Sprenger. Record at 1079; <em>see also </em>Mil. R. Evid. 103(a)(1). The evidence clearly supports the fact that these pants were seized with appellant\u2019s consent as one of more than 40 evidentiary items at the home of his relatives in the State of Washington contemporaneous with his arrest. Second, when admitted at trial, evidence was also presented that appellant had stated they were the jeans he wore at the time of the murder of Corporal Arthurs. <em>Id. </em>at 1078. The jeans corroborated this testimony, and, accordingly, need not be independently admissible. <em>See </em>Mil. R. Evid. 104(a), 304(g); <em>United States v. Duvall, </em>44 M.J. 501 (A.F.Ct. Crim.App.1996). Thus, even if we did not determine any objection to them relevance was waived, we find that sufficient foundational relevance \u2014 both legal and factual \u2014 existed to sustain their admission as evidence in this case. Appellant\u2019s strategy of attempting to demonstrate that the jeans from which he could not dissociate himself might have somehow been contaminated simply fails. The assigned error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-13\">Destruction of Evidence by Agents of the Government (Assignments IY and V)</p>\n<p id=\"b943-15\">A significant amount of time and effort at both the trial and on appeal has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>devoted to what appellant terms the <em>\u201cGar-ries\u201d </em>issues. <em>United States v. Garries </em>22 M.J. 288, 293 at n. 6 (C.M.A.1986). The controversy here centers not on the holding in <em>Games, </em>but on the content of footnote 6 to the opinion regarding a future situation in which the testing in question had been done in a military laboratory without notice to the defense. <em>See </em>Appellate Exhibit LXXXI. During the pendency of testing by the United States Army Criminal Investigative Laboratory (USACIL), trial defense counsel notified the USACIL that evidence should neither be completely consumed nor destroyed by testing without the opportunity either for a defense expert to participate in the testing, or the segregation of enough of the sample involved to permit independent defense evaluation. Counsel for appellant did not provide this notification to trial counsel or any other command official when it was submitted to the USACIL.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> USA-CIL testing of all proffered items seized from appellant yielded no scientific evidence (though we note that different testing procedures were used there than were later used by the Government and defense experts, as discussed below).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Following the negative evaluation of the jeans for evidence of blood in the fabric by the USACIL, and during the actual trial proceedings, the Government submitted the exhibit for further testing, accomplished by Dr. Grimsbo. Dr. Grimsbo found human blood in the fabric of the jeans. In the opinion of Mr. Englert, the spatter patterns evident on the jeans <em>were consistent with </em>blood spatters and with a stabbing event. Dr. Grimsbo testified that he found evidence of human blood, but could not confirm the type as being either that of the victim or appellant. Record at 2175.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">The testing done by Dr. Grimsbo differed from that done by the USACIL, in that he used luminol testing to luminesce the clothing,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and recorded the results with time-lapse photography, which was also made part of the Record. Prosecution Exhibits 12,13, and 14. Record at 2171-75. This differed from the USACIL testing, which consisted of visual observation of the clothing and subjection of it to an \u201calternative light source.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Record at 2210-11. \u2022 No chemical or microscopic screening tests were performed by USACIL personnel, and no obvious stains were noted then. <em>Id. </em>at 2234, 2243-44. CW03 Mills indicated, in response to a question by Trial Counsel, that his testimony was \u201cbased entirely\u201d on his confidence in the alternative light source \u201crevealing the presence of all types of body fluid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2249.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">Luminoling of material can establish unequivocally that no blood is present. Giannelli &amp; Imwinkelried, <em>supra, </em>at 532. The test is based on the catalytic activity of the heme in hemoglobin, which triggers an oxidation reaction leading to a color change. <em>Id.; </em>Record at 2475 (testimony by the defense expert, v. Parker Bell). Luminol is one of the most common tests of this type. <em>Id. </em>Once the \u201cpresumptive\u201d presence of blood is indicated, the next step in determining the actual nature of the substance is through use of a \u201cconfirmatory\u201d test to discern whether the substance is actually blood, and, if so, human blood in particular. Professors Giannelli and Imwinkelried indicate that among the most popular methods is the \u201cTakayama\u201d crystal test, which is based on a reaction between the crystal and the heme portion of the red blood cell. <em>Id. </em>at 533. The crystal confirmatory tests are less sensitive than the catalytic tests, but are more specific \u2014 with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>false positive not generally encountered. <em>Id. </em>These authors further observe that testimony from medical technologists \u201cabout preliminary [\u201cpresumptive\u201d] tests, confirmatory tests, <em>or a combination of such tests </em>... is routinely admissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">We are left with the fact that, for whatever reason, appellant\u2019s trial defense counsel chose not to notify the prosecution team of their <em>Garries </em>request to the USACIL, which might leave open the question of induced or invited error. <em>United States v. Grunden, </em>2 M.J. 116, 124-25 (C.M.A.1977). We find this lack of notice to be irrelevant to our resolution of this matter, however, since we conclude that the testing by Dr. Grimsbo did not destroy or degrade the available evidentiary materials in the jeans to any significant extent. The defense expert, Ms. Hunter, testified that she was able to test the jeans, and that, in fact, she got positive reactions for blood on the exhibit. Her testimony was far less convoluted to us as it appears to have been to appellant, in that she testified not that the luminol testing had either destroyed or significantly altered the substances on the jeans, but that her \u201ccontrol\u201d testing gave results which did not permit her to make a positive identification of any specific description of the blood found by her. Further, and in our opinion of greater importance, is the fact that luminol testing has been shown to have no effect on a subsequent phenophtalein test such as the one noted as the later confirmatory testing procedure used in this case. Dale. L. Laux, M.S., <em>Effects of Luminol on the Subsequent Analysis of Bloodstains, </em>36 J. Forensic Sci. 1512,1513 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">We are struck by the fact that the evil sought to be remedied in <em>Garries </em>situations is the consumption of destructible evidence without sufficient opportunity for independent defense expert evaluation. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>some degradation from the luminol testing as it relates to further defense-sponsored testing, the contemporaneous recordation of the luminescence through photography \u2014 which remained available at all times for independent evaluation by defense experts \u2014 appears to detract from any claim that an adequate opportunity for scientific evaluation by the defense was foreclosed. Appellant\u2019s expert was provided the jeans, and was able to test the results proffered by Government experts and evaluate their recorded previous test results as well. Both Government and defense expert evidence was admitted as matters of legal relevance, and both were considered by the trier-of-fact in arriving at their conclusions. Appellant seemed to argue at trial that <em>Garries </em>requires a lock-step process of notice to the defense, the failure of which will invalidate any subsequent testing, even where no harm befell the evidence or the defense was not otherwise disadvantaged. Record at 1452-56; <em>Games, </em>22 M.J. at 290-93. We are unwilling to impose such a rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">Factual Insufficiency of Evidence on the Premeditated Murder Charge (Assignment VI)</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">In exercising our statutory obligation under Article 66(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866(c), we are convinced of appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on not only the premeditated murder charge, but also on all other charges before the court. We arrive at our conclusion by testing both the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">The test for legal sufficiency is \u201cwhether, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a reasonable factfinder could have found all the essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Turner, </em>25 M.J. 324 (C.M.A.1987) (citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). When applying this test we are \u201cbound to draw every reasonable inference from the evidence of record in favor of the prosecution.\u201d <em>United States v. McGinty, </em>38 M.J. 131, 132 (C.M.A.1993)(quoting <em>United States v. Blocker, </em>32 M.J. 281, 284 (C.M.A.1991)). In appellant\u2019s case, we so find.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">The test for factual sufficiency is \u201cwhether, after weighing the evidence in the record of trial and making allowances for not having personally observed the witnesses, the members of ... [this court] are themselves convinced of the accused\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>25 M.J. at 325.

We are cognizant that his assigned role in the case had been completed prior to the time of his dialogue with the trial counsel<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> sometime in the latter part of December, 1992. At that time, it appears from the record that he recommended to trial counsel that appellant\u2019s clothing be tested for the presence of blood by Mr. Englert. Our concern is specifically that, despite what might have been a very neutral and well-meaning motivation to provide possible resource information to assist in the case, provision of information solely to the assigned prosecutor, with no simultaneous, or even serial, notification to the defense, makes the act <em>appear, </em>at least, as one of an impermissible, adjunct trial counsel. R.C.M. 405(d); Art. 27(a)(2), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 827(a)(2). We must apply a two-part test here, as articulated by the Court of Military Appeals (now the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces) in <em>United States v. Payne, </em>3 M.J. 354 (C.M.A.1977). We first must determine whether a departure from the statutory role occurred, and, if so, if it resulted in prejudice to appellant. <em>Id. </em>at 357. We find that the actions complained of do constitute a departure from a permissible role, and are inconsistent with the quasi-judicial obligations of the pretrial investigating officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">We must next test the error for prejudice to appellant. We note that the error could not have worked any mischief in the referral process, and we are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that no prejudice to the substantial rights of the accused arose in the trial of the ease because of it. Trial counsel is not alleged to have further interacted with the pretrial investigating officer beyond the interaction described above, and we cannot speculate as to any further departure from the statutory roles of either.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">Although we find no prejudice warranting relief in this instance because of the overwhelming evidence of guilt in the record, even without any development of this issue following the discussion in question, those who act as pretrial investigating officers under Article 32, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 832, would do well to ensure that they remain scrupulously attentive to the requirement that they play no subsequent role in the administration of the case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">Refusal by the Military Judge to Suppress Pretrial Statements (Assignment VIII)</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">The final assignment of error submitted to us by appellant\u2019s counsel<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> alleges error in the refusal by the military judge to suppress the pretrial statements made to Detectives S\u00edmica and Gordon of the San Diego Sheriffs Department, for all purposes, including impeachment, on the grounds that they were involuntary. While the Govern-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>merit\u2019s argument that the issue was waived by the failure of appellant to take the stand at trial, we will evaluate this issue of importance to'appellant on its merits. <em>See </em>Government Brief at 31-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Our review of the evidence available on this issue leads us to several conclusions. First, we find that appellant was indeed in a \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d situation as defined in <em>Miranda-Tempia. Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966); <em>United States v. Tempia, </em>16 C.M.A. 629, 37 C.M.R. 249, 1967 WL 4235 (1967). He had been arrested by two San Diego County Detectives near his mother\u2019s home in the vicinity of Seattle, Washington, and warned of his right to remain silent and to consult with an attorney. He initially spoke with the detectives, but after a break indicated a desire to speak with an attorney. The dialogue continued however, despite the mandate of the Supreme Court that it cease under these circumstances. <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">We find that, confronted with this scenario, and upon an appropriate motion <em>in limine </em>proffered by trial defense counsel, the military judge ruled that all statements taken following the request for counsel would be inadmissible in the Government\u2019s case on the merits. He concurrently ruled, as well, that the statements would be admissible as impeachment if the accused testified. We find his decision to be fully consistent with Mil. R. Evid. 304(b)(1), <em>Harris v. New York, </em>401 U.S. 222, 91 S.Ct. 643, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971), and <em>United States v. Williams, </em>23 M.J. 362 (C.M.A.1987). We find no evidence that the free and rational choice of appellant was somehow overborne, or that the statements in question were the product of coercion or other unlawful influence. We specifically find that the trustworthiness of the statements in question has not been brought into question. <em>See Mincey v. Arizona, </em>437 U.S. 385, 98 S.Ct. 2408, 57 L.Ed.2d 290 (1978). Although we are generally inclined to give deference to the essential findings of the military judge in this area, we are not bound by them. Art. 66, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866(c); <em>United States v. Bubonics, </em>40 M.J. 734, 738 (N.M.C.M.R.1994)(citing <em>United States v. Jones, </em>34 M.J. 899, 905 (N.M.C.M.R.1992)). We have conducted a <em>de novo </em>review, and conclude that the military judge\u2019s trial ruling concerning admissibility of appellant\u2019s pretrial statements as impeachment evidence was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">Accordingly, the findings of guilty and the sentence, as approved on review below, are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">Senior Judge McLAUGHLIN and Judge WYNNE concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b938-14\">.

Luminol is a compound 3 aminophthalhy-draide (5-amino 2,3-dihydrophthalazine 1, 4 dione), which was first synthesized in the early twentieth century. \u25a0 It\u2019s name, luminol, means \"producer of light,\" which aptly describes what occurs if it is sprayed, in a reagent mixture, on areas where occult blood (among other substances) is present. The areas glow with a blue light for 10-15 minutes following spraying, and are generally photographed with time-lapse photography to record the reaction. R.R.J.

Luminol, as described in an earlier footnote, is considered a \u201cpresumptive\u201d test for the presence of blood. \u2014 that is a test which determines only that blood (human or animal) <em>may </em>be present, and which must be confirmed as to whether, if blood, it is human or animal, by other testing.
