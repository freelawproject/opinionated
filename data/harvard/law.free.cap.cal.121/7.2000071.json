The motion for new trial was made upon several grounds, including that of the insufficiency of the evidence to sustain the findings; and the order granting the motion is general in terms. The respondent invokes the well-settled doctrine of this court that where a new trial is asked for on several grounds, and is granted, and the record does not disclose for which one of the reasons it was granted, the order will not be reversed if it could have been properly granted upon any one of the grounds assigned. The case is within this rule, and the action of the court cannot, therefore, he reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Garoutte, J., and Harrison, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
