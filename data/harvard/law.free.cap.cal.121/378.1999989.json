(Citing <em>Wittmeier\u2019s Estate, </em>118 Cal. 255.)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">It was there expressly held that \u201cappeals in probate proceedings lie only from such orders and decrees as are enumerated in. section 963, subdivision 3, of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d That the order here appealed from is not enumerated among the appealable orders there provided for is clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">This Uisposition of the appeal is the less to be regretted, since, when the court again settles the administrator\u2019s account, if he should then feel aggrieved, he can appeal from the order then made settling it.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">We advise that the appeal be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">Chipman, C., and Belcher, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the appeal is dismissed.
