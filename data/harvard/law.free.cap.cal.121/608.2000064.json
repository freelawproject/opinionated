Fair, deceased, upon a mortgage of three hundred thousand dollars executed by said Fair to said trustees. The mortgage was paid by plaintiffs after the assessment of the taxes thereupon for 1895. The taxes were subsequently levied, and were paid by plaintiffs, together with a penalty of four hundred and seventy-two dollars and fifty cents added April 13, 1896. The amount of taxes and penalty paid was six thousand seven hundred and seventy-two dollars and forty-eight cents, for which sum, with legal interest from the date of payment, judgment, was rendered in favor of the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b728-10\">Aylett R.

We are now asked to overrule the decision then made, but, whether that decismn was right or wrong, it has been since acted upon, and was acted upon by the parties to this contro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>versy, and we consider that it is protected by the rule of <em>stare decisis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\"><em>J </em>udgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Temple, J., dissented.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
