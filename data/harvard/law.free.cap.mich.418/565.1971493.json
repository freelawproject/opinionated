Jarosz, then 64 years of age, was injured while riding in a motor vehicle that was struck broadside. His injuries disabled him from working as a manager for Borman Foods where he had been paid $285 per week. As a result, DAIIE, his no-fault insurer, began paying him work-loss benefits under \u00a7 3107 of the no-fault act, correctly computed at 85% of his $285 weekly salary. On November 1, 1977, after turning 65 years of age, Mr. Jarosz began mandatory retirement pursuant to company policy. At about the same time, he applied for and began receiving social security retirement benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>of $455.20 per month, the amount to which he was entitled as an unemployed retiree.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">On March 25, 1978, after learning of Mr. Jarosz\u2019s retirement, DAIIE terminated the payment of work-loss benefits. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Jarosz furnished the insurance company with proof that, but for the accident, he would have gone to work for Supreme Steel Company on November 1, 1977, earning $200 per week. DAIIE therefore resumed the payment of work-loss benefits, retroactive to March 26, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">In September, 1978, the insurer learned that Mr. Jarosz was receiving the full social security benefits for a retiree who has no work-related income. Ordinarily, retirees over 65 years of age may work full-time and receive social security retirement benefits; however, as wages increase, benefits are reduced according to a statutory formula. The formula calls for the deduction of $1 for every $2 earned over a specified amount. See 42 USC 403(b); 20 CFR 404.401-404.467. Upon learning that Mr. Jarosz was receiving social security benefits computed for a person who was unemployed, DAIIE took the position that it was entitled to deduct from the no-fault work-loss benefits the amount by which the social security benefits would have been reduced had appellant been earning $200 a week and collecting social security benefits. Mr. Jarosz believed that no deduction was permissible and protested the insurance company\u2019s deduction of work-loss benefits. When the dispute could not be resolved amicably, Mr. Jarosz filed suit in the circuit court. In May, 1979, DAIIE tendered a check to appellant for an amount which represented a deduction for asserted overpayment of work-loss benefits. Appellant returned the check uncashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Appellant moved for summary judgment pursuant to GCR 1963, 117.2(3), claiming that there was no genuine issue concerning the material fact that DAIIE was not entitled to deduct any amount from no-fault benefits upon the basis of the amount of social security benefits he was entitled to receive. The trial court denied the motion by letter, and on March 13, 1980, granted the defendant\u2019s corresponding motion for summary judgment, declaring:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">\"[T]he defendant can take into account social security benefits received by plaintiff to the extent that plaintiff is made whole, as it is the intent of the law to put the injured party in the same position that he would have been had there been no injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Mr. Jarosz appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">In the Court of Appeals and before this Court, the insurer argued that this case turns upon the correct interpretation and application of \u00a7 3107 which defines the meaning of \"work loss\u201d and mandates the payment of no-fault work-loss benefits. According to appellee, a correct computation of Mr. Jarosz\u2019s \"loss of income\u201d for purposes of determining the amount of work-loss benefits due under \u00a7 3107 would reveal that his income actually increased as a result of the accident. This is so, appellee argues, because the combination of <em>full </em>social security benefits and no-fault work-loss benefits computed on the basis of a loss of $200 per week salary is greater than the total of $200 per week salary and the <em>reduced </em>social security benefits for a working retiree, which is what he would have received had he not been injured and had been working at Supreme Steel.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">Since, according to DAIIE, one of the purposes of the no-fault act is to restore an injured party to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>the position in which he would have been had he not been injured, but no better position, the no-fault work-loss benefits due under \u00a7 3107 should be reduced to an amount which, when taken together with the full social security benefits appellant is receiving, would restore him to the position in which he would have been had there been no accident. DAIIE claims that the financial effect upon Mr. Jarosz of reducing the no-fault benefits is identical to the result that would obtain had appellant not been injured and had been receiving social security benefits in the reduced amount to which he would have been entitled if he had earned wages of $200 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The Court of Appeals preferred to rest its analysis and decision upon \u00a7 3109(1), but concluded that the insurer\u2019s proposed result was correct: DAIIE was entitled under \u00a7 3109(1) to subtract from the no-fault work-loss benefits otherwise due an amount equal to the portion of social security benefits representing the differential described above because that amount duplicated the no-fault work-loss benefits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">We granted appellant\u2019s application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Like the Court of Appeals, we think this litigation is correctly analyzed under \u00a7 3109(1) of the no-fault act and not \u00a7 3107. Nevertheless, in Part III, we will address DAIIE\u2019s \u00a7 3107 theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">While, we have not considered a case involving facts precisely duplicating those presented by this case, resolution of the legal problem, as we per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>ceive it, does not require us to navigate entirely uncharted waters. We have considered the application of \u00a7 3109(1) in other factual settings,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and in each case we have been required, as we are here, to determine whether governmental benefits of various kinds must be deducted from no-fault personal protection income benefits otherwise due. To repeat, \u00a7 3109(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-6\">\"Benefits provided or required to be provided under the laws of any state or the federal government shall be subtracted from the personal protection insurance benefits otherwise payable for the injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">The specific question we are required to decide in this case is whether the social security old-age benefits Mr. Jarosz is receiving are the kind of governmental benefits the Legislature intended to be subtracted from no-fault benefits. In answering that question, we take this occasion to delineate a standard or test by which such benefits may be identified in future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">Certainly not <em>all </em>\"[b]enefits provided or required to be provided under the laws of any state or the federal government\u201d must be subtracted from no-fault personal protection insurance benefits otherwise due. Some governmental benefits bear no relationship whatever to no-fault benefits or to the reason no-fault benefits are paid. Benefits bearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>no such relationship are not subject to setoff. Our task is to find a formula by which governmental benefits which are required to be set off under \u00a7 3109(1) can be distinguished from those which are not. The task was begun in <em>O\u2019Donnell v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>404 Mich 524; 273 NW2d 829 (1979). We agree with the Court of Appeals and the parties before us today that <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>established the analytical framework from which the standard we seek may be derived. In <em>O\u2019Donnell, </em>as in this case, we were confronted with claims that a setoff of governmental benefits against no-fault benefits violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the state and federal constitutions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>O\u2019Donnell, </em>social security survivors\u2019 benefits were involved; here, old-age retirement benefits are involved. We held that social security survivors\u2019 benefits were properly deductible from no-fault survivors\u2019 benefits under \u00a7 3109(1). We were led to that conclusion by a two-step analytical approach: first, we determined whether social security survivors\u2019 benefits were the kind of \"[bjenefits provided or required to be provided under the laws of any state or the federal government\u201d that the Legislature declared must be subtracted from no-fault benefits under \u00a7 3109(1). Second, having decided that they were, we determined whether the legislatively mandated subtraction was constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">In making the first determination in <em>O\u2019Donnell, </em>p 544, we observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-7\">\"[t]he history of \u00a7 3109(1) indicates that the Legislature\u2019s intent was to require a setoff of those government benefits that duplicated the no-fault benefits payable because of the accident and thereby reduce or contain the cost of basic insurance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>It was plain, we thought, that survivors\u2019 benefits under the federal Social Security Act served substantially the same purpose as no-fault insurance survivors\u2019 benefits. Both were meant to compensate persons dependent on the decedent-wage earner by affording them protection from the economic hardship caused by the loss of the wage earner\u2019s support. <em>Id., </em>pp 545-546. In addition, they were paid as a result of the decedent\u2019s fatal accident. It was clear that the provisions of both the no-fault and the social security plans specifically entitled the beneficiaries to payment of benefits for the same purpose upon the happening of the same event. The social security benefits were duplicative of the no-fault survivors\u2019 benefits and thus clearly were subject to setoff under \u00a7 3109(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The second issue in <em>O\u2019Donnell, </em>the constitutionality of \u00a7 3109(1), resulted in a determination of the law\u2019s validity because, we concluded, the legislative purpose of reducing or containing the cost of no-fault insurance was a matter of legitimate governmental interest and the means chosen, a setoff of duplicate government benefits, was rationally related to that goal. This constitutional standard, that legislation enacted pursuant to the police power bear a rational relationship to a permissible legislative objective, is essentially the same for due process and equal protection analyses. <em>Shavers v Attorney General, </em>402 Mich 554, 612-613; 267 NW2d 72 (1978). Measured against this requirement, we held the setoff of social security survivors\u2019 benefits against no-fault survivors\u2019 benefits to be constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Our decision in <em>O\u2019Donnell, </em>which we specifically confined to its own facts,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provided, therefore, a framework for determining the kinds of govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>mental benefits which must be subtracted from no-fault benefits under \u00a7 3109(1), but did not purport to announce a specific standard or test for application to other kinds of governmental benefits. While our vision down the litigation tunnel is not limitless, we will delineate that standard today in order to enable bench, bar, insurers, and our citizens to predict with greater certainty the financial effect of coordinated no-fault benefits under \u00a7 3109(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Despite the self-limiting reach of the decision announced in <em>O\u2019Donnell, </em>we have cited it as authority for the method by which it is to be determined whether other governmental benefits are within the ambit of \u00a7 3109(1).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The parties in this case agree as to the application of <em>O\u2019Donnell\u2019s </em>very generalized standard; they disagree about how it is to be particularized for their case.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Appellant argues that the correct application of \u00a7 3109(1) will result in a subtraction of governmental benefits from no-fault benefits when two threshold requirements are met: 1) the state or federal benefits are provided or required to be provided \"as a result of the same accident\u201d, and 2) they \"duplicate in varying degrees the no-fault benefits due\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">DAIIE, on the other hand, contends that the proper analysis requires only the one-step determination whether the state or federal benefits duplicate the no-fault benefits and argues that in <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>the fact that the social security benefits and no-fault benefits were paid on account of the same accident was not the application of a separate criterion, but only an indication that the benefits were duplicative.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> DAIIE declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>\"Contrary to the assertions of plaintiff, it is duplication of benefits, not the event which triggers payment, which is the focus of the analysis of the social security benefits in <em>O\u2019Donnell. </em>This Court repeatedly emphasized that \u00a7 3109(1) was intended to avoid <em>duplication </em>of benefits and thus to enable insurers to keep premiums low without harm to beneficiaries. <em>O\u2019Donnell, supra, </em>pp 544-546, 547-549. The fact that the benefits at issue in <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>were paid as a result of the same accident which resulted in payment of PIP benefits is nothing more than an indication that the benefits are duplicative. It is <em>not </em>a separate criterion for application of \u00a7 3109(1).\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">We agree with DAIIE\u2019s response that the keystone of the correct analysis is whether the benefits are duplicative. However, to complete the analysis, more is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">We conclude that the correct test is: state or federal benefits \"provided or required to be provided\u201d must be deducted from no-fault benefits under \u00a7 3109(1) if they:</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">1) Serve the same purpose as the no-fault benefits,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">2) Are provided or are required to be provided as a result of the same accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Some confusion may have been engendered by two statements we made in <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>which at first reading may appear to conflict. The first statement comports with the two-step formulation proposed by appellant, and the second more nearly replicates the test we have announced today.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">In <em>O\u2019Donnell, </em>p 538, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-7\">\"We conclude that \u00a7 3109(1) does require a setoff of these government benefits but is not arbitrary because the benefits are paid as a result of the same accident and duplicate in varying degrees the no-fault benefits otherwise due.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">However, we also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-9\">\"The survivors\u2019 benefits received pursuant to \u00a7 202 of the Social Security Act were likewise paid as a result of the decedent\u2019s fatal accident and served substantially the same purpose as the no-fault benefits\u201d. <em>Id., </em>p 545.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">In isolating the first of the foregoing statements as a correct statement of the test for application of \u00a7 3109(1) in other governmental benefit cases, the appellant was mistaken. That statement was concerned with the issue of the constitutionality of the setoff of social security survivors\u2019 benefits against no-fault survivors\u2019 benefits and not with establishing a standard for determining whether the social security benefits in <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>fell within the scope of \u00a7 3109(1), as the second statement was. In <em>O\u2019Donnell, </em>which was explicitly limited to its facts, the duplicative <em>nature </em>of social security survivors\u2019 benefits and no-fault survivors\u2019 benefits was obvious. We were not primarily concerned, in the first of the quoted statements concerning constitutionality, with enunciating a test for determining the range of comparable benefits covered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>by \u00a7 3109(1). The test we have formulated today follows, therefore, the analysis we employed in <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>in the second statement quoted above and applied in subsequent cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-6\">\"In the leading case concerning \u00a7 3109(1), <em>O\u2019Donnell v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>404 Mich 524; 273 NW2d 829 (1979) * * * [w]e observed that government benefits provided as a result of the same accident for which no-fault benefits are also payable, and which serve the same purpose as no-fault benefits, are within the scope of \u00a7 3109(1)\u201d. <em>LeBlanc v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>410 Mich 173, 190; 301 NW2d 775 (1981). See <em>O\u2019Donnell, </em>p 545.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">See also <em>Citizens Ins Co of America v Tuttle, </em>411 Mich 536, 551, fn 9; 309 NW2d 174 (1981); <em>Mathis v Interstate Motor Freight System, </em>408 Mich 164, 187, fn 7; 289 NW2d 708 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">At the risk of belaboring the point, still another word might be in order to further clarify the standard we announce today and, in the process, to bring a heightened measure of certainty and predictability to the application of this difficult area of no-fault law.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">In examining our decisions in <em>O\u2019Donnell, Mathis, </em>and <em>LeBlanc, </em>it appears that we may have used the word \"duplicate\u201d, and its adjectival form duplicative, somewhat imprecisely in an effort to characterize the kind of governmental benefits that must be subtracted from no-fault benefits under \u00a7 3109(1). We have said, for example, that such benefits are \"paid as a result of the same accident <em>and </em>duplicate in varying degrees the no-fault benefits otherwise due\u201d. <em>Mathis, supra. </em>Actually, it is more accurate to conceptualize duplicate benefits as those which satisfy both elements of today\u2019s two-pronged test: 1) benefits which serve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>the same purpose as no-fault benefits, and 2) benefits which are provided or required to be provided as a result of the same accident. If both criteria are met, the governmental benefit can be said to be duplicative and thus subject to setoff under \u00a7 3109(1).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">In every case, in order to determine whether the governmental and no-fault benefits serve the same purpose (criterion 1), a particularized assessment of the questioned governmental benefit is necessary to identify the ultimate beneficiary, the nature of the benefits, the reason for paying them, and the events triggering entitlement to them. If an inappropriately generalized notion of purpose or legislative intent is used, it might be concluded that almost any governmental benefit can be seen as duplicating no-fault benefits. For example, at first glance, social security old-age benefits can be seen as a substitute for wages which would otherwise be earned, just as no-fault work-loss benefits are a substitute for wages which would have been earned, and, therefore, both benefits appear to satisfy the first prong of our two-pronged test: benefits which serve the same purpose. More careful analysis reveals, however, that social security old-age benefits are meant to be a substitute for wages earned, but <em>age, </em>usually the <em>age </em>of the beneficiary, triggers payment and identifies the eligible person. No-fault work-loss benefits, on the other hand, are a substitute for <em>wages </em>which a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>person actually would have earned but for an automobile accident. Clearly, since the occurrence of an accident is totally irrelevant to Congress\u2019 social security old-age benefits plan, the legislative purpose or intent regarding the identity of beneficiaries as well as the triggering event for payment of old-age benefits differs from that underlying no-fault work-loss benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">Similarly, the fact that benefits are paid as a result of the same accident (criterion 2) is a characteristic of duplicate benefits. To the extent that DAIIE contends that benefits can be duplicative and not paid as a result of the same accident, we disagree. In reality, if benefits are duplicative, then they are paid as a result of the same accident. But the converse is not necessarily true. Put another way, if benefits are not paid as a result of the same accident, they are not duplicative.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">To some extent, this second criterion (benefits required to be provided as a result of the same accident) of the two-part test overlaps the first criterion (serving the same purpose). That is inevitable and it is because both are characteristics of duplicative benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Still, we find that application of the two-part test is useful, partly because the event triggering payment is easily verifiable. Moreover, the fact that one can determine easily whether benefits are <em>not </em>paid as a result of the same accident provides a quick, accurate method of determining if benefits are not duplicative. In such a case, further analysis of certain benefits thus becomes unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Determining whether benefits are paid as a result of the same accident seems self-explanatory. Yet, we will elaborate in order to clarify any misconceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">For benefits to be duplicative under the standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>we have announced today, substantially equivalent qualifications and provisions would have to exist. In other words, the federal or state law that provides the governmental benefits or requires them to be provided must specifically base payment of benefits upon the happening of an event, and an automobile accident must qualify as such an event.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">This is not to say that federal or state statutes must be identical to no-fault provisions in every way, but they must be substantially the same, at least in the triggering mechanism for payment. For purposes of the second criterion of our two-part test, the benefits received must be contingent upon the occurrence of the same automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Applying our two-part test to the facts of this case, we find that the amount in dispute \u2014 the difference between what the plaintiff is now receiving and what he would have been paid had he been receiving reduced social security benefits together with wages from Supreme Steel \u2014 may not be set off against no-fault work-loss benefits otherwise due. The challenged payment fails both portions of the test. First, this differential amount, although arguably serving the same <em>general </em>purpose as no-fault benefits, the prevention of hardship due to lost wages, does not serve the same <em>particular </em>purpose as work-loss no-fault benefits. The differential payment challenged in this case was not made because the plaintiff was disabled from work and thereby suffered work loss. It was made because the plaintiff did not have additional income in excess of the statutory limit. For purposes of the disputed differential payment, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>reason why the plaintiff does not have income in excess of the statutory limit is irrelevant; any reason is sufficient and a disabling injury causing work loss is not required. Therefore, the particular purpose served by the differential amount is not the same as the purpose served by the no-fault work-loss benefits. Second, the triggering event for the challenged differential payment is not the disabling automobile accident which triggers the no-fault work-loss payment. Instead, the triggering event for the challenged differential amount is the plaintiff\u2019s age.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The challenged differential benefit is not \"provided or required to be provided\u201d because the plaintiff is disabled; it is only \"provided or required to be provided\u201d to persons who have reached 65 years of age. Therefore, the triggering event is not a disabling automobile accident causing work loss; the triggering event is the plaintiff\u2019s age. Even assuming that, but for the accident, the plaintiff would not have received the disputed amount, the accident is not the triggering event since the accident alone will not precipitate payment of the disputed benefit. The disputed payments are made only if the plaintiff does not have outside income in excess of the statutory limits, for whatever reason, <em>and </em>the plaintiff has reached 65 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>years of age. Therefore, it is the confluence of purpose and triggering event which demonstrates that the governmental benefits in question fail to meet the two parts of the <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>test as we have restated it today. Therefore, the challenged benefits do not duplicate no-fault work-loss benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">DAIIE\u2019s primary argument is that Mr. Jarosz\u2019s social security benefits must be considered in determining the amount of loss of income as a result of the accident, for the purpose of determining no-fault \"work loss\u201d benefits under MCL 500.3107; MSA 24.13107.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">DAIIE\u2019s innovative analytical approach to this case, offered for the first time in the Court of Appeals and repeated before this Court in oral argument, is that \"\u00a7 3109 never comes into play here\u201d. Instead, the insurer argues, Mr. Jarosz\u2019s social security benefits must be considered in determining the amount of loss of income that resulted from the accident for the purpose of determining the amount of no-fault work-loss benefits due under \u00a7 3107. According to DAIIE, because of Mr. Jarosz\u2019s social security benefits, he is actually receiving, together with his no-fault work-loss benefits, more money than he would be receiving if he were working at Supreme Steel and collecting reduced social security benefits. Consequently, DAIIE asserts, Mr. Jarosz has no actual loss of income as a result of the accident. Thus, his work-loss benefits should be reduced until the combination of benefits equals what he would have been receiving if he were working.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">What DAIIE fails to recognize is that work-loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>benefits are paid for loss of income from loss of work. Section 3107 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-4\">\"Personal protection insurance benefits are payable for the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-5\">\"(b) Work loss consisting of income from work an injured person would have performed during the first 3 years after the date of the accident if he had not been injured\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Social security old-age benefits may arguably be income, but they are not income from work. The fact that Mr. Jarosz has income in the form of social security old-age benefits does not, in any way, vitiate the fact that he has lost income from work.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">We find that the manifest intent of the Legislature was to define \"work loss\u201d under \u00a7 3107 as income loss attributable solely to the inability to work without regard to non-work-related sources of income. To the extent that the Legislature shares DAIIE\u2019s concern that an insured should not be financially better off not working after an accident than while working before the accident, it has addressed the subject in \u00a7 3109 and has provided for the coordination and setoff of certain kinds of benefits according to the formula we have discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the trial court\u2019s summary judgment for the appellee is vacated. Summary judgment for the appellant on the issue whether appellee is entitled to set off social security benefits against no-fault work-loss payments is granted. The case is remanded to the circuit court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Williams, C.J., and Cavanagh and Boyle, JJ., concurred with Ryan, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-12\"> MCL 500.3101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 24.13101 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b668-11\"> 109 Mich App 86; 310 NW2d 903 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b668-12\"> 414 Mich 872 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b669-10\"> <em>O'Donnell v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>404 Mich 524; 273 NW2d 829 (1979) (social security survivors\u2019 benefits) <em>app dis </em>444 US 803; 100 S Ct 22; 62 L Ed 2d 16 (1979); <em>Mathis v Interstate Motor Freight System, </em>408 Mich 164; 289 NW2d 708 (1980) (worker compensation benefits); <em>LeBlanc v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>410 Mich 173; 301 NW2d 775 (1981), <em>reh den </em>411 Mich 1119; 306 NW2d 311 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b670-8\"> US Const, Am XIV; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 17.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b671-8\"> <em>O\u2019Donnell, supra, </em>p 538, fn 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b672-9\"> See <em>LeBlanc v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>410 Mich 173, 190; 301 NW2d 775 (1981); <em>Mathis v Interstate Motor Freight System, </em>408 Mich 164, 187; 289 NW2d 708 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b672-10\"> As indicated, appellee\u2019s theory in this case is that \"\u00a7 3109(1) never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>comes into play here\u201d, that the case merely concerns the correct computation of the amount of loss of income under \u00a7 3107.

It is not sufficient that the challenged benefit payment has the same <em>effect </em>as the no-fault benefit payment; it must have the same <em>purpose. </em>It is the purpose, not the effect, which the Court considers in determining whether or not the challenged benefit payment duplicates the no-fault benefit payment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b676-7\"> The goal of any test for offsetting benefits under \u00a7 3109(1) is to determine whether the challenged benefit payment \"duplicates\u201d the no-fault benefit payment. Both elements of this two-pronged analysis directly test whether the challenged benefits duplicate the no-fault benefits. As this Court has held in other cases, benefits which do not duplicate no-fault benefits are not to be set off under \u00a7 3109(1).

While we agree that the benefits are not payable solely because the claimant is over 65 years of age and that the payments would be reduced if the claimant were earning in excess of an established amount, we do not agree that the reason for the payment is the claimant\u2019s automobile accident. Rather, the reason for the payment is the fact that the claimant does not earn in excess of the federally established maximum. Whether the claimant does not earn more than the federally established maximum because of a disability or because of a choice to be fully retired is not relevant in determining the amount of the claimant\u2019s payments. The only relevant factor is that the claimant does not earn in excess of the federally established maximum. Therefore, the \"reason\u201d for the payment is not the disability; it is the fact that the claimant earns less than the federally established maximum.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b682-4\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADS\"><em>(dissenting). </em>This appeal concerns the coordination of social security retirement and no-fault benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The majority holds that social security retirement benefits are not \"[bjenefits provided or required to be provided under the laws of any state or the federal government\u201d, required by \u00a7 3109(1) of the no-fault automobile liability act to be subtracted from work-loss benefits payable by a no-fault insurer to an injured person.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The majority distinguishes social security <em>retirement </em>benefits from workers\u2019 compensation benefits, required to be subtracted in <em>Mathis v Interstate Motor Freight System, </em>408 Mich 164, 187; 289 NW2d 708 (1980), social security <em>survivors\u2019 </em>benefits, required to be subtracted in <em>O\u2019Donnell v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>404 Mich 524, 546; 273 NW2d 829 (1979), <em>app dis </em>444 US 803; 100 S Ct 22; 62 L Ed 2d 16 (1979),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and social security <em>disability </em>benefits, required to be subtracted in <em>Thompson v DAIIE, </em>418 Mich 610; 344 NW2d 764 (1984), on the ground that social security retirement benefits become payable upon attainment of age 65 without regard to whether the worker has suffered an injury or disability, and may become payable although the worker continues to have income from wages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Section 3109(1) of the no-fault act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>\"Benefits provided or required to be provided under the laws of any state or the federal government shall be subtracted from the personal protection insurance benefits otherwise payable for the injury.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">We acknowledge that while a literal reading of the term \"benefits\u201d would require the subtraction from no-fault benefits of all benefits provided by federal law, the Court may properly limit the breadth of the term \"benefits\u201d to the meaning that the history or the structure of the act indicates the Legislature intended.

DAIIE did not subtract the portion of the social security retirement payment that Jarosz receives solely because he is 65 years old, and that he would receive even if he were earning income from wages at a post-retirement job. Rather, the amount that is at issue in this case is the portion of the social security retirement payment that Jarosz receives solely because he lost income ($200 per week) for work he would have performed at a post-retirement job if he had not been injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Social security retirement benefits that would not be paid if the person over 65 had not been injured in an automobile accident and had been working are functionally and essentially the same as the workers\u2019 compensation benefits dealt with in <em>Mathis, </em>the social security survivors\u2019 benefits dealt with in <em>O\u2019Donnell, </em>and the social security disability benefits dealt with in <em>Thompson. </em>But for the automobile accident and the resulting injury or disability, such social security retirement benefits would not have been paid. Such social security retirement benefits serve the same income maintenance and replacement purpose served by workers\u2019 compensation benefits, social security survivors\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>and disability benefits, and no-fault work-loss benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The majority opinion \u2014 holding that because in some other case social security retirement benefits may become payable without regard to injury/disability or wage loss, all social security retirement benefits (including those that would not be payable but for wage loss resulting from automobile injury/disability) are not benefits within the meaning of \u00a7 3109(1) \u2014 appears to have adopted the analysis (i) expressed in the dissent in <em>Cruz v Chevrolet Grey Iron Division of General Motors Corp, </em>398 Mich 117, 160; 247 NW2d 764 (1976), where this Court held that the coordination of social security and workers\u2019 compensation benefits was not violative of the Equal Protection Clause,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and (ii) re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>jected in <em>Alessi v Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc, </em>451 US 504; 101 S Ct 1895; 68 L Ed 2d 402 (1981), where the United States Supreme Court held that workers\u2019 compensation benefits may, consistent with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, be subtracted from benefits otherwise payable pursuant to an employer\u2019s pension plan.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Recognizing that it may be appropriate to limit the generality of the term \"benefits\u201d to exclude government payments that would be paid even if there had not been wage loss resulting from an automobile accident, and which in that sense are <em>not </em>\"duplicative\u201d, we would hold that at least the social security retirement benefits at issue in this case are required to be subtracted pursuant to \u00a7 3109(1) because they would not have been paid but for the automobile accident and Jarosz\u2019s resulting injury/disability and inability to earn wages at his post-retirement job, and in that sense are duplicative of the no-fault benefits paid because of his inability to earn wages at his post-retirement job.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">On June 27, 1977, Joseph W. Jarosz suffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>injuries in an automobile accident that prevented him from working at his job as a store manager. Detroit Automobile Inter-Insurance Exchange, the no-fault insurer, paid him work-loss benefits based on his salary of $285 per week. A few months after the accident, Jarosz became 65 and was mandatorily retired pursuant to company policy. He then began receiving social security retirement payments based on the amount to which he was entitled as an unemployed retiree.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">DAIIE terminated the payment of work-loss benefits because of Jarosz\u2019s retirement. The no-fault act provides that work-loss benefits are paid for \"loss of income from work an injured person <em>would have performed </em>* * * if he had not been injured\u201d.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.) Jarosz provided evidence to DAIIE that, but for the accident, he would, after retirement, have gone to work for another company and earned $200 per week ($10,-400 per year). DAIIE thereupon resumed payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>of work-loss benefits based on a \"salary\u201d of $200 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Because Jarosz did not, as a result of the accident, actually begin to work at the new job, he continued to receive social security retirement payments at the rate calculated for an unemployed retiree. DAIIE learned of the social security payments and reduced its check to Jarosz by the amount the social security payment would have been reduced had Jarosz been earning $200 per week at the new job. Jarosz refused to accept the reduced amount and filed this action.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">In <em>O\u2019Donnell v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, supra, </em>p 544, this Court said that the Legislature intended \"to require a setoff of those government benefits that duplicated the no-fault benefits payable because of the accident and thereby reduce or contain the cost of basic insurance\u201d. Similarly, see <em>Mathis v Interstate Motor Freight System, supra, </em>p 187; <em>LeBlanc v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>410 Mich 173, 191; 301 NW2d 775 (1981). <em>Cf. Great American Ins Co v Queen, </em>410 Mich 73; 300 NW2d 895 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">If, despite the all-encompassing language of \u00a7 3109(1), the term \"benefits\u201d is to be limited on the authority of <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>to those government payments that are \"duplicative\u201d, the term \"dupli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>cative\u201d should be given a meaning consistent with the meaning that appears to have been intended in <em>O\u2019Donnell. </em>There the Court relied on the letter previously referred to from the Commissioner of Insurance to the Governor to support its statement that the history of \u00a7 3109(1) indicates a legislative intent to require the setoff of \"government benefits that duplicated the no-fault benefits payable because of the accident\u201d; the Court noted that the letter \"criticized [certain proposed] bills because they tended to 'increase the duplication and overlap between auto insurance and other insurance programs, sick leave programs and <em>social security\u2019 \u201d. O\u2019Donnell, supra, </em>p 544 (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Court continued that \"[t]he final version of \u00a7 3109(1) was similar to an amendment suggested by the Commissioner\u201d, who recommended that the provision read \"benefits recoverable under the laws of any state or the federal government\u201d. Thus the effort to eliminate \"dupli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>cation\u201d did not distinguish between social security disability and survivors\u2019 benefits, on the one hand, and social security retirement benefits, on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Further, the term \"duplicative\u201d should be given a meaning consistent with the underlying purpose of the no-fault act. The Legislature provided work-loss benefits to an injured person to replace \"loss of income from work an injured person would have performed if he had not been injured\u201d.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Consistent with this purpose, those governmentally mandated payments \u2014 including social security retirement payments \u2014 that, like the work-loss benefits provided by the no-fault act, replace income from work the injured person would have performed if he had not been injured are \"duplicative\u201d of the no-fault work-loss benefits and are \"benefits\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3109(1).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Treating governmentally mandated payments as \"benefits\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3109(1) to the extent they replace income from work an injured person would have performed if he had not been injured is consistent with the results this Court has reached in other cases. In <em>O\u2019Donnell, supra, </em>p 546, the Court referred to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>Mathews v De Castro, </em>429 US 181, 185-186; 97 S Ct 431; 50 L Ed 2d 389 (1976), that social security survivors\u2019 payments \"were intended to provide persons dependent on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>the wage earner with protection against the economic hardship occasioned by loss of the wage earner\u2019s support\u201d, and concluded that social security survivors\u2019 payments, like the work-loss benefits provided by the no-fault act, replace income lost as a result of the wage earner\u2019s fatal automobile accident. In <em>Mathis v Interstate Motor Freight System, supra, </em>the payments made under the workers\u2019 compensation act replaced lost wages attributable to the accident, and this Court held that workers\u2019 compensation payments are required by \u00a7 3109(1) to be subtracted. In the companion case of <em>Thompson v DAIIE, supra, </em>this Court holds that social security disability benefits paid to dependents replace lost income from wages and are required to be subtracted.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The majority declares that \"state or federal benefits 'provided or required to be provided\u2019 must be deducted from no-fault benefits under \u00a7 3109(1) if they:</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">1) Serve the same purpose as the no-fault benefits, and</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">2) Are provided or are required to be provided as a result of the same accident.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">The social security retirement payments at issue here satisfy both of these criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">The social security retirement payments at issue in this case were paid only because Jarosz lost income from work and thus serve the same pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>pose as no-fault work-loss benefits which also are only payable for loss of income from work.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Jarosz would, to be sure, have received some social security payments simply by virtue of having reached his 65th birthday even if he had been able to continue to work. A person who is 65 years old is entitled to full social security payments as long as any earnings he receives from work do not exceed the exempt earnings ceiling (which in 1983 was $6,600).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Even if a person is 65 years old and continues to earn an income greater than the exempt earnings ceiling, he may still receive some social security payments, but the payments will be reduced by $1 for every $2 earned in excess of the exempt earnings ceiling.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">DA TIE did not subtract the payments that Jarosz would receive, as a person over 65, even if he continued to work, and therefore those payments are not at issue in this case. The sum which DAIIE subtracted equals the portion of the social security retirement benefits that would not have been paid to Jarosz if he had been working at his post-retirement job.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">When Jarosz reached 65, he became entitled to social security retirement payments consisting of two components: (1) the component paid solely because he was 65 years old; and (2) the component paid because, as a result of the accident that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>occurred before he was 65, he was unable at 65 to work at his post-retirement job and thus lost income from wages. If Jarosz had not been injured in the automobile accident and had been able to work at his post-retirement job earning $200 per week, he would not be entitled to receive the social security payments DAIIE seeks to subtract from the no-fault benefits \u2014 component (2) \u2014 although he is 65 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Neither the social security retirement payments here in issue nor the no-fault work-loss benefits would be payable but for Jarosz\u2019s inability, as a result of the accident, to work at the $200 per week post-retirement job, and thus they both serve the same purpose of replacing income that he would have earned had he been able to work at the post-retirement job. The social security retirement payments <em>at issue in this case </em>are paid to Jarosz not because he is 65 years of age, but rather because he has lost income from wages as a result of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">If a worker is less than 65 years old and has lost income from wages because of disability, the social security system provides disability payments to replace that lost income; such payments are labeled social security <em>disability </em>benefits rather than social security <em>retirement </em>benefits, but, when payable, are paid in substantially the same amount as retirement benefits calculated at the same time.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> To the extent post-65 social security retirement payments replace lost income they serve the same purpose as pre-65 social security disability payments that this Court holds must be subtracted from no-fault work-loss benefits. <em>Thompson v DAIIE, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Being 65 years of age is but one of several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>eligibility requirements that must be satisfied before a worker may receive the social security retirement payments at issue in this case. Other eligibility requirements include having paid money into the social security system and having the appropriate number of quarters of coverage. These eligibility requirements could not justify the conclusion that the \"purpose\u201d of the payment is other than replacement of income lost as a result of the accident. Although there are a number of eligibility requirements for the social security survivors\u2019 payments at issue in <em>O\u2019Donnell, i.e., </em>(i) the death of a worker who had paid money into the social security system and who had the appropriate number of quarters of coverage, and (ii) dependency on the worker, survivors\u2019 payments were said to \"serve[ ] substantially the same purpose as the no-fault benefits\u201d. <em>O\u2019Donnell, supra, </em>p 545.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>lative purpose of replacing lost income from work does not change when the loss of income is attributable to a disabling injury and not death, nor does the purpose change when the worker is 65; to hold otherwise is to ignore that survivors\u2019 benefits are not payable to a spouse unless the spouse is deemed to have difficulty working, either because the spouse is 62 years old or has a child in care.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">The social security retirement payments at issue in this case were provided to Jarosz as a result of the same accident for which no-fault benefits are payable. To conclude that the social security retirement payments <em>in issue </em>were not provided as a result of the automobile accident is to ignore that these social security payments would not be paid but for Jarosz\u2019s loss of income from wages, which in turn resulted from the automobile accident. The automobile accident that entitled Jarosz to no-fault work-loss benefits is exactly the same event but for which the social security retirement benefits in issue would not be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">The setoff required by \u00a7 3109(1) is not limited to cases in which the accident triggers the start-up of the governmentally mandated payments sought to be subtracted. To the extent that, but for the accident, the governmentally mandated benefit would no longer be paid, the payment replaces income lost as a result of the accident and is required to be subtracted.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>The Social Security Act mentions only three triggering events: death, retirement, and disability.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Nowhere does the act provide for payments to be triggered by an automobile accident. The Social Security Act conditions survivors\u2019 payments not upon the occurrence of an automobile accident, but rather upon loss of income because of the death of the worker; a surviving spouse who is at least 62 years of age or has a child in care will receive survivors\u2019 payments upon the death of the worker regardless of what causes the death. Similarly, the Social Security Act conditions disability payments before age 65 not upon the occurrence of an automobile accident, but rather upon loss of income because of the disability of the worker; a worker will receive disability payments regardless of what causes the disability. Finally, the Social Security Act conditions the retirement payments in issue not upon the occurrence of an automobile accident, but rather upon both a loss of income from wages and attainment of age 65; a worker who is 65 years of age will receive the social security retirement payments at issue here only if a total loss of income from wages is suffered regardless of what causes that loss of wage income.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">In <em>O\u2019Donnell, supra, </em>where the worker\u2019s death was caused by an automobile accident, this Court held that social security survivors\u2019 payments are required to be deducted from the no-fault work-loss benefits.

Similarly, if the worker\u2019s loss of income from wages at age 65 is caused by an automobile accident, the social security retirement payments payable solely because of the wage loss are required to be deducted from no-fault work-loss benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The majority opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-7\">\"For benefits to be duplicative under the standard we have announced today, substantially equivalent qualifications and provisions would have to exist.

The concern is misplaced, however, because these benefits are not duplicative.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">\"Whereas federal social security disability insurance and workers\u2019 compensation benefits are in a sense double payment because they both are designed to deal with disability, the federal social security old age and survivors\u2019 benefit is meant to supplement or, in some cases, substitute for private pension benefits, not disability benefits. <em>Old age and survivor bene\u00f1ts are triggered by retirement because of age, not because of injury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">\"Thus, the conditions of payment for workers\u2019 compensation benefits have a completely different nature from old age and survivors\u2019 benefits.

Employer payments in this situation are collateral source payments rather than wages since they are not payments for work done during the time the employee was absent. Nor would the wage continuation payments be subtracted in the calculation of net loss. (See Section 11). Work loss is not restricted to the injured person\u2019s wage level at the time of injury. For example, an unemployed college student who was permanently disabled could claim loss, at an appropriate time after the injury, for work he would then be performing had he not been injured.
