(hereinafter referred to as defendant) on the ground that plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was barred by the exclusive remedy provision<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">The facts in this matter were succinctly stated by the Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-11\">\"Frank Dagenhardt died as a result of injuries he sustained when he fell through a skylight on a building owned by defendant-appellee, Special Machine &amp; Engineering, Inc. (hereinafter defendant). At the time this tragic accident occurred, Frank Dagenhardt was employed by Slasor Heating &amp; Cooling Company, which had contracted with defendant to perform certain heating and cooling work. This work required Dagenhardt to go out onto the roof of defendant\u2019s plant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-12\">\"In the contract between Slasor and defendant, Slasor represented that it was fully covered by workers\u2019 disability compensation insurance. In fact, on the day of the accident Slasor did not carry such insurance, in violation of MCL 418.611; MSA 17.237(611). Conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>quently, defendant petitioned the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation to determine its liability under MCL 418.171; MSA 17.237(171), as a statutorily substituted employer. Notice of the proceedings were provided to plaintiff, Patricia Dagenhardt, Frank\u2019s widow. At the hearing, the administrative law judge ruled that, for purposes of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act, defendant would be liable for the payment of compensation benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-4\">\"A wrongful death action was commenced by plaintiff against defendant and Naturalite, Inc., a manufacturer of skylights who is not involved in this appeal. Defendant moved for summary judgment on the basis that MCL 418.131; MSA 17.237(131) operated to transfer to it the immunity to suit Slasor would have enjoyed under the act as decedent\u2019s employer. The trial court granted summary judgment in an order dated January 4, 1980.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]\u201d <em>Dagenhardt v Special Machine &amp; Engineering, Inc, </em>108 Mich App 75, 77-78; 310 NW2d 41 (1981).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case for trial, finding that plaintiffs wrongful death action was not barred by the exclusive remedy provision because: (1) it could see no compelling reason why a worker should not be able to sue a principal or contractor who might also be liable for compensation, especially since a principal or contractor held liable for payment of compensation is entitled to be indemnified by the uninsured contractor or subcontractor it employs, and (2) alternatively, since defendant voluntarily paid benefits to the decedent\u2019s dependents, a literal interpretation of \u00a7 171 of the WDCA led to that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">We granted leave to appeal._</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Section 171 of the WDCA reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">\"Sec. 171. (1) If any employer subject to the provisions of this act, in this section referred to as the principal, contracts with any other person, in this section referred to as the contractor, who is not subject to this act or who has not complied with the provisions of section 611, and who does not become subject to this'act or comply with the provisions of section 611 prior to the date of the injury or death for which claim is made for the execution by or under the contractor of the whole or any part of any work undertaken by the principal, the principal shall be liable to pay to any workman employed in the execution of the work any compensation under this act which he would have been liable to pay if that workman had been immediately employed by him; and if compensation is claimed from or proceedings are taken against the principal, then, in the application of this act, reference to the principal shall be substituted for reference to the employer, except that the amount of compensation shall be calculated with reference to the earnings of the workman under the employer by whom he is immediately employed. A contractor shall be deemed to include subcontractors in all cases where the principal gives permission that the work or any part thereof be performed under subcontract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">\"(2) If the principal is liable to pay compensation under this section, he shall be entitled to be indemnified by the contractor or subcontractor. The employee shall not be entitled to recover at common law against the contractor for any damages arising from such injury if he takes compensation from such principal. The principal, in case he pays compensation to the employee of such contractor, may recover the amount so paid in an action against such contractor.\u201d MCL 418.171; MSA 17.237(171).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">The question before us is whether the foregoing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>provision of the WDCA causes \u00a7 131, the exclusive remedy provision, to apply in this case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">\"Sec. 131. The right to the recovery of benefits as provided in this act shall be the employee\u2019s exclusive remedy against the employer. As used in this section and section 827 'employee\u2019 includes the person injured, his personal representatives and any other person to whom a claim accrues by reason of the injury to or death of the employee, and 'employer\u2019 includes his insurer, a service agent to a self-insured employer, and the accident fund insofar as they furnish, or fail to furnish, safety inspections or safety advisory services incident to providing workmen\u2019s compensation insurance or incident to a self-insured employer\u2019s liability servicing contract.\u201d MCL 418.131; MSA 17.237(131).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Essentially, defendant claims that, by the unambiguous language of \u00a7\u00a7 131 and 171, principals must be permitted to invoke the exclusive remedy provision and that it should not be penalized for having been forthright, <em>i.e., </em>for voluntarily paying compensation to decedent\u2019s dependents.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">On the other hand, plaintiff claims that, because the applicable statutory language is ambiguous, principals are not employers within the meaning of \u00a7 131 and that, in any event, defendant cannot invoke the exclusive remedy provision because it voluntarily paid compensation in this case. Plaintiff also claims that if the WDCA is interpreted in defendant\u2019s favor, then she will be deprived of her state and federal constitutional rights to due process and equal protection. However, we note that plaintiffs constitutional claims are not properly before this Court because they were not presented to the trial court. See <em>Falk v Macomb County Civil Service Comm, </em>57 Mich App 134, 137; 225 NW2d 713 (1974), <em>lv den </em>394 Mich 819 (1975), and the authorities cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Shortly before the Court of Appeals decision in this case, another panel of that Court considered the present issue and held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">\"the language which the Legislature employed in the act serves to afford the \u25a0 defendant the immunity of \u00a7 131. The Legislature has clearly stated that, when a principal becomes liable for the payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits, references to the principal are to be substituted for references to the employer in other sections of the act. There is no indication that the Legislature intended this to be true everywhere but in the exclusive remedy provision. While the logic of this situation may be questioned after examination of the entire statutory scheme, we are not allowed to substitute our ideas for the Legislature\u2019s. Accordingly, plaintiff\u2019s arguments concerning the construction of the act are more appropriately addressed to that forum.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Drewes v Grand Valley State Colleges, </em>106 Mich App 776, 784; 308 NW2d 642 (1981).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">We approve the foregoing language from <em>Drewes. </em>There is nothing in the workers\u2019 disability compensation scheme to suggest that \u00a7 171 does not apply to the exclusive remedy provision. Indeed, the principal incurs liability for an injured worker\u2019s disability compensation benefits merely because that worker was employed by an uninsured employer and was injured while performing work which the principal contracted for the employer to perform. Once liability has been imposed and the injured worker seeks or receives disability compensation benefits from the principal, \"then, in the application of this act, reference to the principal <em>shall </em>be substituted for reference to the employer\u201d. (Emphasis added.) The statute\u2019s directive that \"reference to the principal shall be substi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>tuted for reference to the employer\u201d is clear and unambiguous. Thus, we need undertake no further interpretation or construction of its terms. <em>Detroit v Redford Twp, </em>253 Mich 453, 455-456; 235 NW 217 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Conversely, \u00a7 131 appears to limit the term \"employer\u201d to the employer, the employer\u2019s insurer, the employer\u2019s service agent if self-insured, or the accident fund. Thus, an apparent conflict with \u00a7 171 is created because the directive of \u00a7 171 is mandatory, \"shall be substituted\u201d. <em>State Highway Comm v Vanderkloot, </em>392 Mich 159, 178-182; 220 NW2d 416 (1974) (opinion of Williams, J.). Nevertheless, since the intention of the Legislature in enacting the WDCA was to provide disabled workers with benefits during the periods of their disabilities so that they and their dependents might survive an otherwise catastrophic loss of needed income, <em>McAvoy v H B Sherman Co, </em>401 Mich 419, 437; 258 NW2d 414 (1977), it is reasonable to interpret the term \"employer\u201d appearing in \u00a7 131 as including the term \"principal\u201d. Indeed, \"provisions of a statute must be construed in light of the other provisions of the statute, in such a manner as to carry out the apparent purpose of the Legislature\u201d. <em>Workman v DAIIE, </em>404 Mich 477, 507; 274 NW2d 373 (1979). Also, <em>In re Petition of State Highway Comm, </em>383 Mich 709, 714-715; 178 NW2d 923 (1970). Section 131 does not exclusively limit the interpretation of the term \"employer\u201d. Rather, it sets forth a list of entities deemed to be the employer for purposes of the exclusive remedy provision, <em>i.e., </em>an employer \"includes\u201d those entities. Substituting the principal for the employer in \u00a7 131 does no violence to the purpose of the act, nor does it disrupt the list of entities enumerated in that section, <em>i.e., </em>the list will accordingly refer to the principal\u2019s insurer or service agent since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>contractor will have none, and the accident fund. Consequently, when construed together and in conjunction with the legislative intent, \u00a7\u00a7 131 and 171 require that a principal liable for a worker\u2019s disability compensation benefits is entitled to invoke the exclusive remedy provision against that worker, <em>i.e., </em>principals are employers within the meaning of \u00a7 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Our conclusion is not altered by the fact that, in this case, compensation benefits were voluntarily paid by defendant to decedent\u2019s dependents.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As previously noted, liability for a worker\u2019s disability compensation benefits is imposed upon the principal merely because that worker was employed by an uninsured employer and was injured while performing work which the principal contracted for the employer to perform. Section 171 then states that substitution of the term \"principal\u201d for the term \"employer\u201d shall occur \"if compensation is claimed from or proceedings are taken against the principal\u201d. However, when examining the entire workers\u2019 disability compensation scheme, it becomes clear that the imposition of liability itself is sufficient to allow a principal to invoke the protection of \u00a7 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Like \u00a7 171, \u00a7 301 of the WDCA imposes liability upon the employer or principal at the time of the injury and, in addition, directs that compensation <em>\"shall be paid\u201d. </em>(Emphasis added.) MCL 418.301(1); MSA 17.237(301)(1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The mandatory obligation to pay disability compensation benefits arises regardless whether \"compensation is claimed from or proceedings are taken against\u201d the employer or principal. Similarly, several other sections of the WDCA direct mandatory payment of benefits once liability has been imposed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Finally, and most importantly, \u00a7 801 provides, in pertinent part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-4\">\"[compensation shall be paid <em>promptly </em>and directly to the person entitled thereto and shall become due and payable on the fourteenth day after the employer has notice or knowledge of the disability or death, on which date all compensation then accrued shall be paid. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Thereafter compensation shall be paid in weekly installments.\u201d (Emphasis added.) MCL 418.801(1); MSA 17.237(801X1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Indeed, since the act is designed to compensate a disabled worker for the loss of needed income, prompt, voluntary payment of benefits by an employer or a principal advances that purpose.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Likewise, a subsequent petition for a determination of rights can be submitted by \"any party in interest\u201d, MCL 418.847; MSA 17.237(847), because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">\"[n]either the payment of compensation or <em>[sic] </em>the accepting of the same by the employee or his dependents shall be considered as a determination of the rights of the parties under this act.\u201d MCL 418.831; MSA 17.237(831).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Thus, when viewed in context, it must be held, contrary to the implication of the Court of Appeals, that \u00a7 171 is not an election of remedies provision. Rather, it was designed to complement the remainder of the WDCA. As such, the same limitations preventing an injured worker from suing his or her employer in tort apply when that same worker wishes to sue a \u00a7 171 principal. Section 171 merely emphasizes that an injured worker cannot secure a tort recovery from a principal who is liable to pay that worker disability compensation benefits. Consequently, plaintiff\u2019s wrongful death action against defendant is barred by \u00a7131 of the WDCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Our result today complies with the object of the workers\u2019 disability compensation scheme and approximates that of the typical situation. Generally, an injured worker collects compensation through his or her employer. Further, although the employer is immune from tort liability, the worker can seek a tort recovery from a third party, such as a principal. However, a successful tort recovery entitles the worker\u2019s employer to reimbursement for disability compensation benefits previously paid and to credit for benefits due in the future. MCL 418.827; MSA 17.237(827).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Similarly, in a case such as the present, an injured worker collects compensation through the principal. Further, although the principal is immune from tort liability, the worker can seek a tort recovery from a third party.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, a successful tort recovery entitles the principal to reimbursement for disability compensation benefits previously paid and to credit for benefits due in the future. MCL 418.827; MSA 17.237(827). In addition, the principal has another avenue of relief available, i.e., indemnification from the worker\u2019s uninsured employer. MCL 418.171(2); MSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>17.237(171)(2).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In any event, it does not alter the workers\u2019 disability compensation scheme, <em>i.e., </em>the party liable to pay disability compensation benefits is immune from tort liability. The contrary result reached by the Court of Appeals in this case unfairly imposes two burdens upon a principal which are never imposed upon an injured worker\u2019s direct employer.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded to the trial court for entry of a judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b631-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Ryan, Brickley, and Boyle, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b631-4\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AfNS\"><em>(to affirm). </em>The question presented is whether the personal representative of the estate of a worker who died as the result of injuries sustained in the employ of a subcontractor is barred by the \"exclusive remedy\u201d provision of the workers\u2019 compensation act from maintaining an action in tort against the contractor who, when the subcontractor failed to provide workers\u2019 compensation benefits, paid such benefits to the worker\u2019s dependents pursuant to the \"contracting\u201d provision of the act. We would hold that an action against the contractor is not barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">(As first enacted in 1921<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and subsequently amended<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and re-enacted,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the contracting provision of the workers\u2019 compensation act refers to a person for whom work is to be performed as the \"principal\u201d, and to a person who agrees to perform the work as the \"contractor\u201d. In this opinion, in an effort to ease and clarify the presentation, we instead adopt the everyday usage, and refer to the person or entity for whom the work is to be performed as the \"contractor\u201d, rather than as the \"principal\u201d, and to the person or entity who agrees to perform the work as the \"subcontractor\u201d, rather than as the \"contractor\u201d.)</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The \"contracting\u201d provision, added to the work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>ers\u2019 compensation act in 1921, states that when a subcontractor fails to obtain workers\u2019 compensation insurance or otherwise to secure payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits, an employee of the subcontractor or the employee\u2019s dependents can recover benefits from the contractor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The contracting provision further states that when benefits are claimed from the contractor, \"in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>application of this act, reference to the principal [the contractor] shall be substituted for reference to the employer\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Reading the \"reference\u201d clause of the contracting provision<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> together with the \"exclusive remedy\u201d provision of the act,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which states that a proceeding to obtain workers\u2019 compensation benefits is the exclusive remedy of the worker and his dependents against the \"employer\u201d, the contractor contends, and the majority holds, that the personal representative of the worker\u2019s estate cannot maintain a tort action against the contractor because the worker\u2019s dependents obtained workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the contractor, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>though such an action could be maintained if either (i) the subcontractor had purchased workers\u2019 compensation insurance, or (ii) the worker\u2019s dependents had not obtained from the contractor the workers\u2019 compensation benefits that the subcontractor failed to provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The majority opinion adopts the reasoning of the Court of Appeals in <em>Drewes v Grand Valley State </em>Colleges, 106 Mich App 776, 784; 308 NW2d 642 (1981), where the Court said, that because there is \"no indication that the Legislature intended\u201d for the \"reference\u201d clause to be applied \"everywhere [in the act] but in the exclusive remedy provision\u201d, an action in tort cannot be maintained against the contractor. The Court of Appeals said that \"[w]hile the logic of this situation may be questioned after examination of the entire statutory scheme, we are not allowed to substitute our ideas for the Legislature\u2019s\u201d.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">We agree that, absent a basis for concluding that the policy expressed in the exclusive remedy provision does not apply, we would be obliged to enforce the language as written. We also agree that where the Legislature has spoken we cannot substitute our ideas of sound public policy for those of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">There is, however, reason to believe that</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">A) the policy of the exclusive remedy provision, relied on in the majority opinion to exculpate the contractor from tort liability, does not extend to a contractor required to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits because his subcontractor is uninsured, and</p>\n<p id=\"b635-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>B) the 1921 Legislature, which added the contracting provision,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> did not intend to insulate from tort liability under the exclusive remedy provision a contractor required to pay benefits in those circumstances, and</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">C) it was not part of the legislative purpose, when the act was subsequently amended in the early 1950\u2019s to authorize for the first time a worker who had received workers\u2019 compensation benefits to seek a larger award against a third-party tortfeasor,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to bar a worker, injured in the employ of an uninsured subcontractor, who obtains benefits from a contractor from maintaining a tort action against the contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The exculpation of an employer from tort liability set forth in the exclusive remedy provision is a trade-off for being <em>subject </em>to tort liability, not for being <em>subjected </em>in a particular case to tort liability. The exclusive remedy provision is thus designed to relieve an employer, unconditionally <em>subject </em>to workers\u2019 compensation liability to a worker, from tort liability to him without regard to whether the worker seeks or accepts workers\u2019 comp\u00e9nsation benefits after injury. The policy expressed in the exclusive remedy provision does not extend to a contractor who <em>is </em>generally subject to tort liability to a worker in the employ of a subcontractor and who is <em>not </em>generally subject to workers\u2019 compensation liability to the worker, but who may be <em>subjected </em>to workers\u2019 compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>liability to him only if the subcontractor is uninsured and the worker seeks workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the contractor after injury.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">As originally enacted in 1912 and until 1952, the dual liability provision<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of the act barred an action in tort against a third-party tortfeasor if the worker sought workers\u2019 compensation benefits after injury. That policy was reiterated in a clause in the contracting provision that barred a worker who sought workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the contractor from maintaining an action against the subcontractor \"or any other person\u201d.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> An action against the contractor was thus barred by both the dual liability provision and the complementary \"or any other person\u201d clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">The 1921 Legislature, which enacted the contracting provision,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and the 1943 Legislature, which restated this provision when workers\u2019 compensation coverage was made mandatory,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> did not look to the <em>exclusive remedy provision </em>as the operative provision to exculpate from tort liability a contractor called upon to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits that a subcontractor had not provided.

The purpose and intent of the exclusive remedy provision, part of the act from its inception although it did not take its present form until 1943 when workers\u2019 compensation coverage was made mandatory, is to relieve an employer, unconditionally subject to the obligation to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> of tort liability without regard to whether the injured worker claims or accepts workers\u2019 compensation benefits after injury. The \"exclusive remedy\u201d provision was then, as it is now, a trade-off for the employer being <em>subject </em>to liability under the act, not for being <em>subjected </em>to liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">It was thus not part of the legislative purpose or intent \u2014 in 1912 in enacting, and in 1943 in reenacting, the <em>exclusive remedy provision </em>\u2014 for that provision to become operative as the result of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>election of remedies by the injured worker after injury. It follows that the policy of the exclusive remedy provision of providing a trade-off for being subject to workers\u2019 compensation liability does not extend to a contractor who <em>is </em>generally subject to tort liability to an employee of a subcontractor and who is <em>not </em>generally subject to workers\u2019 compensation liability to such an employee, but who may be <em>subjected </em>to workers\u2019 compensation liability to such an employee only if the subcontractor failed to insure or otherwise secure the payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits and the employee seeks benefits from the contractor after injury.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">As originally enacted in 1912 and until 1952, the act provided a second election for a worker who, although covered by the act (because his employer and he had both elected coverage), also had a tort claim against a person other than his employer. Under the dual liability provision of the act, the worker could elect, after injury, either to sue the tortfeasor or to claim workers\u2019 compensation benefits from his employer. If the worker claimed workers\u2019 compensation benefits after injury, he waived his right to sue all third persons in tort. The employer then was subrogated to the worker\u2019s tort claim and could sue the tortfeasor to recover workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid the worker.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>A purpose and intent of the dual liability provision, as originally enacted and until 1952, was thus to put the injured worker to an election of remedies after injury. An injured worker who sought workers\u2019 compensation benefits rather than sue a tortfeasor did not thereby immunize the employer from tort liability in return for subjecting the employer to the obligation to pay benefits. The employer was relieved of tort liability to a worker when the employer had elected to become subject to the provisions of the act and the worker had failed, when he was hired, to elect not to be subject to the provisions of the act. By accepting workers\u2019 compensation benefits, the worker instead, under the dual liability provision, immunized all persons other than the employer from tort liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">The \"reference to the principal [contractor]\u201d clause of the contracting provision enacted in 1921 was not designed or intended, in combination with the exclusive remedy provision relied on in <em>Drewes </em>and in the majority opinion as the operative language, to provide an election of remedies or to exculpate the contractor from tort liability:</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">(i) the exclusive remedy provision was intended to and operates to insulate an employer generally subject to liability for workers\u2019 compensation benefits from tort liability independently of employee election after injury, and</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">(ii) under the dual liability provision, and the complementary \"or any other person\u201d clause enacted by the 1921 Legislature as part of the contracting provision from its inception, no person was subject to tort liability if the worker elected to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits after injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">A worker injured in the employ of an uninsured subcontractor can maintain an action in tort against the contractor, at least where he has not accepted workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the contractor.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The contractor is not insulated from such an action by an employee of a subcontractor, insured or uninsured, on the rationale that the contractor may, if the subcontractor fails to secure the payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits, be subjected by the employee to liability to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">When the contracting provision, with the \"reference to the principal [contractor]\u201d clause,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> was added in 1921, <em>that </em>clause could not, in combina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>tion with the exclusive remedy provision, have deprived an employee of a subcontractor of the right to maintain an action against a contractor who paid workers\u2019 compensation benefits that the subcontractor did not provide, because under the dual liability provision and the complementary \"or any other person\u201d clause of the contracting provision<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> an employee of a subcontractor could not have accepted workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the contractor and then sued in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The 1921 legislation adding the contracting provision could not embody a separate purpose to exculpate, under the exclusive remedy provision, a contractor who pays workers\u2019 compensation benefits his subcontractor did not provide, from liability in a tort action that could not then be maintained against the contractor or anyone else where workers\u2019 compensation benefits were paid. The 1921 legislative purpose did not become enlarged when, as a result of the 1952 and 1954 amendments, the contractor would no longer be exculpated from tort liability under the dual liability or the \"or any other person\u201d clause where the worker after injury claimed workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">The purpose and intent of the contracting provision, added in 1921, was to define the scope of the contractor\u2019s obligations and of an injured worker\u2019s rights respecting workers\u2019 compensation benefits where the contractor had elected and the subcontractor had not elected to provide workers\u2019 compensation benefits. It was not part of the legislative purpose or intent of the 1921 legislation to provide that the <em>exclusive remedy provision </em>\u2014 that in 1921 could only become operative if the worker had not elected <em>at the time of hiring </em>not to become <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>subject to the provisions of the act<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> \u2014 would become operative upon an election of remedies by the worker <em>after injury. </em>In this connection it is noteworthy that where a subcontractor had not elected to become subject to the provisions of the act \u2014 and the 1921 contracting provision only applied in such a case \u2014 an employee of a subcontractor never had an opportunity to elect whether to become subject to the provisions of the act, a precondition in 1921 for the exclusive remedy provision to become operative.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">In 1943, the act was amended to eliminate employer and employee elections whether to be covered by the act, and thus to make workers\u2019 compensation coverage mandatory.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The contractor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>obligation under the contracting provision was restated to include the obligation to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits if the subcontractor failed to insure or otherwise secure their payment.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The worker\u2019s election under the \"dual liability\u201d provision (and the complementary \"or any other person\u201d clause of the contracting provision), to sue a third-party tortfeasor or to claim workers\u2019 compensation benefits was not changed.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Although workers\u2019 compensation coverage was now mandatory, a worker in the employ of a subcontractor, insured or uninsured, could (as before the 1943 amendment) after injury sue the contractor in tort \u2014 although he could not sue an actual employer \u2014 in lieu of claiming workers\u2019 compensation benefits.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The liability of a contractor to an injured employee of an insured or uninsured subcontractor was <em>not </em>limited to the payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits on the rationale that the contractor was <em>subject </em>to liability as an \"employer\u201d if the subcontractor failed to provide security for the payment of benefits and the exclusive remedy against a person subject to liability as an \"employer\u201d is the right to seek workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">The exclusive remedy provision was thus not the determinative provision after coverage became mandatory in 1943; the determinative provisions continued to be the dual liability provision and the complementary \"or any other person\u201d clause in the contracting provision, which provided all injured workers, including those injured in the employ of an insured or uninsured subcontractor, a choice of seeking workers\u2019 compensation benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>or of suing any person other than an actual employer (who alone was already exculpated by the exclusive remedy provision) and which exculpated all persons from tort liability when the worker chose after injury to seek workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">In 1952, the act was amended to eliminate the election of remedies under the dual liability provision so that an injured worker could accept workers\u2019 compensation benefits without giving up any larger amount recoverable in tort from a third-party tortfeasor.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> For the first time, it became important whether the worker could sue in tort a contractor who had paid the workers\u2019 compensation benefits that an uninsured subcontractor had failed to provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">In 1954, an apparent curative amendment of the contracting provision (last amended in 1943) was enacted to eliminate the \"or any other person\u201d clause,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> which, complementing the pre-1952 dual liability provision, barred a tort action against \"any other person\u201d if the employee claimed workers\u2019 compensation benefits and would, if literally construed, have continued to bar after 1952 a tort action against the contractor if the worker had after injury sought from the contractor workers\u2019 compensation benefits that an uninsured subcontractor had failed to provide. The Legislature thereby evidenced a purpose and intent that a worker injured in the employ of an uninsured subcontractor, like all other injured workers, could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>both claim workers\u2019 compensation benefits and sue in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The Legislature thus has moved, in 1943, 1952, and 1954, to eliminate the provisions of the original 1912 act providing employers and employees with elections of remedies.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Today\u2019s decision that a contractor is relieved of tort liability if he pays workers\u2019 compensation benefits that a subcontractor failed to provide reintroduces into the act the concept of election of remedies eliminated by the 1943, 1952, and 1954 amendments.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> It constitutes for the first time in 1952 or 1954, the exclusive remedy provision, enacted in 1912,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> a trade-off not for being <em>subject </em>to liability but for being <em>subjected </em>to liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">The construction of the act set forth in the majority opinion is not consonant with the structure of the act or the apparent purpose of the 1943, 1952, and 1954 Legislatures to eliminate provisions of the act putting an employer or an employee to an election of remedies, and is violative of the clear purpose of the 1954 amendment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>the contracting provision to extend the benefit of the 1952 amendment of the dual liability provision to a worker injured in the employ of an uninsured subcontractor who obtains workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the contractor, by allowing him to maintain an action in tort against an \"other person\u201d, who then, as in 1921 and 1943, included the contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The purpose of the 1952 amendment of the dual liability provision was to secure to the injured worker the benefit of a recovery obtainable in tort to the extent it may exceed workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The only purpose of the 1954 amendment of the contracting provision was to secure the benefit of the 1952 amendment of the dual liability provision to a worker injured in the employ of an uninsured subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The construction placed on the act in the majority opinion deprives a worker injured in the employ of an uninsured subcontractor <em>and no other injured worker </em>of the benefit of a greater recovery obtainable in a tort action and is not consistent with the purpose of the 1952 and 1954 amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">It appears that in a majority of jurisdictions a contractor is regarded as, or is deemed to be, the employer of an employee of a subcontractor, and on that rationale is not subject to tort liability to such an employee even if the subcontractor or his insurer pays workers\u2019 compensation benefits.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Where that is the rule it is held, as one would expect, that the contractor, <em>not </em>subject to tort liability if the subcontractor or his insurer pays <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation benefits, does not become subject to tort liability if the subcontractor or his insurer does not pay the benefits and the contractor pays them.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>The rule in Michigan, however, is that the contractor is generally subject to tort liability to an employee of a subcontractor, and therefore a tort action may be maintained against the contractor by a person injured in the employ of a subcontractor, at least where the subcontractor has provided for the payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> It is indeed arguable, as Professor Larson urges, that the corollary of the contractor\u2019s contingent liability to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits should be exculpation from tort liability to employees of all subcontractors, insured and uninsured.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> But, in light of the legislative decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>make the contracting provision operative only when the subcontractor is not insured, and thus not to free a contractor from tort liability to employees of all subcontractors, insured and uninsured, a change in the Michigan rules can appropriately be ordained only by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">We have found decisions in eight jurisdictions where, as in Michigan, a contractor is generally subject to tort liability to an employee of a subcontractor, that address the question whether a contractor so generally subject to tort liability remains subject to tort liability if he is required to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits when the subcontractor fails to provide benefits. Decisions in six of the eight jurisdictions hold that the contractor continues to be subject to tort liability although he was required to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>The extent of a contractor\u2019s liability for workers\u2019 compensation benefits and exculpation from tort liability are essentially matters of policy to be decided by the Legislature. We are obliged to reach a result that serves the legislative policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">We are persuaded that if one begins with the established premise that, in this state, the contractor is generally subject to tort liability to an employee of a subcontractor, it better serves the legislative policy embodied in the 1952 and 1954 amendments for the contractor not to be advantaged and the worker disadvantaged because the subcontractor, in violation of the act, is uninsured. A contractor can protect himself from being called upon to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits to an employee of an uninsured subcontractor by requiring the subcontractor, at the time the subcontractor enters into an agreement with the contractor, to provide continuing evidence that the subcontractor is insured for workers\u2019 compensation liability.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Holding the contractor to both tort and workers\u2019 compensation liability provides a worker injured in the employ of an uninsured subcontractor no more than the opportunity, along with all other injured workers, to pursue a greater tort recovery. The contractor is protected by the subrogation feature of the dual liability provision from being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>required to pay twice. Whatever verdict might be returned against the contractor in a tort action must be reduced by the amount the contractor has paid as workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and the balance of a tort recovery (paid to the worker) is deemed to be an advance payment of any further workers\u2019 compensation benefits that the worker otherwise could claim from the contractor.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The act further provides that the contractor may seek to recover the amount paid as workers\u2019 compensation benefits in an action against the subcontractor.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The contracting provision, as enacted in 1921, precluded a contractor who had elected to become subject to the provisions of the act from avoiding the obligation so assumed by subcontracting with a subcontractor who had not elected to subject himself to the provisions of the act work to be performed by the contractor. The contracting provision, as amended in 1943, bars a contractor from avoiding mandatory workers\u2019 compensation liability by dealing with an uninsured subcontractor. It would not be consonant with the policy implicit in those legislative decisions to permit a contractor to avoid the tort liability, to which he is otherwise subject under the Michigan rule, by dealing with an uninsured subcontractor,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>The contractor\u2019s responsibility under the contracting provision arises without regard to whether he purposefully sought to deal with a subcontractor who had not elected coverage or is not insured.

Whether the contractor acted purposefully is not, for purposes of the contracting provisions, relevant. The same policy that requires a contractor to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits to an injured employee of an uninsured subcontractor, without regard to whether the contractor purpose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>fully dealt with an uninsured subcontractor, requires that the contractor continue to be subject to the tort liability it would be subject to if it dealt with an insured subcontractor, without regard to whether it purposefully dealt with an uninsured subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">We would affirm the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b660-7\">Williams, C.J., and Kavanagh, J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b620-13\"> MCL 418.131; MSA 17.237(131).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b620-14\"> MCL 418.101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 17.237(101) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b621-7\"> We note that the motion should have been denominated as one for accelerated judgment, pursuant to GCR 1963, 116.1(2), and it will be treated as such because no prejudice to plaintiff is alleged or apparent.

See <em>id., </em>\u00a7 72.31(b) and fns 49 and 50. An analysis of the decisions cited from the remaining seven jurisdictions (Utah, Nevada, Kentucky, Virginia, Alaska, New York, and Mississippi) indicates that either those jurisdictions also have so held, or would so hold, or that the cases cited are not in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">In <em>Adamson v Okland Construction Co, </em>29 Utah 2d 286; 508 P2d 805 (1973), the subcontractor paid workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and the contractor was held to be immune from tort liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">In <em>Ortolano v Las Vegas Convention Service, </em>96 Nev 308; 608 P2d 1103 (1980), where the benefits were paid by the worker\u2019s \"immediate employer\u201d, the convention service was held to be immune.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">In <em>Whittenberg Engineering &amp; Construction Co v Liberty Mutual Ins Co, </em>390 SW2d 877, 882 (Ky, 1965), the court ruled that the contractor could be required to indemnify the subcontractor\u2019s insurer, who had paid the workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The court stated that a contractor was immune from a common-law tort action by an injured employee of a subcontractor, even if the subcontractor or his insurer had paid benefits. In <em>United Engineers &amp; Constructors, Inc v Branham, </em>550 SW2d 540 (Ky, 1977), the contractor was held immune from tort liability where the insurer of the subcontractor had paid benefits to an injured employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">In <em>Evans v Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co, </em>243 F Supp 1017 (ED Va, 1965), <em>aff\u2019d </em>361 F2d 364 (CA 4, 1966), the court ruled that the Virginia workers\u2019 compensation act barred an action against the owner of a project by an employee of a contractor who had received workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the insurer of the contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">In <em>Sloan v Atlantic Richfield Co, </em>552 P2d 157, 160 (Alas, 1976), the court held that an employee of an independent contractor does not have a cause of action against an owner or possessor of the premises whereon the injury occurred. The case was decided on common-law, not statutory, grounds. But see <em>Miller v Northside Danzi Construction Co, </em>629 P2d 1389 (Alas, 1981), fn 48 <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">It is unclear who paid the benefits in <em>Washington v East 87th &amp; 88th Street Contracting Co, </em>90 Misc 2d 911; 396 NYS2d 596 (1977). In all events the rule in New York is stated in <em>Sweezey v Arc Electrical Construction Co, Inc, </em>295 NY 306; 67 NE2d 369 (1946), where the New York Court of Appeals held that the contractor was liable in tort although it was obligated to pay the benefits because the subcontractor had failed to secure compensation insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">In one jurisdiction, Georgia, the contractor was held, by the state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>intermediate appellate court, to be immune from tort liability after it had been required to pay benefits because its subcontractor was not insured, although a contractor would be subject to tort liability if an insured subcontractor paid benefits. See <em>Jackson vJB Rush Construction Co, Inc, </em>134 Ga App 445; 214 SE2d 710 (1975). Subsequently, however, the Supreme Court of Georgia held that the contractor was immune from tort liability even when the subcontractor paid the benefits, reasoning that if a contractor was immune when he was required to pay benefits, he also should be immune when the subcontractor was insured and paid benefits. See <em>Wright Associates, Inc v Rieder, </em>247 Ga 496; 277 SE2d 41 (1981); <em>Cleckley v Batson-Cook Co, </em>160 Ga App 831; 288 SE2d 573 (1982).

He states a defensible point of view. The contractor, and the owner who employs the contractor, ultimately bears the cost of workers\u2019 compensation insurance when the subcontractor is insured. The subcontractor presumably adds the cost of such insurance when he submits his bid or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>otherwise is hired by the contractor. See <em>Griffin v United States, </em>644 F2d 846, 848 (CA 10, 1981); <em>Musick v Puerto Rico Telephone Co, </em>357 F2d 603, 605 (CA 1, 1966); <em>Watkins v United States, </em>479 F Supp 785, 789 (D SC, 1979); <em>Bence v Pacific Power &amp; Light Co, </em>631 P2d 13, 15, fn 1 (Wy, 1981). But see <em>DiNicola v George Hyman Construction Co, </em>407 A2d 670, 674-675 (DC App, 1979). It thus may be sound public policy to treat the contractor/owner and the subcontractor as a single enterprise for purposes of workers\u2019 compensation and third-party tort liability, but that is not the rule in Michigan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b656-7\"><em> </em>See <em>Kilgore v C G Canter, Jr &amp; Associates, Inc, </em>396 So 2d 60 (Ala, 1981); <em>Miller v Northside Danzi Construction Co, </em>629 P2d 1389 (Alas, 1981); <em>Prive v M W Goodell Construction Co, Inc, </em>119 NH 914; 409 A2d 1149 (1979); <em>Laffoon v Bell &amp; Zoller Coal Co, </em>65 Ill 2d 437; 359 NE2d 125 (1977); <em>Sweezey v Arc Electrical Construction Co, Inc, </em>295 NY 306; 67 NE2d 369 (1946) (The opinion is unclear whether the contractor in fact had paid the benefits; the court declared, however, that a general contractor remains liable in tort although obligated to pay compensation benefits to an injured employee of an uninsured subcontractor.); <em>Culbertson v Kieckhefer Container Co, </em>197 Wis 349; 222 NW 249 (1928) (dicta).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">In two jurisdictions, the District of Columbia and Arkansas, the contractor is subject to tort liability when an insured subcontractor pays the benefits, but is immune from tort liability when the subcontractor is not insured and the contractor is required to pay benefits. See <em>Clanagan v Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, </em>558 F Supp 209 (D DC, 1982); <em>Carter v Fraser Construction Co, </em>219 F <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Supp 650 (WD Ark, 1963); <em>Baldwin Co v Maner, </em>224 Ark 348; 273 SW2d 28 (1954). The District of Columbia workers\u2019 compensation act construed in <em>Clanagan </em>is the same (see <em>Clanagan, supra, </em>p 210, fn 1; DC Code \u00a7 36-501) as the Federal Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (33 USC 904[a]-905[a]). At least one court that has construed that federal act has concluded, however, that a contractor remains liable in tort after having paid the benefits to an injured employee of an uninsured subcontractor. See <em>Fiore v Royal Painting Co, Inc, </em>398 So 2d 863 (Fla App, 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b657-8\"> The policy might be endorsed to show the contractor as an additional insured and to require that notice of cancellation be sent to the contractor as well as the subcontractor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b658-6\"> See fn 30.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"51\">\n<p id=\"b658-7\"> See fn 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"52\">\n<p id=\"b658-8\"> Georgia and Mississippi have explicitly construed their workers\u2019 compensation acts so as to make <em>all </em>contractors equally liable. See <em>Wright Associates, Inc v Rieder, 247 </em>Ga 496; <em>277 </em>SE2d 41 (1981); <em>Doubleday v Boyd Construction Co, </em>418 So 2d 823 (Miss, 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">The Mississippi Supreme Court first held that a contractor who had hired an uninsured subcontractor should be immune when it was required to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits to the subcontractor\u2019s injured employee. See <em>Mosley v Jones, 224 </em>Miss 725; 80 So 2d 819 (1955). The court then held that a contractor should also be immune when he had required his subcontractor to buy insurance and pay benefits to his own injured employees. The court reasoned that by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>requiring the subcontractor to buy insurance the contractor had \"secured\u201d the payment of benefits to the employee and therefore was immune under the Mississippi act. <em>Doubleday v Boyd Construction Co, supra. </em>The court wrote that</p>\n<p id=\"AQO\">\"the obvious purpose of the statute is for the protection of employees of subcontractors who do not carry workmen\u2019s compensation insurance. It would be paradoxical however, in our opinion, to hold * * * that a general contractor risk <em>[sic] </em>personal injury judgments in common law suits if he complies with the statute by contractually securing compensation insurance by his subcontractor, but if he lets work to subcontractors who do not comply with the act, then his liability is limited to the sums provided by the act. We do not think the legislature intended such an improbable result.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 826.</p>\n<p id=\"Asf\">See also <em>Nations v Sun Oil Co (Delaware), </em>695 F2d 933 (CA 5, 1983) (applying <em>Doubleday </em>to hold the contractor immune after the insured subcontractor paid the benefits).</p>\n<p id=\"ANmy\">In <em>Laffoon v Bell &amp; Zoller Coal Co, </em>65 Ill 2d 437; 359 NE2d 125 (1977), the court also postulated that it was necessary to treat all contractors equally but, in contrast with Georgia and Mississippi, concluded that the contractor was always subject to tort liability to the employees of a subcontractor, insured or uninsured.</p>\n<p id=\"A-_\">When a contractor hires an insured subcontractor, the contractor presumably pays both for the subcontractor\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance, through its contract with the subcontractor, and for insurance to cover its liability in tort. In jurisdictions like Michigan, where contractors remain subject to tort liability although the subcontractor is insured, contractors are treated unequally when a contractor is relieved of tort liability if the subcontractor is uninsured.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
