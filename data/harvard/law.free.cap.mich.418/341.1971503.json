Pursuant to the Judges\u2019 Retirement Act, MCL 38.801 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 27.125(1) <em>et seq., </em>plaintiff has received a retirement annuity from the Judges\u2019 Retirement System since Judge Murphy\u2019s death. At issue in this appeal is whether plaintiff\u2019s annuity should remain at the amount to which she was entitled on July 11, 1961, or whether her annuity should be increased as the salary paid by the state to circuit judges increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The Court of Claims and the Court of Appeals concluded that plaintiff\u2019s annuity should not be increased. We disagree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">The Legislature established the Judges\u2019 Retirement System in the Judges\u2019 Retirement Act, 1951 PA 198, MCL 38.801 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 27.125(1) <em>et seq. </em>Section 14 of the act provided a flat-rate annual retirement annuity of $4,500 for judges who were members of the system.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The original act made no provision for an annuity for the spouse of a deceased or former judge. However, 1952 PA 79 added \u00a7 19a, which provided a flat-rate annuity for qualifying widows of judges who died after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>creation of the retirement system. The amount of the annuity was $2,250, one-half the amount of a retired judge\u2019s annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Both \u00a7 14 and \u00a7 19a were amended by 1956 PA 224. The annuity provided for a retired judge in \u00a7 14 was changed from the flat-rate amount to a variable amount equal to one-half of the annual salary currently paid by the state to circuit judges. Section 19a was modified to provide widows with an annuity of one-half of the annuity provided for judges in \u00a7 14:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">\"The widow of any member who dies or who shall have died in office or on retirement on or after September 28, 1951, and he has had 10 or more years of service prior to his death, and which widow at the time of death of the judge had been the wife of such judge for at least 10 years during his judicial service, and who has reached the age of 55, shall be entitled to apply to the retirement board for and to receive for life a retirement annuity in the amount of 1/2 of the retirement annuity provided for such judge in section 14 of this act, until she remarries\u201d. Former MCL 38.819a; MSA 27.125(19.1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">The language of this 1956 amendment is controlling in this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Plaintiff and amici curiae<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> argue that the plain language of former \u00a7 19a<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides that the annuities of widows, like the annuities of judges, are to be calculated with reference to current circuit judges\u2019 salaries. Defendants argue that the longstanding administrative interpretation and application of the Judges\u2019 Retirement Act, which has been to pay all qualifying widows a fixed annuity of 1/2 of the annuity the judge would have been entitled to at his death, is correct and should not be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The Court of Claims granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, relying primarily on two opinions of the Attorney General construing former \u00a7 19a. In 1957 the executive secretary of the Judges\u2019 Retirement System requested the Attorney General\u2019s opinion as to whether the \"1/2 of the retirement annuity provided for such judge\u201d in \u00a7 19a referred to the annuity to which the judge would have been entitled at the time of his death, or the annuity which would be currently paid a judge with the same service qualifications. In response to this inquiry the Attorney General interpreted the statute as fixing the amount of the widow\u2019s annuity at the time of the judge\u2019s death. The Attorney General said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">\"We think the language of the statute provides a ready answer to this question, referring, as it does, to '1/2 the annuity provided <em>for such judge.\u2019 </em>The annuity to which the judge is entitled is fixed as of the date of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>his death, since it is clear that subsequent to his death he is entitled to no annuity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-4\">\"The widow can have no greater interest in his pension than he has at the time of his death. As shown above, the Judges\u2019 Retirement Act makes her annuity half that provided for him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">\"The statute contains the provision, at section 19a, setting forth requirements which must be met in order for the widow to qualify for <em>her </em>annuity. These requirements include the following: she must have been his wife for at least 10 years during his judicial service; she must have reached the age of 55; she must make application to the retirement board for her retirement annuity; she ceases to be entitled to the annuity upon remarriage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">\"It is clear, therefore, that under the section establishing the widow\u2019s annuity, her annuity is a different pension from his, and not merely a device whereby she steps into his shoes and continues to receive his pension. She must qualify for her own annuity, as just set forth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">\"Finally, we note that the statute nowhere contains any language providing for an 'escalator\u2019 clause whereby the pension of the widow fluctuates with the going rate for justices holding positions similar to that occupied by her husband when alive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">\"For the reasons set forth above, it is my ruling that the amount of the widow\u2019s annuity is fixed at half the amount provided for such judge at the time of his death, and not the annuity which would currently be paid a judge with the same service qualifications.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) 1 OAG, 1957, No 2953, pp 165-166 (April 12, 1957).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">After this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Campbell v Judges\u2019 Retirement Board, </em>378 Mich 169; 143 NW2d 755 (1966), the executive secretary of the Judges\u2019 Retirement System requested an opinion of the Attorney General as to the effect of <em>Campbell </em>on widows\u2019 annuities.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Attorney General re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>sponded in an informal opinion letter dated October 19, 1967. He referred to the 1957 Attorney General Opinion and concluded that <em>Campbell </em>had no effect because the escalator clause had never been applicable to widows\u2019 annuities. The letter referred to two principles of statutory construction in support of the view that widows\u2019 annuities should not be increased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\">\"Such interpretation of \u00a7 19a by the Judges\u2019 Retirement Board is of long standing. It has been uniformly applied to all those who received widows\u2019 annuities under the section. It thus is entitled to great weight and would not be overturned unless a different construction was plainly required. <em>Roosevelt Oil Co v Secretary of State, </em>339 Mich 679; 64 NW2d 582 (1954); <em>Aller v Detroit Police Dep\u2019t Trial Board, </em>309 Mich 382; 15 NW2d 676 (1944).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">\"Additionally, \u00a7 19a was amended by 1965 PA 313 but not so as to change the administrative interpretation. It has been held that re-enactment of , language construed by an administrative agency shows legislative approval because executive interpretation is presumed to have been known to the Legislature. <em>Chrysler Corp v Smith, </em>297 Mich 438; 298 NW 87 (1941).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The Court of Appeals majority affirmed, relying, as had the Court of Claims, on the Attorney General\u2019s construction of the applicable statutory provisions. 85 Mich App 568; 272 NW2d 139 (1978).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Judge Cynar dissented, concluding that the Legislature intended the escalator clause to apply to the widow\u2019s annuity. He reasoned that \u00a7 19a makes the amount of the widow\u2019s pension mathematically dependent upon that provided for the judge in \u00a7 14 of the act. Judge Cynar also pointed out that the purpose of the escalator clause was to counteract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>the effect of inflation upon the annuity. Since the annuity of a widow and that of a judge are equally affected by inflation, he saw no reason to distinguish between the annuities with respect to the escalator clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">We conclude that the clear meaning of former \u00a7 19a is that a widow\u2019s annuity increases with the changes in circuit judges\u2019 salaries. Section 19a provided that the annuity is to be \"in the amount of 1/2 of the retirement annuity provided for such judge in section 14\u201d. The logical reading of this language is that \u00a7 19a incorporates the provisions of \u00a7 14 for the purpose of computing the amount of the widow\u2019s annuity. Section 14 provided that on retirement a judge\u2019s annuity shall be \"1/2 the annual salary being currently paid by the state to the circuit judges\u201d. The result contemplated by this statutory formula is that the widow\u2019s annuity is equal to 1/4 the salary currently paid to circuit judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The Attorney General\u2019s construction of \u00a7 19a of the act is inconsistent with the terminology employed by the Legislature. The Attorney General reads into the act the limitation that the basis on which a widow\u2019s annuity is calculated becomes fixed at the date of the judge\u2019s death. There is no basis for this strained and narrow interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">The principles of statutory construction cited by the Attorney General do not require a contrary result. The principle that a long-standing interpretation of a statute by the agency which administers it is entitled to great weight does not control when the interpretation is clearly wrong. <em>Schuhknecht v State Plumbing Board, </em>277 Mich 183, 186-187; 269 NW 136 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">Second, the fact that \u00a7 19a was amended by 1965 PA 313, but not so as to change the administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>interpretation, does not evidence legislative approval of the administrative interpretation of the 1956 amendment. The 1961 amendment of \u00a7 14 had already prospectively eliminated the escalator feature for <em>all </em>annuitants.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The Attorney General also found it significant that \u00a7 19a contained no express language that the annuity for widows escalates as the state salary paid to circuit judges increases. We find this argument unpersuasive, because the escalator clause was incorporated into \u00a7 19a by reference to \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgments of the Court of Claims and the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the Court of Claims for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">No costs, a public question being involved.</p>\n<judges id=\"b445-8\">Williams, C.J., and Levin, Ryan, Brickley, and Cavanagh, JJ., concurred with Kavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-9\"> Prior to January 10, 1952, Recorder\u2019s Court Judge George Murphy agreed to become a member of the Judges\u2019 Retirement System.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b440-9\"> In 1961, the Legislature amended \u00a7 14 by removing the escalator clause and providing that the judge\u2019s retirement annuity would be \"1/2 the salary paid by the state to him at the time of his retirement\u201d. 1961 PA 169. In <em>Campbell v Judges\u2019 Retirement Board, 378 </em>Mich 169; 143 NW2d 755 (1966), this Court decided that the 1961 amendment did not operate to deny the benefits of the escalator clause to judges who were members of the Judges\u2019 Retirement System during the period from 1956 to 1961 when the escalator clause was in effect. The Court held that a valid contract was entered into between judges and the state which created vested rights for the judges upon their retirement, and that these rights cannot be impaired or diminished by the state. Defendants agree that, consistent with <em>Campbell, </em>widows\u2019 benefits provided for in the Judges\u2019 Retirement Act may not be impaired by the Legislature. Thus, the 1961 amendment repealing the escalator clause has no effect on this dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">Although the Judges\u2019 Retirement Act has been amended several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>times since 1961, none of these amendments affect the disposition of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b441-9\"> The amici curiae are serving and retired judges who, by virtue of judicial service from 1956 to 1961 and the decision in <em>Campbell, supra, </em>are entitled to the benefit of the escalator clause in computing their retirement benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b441-10\"> Section 19a was repealed and replaced by \u00a7 19c by 1974 PA 337.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b442-10\"> See fn 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b443-7\"> The Court of Appeals granted rehearing, but reaffirmed its original decision on January 22, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b445-9\">Boyle, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0I\"><em>(concurring). </em>I agree that <em>Campbell v Judges\u2019 Retirement Board, </em>378 Mich 169; 143 NW2d 755 (1966), requires the result reached in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
