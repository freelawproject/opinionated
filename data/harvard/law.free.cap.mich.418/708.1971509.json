Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">Plaintiffs-appellees are foreign corporations which have been or are engaged in the business of licensing theater owners and operators to exhibit motion picture films distributed by them. Defendants-appellants owned and operated two motion picture theaters in Detroit and Royal Oak, one a partnership, and the other a Michigan corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">Defendant movie theater entities entered into licensing agreements with plaintiff distributors which required the defendants to pay the distributors a percentage of the theaters\u2019 gross receipts of the admission prices collected at the box office in exchange for the right to exhibit plaintiffs\u2019 films. The agreements further provided that the distributors\u2019 share of the proceeds was to be held in trust by the exhibitors for the distributors in a separate and distinct fund. Defendants were contractually obligated to prepare and submit to plaintiffs daily statements of the gross receipts derived from the exhibition of the films and to keep and preserve for at least four years full and accurate books and records. Plaintiffs contractually reserved the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>to audit the defendants\u2019 books and records at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Plaintiffs used a spot-checking system to verify the accuracy of defendants\u2019 reports. This checking system revealed discrepancies between the amount of gross receipts shown on the written statements prepared and submitted by defendants and the amount shown by the checking system. As a result, plaintiffs made a written request to examine defendants\u2019 business records. Defendants refused to honor the request, and plaintiffs commenced this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The original complaint was filed against \"Joseph Miskinis d/b/a Oak Drive-In Theatre and Civic Theatre\u201d. Counts I and III set out causes of action for breach of contract by failing to produce for examination the relevant business records, by submitting false and incorrect statements of gross receipts, and by submitting statements of gross receipts which did not fully and completely disclose the gross receipts. Count II of the original complaint was a claim for intentional misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">In his answer to the original complaint defendant Joseph Miskinis, Jr., denied being the sole owner of the theaters in question and answered that the Oak Drive-In was owned by a Michigan corporation, that the Civic Theatre was owned by a Michigan partnership, and that the defendant had a minority interest in each entity. Plaintiffs subsequently moved to add parties defendant. The motion was granted, and plaintiffs filed an amended complaint naming as defendants the Oak Drive-In Theatre and the Civic Theatre in addition to Joseph Miskinis.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">During the course of discovery plaintiffs moved the trial court for an order requiring defendants to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>produce their business books and records for examination. Defendants raised the privilege against self-incrimination in opposition to this motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion, but limited the scope of discoverable documents to those pertaining to the defendants\u2019 theater operations from January 1, 1976, to December 31, 1978. The court further ordered \"that neither the plaintiffs nor their agents, employees, or independent contractors who perform the copying and examination of the aforesaid books, documents, and records shall disclose the information obtained from those books, documents, and records during such copying and examination to anyone except plaintiffs\u2019 legal counsel or this court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Defendants sought leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals, which was granted. The Court affirmed the judgment of the lower court in an unpublished per curiam opinion. The Court of Appeals rejected defendants\u2019 claim that the production of documents was protected by the privilege against self-incrimination, Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17; US Const, Am V. Reasoning that the privilege against self-incrimination applies only to natural persons and that a corporation, a creature of the state, could not assert the privilege to avoid the production of its records, the Court of Appeals held that production was justified because the records were those of a particular corporation as opposed to the personal records of any individual. The officer of the corporation in possession of corporate books could not assert his own privilege against self-incrimination to prevent their disclosure inasmuch as he only held the records pursuant to his duty to the corpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>ration, unless the materials were his own personal records. This reasoning was also found to be applicable to a partnership. The Court of Appeals modified the trial court\u2019s order to the extent that it could be read as requiring production of Joseph Miskinis\u2019 personal tax returns if they should be found by the trial court to be personally incriminating to the individual defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">This Court granted defendants\u2019 application for leave to appeal. 414 Mich 868 (1982). We affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">II. Federal Constitutional Provision: Amendment V</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">We begin our analysis with an examination of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to determine whether federal constitutional law prohibits the compelled production of the documents at issue in this case. The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination is a personal privilege and cannot be asserted on behalf of another. The privilege applies only to natural persons and thus cannot be utilized by or on behalf of any organization, such as a corporation. <em>United States v White, </em>322 US 694; 64 S Ct 1248; 88 L Ed 1542 (1944); <em>Hale v Henkel, </em>201 US 43; 26 S Ct 370; 50 L Ed 652 (1906).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the custodian of an organization\u2019s books and records cannot refuse to produce the documents even if they might be personally incriminating to the custodian. In <em>Wilson v United States, </em>221 US 361; 31 S Ct 538; 55 L Ed 771 (1911), the Court upheld the contempt conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>of Wilson, president of the United Wireless Telegraph Company, for his refusal to obey a grand jury subpoena duces tecum requiring the production of the corporation\u2019s letter-press copy books. The Court focused on the nature of the documents as the books of the corporation and on the capacity in which they were held, despite the fact that Wilson himself had written many of the business entries in his capacity as executive officer of the corporation. The <em>Wilson </em>Court reasoned that because of the corporate form of business activity, with its chartered privileges, the corporation could not refuse the government\u2019s demand to examine books when that demand is expressed in lawful process and is reasonable under the circumstances. \"This is involved in the reservation of the visitatorial power of the state, and in the authority of the National Government where the corporate activities are in the domain subject to the powers of Congress.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>p 382. See also <em>Hale v Henkel, supra, </em>pp 74-75. The reserved power of visitation would be defeated if \"guilty officers could refuse inspection of the records and papers of the corporation\u201d, and it was held that the visitatorial power which existed with respect to the corporation necessarily reached the corporate books regardless of the conduct of the custodian.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">While the Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Wilson </em>could fairly be read as applying only to the production of corporate documents, subsequent decisions of the Court make clear that production of documents of other types of organizations may be compelled against Fifth Amendment objections. In <em>United States v White, </em>322 US 694; 64 S Ct 1248; 88 L Ed 1542 (1944), it was held that an \"assistant supervisor\u201d of an unincorporated labor union who had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>possession<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of books subpoenaed by a federal grand jury could not refuse to produce the documents even though they might have tended to incriminate the union and himself personally. The Court held that individuals, when acting as representatives of a collective group, are not exercising their personal rights, duties, and privileges, but rather assume the rights, duties, and privileges of the entity of which they are agents or officers and are bound by its obligations. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-4\">\"The reason underlying the restriction of this constitutional privilege to natural individuals acting in their own private capacity is clear. The scope and nature of the economic activities of incorporated and unincorporated organizations and their representatives demand that the constitutional power of the federal and state governments to regulate those activities be correspondingly effective. The greater portion of evidence of wrongdoing by an organization or its representatives is usually to be found in the official records and documents of that organization. Were the cloak of the privilege to be thrown around these impersonal records and documents, effective enforcement of many federal and state laws would be impossible. See <em>Hale v Henkel, supra, </em>70, 74; 8 Wigmore on Evidence (3d ed), \u00a7 2259a. The framers of the constitutional guarantee against compulsory self-disclosure, who were interested primarily in protecting individual civil liberties, cannot be said to have intended the privilege to be available to protect economic or other interests of such organizations so as to nullify appropriate governmental regulations.\u201d <em>White, </em>p 700.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Most relevant to our present analysis is the Court\u2019s reasoning that an association\u2019s inability to rely on the privilege against self-incrimination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>does not depend solely on the fact that the state charters corporations and retains visitatorial powers over them,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but rather on the \"inherent and necessary power of the federal and state governments to enforce their laws, with the privilege against self-incrimination being limited to its historic function of protecting only the natural individual from compulsory incrimination through his own testimony or personal records\u201d. <em>White, </em>pp 700-701. The Court articulated the following standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-6\">\"The test, rather, is whether one can fairly say under all the circumstances that a particular type of organization has a character so impersonal in the scope of its membership and activities that it cannot be said to embody or represent the purely private or personal interests of its constituents, but rather to embody their common or group interests only. If so, the privilege cannot be invoked on behalf of the organization or its representatives in their official capacity.\u201d <em>White, </em>p 701.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-7\"><em>Bellis v United States, </em>417 US 85; 94 S Ct 2179; 40 L Ed 2d 678 (1974), dispels any suggestion that the <em>White </em>test depends solely on the size of the organization. Bellis had been one of the three partners of the law firm Bellis, Kolsby &amp; Wolf. After he left the firm to join another law firm, the partnership was dissolved, and the other two partners formed a new partnership. Almost four years after the dissolution of the earlier partnership, Bellis was served with a subpoena directing him to appear before a grand jury and to bring the partnership records that were in his possession. Bellis asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege as a basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>for refusing production of the records, and he was held in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">In <em>Bellis </em>the Supreme Court reasoned that the \"organized, institutional activity\u201d language used in <em>United States v White, supra, </em>\"presupposes the existence of an organization which is recognized as an independent entity apart from its individual members\u201d that \"must maintain a distinct set of organizational records, and recognize rights in its members of control and access to them\u201d. The subpoenaed records must in fact be organizational records held in a representative capacity, and it must be fair to say that the records demanded are the records of the organization rather than those of the individual. <em>Bellis, supra, </em>pp 92-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">The Court held that partnerships could represent organized institutional activity so as to preclude any claim of Fifth Amendment privilege with respect to the partnership\u2019s financial records. With respect to the small size of the partnership,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Court found that the partnership had an established institutional identity independent of its individual members observing, among other things,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that the firm held itself out to third parties as an entity with an independent existence. The Court flatly rejected any suggestion that the Court\u2019s formulation in <em>White, supra, </em>could be reduced to a simple proposition based solely upon the size of the organization. The Court found that Beilis held the subpoenaed partnership records in a representative capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>From the federal precedent discussed above we distill a three-step inquiry for determining whether the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination prohibits the compelled production of an organization\u2019s documents:</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">1. Are the documents the records of the organization rather than those of the individual who has possession of them?</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">2. Does the custodian hold the records in a representative, rather than a personal, capacity?</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">Assuming affirmative answers, in the case of a corporation the inquiry is ended because of the special nature of the corporate form and the state\u2019s reservation of visitatorial powers over corporations. See <em>Bellis v United States, supra; United States v White, supra; Grant v United States, </em>227 US 74; 33 S Ct 190; 57 L Ed 423 (1913); <em>Wilson v United States, </em>221 US 361, 382; 31 S Ct 538; 55 L Ed 771 (1911). In the case of non-corporate organizations, however, a third question arises:</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">3. Does the organization have an established institutional identity which is recognized as an entity apart from its individual members?</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">With respect to the first question, <em>i.e., </em>the identity of the documents, we note that there has been no assertion by defendants that the documents for which production was compelled are the personal documents of Joseph Miskinis, Jr., the individual asserting the privilege. The trial court\u2019s order,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>modified by the Court of Appeals,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> required the production of corporate and partnership records only.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">Nor is there any argument that Joseph Miskinis, Jr., holds these records in a personal capacity. In their answers to interrogatories and in their brief in support of this appeal, defendants admit that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Joseph Miskinis, Jr., had possession of the records of the partnership and corporation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, regardless of whether he held these documents as the official or authorized custodian of the corporate and partnership records, since he had possession of all of the desired documents, Miskinis must be deemed, for purposes of this litigation, to be holding the records on behalf of the organization. See <em>United States v White, supra, </em>and fn 3 <em>supra. </em>Otherwise, an organization could shield itself from the compulsory production of documents merely by the expedient of dividing possession of the documents among more than one of its members, none of whom is regarded as the official custodian of records.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Our finding that the documents are corporate documents held by Joseph Miskinis, Jr., in a representative capacity makes unnecessary any further analysis with respect to the documents of the corporate defendant, Oak Drive-In Theatre Company. We hold that the production of these documents is not prohibited by the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">With respect to the documents of the partnership Civic Theatre Company, however, our analysis does not end here, and we must determine whether the partnership has an established institutional identity which is recognized as an entity apart from its individual members. We find that it does have such an independent identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">Defendants argue that plaintiffs always dealt with defendants as if they were dealing solely with Joseph Miskinis, Jr., and that this action was initially commenced solely against him. The test for determining whether an entity had an indepen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>dent identity for Fifth Amendment purposes, however, is not the knowledge of the plaintiffs, but rather how the defendants were perceived by the public at large and whether the organization held itself out to third parties as an entity with an independent existence. See text accompanying fn 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">In support of our finding we rely upon the fact that the Civic Theatre Company maintained separate partnership records and had a separate bank account. <em>Bellis, supra. </em>The Civic Theatre employed more than one hundred temporary employees during the four-year period of 1977 to 1980. Most persuasive, however, is the fact that at the commencement of this litigation the individual defendant asserted the partnership structure of the Civic Theatre as a bar to his personal liability. Indeed, he answered the original complaint by stating that he owned only a minority interest in both business entities, thereby relying upon the separate partnership identity of the Civic Theatre Company to avoid personal liability. Having done so, it is proper to permit all of the parties to rely on the existence of the partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Defendants have repeatedly argued in support of the Fifth Amendment privilege that the plaintiffs always believed that they were dealing exclusively with Joseph Miskinis, Jr.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This argument and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>facts of this case would lead to the incongruous result that the business was identified with Joseph Miskinis, Jr., a minority interest owner, and that the owners of the majority interest were not even identified as the individuals who comprised the business. The logical result of defendants\u2019 argument would be that the minority owner could assert his privilege against self-incrimination because he was known to plaintiffs, but that the owners of the majority interest could not assert this privilege to protect the production of records because their ownership interest was unknown, leaving unprotected those against whom the documents would probably be most incriminating.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Hence, adopting defendants\u2019 reasoning would require reformulating the relevant inquiry. The issue would turn not on the objective reality of the business relationship, but rather on how the relationship was subjectively perceived. The availability of the Fifth Amendment privilege would rest then on ad hoc determinations which would make the privilege available to certain members of an organization with respect to some parties and not with respect to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">Moreover, we find that the existence of \"secret\u201d or unknown partners supports a finding of an established institutional identity apart from the individual members. Obviously, the unknown partners have no individual identity with respect to the business operations to confer upon the organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">We are mindful of the following language in <em>Bellis v United States, supra, </em>417 US 101, relied upon by defendants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>\"This might be a different case if it involved a small family partnership, see <em>United States v Slutsky, </em>352 F Supp 1105 (SD NY, 1972); <em>In re Subpoena Duces Tecum, </em>81 F Supp [418, 421 (ND Cal, 1948)], or, as the Solicitor General suggests, * * * if there were some other preexisting relationship of confidentiality among the partners.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">Having examined the cases cited, we conclude that the language merely was meant to restate that the papers required to be produced must not be the private and personal papers of the individuals held in a personal capacity. While this is a \"family\u201d partnership, we read the Court\u2019s use of this word to denote a partnership so small and informal that the partnership\u2019s records and papers are inseparable from the personal and private papers of its members. Such is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the compelled production of the corporate and partnership records and books does not violate the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">III. Michigan Constitutional Provision: Article 1, Section 17</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">Defendants argue alternatively that even if production of the records and books is not protected under the federal constitution, it is protected under the Michigan Constitution, Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-8\">\"Sec. 17. No person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of law. The right of all individuals, firms, corporations and voluntary associations to fair and just treatment in the course of legislative and executive investigations and hearings shall not be infringed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">Plaintiffs respond that the Michigan constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>tional provision is identical to the federal provision and has been treated similarly by this Court. The precedents relied upon by defendants are distinguishable on the ground that they involve disclosures in the context of criminal proceedings. Plaintiffs argue that public policy does not warrant an application of the Michigan Constitution disparate from that of the United States Constitution and that to adopt the principles urged by defendants would result in the establishment of imponderable barriers to effective civil discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Having examined prior decisions of this Court, we find nothing which requires an interpretation of our constitutional privilege against self-incrimination different from that of the United States Constitution. \"The provision in each Constitution is the same.\u201d <em>In re Moser, </em>138 Mich 302, 305; 101 NW 588 (1904).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">Initially we note that our holding does not depend on the fact that all of the precedent relied upon by defendants involves cases where production was required in a criminal proceeding, as plaintiffs suggest. The constitutional privilege against self-incrimination applies to evidence in a civil proceeding which might subject the witness to criminal prosecution. <em>Berney v Volk, </em>341 Mich 647, 651; 67 NW2d 801 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">This Court has previously addressed the issue of the production of corporate documents in two cases. In <em>In re Moser, supra, </em>a grand jury investigating corruption among municipal officers subpoenaed the books and records of the company of which Moser was president. Moser had possession of the subpoenaed books and records. He refused to produce the books, but not for the reason that they would incriminate him.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moser was convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>of contempt of court. His conviction was affirmed by this Court. Noting that the documents could not have been incriminating to Moser since he was not associated with the corporation during the relevant time period, this Court found that the sole basis for the petitioner\u2019s refusal to produce the books was his desire to protect the officers of the corporation during the time under investigation. The Court stated the rule thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-5\">\"We think the rule is this: <em>One cannot be compelled to produce his own books, or the books of another, which are under his control as agent or otherwise, where their production would tend to criminate him; neither can his clerk, whose possession is his possession, be required to produce them; </em>but when, as the agent of another, he chooses to make entries on the books of that other, and those books are in the actual and legal possession and control of another officer of the corporation, or of the corporation itself, such officer may be compelled to produce them, in a proper case, under a subpoena duces tecum.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>In re Moser, </em>pp 314-315.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-6\"><em>St John v General Motors Corp, </em>308 Mich 333; 13 NW2d 840 (1944), was a civil action commenced by 28 female employees of the defendant to recover the difference between wages paid them and those paid to male employees engaged in similar employment. The plaintiffs sought the defendant\u2019s employment records by subpoena duces tecum, and the defendant objected to the introduction at trial of the records on the ground of self-incrimination because the alleged wage discrimination was a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">The <em>St John </em>Court, p 337, cited <em>Moser </em>for the proposition that \"the privilege against self-incrimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>nation is personal to a witness and cannot be claimed in behalf of another, inclusive of an employing corporation, <em>unless guilt of the witness producing the record is also involved\u201d. </em>(Emphasis added.) This Court held that the privilege did not apply to the subpoenaed documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Defendants rely on the language from <em>Moser </em>and <em>St John, </em>emphasized above, to support their contention that the books and records are privileged if they will be personally incriminating to Miskinis. We agree that these opinions lend themselves to such an interpretation. Nevertheless, we find, as did the Court of Appeals, that the emphasized portions of these opinions are dicta to the extent that they state that a custodian of corporate and partnership records can refuse to produce them on the grounds that they are personally incriminating to him because neither Court was faced squarely with, nor fully addressed, the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">Now being faced squarely with the. issue in this context, we decline to construe art 1, \u00a7 17 more liberally than the Fifth Amendment. This constitutional provision \"should be construed to effect a practical and beneficial purpose\u201d. <em>In re Watson, </em>293 Mich 263, 275; 291 NW 652 (1940). So sweeping an interpretation is not dictated by, nor consonant with, public policy. Such a ruling would drastically impede the investigation of white collar crime, <em>e.g, </em>tax evasion, embezzlement, bribery, and corruption. Moreover, discovery in civil cases would be severely restricted whenever the conduct underlying the civil liability might also give rise to criminal liability, <em>e.g., </em>antitrust violations and securities fraud. See <em>St John v General Motors Corp, supra. </em>This would be contrary to Michigan\u2019s \"strong historical commitment to a far-reaching, open and effective discovery practice\u201d. <em>Daniels v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number><em>Allen Industries, Inc, </em>391 Mich 398, 403; 216 NW2d 762 (1974). Permitting custodians of an organization\u2019s records to assert their privilege to bar production of the documents would encourage persons contemplating criminal conduct to carry it out under the name of a corporation or partnership, thus guaranteeing immunity from personal civil liability while enjoying the personal privilege against self-incrimination. Indeed, as we noted earlier, the individual defendant, Joseph Miskinis himself, raised the separate legal status of the theater, answering the original complaint by denying personal liability on the grounds that the Oak Drive-In Theatre and the Civic Theatre were owned by a corporation and by a partnership, respectively, and that he had a minority interest in each entity. Defendant, having shielded himself from civil liability behind the veil of the corporate and partnership entities, cannot now lift the veil to gain the benefit of using his personal privilege to conceal business records.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">Defendants also argue, however, that an amendment to the provision made in the constitution precludes the production of the documents here. Prior to adoption of the Constitution of 1963, the analogous provision of the Constitution of 1908 was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-6\">\"No person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of law.\u201d Const 1908, art 2, \u00a7 16.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">The Constitution of 1963 kept the above-quoted language intact and added the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-8\">\"The right of all individuals, firms, corporations and voluntary associations to fair and just treatment in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>course of legislative and executive investigations and hearings shall not be infringed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Defendants rely on the inclusion of the word \"individuals\u201d and argue that by including individuals, without distinction, with firms, corporations, and voluntary associations, it is clear that an individual who is an officer of a corporation or a partner in a firm who is in control of, and in charge of, and who is responsible for the composition, contents, possession and authorship of documents and records, is fully entitled to the benefits of the privilege against self-incrimination. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">The record of the Constitutional Convention makes clear that this added language. was intended as a new guarantee of fair and just treatment in <em>legislative </em>and <em>executive </em>investigations.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This amendment was not intended to modify the scope of the privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">Finally, since the minority opinion avoids the issue of the scope of the Michigan constitutional provision against self-incrimination by finding that there was a contractual waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination, a comment on this analysis is appropriate. The contractual waiver provision was never raised by any party and was neither briefed nor argued before this Court. We would not hold that this Court should never ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>dress an issu\u00e9 not raised by the parties. Indeed, this Court has done so, rarely, in limited circumstances where justice so required. See, <em>e.g., City of Dearborn v Bacila, </em>353 Mich 99, 118; 90 NW2d 863 (1958). Nevertheless, where it appears that there may be a cognizable response to an issue, the preferable course of action would be a remand to permit the trial court to resolve the issue. The minority has cited no case for the proposition that this Court can resolve a case on the basis of an issue not raised by the parties in order to avoid resolution of a constitutional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Accordingly, we hold that the compelled production of the books and records of the Oak Drive-In Theatre Company and the Civic Theatre Company is not violative of Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17. The trial court\u2019s order, as modified by the Court of Appeals, adequately protects the individual defendant\u2019s right against self-incrimination with respect to non-corporate and non-partnership records.

Our reading of the discovery order leaves us with the impression that all of the requested records fit within this holding. Nonetheless, it is conceivable that item #7, requiring production of 'Federal, state, and local tax returns on which the proceeds from ticket and concession sales were reported\u2019, could include defendant Miskinis\u2019s personal tax returns, as opposed to just those of the corporation and partnership. Should the order turn out to cover personal tax returns and should defendant Miskinis be convinced that such returns contain incriminating information, Miskinis may present the returns to the trial court to determine whether that is the case. The trial court, upon determining that such returns are incriminating personal records, shall delete any incriminating portions and permit plaintiffs to examine and copy the remaining parts to the extent they are pertinent to this lawsuit.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b818-9\"> Defendants admit that Joseph Miskinis, Jr., has possession of all of the partnership\u2019s records, but it is not clear whether he has all of the corporation\u2019s records.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b819-7\"> We note that the original complaint named \"Joseph Miskinis d/ b/a Oak Drive-In Theatre and Civic Theatre\u201d as the defendant, and names only \"Joseph Miskinis\u201d throughout the complaint.

We also concur with the majority\u2019s decision that Miskinis is not protected by the state privilege from compelled disclosure of the documents. We would hold against his claim of the state privilege, however, because the privilege was waived in the contracts entered into between the plaintiffs and the corporate and partnership defendants. In light of that waiver, we need not reach the question whether this Court should adopt as an exception to the state constitutional privilege the exception to the Fifth Amendment privilege that has been so enunciated by the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Miskinis, his mother Mary Miskinis, and his now deceased father Joseph Miskinis, Sr., were partners in a partnership and owned 75% of the capital stock of a corporation that exhibited motion pictures. Miskinis, acting for the partnership and corporation, entered into license agreements with most of the nationwide distributors of motion pictures. Under these agreements, the distributors retained ownership of the motion pictures and permitted exhibitors to show the films. In return, the exhibitor agreed to pay the distributor a percentage of his theater\u2019s gross receipts. To protect against an exhibitor\u2019s understating gross receipts, the license agreements included a requirement that the exhibitor prepare and submit statements of the daily gross receipts. The license agreements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>also required the exhibitor to retain his records for at least four years. The distributors reserved the right in the agreements to inspect the exhibitor\u2019s records at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Believing that the Miskinis partnership and corporation were understating their gross receipts, and hence paying the distributors less than contractually required, the distributors asked to examine the corporate and partnership records. Their request was denied. The distributors commenced this action alleging breach of contract, in failing to allow inspection of the documents and in submitting false statements of gross receipts, and, originally, intentional misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Miskinis, one of several defendants, possesses most of the records sought in this action. He again refused, after the action was commenced, to produce them for inspection by the distributors, claiming his federal and state constitutional privileges against compelled self-incrimination. The circuit court found that neither the federal nor the state privilege applies to corporate or partnership records and ordered Miskinis to produce the records. The distributors were ordered not to disclose any information which they might find in those records to anyone except their legal counsel or the court. The Court of Appeals affirmed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>We would affirm, although for different reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">The Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination, applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> may be claimed in civil proceedings<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> if the person claiming the privilege is subject to criminal prosecution and disclosure may incriminate him.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Miskinis may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>subject to criminal prosecution for the activities disclosed in the documents now sought,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and therefore may assert the privilege in a civil action.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">The Fifth Amendment privilege applies to the compelled production of documents to the extent that a person might incriminate himself by producing them.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In this case, Miskinis would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>authenticating documents he produces as being the ones that he kept and the ones that the plaintiffs seek. Neither the circuit court nor the Court of Appeals found that Miskinis\u2019 production of these documents would not be incriminating; neither court found that a subsequent criminal prosecution of Miskinis is not possible, or is no more than an imaginary prospect. Accordingly, unless an exception to the Fifth Amendment privilege precludes Miskinis from invoking it, he may not be compelled to produce the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">The Fifth Amendment privilege, however, no longer protects corporate or partnership documents from disclosure.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The \"corporate documents\u201d exception was first stated in <em>Wilson v United </em>States, 221 US 361, 381-385; 31 S Ct 538; 55 L Ed 771 (1911), where the United States Supreme Court held that a person could be compelled to produce corporate documents that incriminated him. The Court said that, by allowing a business to incorporate, the state reserved the right to inspect the corporation\u2019s documents to assure that the corporation was not abusing the privileges granted by the state. The right of visitation, said the court, was an implied aspect of the compact between the corporation and the state, and could be availed of by the federal government. See id., p 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>The corporate documents exception was then enlarged to require a member of an unincorporated union to produce incriminating union documents. See <em>United States v White, 322 </em>US 694; 64 S Ct 1248; 88 L Ed 1542 (1944). The Court concluded that the state\u2019s need to regulate the economic activities of large organizations justified an expansion of the corporate documents exception. See <em>White, supra, </em>pp 700-701.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>The Court in <em>White </em>looked to whether the character of the organization was personal or impersonal to distinguish those organizations whose business documents were protected by the Fifth Amendment from those organizations whose documents were not so protected. If the organization had \"a character so impersonal in the scope of its membership and activities that it cannot be said to embody or represent the purely private or personal interests of its constituents, but rather to embody their common or group interests only\u201d, the Fifth Amendment privilege would not apply to its documents. See <em>id., </em>p 701. The Court noted that the union had a perpetual life and that there was a potential for conflict between the organization and its members; it did not discuss the degree to which the union represented its members to third persons, or whether persons doing business with the union thought in terms of doing business with an independent organizational entity. The language of the test enunciated, and the facts relevant to its application, suggested that the Court was concerned with the relationship between the organization and its members rather than the relationship between the organization and those with whom it did business.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>In <em>Bellis v United States, </em>417 US 85, 95-100; 94 S Ct 2179; 40 L Ed 2d 678 (1974), the Court held that a former partner in a dissolved three-member law firm could be compelled to produce self-incriminating partnership documents,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and appeared to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>abandon the test enunciated in <em>White.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The new test announced in <em>Bellis </em>focused on whether the partnership had \"an established institutional identity independent of its individual partners\u201d. Rather than inquiring into the relationship between the members of the partnership and the partnership entity, as suggested in <em>White, </em>the Court inquired into, among other things, the formality of the partnership\u2019s organization and its finances, properties, tax liability, and stationery. The Court declared that the partnership had \"held itself out to third parties as an entity with an independent institutional identity\u201d. Also important was that the petitioner, like the union member in <em>White, </em>did not own the records directly, but vicariously through his membership in the entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">The \"corporate documents\u201d exception to the Fifth Amendment appears to have grown as the Court has seen a governmental need to regulate the business activities that might be disclosed in documents. This growth has extended an exception to the privilege first recognized in relation to corporations, in light of their incorporation compact with the state, to the documents of large impersonal organizations and then to the. documents of small, personal partnerships. Recently, the Court re-examined<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the rule that the Fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>Amendment privilege protects the business documents of a sole proprietor.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> That the Court confronted what once was regarded as a settled issue demonstrates just how fluid the exception has become.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">In light of the exception developed by the United States Supreme Court, we concur with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the Fifth Amendment privilege does not apply to the documents now being sought.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">By extending the exception to the Fifth Amendment privilege developed by the United States Supreme Court to the state constitutional privilege, the majority declines to follow previous inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>pretations of the scope and protections accorded by the state privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">This Court has stated, and thereafter reaffirmed, that the state constitutional privilege against compelled self-incrimination should be construed liberally. See <em>In re Schnitzer, </em>295 Mich 736, 740; 295 NW 478 (1940); <em>People ex rel Moll v Danziger, </em>238 Mich 39, 42; 213 NW 448 (1927); <em>Joslin v Noret, </em>224 Mich 240, 244; 194 NW 983 (1923). As with the Fifth Amendment privilege, the state \"constitutional provisions regarding the privilege against self-incrimination also apply to [disclosure] in a civil proceeding which might subject the witness to criminal prosecution.\u201d A person thus may \"assert the privilege in a civil proceeding * * * even though its assertion would work a hardship upon the civil plaintiff who has no interest whatever in a criminal action if brought.\u201d <em>Berney v Volk, </em>341 Mich 647, 651-653; 67 NW2d 801 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">This Court has said that the state privilege applies to corporate and partnership documents. The scope, as well as the limits, of the state privilege were discussed in <em>In re Moser, </em>138 Mich 302, 313-315; 101 NW 588 (1904):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-7\">\"No private individual can be compelled to produce his books or papers for the purpose of affording evidence against himself in a criminal prosecution. Neither can the subterfuge of subpoenaing his clerk, who has access to or temporary possession of the books for the purpose of his employer\u2019s business, be resorted to, to compel a production of the books. The possession of the clerk in such case is the possession of his employer. * * * One cannot be compelled to produce his own books, or the books of another, which are under his control as agent or otherwise, where their production would tend to criminate him; neither can his clerk, whose possession is his possession, be required to produce them\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>The Court, discussing the \"unreported case of <em>Frazer v Circuit Judge\u201d, </em>said that a person\u2019s privilege against compelled disclosure of self-incriminating documents applied to corporate records:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-5\">\"In that case the officers of the Detroit City Railway Company, in whose possession and control the books were, and who were under investigation by the grand jury, were ordered by a subpoena duces tecum to produce the books. It requires no argument to show that they were thus required to produce testimony against themselves and were therefore within the protection of the Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-6\"><em>In re Moser </em>was decided shortly after the United States Supreme Court had held that the Fifth Amendment privilege protected a member of a small partnership from being compelled to produce incriminating partnership records that the partnership was required by federal law to keep. See <em>Boyd v United States, </em>116 US 616; 6 S Ct 524; 29 L Ed 746 (1886). In light of the holding in <em>Boyd, </em>which was cited approvingly in <em>In re </em>Moser,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> this Court could thus declare with complete accuracy that \"[t]he provision in each Constitution is the same\u201d.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This Court has reiterated the view that a person may not be compelled to produce incriminating business documents, see <em>People v Marxhausen, </em>204 Mich 559, 568-574; 171 NW 557 (1919) (quoting <em>Boyd </em>with approval), or incriminating corporate documents, see <em>St John v General Motors Corp, </em>308 Mich 333, 337; 13 NW2d 840 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Today the majority limits the application of the state constitutional privilege to those situations where the federal privilege, with its significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>limitations by the United States Supreme Court,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> continues to apply.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> By so limiting the Michigan constitutional privilege, the majority holds that a state protection once considered to be undoubted no longer exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Although this Court may adopt in the construction of the state constitution those Fifth Amendment doctrines developed by the United States Supreme Court that we are persuaded are correct, we are not bound to incorporate all such doctrines as the measure of the state constitutional privi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>lege. We are not prepared to join at this time in adopting a doctrine as fluid as the exception developed in the <em>Wilson, White, </em>and <em>Bellis </em>decisions as the measure of the state privilege. We nevertheless would require Miskinis to produce the corporate and partnership documents on another basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">We would hold that Miskinis may be compelled to produce the documents because the Miskinis corporation and partnership contractually agreed to disclose the documents to the plaintiffs.

The receipts depended on the number of tickets sold each day. Aware that persons in defendants\u2019 position could understate their ticket sales and pay plaintiffs less than required, plaintiffs required defendants to keep accurate records, reserved the right to inspect or \"visit\u201d those records, and made spot attendance checks. The reservation of such a visitorial privilege is reasonable under the circumstances,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and is similar to the visitorial privilege held in <em>Wilson </em>to have been reserved by the state.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">This Court is not foreclosed from deciding this case on the basis of a contractual waiver of the state privilege by a failure of the plaintiffs to raise the waiver question explicitly. Although the plaintiffs did not argue that Miskinis\u2019 state privilege against compelled self-incrimination was \"waived\u201d in the contracts between the plaintiffs and the Miskinis corporation and partnership, they did argue that Miskinis\u2019 duty to disclose the docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>ments now sought is based in part on those contracts. The plaintiffs, relying on the contracts, contended that the Miskinis corporation and partnership had a fiduciary duty to render an accounting because, as the plaintiffs have urged, they were acting as trustees for the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs also maintained that a contractual agreement to disclose documents justifies a court in compelling disclosure where, but for the contractual agreement, disclosure could not be compelled.

In <em>Doe, </em>the Court held that a sole proprietor could not be compelled to produce business records that he had written and continued to possess. In doing so, the United States Supreme Court affirmed the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which had held that a sole proprietor could not be compelled to produce his business records when that production would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>testimonial aspects that would incriminate him. <em>1980 Grand Jury, </em>fn 9 <em>supra, </em>pp 334-336.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">A majority of the Supreme Court, however, \"reversed\u201d the Third Circuit\u2019s alternative holding that the <em>contents </em>of a sole proprietor\u2019s business documents, like a person\u2019s most private diaries, were themselves protected from compelled disclosure by the Fifth Amendment. <em>Doe, supra, </em>79 L Ed 2d 557-558.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">The Third Circuit had noted that, until the Supreme Court decided <em>Fisher v United States, </em>fn 9 <em>supra, </em>the Fifth Amendment had been viewed as protecting from compelled production the <em>contents </em>of a person\u2019s private papers, as distinguished from his business papers. <em>1980 Grand Jury, </em>fn 9 <em>supra, </em>pp 331-333. The Court of Appeals recognized that in <em>Fisher </em>the Supreme Court \"seemingly diverged\u201d from that established view when it said that \"the fifth amendment 'applies only when the accused is compelled to make a <em>testimonial </em>communication that is incriminating\u2019. * * * In effect, the focus of the Court had shifted from privacy to the process of compulsion\u201d. <em>1980 Grand Jury, </em>fn 9 <em>supra, </em>pp 331-332, quoting <em>Fisher, </em>fn 9 <em>supra, </em>p 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">The Third Circuit nevertheless had continued to adhere to the view \"that the fifth amendment privilege applies, even after <em>Fisher, </em>to an individual\u2019s production of his private papers\u201d. <em>Id., </em>p 333. Other courts had similarly read <em>Fisher\u2019s </em>analysis narrowly and held that the Fifth Amendment protects an individual from being compelled to produce private records such as diaries because their contents, rather than the act of producing them, incriminated the individual.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>Concluding that the contents of a sole proprietor\u2019s business documents were as protected from compelled production by the Fifth Amendment as his private diaries, the Third Circuit had suggested that their production could not be compelled even if the act of producing them did not have incriminating testimonial aspects. Although affirming the judgment of the Third Circuit, a majority of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Doe </em>\"reversed\u201d the court\u2019s alternative rationale because that rationale had based the protection of the Fifth Amendment on the private nature of the contents of the documents rather than the incriminating nature of the act of producing them. The majority thus reiterated the <em>Fisher </em>analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-5\">\"Where the preparation of business records is voluntary, no compulsion is present. * * * Respondent does not contend that he prepared the documents involuntarily or that the subpoena would force him to restate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>repeat, or affirm the truth of their contents.\u201d <em>Doe, supra, </em>79 L Ed 2d 559-560.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">Justice O\u2019Connor concurred, but wrote separately</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-5\">\"just to make explicit what is implicit in the analysis of [the majority] opinion: that the Fifth Amendment provides absolutely no protection for the contents of private papers of any kind. The notion that the Fifth Amendment protects the privacy of papers originated in <em>Boyd v United States, </em>116 US 616, 630 (1886), but our decision in <em>Fisher v United States, </em>425 US 391 (1976), sounded the death-knell for <em>Boyd. </em>* * * [l]ts privacy of papers concept 'had long been a rule searching for a rationale * * *.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>p 409.

Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the Fifth Amendment privilege does not protect documents of family partnerships. Under the <em>White </em>test family partnerships might have been considered sufficiently personal in nature so that the Fifth Amendment protected documents of such partnerships. Under <em>Bellis, </em>p 95, however, the Fifth Amendment is inapplicable to a partnership which has \"an established institutional identity independent of its individual partners\u201d. Because family partnerships may have such an independent identity to the same extent as non-family partnerships, they presumably should be treated no differently. Other courts have refused to distinguish small family partnerships from the small, three-member law firm in <em>Bellis, </em>and have held that partnership documents were not protected by the Fifth Amendment privilege. See <em>United States v Alderson, </em>646 F2d 421, 422-423 (CA 9, 1981); <em>United States v Hankins, </em>565 F2d 1344 (CA 5, 1978); <em>United States v Mahady &amp; Mahady, </em>512 F2d 521, 524 (CA 3, 1975); <em>In re Sentinel Financial Instruments, </em>553 F Supp 71, 72-76 (SD NY, 1982); <em>In the Matter of September, 1975 Special Grand Jury, </em>435 F Supp 538, 542-546 (ND Ind, 1977); <em>South Carolina Tax Comm v Reeves, </em>278 SC 658; 300 SE2d 916, 916-917 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>(1983); <em>People v Lynch, </em>83 Ill App 3d 479, 481-485; 404 NE2d 814 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">To be sure, the majority in <em>Bellis, </em>p 101, wrote that \"[t]his might be a different case if it involved a small family partnership, see <em>United States v Slutsky, </em>352 F Supp 1105 (SD NY, 1972); <em>In re Subpoena Duces Tecum, </em>81 F Supp 418, 421 (ND Cal, 1948)\u201d. Nevertheless, the Court failed to suggest an analytic reason why a different result might be justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">In <em>In re Subpoena Duces Tecum, </em>pp 420-421, one of the two cases cited in <em>Bellis, </em>a United States district court held that documents that belonged to a small family partnership were protected by the Fifth Amendment. The court first, noted that, under state law, ownership and possession of partnership documents were both shared and personal. The court held that the test in <em>White, supra, </em>which had extended the \"corporate documents\u201d exception to impersonal unincorporated organizations, did not apply to small family partnerships:</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">\"It is only when a group or association of persons is 'so impersonal in the scope of its membership and activities that it cannot * * * represent the purely private or personal interests of its constituents\u2019, that the right is unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">\"I am of the opinion that the doctrine of <em>United States v White </em>* * * cannot be extended to the members of a partnership * * * whose only purpose is to conduct the personal business of the partners and to divide and share their profits and losses for their mutual benefit and protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">\"It may be that some partnerships, which have a large number of partners * * * might * * * take on the habiliments of an association or corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-11\">\"But certainly this small family partnership does not reach such a stature. The nature of this partnership is not of the kind that the partners\u2019 ownership of their own papers in common, is any less personal [than their own individually owned documents].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-12\">In <em>United States v Slutsky, </em>pp 1106-1109, the other case cited in <em>Beilis, </em>two brothers, who had formed a partnership to run a business started by their father, refused to produce the partnership\u2019s business records. The partnership, consisting solely of the two brothers, operated a resort hotel country club. The club had a payroll of approximately $1,000,000, gross receipts of $4,000,000, and buildings worth approximately $4,400,000. It employed several full- and part-time cashiers, a full-time bookkeeper, and a full-time accountant. The two partners and their two sons lived on and personally managed the resort premises. Applying the test enunciated in <em>White, </em>the United States district court held that the partners could not be compelled to produce partnership documents. The court recognized that the size of a partnership was not determinative under that test. \"The Supreme Court in <em>White </em>emphasized the nature of the group associated, as well as its size.\u201d Examining the nature of the association of the brothers\u2019 partnership, the court wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b838-13\">\"This small family partnership is not so impersonal in the scope of its membership and activities that it cannot represent the purely private or personal interests of its constituents. Some partnerships <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>consisting of a large number of partners, some special or limited as well as general, might be so impersonal in the scope of the membership and activities that the firm does not embody the personal or private interest of the constituent partners. Surely this two-brother family partnership does not reach such status * * *. [The resort] appears to be a personal family business, albeit large and successful. The records sought here, therefore, are not merely 'impassive and impersonal records of business events transacted between the firm and those with whom it dealt\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">The majority states that in <em>Slutsky </em>\"the partnership\u2019s records and papers [were] inseparable from the personal and private papers of its members\u201d. <em>Ante, </em>p 725. The <em>Slutsky </em>opinion emphasized, however, the close relationship between the two brothers and their partnership rather than the connection between the papers of the brothers and the papers of the partnership. The Court in <em>Slutsky, </em>p 1106, stated that it was hearing a motion \"to compel the production of <em>business records * * * of a two-man partnership\u201d. </em>(Emphasis added.) The conclusion in <em>Slutsky </em>was that \"[t]he partners were intimately involved with the operation of the business, so much so that the district court was convinced that the partnership records <em>were </em>the <em>purely </em>private and personal records of the partner-brothers\u201d. <em>United States v Greenleaf, </em>546 F2d 123, 128 (CA 5, 1977) (refusing to except family partnerships from the <em>Beilis </em>rule because none of the partners involved were related). Accord, Wilson <em>v California Health Facilities Comm, </em>110 Cal App 3d 317, 322, fn 4; 167 Cal Rptr 801 (1980), <em>app dis </em>450 US 1036 (1981). See also <em>United States v Onassis, </em>125 F Supp 190, 210 (D DC, 1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">The asserted distinction between small family partnerships and impersonal partnerships is not, as the majority states, merely a restatement of the doctrine that \"the papers required to be produced must not be the private and personal papers of the individuals held in a personal capacity\u201d. <em>Ante, </em>p 725. Rather, it is urgent that, in light of the close, personal relationship between family members, the records of a partnership formed by a few close relatives constitute, in fact, the partners\u2019 private documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">In sum, family partnerships generally are personal, rather than impersonal, business organizations. Under <em>White, </em>therefore, the Fifth Amendment generally would have protected the documents of such a partnership. The new test, promulgated in <em>Beilis, </em>is whether the partnership has an established institutional identity separate from its individual members. We agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the Miskinis partnership had a separate institutional identity; consequently, we agree with the majority\u2019s holding that the Fifth Amendment does not apply to the partnership documents now sought.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b841-8\"> See <em>In re Moser, supra, </em>pp 313-314.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"AWa\"> <em>Id., </em>p 305.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b842-6\"> See <em>ante, </em>pp 732-742; <em>Andresen v Maryland, </em>427 US 463; 96 S Ct 2737; 49 L Ed 2d 627 (1976); <em>Fisher v United States, </em>425 US 391, 407-412; 96 S Ct 1569; 48 L Ed 2d 39 (1976); <em>United States v Schlansky, </em>709 F2d 1079, 1082-1084 (CA 6, 1983); <em>1980 Grand Jury, </em>fn 9 <em>supra, </em>pp 329-336; Brennan, <em>State Constitutions and the Protection of Individual Rights, </em>90 Harv L Rev 489, 497 (1977); Note, <em>The Aftermath of Fisher, </em>fn 9 <em>supra, </em>pp 684-686.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b842-7\"> Although the majority suggests that the state privilege should not be interpreted differently than the Fifth Amendment privilege, see <em>ante, </em>p 726, we do not read that suggestion literally. If it were, today\u2019s decision would do more than appear to overrule <em>sub silentio </em>the views expressed in <em>In re Moser. </em>If today\u2019s decision really anchors the state privilege to the Fifth Amendment, the majority overrules a line of decisions holding that the state privilege protects a witness from being compelled to give self-incriminating testimony unless he receives a grant of transactional immunity that precludes his subsequent prosecution for activities about which he testifies under the immunity grant. See, <em>e.g., In re Watson, </em>293 Mich 263; 291 NW 652 (1940) (only full transactional immunity supplants state privilege). This contrasts with recent interpretations of the Fifth Amendment, which hold that it protects a person only against being compelled to give self-incriminating testimony that can be used, directly or indirectly, against that person. See <em>Kastigar v United States, </em>406 US 441; 92 S Ct 1653; 32 L Ed 2d 212 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">A witness granted use and derivative use immunity, in contrast with one granted transactional immunity, can be prosecuted for activities about which he was compelled to give self-incriminating testimony under the grant of immunity. Prosecutors are prohibited only from using the testimony, directly or indirectly, in a subsequent criminal prosecution of the witness. See <em>id.; </em>Comment, <em>Prospective Determinations of Derived Use, </em>fn 7 <em>supra. </em>Because a question regarding the kind of immunity necessary to supplant the state privilege is not presented, and <em>Watson </em>has not been overruled, the language of the majority opinion concerning the relationship between the Fifth Amendment and the state privilege against compelled self-incrimination should be read in the context of the issue decided today. \u2022</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b843-8\"> See, <em>e.g., D H Overmyer Co, Inc, of Ohio v Frick Co, </em>405 US 174, 185-186; 92 S Ct 775; 31 L Ed 2d 124 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">In Michigan, confession of judgment is provided for by statute.
