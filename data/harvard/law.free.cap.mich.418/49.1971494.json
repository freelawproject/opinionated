The opinion concludes that \"the people approved the whole of 1968 PA 76\u201d,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that is, including the interest rate, and that \"[u]nder the debt-control limitations of the constitution, the Legislature, by itself, cannot change that which the voters have approved\u201d.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">We advise that Act 47, \"presumed constitutional until the contrary is shown\u201d,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> is constitutional. The people, in answering in the affirmative the three-part ballot question on Act 76, approved the borrowing, or the three particulars of the borrowing required by art 9, \u00a7 15 to be set forth in the ballot question, and not the whole act. Further, even if the people are deemed to have approved the whole act, the Legislature may nevertheless amend without voter approval an act authorizing long-term borrowing unless the amendment relates to one or more of the three particulars (the amount to be borrowed, the specific purpose to which the funds shall be devoted, or the method of repayment) identified in \u00a7 15. Act 47 (the 1982 amendment of Act 76) concerns a particular of long-term borrowing (the interest rate) not required by \u00a7 15 to be stated in a ballot question. The remaining $33 million of general obligation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>bonds may, consistent with \u00a7 15, be sold at an interest rate higher than the <em>6% </em>authorized by Act 76 before it was amended by Act 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Section 15 of the 1963 Constitution was a new provision. The state was, for all practical purposes, precluded from borrowing money by the 1908 Constitution.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A constitutional amendment, initiated by the people or proposed by two-thirds of the members of both houses of the Legislature and approved by a majority of the voters,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> was required to authorize long-term borrowing. The 1908 Constitution was amended nine times to authorize long-term borrowing in stated amounts for specific purposes.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>It was not the practice, with regard to long-term \u2022 borrowing under Article 10 of the 1908 Constitution, to obtain voter approval of an interest rate. None of the nine amendments of Article 10 stated an interest rate.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Section 15 was designed to eliminate the \"cluttering up\u201d of the 1963 Constitution with constitutional amendments authorizing specific long-term borrowings, but to continue to require approval of long-term borrowing by two-thirds of the members of both houses of the Legislature and by a majority of the voters.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In not requiring a statement of the interest rate in the ballot question, \u00a7 15 is consistent with the practice preceding adoption of the 1963 Constitution and with its purpose of simplifying the procedures for authorizing long-term borrowing while preserving to the voters the control of long-term borrowing that they exercised under the 1908 Constitution. To hold that the establishment of an interest rate requires voter approval would make long-term borrowing procedures under the 1963 Constitution more restrictive than those under the 1908 Constitution in contravention of \u00a7 15\u2019s purpose of simplifying procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Section 15 provides that a \"question\u201d shall be submitted to the voters. It does not state that the voters shall approve the act (or the whole act) or that the question to be submitted to the voters is whether they approve the act. Consistent with \u00a7 15, the question submitted to the voters pursuant to Act 76 did not ask whether they approved that act, but whether they approved the borrowing, or the three particulars of the borrowing stated in the question. When the voters answered the \"question\u201d affirmatively, they indicated approval of the borrowing, or the three particulars of the borrowing so stated, and Act 76 thereupon became effective.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Absent a clear constitutional prohibition, this Court should not block the borrowing of the remaining $33 million principal amount approved by the Legislature and the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">Section 15 does not state precisely whether voter approval, evidenced by affirmative answer on a ballot question, means that the voters have approved (i) the borrowing, or the three particulars of the borrowing required by \u00a7 15 to be set forth in the ballot question, or (ii) the \"whole act\u201d, including whatever other provisions may be there set forth in addition to those three particulars. Either construction of \u00a7 15 is arguably correct.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>The first construction is, in our opinion, preferable. It does not impute to the voters approval of provisions of a long-term borrowing act of which the ballot question does not inform the voters. It does not enlarge the answer of the voters beyond the question propounded to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The ballot question asked whether the people approved the borrowing of \"the sum of $335,000,-000\u201d. Nothing was said in the ballot question about borrowing interest; the state did not borrow the interest it would obligate itself to pay on the principal amount it actually borrowed. Nor did the ballot question state the interest rate; \u00a7 15 does not require that it be stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">By affirmatively answering the ballot question, the people approved the borrowing of the principal amount of $335 million. The interest required to be paid on the principal amount actually borrowed was not borrowed; the principal, not the interest, was borrowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">In <em>Miller v Ayres, </em>211 Va 69; 175 SE2d 253 (1970), and <em>Louthan </em>v <em>King County, </em>94 Wash 2d 422; 617 P2d 977 (1980), relied on in the opinion advising that Act 47 is unconstitutional, the legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>latures of Virginia and Washington increased the maximum interest rates prescribed by statute for local bond issues. The supreme courts of those states attributed to city and county voters who had voted in local bond issue elections presumptive knowledge of the maximum interest rate prescribed by state statute.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Without considering the precedents (Part III) which hold that a legislature has the power, without further voter approval, to amend voter-approved legislation, those courts concluded that additional series of local bond issues, which had been approved by the voters before the increase in the maximum interest rate, could not be issued at the higher rate without again submitting the question whether the bonds should be issued to the voters of the local governmental unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The Michigan Constitution, in contrast with the constitutions of Virginia and Washington, mandates the form of the ballot question, thereby prescribing the substantive provisions of bond legislation that must be submitted for voter approval. An interest rate is not a substantive provision required by the Michigan Constitution to be submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">If the reasoning of the Virginia and Washington <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>courts were to be incorporated into the jurisprudence of this state, it would raise serious questions concerning the power of the Legislature. It is customary to provide that voter-approved bonds may be issued in series over a period of years as the money is needed. There are many statutory provisions concerning bond issues; the Legislature may find it necessary from time to time to amend such statutory provisions in light of changed circumstances.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> A decision of this Court advising that the voters are presumed to know all the provisions of all those statutes and that the Legislature may not, insofar as indebtedness subject to \"debt-control limitations\u201d of the constitution is concerned, change \"that which the voters have approved\u201d, would improperly cast doubt on the validity of all amendatory legislation and is contrary to the spirit of the Michigan Constitution, which reserves to the Legislature the power to amend voter-approved legislation without voter approval. See Part III.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">If this Court were to advise that the provisions of Act 47 (amending the interest rate of Act 76) cannot become effective without a vote of the people pursuant to \u00a7 15,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the ballot question for a vote on those provisions would, like the ballot question on Act 76, submitted to the people in 1968, state the amount, specific purpose, and method of repayment. Neither the interest rate nor the change in Act 76 effected by Act 47 would, under \u00a7 15, be stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The question that would be asked in respect to the provisions of Act 47, pursuant to \u00a7 15, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>thus be the same question already asked and answered affirmatively in respect to Act 76: shall the state borrow $33 million for the purpose and with the method of repayment described in the 1968 ballot question?<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The voters would be no better informed by a ballot question, pursuant to \u00a7 15, on the provisions of Act 47 about the interest rate of Act 76 of the change in interest rate ceiling enacted by Act 47 than they were by the ballot question on Act 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Even if the voters are deemed to have approved Act 76 as a \"whole\u201d, and not just the borrowing, or the three particulars of the borrowing required to be set forth in the ballot question, it does not follow that the voters must approve a change in particulars included in that act other than the three particulars required by the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">An act adopted with the approval of the voters is generally subject to amendment by the Legislature without voter approval, subject to explicit and implicit constitutional limitations. Voter approval of a legislative amendment of voter-approved legislation is not required unless it relates to a provision that the Legislature is not empowered to enact without voter approval. There is no reason to infer a constitutional limitation to guard against legislative action in an area in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Legislature has the authority to legislate without an approving vote of the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">An underlying premise of the opinion of the justices advising that Act 47 is unconstitutional is expressed in the statement that \"[u]nder the debt-control limitations of the constitution, the Legislature, by itself, cannot change that which the voters approved.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> An act of the Legislature \u00e1pproved by the voters is, however, generally regarded as subject to amendment by the Legislature without a vote of the people. <em>Chattanooga-Hamilton County Hospital Authority v City of Chattanooga, </em>580 SW2d 322 (Tenn, 1979); <em>Jones v Maine State Highway Comm, </em>238 A2d 226 (Me, 1968); <em>Cottingham v State Board of Examiners, </em>134 Mont 1, 12; 328 P2d 907 (1958); <em>Adams v Bolin, </em>74 Ariz 269, 276; 247 P2d 617 (1952); <em>Luker v Curtis, </em>64 Idaho 703, 706; 136 P2d 978 (1943); <em>State ex rel Pierce v Slusher, </em>119 Or 141, 147; 248 P 358 (1926); <em>State ex rel Richards v Whisman, </em>36 SD 260, 269; 154 NW 707 (1915); <em>Waugh v Glos, </em>246 Ill 604, 607; 92 NE 974 (1910).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>The courts have reasoned that the legislative power retained by the people, through the initiative and referendum, does not give any more force or eifect to voter-approved legislation than to legislative acts not so approved. Voter-approved acts are \"on an equal footing\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> with legislation that has not been submitted to the people. Approval by the voters does not \" 'lessen the power of the legislature\u2019 the initiative and referendum merely take \" 'from the legislature the exclusive right to enact laws, at the same time leaving it a co-ordinate legislative body with them [the people]\u2019 \u201d.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Some courts have reasoned that experience after the enactment of voter-approved legislation might indicate that legislation was not worka<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>ble and that in providing for the initiative and referendum the people intended that the Legislature possess the power to make needed changes as otherwise there would be no means of doing so before the next election.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> It has been said by some courts that if the people disagree with a legislative amendment of voter-approved legislation their remedies are the (or another) referendum and, when the Legislature stands for re-election, the ballot.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Our research has failed to disclose a single decision of an appellate court holding, upon consideration of the authorities addressing the question, that a state legislature is not empowered to amend legislation approved by the voters in a statewide election without a further submission to the voters in another statewide election. In <em>Dykstra v Holden, </em>151 Mich 289, 291; 115 NW 74 (1908), this Court held that where the Legislature had, before express authorization in the 1908 Constitution,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> provided that a local act of 1903 should be submitted to the people of a city before it became operative, the Legislature could amend the 1903 act without resubmission to the people of that city.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The opinion advising that Act 76 is unconstitutional does not consider the decisions in this and other jurisdictions holding that voter-approved legislation is subject to amendment by the Legislature without a vote of the people. The opinion cites <em>Miller v Ayres, supra, </em>and <em>Louthan v King County, supra,</em><footnotemark><em>30</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where the courts similarly did not consider the precedents holding that the Legislature has the power without voter approval to amend voter-approved legislation. <em>Miller and Louthan </em>were decided in constitutional contexts substantially different from those that govern in Michigan.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The Constitution of Virginia <em>(Miller) </em>did not and does not provide for statewide initiative or referendum. The Supreme Court of Virginia therefore had no need to consider the possible effect of its decision on the general power of the Legislature to amend legislation approved by the voters in a statewide election. This Court, however, should consider the implications of its decision in the instant case on the power of the Legislature to amend legislation and provisions of legislation approved by the voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">The Constitution of Washington <em>(Louthan) </em>provides that \"[n]o act, law, or bill approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon shall be amended or repealed by the legislature within a period of two years following such enactment\u201d.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>The Michigan Constitution contains no such limitation on the power of the Legislature. To the contrary, it specifically provides that laws adopted by the people pursuant to the initiative may be amended or repealed by the vote of three-fourths of the members elected to and serving in each house of the Legislature, and that laws approved on a referendary vote of the people may be amended by the Legislature at any subsequent session.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The constitution does not state whether long-term borrowing legislation submitted to the voters pursuant to \u00a7 15 may be amended by the Legislature without a vote of the people. The section of the Michigan Constitution (art 4, \u00a7 34) stating that the Legislature may provide that a bill will not become law unless approved by a majority of the electors<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> likewise does not state whether the Legislature has the power of amendment without a further vote of the people. It would seem, however, that the Legislature should have no less a power of amendment in respect to legislation that it chooses to submit to the voters than the power expressly conferred by the constitution in respect to legislation required (because the requisite number of registered electors have signed a petition invoking the referendum) to be submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The structure of this state\u2019s constitution appears to be consistent with the general rule prevailing in other jurisdictions that voter-approved legislation may be amended by the Legislature, subject to the super-majority limitation applicable to laws initiated by the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">The power of the Legislature to amend or repeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>voter-approved legislation is, nevertheless, subject to express constitutional limitations,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> as well as to those implicit in express limitations. The Legislature does not, to be sure, have the same plenary power with respect to legislation authorizing long-term borrowing that it has with respect to other legislation that may be submitted for voter approval. In contrast with most legislation that may be the subject of a vote of the people, the people must respond affirmatively to the three-part question required to be propounded pursuant to \u00a7 15 before legislation providing for long-term borrowing may be implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">A constitutional limitation may be inferred to enforce or implement the purpose and spirit of an explicit constitutional limitation. Although \u00a7 15 is silent with respect to whether an act providing for long-term borrowing may be amended without a vote of the people, it is implicit that it may not be amended in respect to the three particulars (amount, specific purpose, and method of repayment) expressly required to be stated in the ballot question. Any other construction of \u00a7 15 would permit the Legislature to do indirectly what it could not do directly without a vote of the people. Accordingly, provisions of an act providing for long-term borrowing stating the amount to be borrowed, the specific purpose to which the funds shall be devoted, and the method of. repayment may not be amended without an approving vote by the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Inferring a constitutional limitation requiring an approving vote by the people of an amendment respecting the interest rate of a long-term borrowing act \u2014 not required to be set forth in the act or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>the ballot question \u2014 would not prevent the Legislature from doing indirectly what it cannot do directly, but rather would prevent the Legislature from doing directly what it can constitutionally do indirectly.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The opinion of the justices advising that Act 47 is unconstitutional states, and we agree, that \"[t]he Legislature might have enacted a bill without a set interest rate\u201d.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> If Act 76 had been enacted without a set interest rate, the Legislature could then, without voter approval, have set or provided for setting the interest rate, as was done under the 1908 Constitution.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The Legislature, consistent with \u00a7 15, could approve a long-term borrowing act stating no more than the three particulars that are required by \u00a7 15 to be set forth in a ballot question (amount, specific purpose, and method of repayment). Before or after approval of such an act by the voters, the Legislature could, without voter approval, \"implement\u201d such act by providing in a separate act for the interest rate and other particulars not required by \u00a7 15 to be set forth in the ballot question. (After the voters responded affirmatively to the ballot question on Act 76, that act was \"implemented\u201d by 1969 PA 21<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and 1969 PA 159.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark>) An advisory opinion or decision that would infer a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>constitutional limitation that may be readily bypassed (by enacting the three-part question in one act and other particulars of the legislation in a concurrent or subsequent \"implementing\u201d act) would not serve to enforce or implement the purpose or spirit of \u00a7 15, but would simply encumber the legislative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">No interest of the people secured by \u00a7 15 would be protected by inferring a constitutional limitation concerning features of long-term borrowing legislation not required by \u00a7 15 to be submitted to and approved by the voters. A constitutional limitation barring the Legislature from doing directly what it may constitutionally do indirectly should not be inferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The rule is not that \"[ujnder the debt-control limitations of the constitution, the Legislature, by itself, cannot change that which the voters have approved\u201d. The rule \u2014 consistent with the general rule that the Legislature may amend voter-approved legislation, with \u00a7 15, and with the other provisions of the Michigan Constitution concerning initiative and referendum \u2014 is that the Legislature (i) is not empowered without voter approval to amend a legislative provision that it cannot enact without voter approval, and (ii) is empowered without voter approval to amend a legislative provision that it can enact without voter approval although such provision may have been submitted to a vote of the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">We advise that the provision of Act 76 concerning the interest rate may be amended as provided in Act 47 without a vote of the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">The opinion of the justices advising that Act 47 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>is unconstitutional seems to suggest that because a long-term borrowing act serves the function formerly served under the 1908 Constitution by a constitutional amendment authorizing long-term borrowing, such an act is subject to amendment \"the same\u201d as if it were a constitutional amendment and thus cannot be amended except by a vote of the people.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> That argument ignores that a purpose of \u00a7 15 was to eliminate from the constitution the details of long-term borrowing. The statement in the official convention comment that \"the voting is * * * <em>the same </em>as * * * for a constitutional amendment\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> (emphasis supplied) simply refers to \"two-thirds of the members\u201d and \"a majority of the electors\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Although a long-term borrowing act cannot become effective unless there is an affirmative vote on the ballot question, such an act does not, upon a favorable vote, become a constitutional amendment. Nor does such an act have the status of a constitutional amendment. To advise that a long-term borrowing act has the status of, or in effect is, a constitutional amendment and therefore can only be amended by the same process applicable to constitutional amendments is to reintroduce the very rigidity that \u00a7 15 was designed to avoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Although the opinion of the justices advising that Act 47 is unconstitutional intimates that the phrase \"amount to be borrowed\u201d in \u00a7 15 may include the interest or the rate of interest,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> that would be inconsistent with the opinion\u2019s statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>that \"[t]he Legislature might have enacted a bill without a set interest rate\u201d.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> We would not intimate that \"the amount to be borrowed\u201d or \"the method of repayment\u201d contemplates inclusion of the interest or the rate of interest and thereby both (i) put in doubt the validity of bonds (including the $302 million of bonds already issued pursuant to Act 76) that have been issued since the adoption of the 1963 Constitution pursuant to ballot questions that did not mention interest, and (ii) suggest that in the future a ballot question should contain a statement regarding the interest or the rate of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The \"amount to be borrowed\u201d in the instant case was, as stated in the ballot question, $335 million, and did not include the interest that the state obligated itself to pay on the principal amount borrowed. Nor is the interest rate an \"amount to be borrowed\u201d. The term \"method of repayment\u201d refers, in general, to the source of repayment; in the instant case, as set forth in the ballot question, that source is the \"general fund of the state\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The characterization, in the opinion of the justices advising that Act 47 is unconstitutional, of that act as a \"new debt authorization\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> is, again, inconsistent with the statement that \"[t]he Legislature might have enacted a bill without a set interest rate\u201d. If a <em>change </em>in a stated interest rate is a \"new debt authorization\u201d, then the <em>establishment </em>of an interest rate where none has been stated would also seem to be a new debt authorization. If the establishment of an interest rate is itself a new debt authorization that the people must approve pursuant to \u00a7 15, the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>cannot enact a long-term borrowing act which does not set the interest rate. Moreover, the \"new debt authorization\u201d characterization begs the question. An amendment of an interest rate may as readily be characterized as a change in an old debt authorization as a new debt authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">None of the constitutional amendments providing for long-term borrowing under the 1908 Constitution prescribed the interest rate, and two amendments did not even prescribe how the interest rate would be set.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> In the fifty years preceding the 1970\u2019s, interest rates moved within a relatively narrow range. Given this history, it is reasonable to conclude that the drafters of the 1963 Constitution did not foresee an exponential rise in interest rates and therefore did not require voter approval of the interest rate. The interest rate was not one of the particulars required to be stated in a \u00a7 15 ballot question.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">After the drafting and adoption of the 1963 Constitution, there was a major change in the bond market, and interest rates have risen significantly. Interest rates can now be quite volatile, and the interest cost of a bond issue is now a much more significant factor than it was in the years preceding the drafting and adoption of the 1963 Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Some may, therefore, think that the people should approve the interest rate or any change or increase in the burden of the interest rate.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>can, however, only properly and effectively be accomplished by a constitutional amendment reserving to the people the power to approve the interest rate along with the other three particulars set forth in \u00a7 15 (amount, specific purpose, and method of repayment).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">A decision of this Court that bars the marketing of the remaining $33 million of water pollution bonds because an interest rate was prescribed in Act 76 will not protect the people from legislative change in interest rates except in the instant case. In the future, the Legislature may, by not having prescribed an interest rate when long-term bond legislation is submitted to the voters pursuant to \u00a7 15, avoid any inhibition on its power to set interest rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">A decision advising that Act 76 is unconstitutional may thus serve only to preclude the marketing of the remaining $33 million of water pollution bonds and to introduce into the jurisprudence concepts that are inconsistent with the spirit of the Michigan Constitution and that may be seen as inhibiting legislative power in respect to voter-approved legislation in other areas not dealt with or anticipated at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">In conclusion, \u00a7 15 does not require that the ballot question state an interest rate. Inferring a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>constitutional limitation requiring voter approval of a legislative amendment of a provision that was not required to be submitted to a vote of the people on the debatable premise that it was submitted to such a vote would be inconsistent with the well-established general rule that the Legislature may without a vote of the people amend voter-approved legislation. Inferring such a constitutional limitation would not implement or enforce the purpose and spirit of \u00a7 15, but would simply encumber the legislative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">We advise that Act 47 is constitutional.</p>\n<judges id=\"b173-6\">Kavanagh, Cavanagh, and Boyle, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b173-7\">Williams, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">We have been asked by the Legislature and former Governor Milliken to render an advisory opinion regarding the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-10\">May the state issue up to $33,000,000 of general obligation bonds at a rate of interest higher than the 6% authorized by 1968 PA 76?<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>1982 PA 47 was an attempt by the Legislature to amend, without voter approval, a prior act, 1968 PA 76, MCL 323.371 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.2769(201) <em>et seq., </em>which was <em>approved by the voters </em>as prescribed by Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 15.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 1968 PA 76 authorized a bond issue for the prevention and abatement of water pollution at a maximum rate of interest of 6% per annum.

We are of the opinion that amendment of 1968 PA 76 by 1982 PA 47 is unconstitutional for lack of approval by the voters as required by art 9, \u00a7 15, of the 1963 Constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">We have been aided in the consideration of this matter by the Attorney General who has submitted one brief in support of the conclusion of constitutionality, and one brief in support of the conclusion of unconstitutionality, and by the briefs filed by amici curiae, supporting the conclusion of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>stitutionality.

Section 4 confers on the State Administrative Board certain duties with respect to the bond issue and states that the Municipal Finance Commission shall approve the bonds prior to their issuance. Section 8 states the question to be submitted to the electorate pursuant to Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 15. Section 9 states that the Secretary of State shall take the necessary steps to properly submit the question to the electors. Sections 11 and 12 state that no bonds may be issued nor will the act become finally effective until the question is approved by a majority of the voters in the 1968 general election.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Pursuant to \u00a7 9 of 1968 PA 76 and the Michigan Election Law, MCL 168.1 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 6.1001 <em>et </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number><em>seq.,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Secretary of State certified the question to be submitted to the electorate. The proposal that appeared in the ballot was exactly as set forth in 1968 PA 76, other than the heading. It appeared as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\"Proposal No. 3</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\"Referendum on Act 76 of the Public Acts of 1968</p>\n<p id=\"Axq\">(Proposal Relating to Bonding to Abate Water Pollution)</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">\"Shall the state of Michigan borrow the sum of $335,000,000.00 and issue general obligation bonds of the state therefor pledging the full faith and credit of the state for the payment of principal and interest thereon for the purpose of planning, acquiring and constructing facilities for the prevention and abatement of water pollution and for the making of grants, loans and advances to municipalities, political subdivisions and agencies of the state for such purposes, the method of repayment of said bonds to be from the general fund of the state?</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">\"Yes</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">\"No\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">The Secretary of State, as prescribed by 1968 PA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>76, \u00a7 9, and MCL 168.480; MSA 6.1480, published the entire text of 1968 PA 76 and mailed two copies of the text to each county clerk to be posted at the voting precincts. The act was thereafter posted at the polling places. 1968 PA 76, authorizing the issuance of bonds at the maximum interest rate of 6% to deal with water pollution problems, was overwhelmingly approved by the voters on November 5, 1968. 1969-1970 Michigan Manual, p 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Pursuant to the bond authorization approved by the voters, the state borrowed $302 million by the end of 1972. Because of market forces, however, the state is unable to sell the remaining bonds bearing an interest rate of 6%. Therefore, on March 19, 1982, the Legislature enacted 1982 PA 47 which purported to amend 1968 PA 76 by increasing the maximum rate of interest from 6% to 18%. The purpose of this legislation is to make the bonds marketable and, thus, carry out the purposes of the earlier act, <em>i.e., </em>the abatement and prevention of water pollution. The amendment was not submitted to the electorate for approval pursuant to Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 15, as was the original long-term borrowing act.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The Legislature and former Governor Milliken requested an advisory opinion as to the constitutionality of 1982 PA 47. The basic issue is whether the state may issue the remainder of the general obligation bonds authorized by the voters in 1968 PA 76 at an interest rate higher than the 6% maximum provided by the original authorization, although the increase in interest rate was not approved by the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">II. Constitutional Principles</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">As stated in <em>Advisory Opinion on Constitutional</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number><em>ity of 1976 PA 240, </em>400 Mich 311, 317-318; 254 NW2d 544 (1977):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-4\">\"The Michigan Constitution is not a grant of power to the Legislature as is the United States Constitution, but rather, it is a limitation on general legislative power. <em>In re Brewster Street Housing Site, </em>291 Mich 313; 289 NW 493 (1939). Unless the Constitution contains limitations, the Legislature has general power to contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Acts of the Legislature are presumed constitutional unless such legislation manifestly infringes upon some provision of the constitution. <em>Johnson v Comm\u2019r of Agriculture, </em>314 Mich 548, 557; 22 NW2d 893 (1946). In this case, we must analyze Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 15, and determine whether this constitutional limitation on long-term borrowing precludes the Legislature from amending without approval of the people a prior bond authorization that was approved by the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">In deciding the constitutionality of 1982 PA 47, it is important to note the limited power of the State of Michigan to borrow money. Article 9, \u00a7 12, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">\"No evidence of state indebtedness shall be issued except for debts authorized pursuant to this constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">This provision is clear. Only as authorized by constitutional provision may the state borrow money.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>The only constitutional provision applicable in this case, art 9, \u00a7 15, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">\"The state may borrow money for specific purposes in amounts as may be provided by acts of the legislature adopted by a vote of two-thirds of the members elected to and serving in each house, and approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon at any general election. The question submitted to the electors shall state the amount to be borrowed, the specific purpose to which the funds shall be devoted, and the method of repayment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The import of art 9, \u00a7 12 and art 9, \u00a7 15 taken together is quite clear. \"No evidence of state indebtedness shall be issued except for debts authorized pursuant to this constitution.\u201d Article 9, \u00a7 12. The only long-term debts, such as the instant debts, authorized by the constitution are those authorized by the process established by art 9, \u00a7 15, <em>i.e., </em>by \"acts of the legislature adopted by a vote of two-thirds of the members elected to and serving in each house, and approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon at any general election\u201d. There is nothing anywhere in the constitution authorizing the issuance of state indebtedness under art 9, \u00a7 12 by legislative amendments without vote of the people of acts adopted pursuant to art 9, \u00a7 15. The Legislature is not allowed to incur long-term debt without prior approval of the people. <em>Advisory Opinion on Constitutionality of 1975 PA 301, </em>400 Mich 270, 302-303; 254 NW2d 528 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">III. General Constitutional Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">This brings us to the issue raised by the Gover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>nor and the Legislature in this case. Granted that the Legislature cannot incur long-term debt without a vote of the people, does art 9, \u00a7 15, allow the Legislature, without a vote of the people, to amend a prior long-term debt authorization of the people by altering the maximum interest rate from 6% to 18%?</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">In construing art 9, \u00a7 12 and art 9, \u00a7 15, we apply the basic rule as set forth in <em>Traverse City School Dist v Attorney General, </em>384 Mich 390, 405; 185 NW2d 9 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">\"The primary rule is the rule of 'common understanding\u2019 described by Justice Cooley:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">\" 'A constitution is made for the people and by the people. <em>The interpretation that should be given it is that which reasonable minds, the great mass of the people themselves, would give it. </em>\"For as the Constitution does not derive its force from the convention which framed, but from the people who ratified it, <em>the intent to be arrived at is that of the people, </em>and it is not to be supposed that they have looked for any dark or abstruse meaning in the words employed, <em>but rather that they have accepted them in the sense most obvious to the common understanding, </em>and ratified the instrument in the belief that that was the sense designed to be conveyed.\u201d (Cooley\u2019s Const Lim 81).\u2019 [As quoted in <em>May v Topping, </em>65 W Va 656, 660; 64 SE 848 (1909).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-9\">\"A second rule is that to clarify meaning, the circumstances surrounding the adoption of a constitutional provision <em>and the purpose sought to be accomplished </em>may be considered. On this point this Court said the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-10\">\" 'In construing constitutional provisions where the meaning may be questioned, the court should have regard to the circumstances leading to their adoption and the <em>purpose </em>sought to be accomplished.\u2019 <em>Kearney v Board of State Auditors, </em>189 Mich 666, 673; 155 NW 510 (1915).\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>It is clear beyond peradventure that the common understanding of the people was that the combination of art 9, \u00a7 12 and art 9, \u00a7 15, is a limitation on legislative authority to enact borrowing statutes without approval of the electorate.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Prior to the 1963 Constitution, the 1908 Constitution, art 10, \u00a7 10, provided debt limitations as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">\"The State may contract debts to meet deficits in revenue, but such debts shall not in the aggregate at any time, exceed two hundred fifty thousand dollars. The State may also contract debts to repel invasion, suppress insurrection, defend the State or aid the United States in time of war. The money so raised shall be applied to the purposes for which it is raised or to the payment of the debts contracted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Thus, in order to engage in any other long-term borrowing, the 1908 Constitution required a constitutional amendment for each borrowing. This process \"cluttered up\u201d the constitution. This particular provision was amended nine times to allow long-term borrowing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">Dissatisfaction with the procedure required by the provisions of the 1908 Constitution resulted in art 9, \u00a7 15, of the 1963 Constitution. As stated by the convention in its official comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">\"This is a new section dealing with long-term borrowing such as we used when we paid bonuses to the veterans of three wars; when we borrowed for hospital construction; and when in the decade of the twenties, we borrowed on full faith and credit for highway construction. The <em>legislature is not empowered to authorize any such borrowing without the approval of the voters of the state, </em>but this section provides a method that can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>be used without cluttering up the constitution with amendments authorizing the borrowing, as we have had to do in the past.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-6\">\"The voting will be the same, a two-thirds vote in both houses of the legislature on a bill, but the bill will not be effective unless and until approved by a majority of the people who vote on the proposition. <em>The voting is, therefore, the same as that under the present constitution for a constitutional amendment, </em>but it avoids the necessity of amending the constitution.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 2 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, p 3401.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">In essence, the principle of requiring voter approval before the state can engage in long-term borrowing was not altered by the 1963 Constitution. Just as the amendment process under the 1908 Constitution<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> required a 2/3 vote of the members of each house and a majority of the electorate voting on the amendment, so does art 9, \u00a7 15, of the 1963 Constitution require a 2/3 vote in both houses and approval by a majority of the electorate voting thereon. The only difference between the two procedures is that today a constitutional amendment is no longer needed. But approval of such legislative enactment requires approval of a majority of the voters for the proposed bond authorization to become law, just as a constitutional amendment does.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Fundamental analysis of the purpose of art 9, \u00a7 12, the debt-limitation provision, art 9, \u00a7 15, the borrowing provision, and the 1963 Constitutional Convention Official Comment makes it abundantly clear that the people, in their constitution, (1) limited the state\u2019s ability to incur debt to only such ways as provided by the constitution, (2) the only way to incur long-term debt provided by the constitution is by a 2/3 vote of the Legislature and approval of the people, and (3) voting under the 1963 Constitution is \"the same * * * as * * * for a constitutional amendment\u201d. Under such analysis, it is clear for two reasons that the 1968 PA 76 debt authorization could not be amended by the 1982 PA 47 legislative action alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">First, 1982 PA 47 is, in effect, an attempted new debt authorization. It was recognized that because of market conditions 1968 PA 76 was no longer an effective debt authorization. At 6%, evidences of debt would not sell. In order to have an effective debt instrument, a new authorization was necessary. That was what 1982 PA 47 attempted to accomplish. But art 9, \u00a7 15, requires that a debt authorization not only be approved by 2/3 of the Legislature, but by a majority vote of the people. 1982 PA 47 was not so approved; therefore, it is not a valid' debt authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Second, the history of the 1963 Constitutional Convention and the convention comment indicate that, while the debt authorization instrument under art 9, \u00a7 15, is not a constitutional amendment, \"[t]he voting is * * * the same as * * * for a constitutional amendment\u201d. If the voting is the same as for a constitutional amendment, it would not illogically suggest that any amendments of the debt authorization instrument would likewise be approved by voters as for a constitutional amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>ment. 1982 PA 47 was not approved as for a constitutional amendment. Therefore, it is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">IV. Specific Constitutional Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Just as consideration of the fundamental principles leads to the conclusion that 1982 PA 47 is invalid, critical analysis of the specific language of art 9, \u00a7 15, reaches the same conclusion. Such critical analysis requires that we consider exactly what the voters approved in the 1968 election.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The Attorney General in his brief in support of the constitutionality of 1982 PA 47 and amici curiae rely heavily on the second sentence of art 9, \u00a7 15, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">\"The question submitted to the electors shall state the amount to be borrowed, the specific purpose to which the funds shall be devoted, and the method of repayment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">Thus, they argue that the electorate does not approve the entire act, but merely the amount to be borrowed, the specific purpose to which the funds shall be devoted, and the method of repayment. In 1968, according to them, the voters did not approve 1968 PA 76 which included the 6% interest ceiling, but instead merely approved the general question submitted on the ballot.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Legislature is, therefore, they believe, free to amend the prior act and raise the interest ceiling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>in the bonds to 18%. We do not agree with this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The Attorney General, in his brief in support of constitutionality, and amici curiae fail to analyze the whole constitutional provision. Analysis of the whole provision shows that the people approved the whole of 1968 PA 76, not merely the provisions set forth in the ballot question, and that it is the act, not the question, that authorizes the borrowing.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">First, by setting up the constitution in its component parts, it is perfectly clear that the whole act is approved by the people. The constitution specifically states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-7\">The state may borrow money for specific purposes in amounts as may be provided by acts of the legislature</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-8\">(a) adopted by a vote of two-thirds of the members elected to and serving in each house; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-9\">(b) approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon at any general election.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">In question are the \"acts of the legislature\u201d (a) <em>\"adopted by a vote of two-thirds\u201d </em>of the Legislature <em>and </em>(b) <em>\"approved by a majority of the electors voting </em>thereonThe people, like the Legislature, approve not a part of, but the whole <em>act. </em>While the second sentence states specifically what the question put to the people must contain, the first sentence equally plainly states that the <em>\"acts of the legislature\u201d </em>are what the electorate approves. More importantly, \"[t]he state may borrow money for specific purposes in amounts as may be provided by [such] acts\u201d and only as so provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">Secondly, the convention comment notes that the <em>bill </em>will not be effective unless and until approved by a majority of the people who vote on the proposition as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>\"The voting will be the same, a two-thirds vote in both houses of the legislature on a bill, but the <em>bill will not be effective unless and until approved by a majority of the people </em>who vote on the proposition. The voting is, therefore, the same as that under the present constitution for a constitutional amendment, but it avoids the necessity of amending the constitution.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 2 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, p 3401.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Just as the amendment to the constitution had to be approved by the electorate, so too the act authorizing the long-term borrowing must be approved by the electorate.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Third, the second sentence dealing with the question to be submitted merely specifies the information that must be placed on the ballot. Obviously, it would not be practical or efficient to include the entire act on the ballot. The main objective of the question on the ballot is to generally apprise the voters of the subject matter.

In fact, several of the attempts by the Legislature to invoke the provisions of art 9, \u00a7 15, provided that the State Administrative Board would set the interest rate that the bonds would bear. <em>It is interesting to note, however, that of the six proposals submitted to the people as prescribed by art 9, \u00a7 15, all three of the defeated proposals had no set interest rate.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The only one of the adopted proposals that provided for the board to set the interest rate was the bond issuance to provide a service bonus for veterans of Vietnam and other conflicts.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The interest rate, it would seem, is obviously a significant factor to the electorate.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">We are not presented in this case, however, with a proposal that left the authority to set the maximum interest rate up to the State Administrative Board, but rather with an act that specifically set the interest rate at 6%. The Legislature might have enacted a bill without a set interest rate.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>however, did not choose this alternative. Instead, it passed an act authorizing a bond issuance with a specific interest ceiling of 6%. If the Legislature had not specified an interest ceiling, it is quite possible 1968 PA 76 might have been defeated by the people as were 1969 PA 304, 1972 PA 231, and 1974 PA 245 which did not fix interest ceilings.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">We are well aware of the financial condition being faced by the state and its municipalities and of the need to issue general obligation bonds at a marketable rate to continue the much-needed cleanup of one of this state\u2019s greatest resources\u2014 its waters. It is our opinion, however, that art 9, \u00a7 15, of the 1963 Constitution requires that any amendment of a voter-approved long-term borrowing authorization must be submitted to the electorate. The people, in ratifying the 1963 Constitution, clearly wanted the ability to control long-term borrowing. To allow the Legislature to unilaterally amend the interest rate in a voter-approved bond authorization from 6% to 18% certainly challenges the people\u2019s constitutional control over long-term borrowing. In 1968, the electorate authorized issuance of $335 million in general obligation bonds at an interest rate of 6%. Under the debt-control limitations of the constitution, the Legislature, by itself, cannot change that which the voters have approved.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We are of the opinion that 1982 PA 47 is unconstitutional.</p>\n<judges id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Ryan and Brickley, JJ., concurred with Williams, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-8\"> \"The state may borrow money for specific purposes in amounts as may be provided by acts of the legislature adopted by a vote of two-thirds of the members elected to and serving in each house, and approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon at any general election.

Obviously \"the amount to be borrowed\u201d at 6% is a very different thing from \"the amount to be borrowed\u201d at 18%, as would be \"method of repayment\u201d. However, since the resolution of this matter appears to us so clear from the other arguments discussed in the opinion, we do not elaborate on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b186-7\"> MCL 168.643a; MSA 6.1643(1) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">\"Any question submitted to the electors of this state or the electors of any subdivision of this state shall, to the extent that it will not confuse the electorate, be worded in the following manner: A 'yes\u2019 vote will be a vote in favor of the subject matter of the proposal or issue, and a 'no\u2019 vote will be a vote against the subject matter of the proposal or issue. Questions shall be worded so as to apprise the voters of the subject matter of the proposal or issue, but need not be legally precise. The language used shall create no prejudice for or against the issue or proposal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">Furthermore, with regard to constitutional amendments, we have emphasized the importance of informing the electorate but at the same time not confusing it. <em>Pontiac School Dist v City of Pontiac, </em>262 Mich 338, 344; 247 NW 474; 247 NW 787 (1933).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b187-8\"> In <em>Louthan, </em>the Supreme Court of Washington held that without further authorization from the voters, general obligation bonds could not be issued at a greater maximum rate than 8%, the rate provided by statute when the initial bond ordinance was approved by the voters. In <em>Miller, </em>the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia also held that bonds could not be issued and sold at a greater interest rate than that provided by the statute in effect at the time of the initial voter approval. The electors were presumed to have knowledge of the underlying statutes, and the fact that the interest rate was not placed on the ballot was found to be immaterial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b187-9\"> That interest rates are important has always been, and today particularly is, elementary. Economists and politicians advert to this truism constantly. Automobile dealers, real estate operators and consumers, among others, understand only too well that it is not only the ticket price but the interest cost that makes or breaks the possibility of sales.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b188-7\"> The following proposals for long-term borrowing were not approved by the electorate: 1969 PA 304, 1972 PA 231, and 1974 PA 245. See 1971-1972 Michigan Manual, p 520, 1973-1974 Michigan Manual, p 560, and 1975-1976 Michigan Manual, p 570.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b188-8\"> 1974 PA 106, MCL 35.1001 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 4.1097(21) <em>et seq.; </em>1975-1976 Michigan Manual, p 568.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b188-9\"> Amici curiae argue that the Legislature could have passed two separate bills: one authorizing the borrowing and referring the question to the voter and the other implementing such legislation. The second act then could have voluntarily been referred to the voters as prescribed by art 4, \u00a7 34. The provisions could be amended later without resubmission to the voters. <em>Dykstra v Holden, </em>151 Mich 289; 115 NW 74 (1908).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">This argument seems to go against the position in favor of the constitutionality of 1982 PA 47 because in fact the Legislature did not pass two separate acts. It instead <em>chose </em>to set forth in one bill all of the necessary information pertaining to the long-term borrowing proposition. That bill <em>had </em>to be submitted to the electorate for approval as prescribed by art 9, \u00a7 15. Everything was set forth in the act, including the interest rate, and that is what the electorate approved. Likewise, the concept that 1968 PA 76 can be considered as two separate acts is unacceptable, because 1968 PA 76 was adopted as a whole act under art 9, \u00a7 15, and was not submitted to the voters as prescribed by art 4, \u00a7 34.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b189-7\"> In his opinion, Justice Levin argues that \"[a]n act of the Legislature approved by the voters is, however, generally regarded as subject to amendment by the Legislature without a vote of the people\u201d <em>[ante, </em>p 65]. Vote of the people is not required under art 2, \u00a7 9, \u00b6 5 or art 4, \u00a7 29 of the Michigan Constitution. But in each case such amendment without a vote of the people is authorized only for acts adopted under those sections of the constitution. There is no provision authorizing amendment of art 9, \u00a7 15 enactments by the Legislature without a vote of the people. Since specific permission is included in the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>two sections, absence of such provision in art 9, \u00a7 15 could be considered noteworthy. However, the most significant fact is that the combination of art 9, \u00a7 12 and art 9, \u00a7 15 precludes issuance of evidence of debt except by the procedure specified in art 9, \u00a7 15, which requires a vote of the people. It is with this in mind that the sentence in the text to which note 16 refers was written, <em>viz., \"[u]nder the debt-control limitations of the constitution, </em>the Legislature, by itself, cannot change that which the voters have approved\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
