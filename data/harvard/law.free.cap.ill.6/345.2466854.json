The proper survey was also returned,</summary><summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-4\" pgmap=\"362\">It also appeared from the record, that at the March term of said Court, 1844, Miles Gray and Thomas Rogers presented their report in relation to damages sustained by John D. Hutchins, by reason of said road running through his land, reporting that Hutchins would sustain no damage thereby, which said report was approved by said Court, whereupon said Hutchins appealed to the Circuit Court and regularly entered into bond, &amp;e.</summary><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-5\" pgmap=\"362\">At the April term of the De Witt Circuit Court, 1844, the Hon.

The report of the viewers was favorable, and the Court ordered the road to be re-located. The road, as re-located, ran through the land of Hutchins, who objected to the opening of the same. The householders summoned to assess his damages, reported to the Court that, in their opinion, he would sustain none. Their report was approved, and Hutchins prosecuted an appeal to the Circuit Court. That Court, on the motion of the defendants, dismissed the appeal on the ground that an appeal did not lie in such a case. That decision is now assigned for error.</p> <p id=\"b363-5\" pgmap=\"363\">The decision of the Circuit Court was erroneous. The thirtieth section of the \u201c\u00bflet concerning Public Beads,\u201d approved February 20th, 1841, expressly gives to the owner of land, over which a road may be located, the right to appeal from the decision of the County Commissioners\u2019 Court on the report of the householders.</p> <p id=\"b363-6\" pgmap=\"363\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p> <p id=\"b363-7\" pgmap=\"363\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
