Stephen A. Douglass, and in the latter by the Hon. Peter Lott. It has been the practice with counsel, in drawing up bills of exceptions, to add the usual seal or scrawl at the close thereof, before presenting the same to the Court for approval; and the Court below, in these cases, did not notice that the seal was omitted. When the causes came up for hearing in this Court, both of the Judges, who presided at the trial, were out of office. Motions were therefore made, with argument, to permit the Ex-Judges to annex their seals to their respective signatures in the said bills, though one of the causes had been argued in chief.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b202-5\" pgmap=\"202\">.
