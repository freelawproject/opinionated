Pursuant to our order of August 18,1998, the Franks have responded. They oppose Harding\u2019s motion and move that the Exhibits at issue be judicially noticed. For the reasons stated below, we grant Harding\u2019s motion, in part, and deny the Franks\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>\u00b62 The case underlying this appeal was brought in the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Carbon County, by the Franks against Harding; they sought judgment for amounts allegedly owed them by Harding and relief from threats allegedly leveled by him against them. Harding did not timely answer the complaint and the Franks obtained entry of his default, followed by a default judgment. Thereafter, Harding moved to set the default judgment aside. The District Court held a hearing on the motion and Harding presented evidence surrounding the circumstances of his failure to answer the complaint timely. The court did not allow the Franks to present evidence, but did allow their counsel to make an offer of proof as to the testimony he would have offered. The court granted Harding\u2019s motion to set aside the default judgment and the Franks timely filed a notice of appeal. The sole issue raised on appeal is whether the District Court erred in granting Harding\u2019s motion to set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">\u00b63 The Franks\u2019 opening brief on appeal was filed on June 23,1998. Attached thereto are Exhibits A, C and D, all of which are newspaper articles. Exhibit B, also attached, is the process server\u2019s proof of service with narrative statement attached. Harding moves to strike all four of the referenced Exhibits \u2014 together with all statements and arguments based thereon in the Franks\u2019 opening brief \u2014 on the grounds that they are not part of the record on appeal and are included for the improper purpose of prejudicing this Court against him. We observe at the outset that Exhibit B, the process server\u2019s proof of service and attached statement are of record \u2014 having been filed February 11, 1998 \u2014 and we do not discuss that Exhibit further.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">\u00b64 The Franks respond, first, that the newspaper articles are attached to allow this Court \u201cto evaluate the parties to this appeal.\u201d In this regard, we need observe only that the issue on appeal \u2014 whether the trial court erred in setting aside the default judgment \u2014 obviously does not require this Court to \u201cevaluate the parties;\u201d it requires us only to apply the law in determining whether the District Court erred in setting aside the default judgment. Exhibits A, C and D are totally and entirely irrelevant to our consideration of that issue and it is clear that counsel can only have attached Exhibits A, C and D for an improper purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">\u00b65 Relying on <em>Matter of Establishment &amp; Org. of Ward Irr. Dist. </em>(1985), 216 Mont. 315, 321, 701 P.2d 721, 726, the Franks also contend that it is permissible to \u201csupplement\u201d the record on appeal with judicially recognizable material and that the articles are proper subjects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>for judicial notice. <em>Ward Irr. Dist. </em>is readily distinguishable, however, on several grounds. First, we considered the survey descriptions and maps at issue there under the express authority of the Commission Comments to Rule 201(b), M.R.Evid., which permit judicial notice of \u201cpublished maps or charts.\u201d Second, the Montana Water Code specifically provided that, in the water rights adjudication process, maps and descriptions were acceptable articles of evidence to prove a water right. <em>Ward Irr. Dist., </em>216 Mont. at 321, 701 P.2d at 726. In the present case, neither of those bases is even arguably present and, indeed, the Franks\u2019 counsel makes no effort to argue that the newspaper articles are judicially recognizable under Rule 201(b), M.R.Evid. Furthermore, the alleged \u201cfacts\u201d contained within the newspaper articles are, as noted above, totally irrelevant to the issue raised for our consideration in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">\u00b66 Finally, the Franks argue \u2014 relying on 29 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 88 (1994) \u2014 that \u201c[n]ewspaper articles and television stories are regularly judicially noticed by federal courts.\u201d While it is true that \u00a7 88 cites to two federal district court cases wherein newspaper articles apparently have been judicially noticed, the section also cites to a federal circuit court of appeals case refusing to take judicial notice of the truth of a newspaper article. Thus, \u00a7 88 can hardly be said to support the Franks\u2019 assertion that federal courts \u201cregularly\u201d take judicial notice of newspaper articles. Moreover, Rule 201(b), M.R.Evid., is applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">\u00b67 In summary, it is clear that Exhibits A, C and D are improperly attached to the Franks\u2019 brief. Nor is it conceivable that the Franks\u2019 counsel, an attorney with some 15 years\u2019 experience in the practice of law, did not recognize the impropriety of attaching such nonrecord and totally irrelevant matters to his clients\u2019 brief on appeal. In this regard, we long have cautioned counsel about such practices, stating, for example, that \u201c \u2018[w]e <em>strongly condemn this practice by counsel for appellants </em>[of attempting to introduce extraneous evidence by the \u2018back door\u2019 via attachment as appendices to their brief] <em>and use this occasion to warn other parties to future appeals that this practice will not be </em>tolerated.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Downs v. Smyk </em>(1979), 185 Mont. 16, 25, 604 P.2d 307, 312 (quoting <em>Farmers State Bank of Conrad v. Iverson </em>(1973), 162 Mont. 130, 133-34, 509 P.2d 839, 841). This practice wastes the time and resources of both opposing counsel and this Court and, had Harding requested sanctions in this regard, they likely would have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>\u00b68 The Court having fully considered the matters before it,</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">\u00b69 IT IS ORDERED that Harding\u2019s motion to strike Exhibits A, C and D to the Franks\u2019 opening brief is GRANTED and we will not consider those Exhibits or any statements or argument in the Franks\u2019 opening brief which rely on those Exhibits; and</p>\n<p id=\"AdI\">\u00b610 IT IS ORDERED that the Franks\u2019 motion for judicial notice of Exhibits A, C and D is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">\u00b6 11 The Clerk is directed to mail a true copy of this Order to counsel of record for the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">\u00b612 DATED this 1st day of September, 1998.</p>\n<judges id=\"b473-7\">/S/J.A.TURNAGE</judges>\n<judges id=\"b473-8\">/S/ KARLA M.
