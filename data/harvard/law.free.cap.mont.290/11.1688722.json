We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-17\">\u00b62 We address the following restated issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b34-18\">\u00b63 1. Does sufficient evidence support the convictions?</p>\n<p id=\"b35-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>\u00b64 2. Does \u00a7 45-8-101, MCA, as applied in this case, violate Comp\u00e1s\u2019 free speech rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">\u00b65 Chan and Pam Libbey (the Libbeys) developed, own and operate the Yellowstone Edge RV Park (RV Park) located in the Paradise Valley of Montana. The RV Park is situated eighteen miles south of Livingston on land wedged between U.S. Highway 89 and the Yellowstone River. The Libbeys opened the RV Park in the summer of 1994, after complying with the required public hearing process and obtaining the necessary state and local permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">\u00b66 Once the Libbeys started renting RV and camping spaces on the river, they began to experience repeated horn honking from vehicles traveling on the highway past the RV Park. The honking amounted to \u201csomeone just laying on the horn\u201d the length of the RV Park. Several Park County residents described the RV Park as a scar on the Paradise Valley\u2019s landscape and the newspaper in Livingston reported that the RV Park had become a \u201cpersistent source of controversy\u201d due to its location on the Yellowstone River.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">\u00b67 While in the campground office on the evening of May 6,1995, the Libbeys heard a loud, long horn honk consisting of three continuous blasts from a vehicle traveling north on Highway 89. Due to the ongoing horn honking problem, Chan left the RV Park in Pam\u2019s car and pursued the vehicle from which the honking emanated. He followed the vehicle, a white Toyota extended cab pickup, until he was close enough to get the license plate number. He then passed the pickup and obtained a physical description of the driver, a male with long straight blond hair, and one passenger, a female with short hair. Chan then returned to the RV Park. Several RV Park guests asked Pam why someone was holding down his or her horn while passing the campground.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">\u00b68 The next morning the Libbeys again heard three long horn honking \u201cblasts\u201d from a white Toyota pickup as it traveled south on the highway past the RV Park. Chan again followed the vehicle in Pam\u2019s car and confirmed that it was the same Toyota pickup from the night before, driven by the same male; this time he was accompanied by two passengers, a male and a female. Chan identified the female passenger as the woman from the prior night\u2019s horn honking incident. The RV Park guests complained about the horn honking noise. The Toyota\u2019s description, its license plate number and the descriptions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>driver and passengers were provided to the Park County Sheriffs Office after each incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">\u00b69 Comp\u00e1s subsequently was charged by complaint in the Park County Justice Court with two counts of disorderly conduct in violation of \u00a7 45-8-101(l)(b), MCA. The alleged factual basis for the charges was that she disturbed the peace, making loud or unusual noises, by blowing the Toyota\u2019s horn while her friend drove past the RV Park on May 6 and 7,1995. Comp\u00e1s was convicted of both counts of disorderly conduct and appealed to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\u00b6 10 At Comp\u00e1s\u2019 <em>de novo </em>bench trial on May 5,1997, she admitted to the District Court that she frequently honked as she traveled past the RV Park and that she did, in fact, honk the Toyota\u2019s horn on the dates in question. Comp\u00e1s testified that it was her \u201cpersonal policy to honk every time [she] drove by the place\u201d because she wanted to protest the RV Park and its location on the Yellowstone River. In Comp\u00e1s\u2019 view, the RV Park was an eyesore which destroyed the view from the road and the river.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\u00b611 The District Court subsequently entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order finding Comp\u00e1s guilty of two counts of disorderly conduct, making loud or unusual noises, in violation of \u00a7 45-8-101(l)(b), MCA. The court found that, while a passenger in a white Toyota pickup, Comp\u00e1s \u201creached over and honked the horn for three long, steady bursts as it traveled the length of the park... in protest of the placement and operation of the park\u201d and that \u201cby honking a horn for several seconds on May 6 and 7, 1995 ... [Comp\u00e1s] made loud and unusual noises.\u201d It concluded that Comp\u00e1s \u201cdisturbed] the peace of the owners and guests of Yellowstone\u2019s Edge RV Park.\u201d Judgment was entered accordingly and Comp\u00e1s appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">\u00b612 1. Does sufficient evidence support the convictions?</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">\u00b613  We review the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction to determine whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Granby </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 193, 199, 939 P.2d 1006, 1009 (citation omitted). The same standard applies to our review of judge-made findings relating to a criminal conviction as to jury-made findings. <em>Granby, </em>283 Mont. at 199, 939 P.2d at 1010 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">\u00b614  Comp\u00e1s was convicted of committing the offense of disorderly conduct set forth in \u00a7 45-8-101(l)(b), MCA, by making loud or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>unusual noises. She correctly observes that two elements must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt to support a conviction under \u00a7 45-8-101(l)(b), MCA: (1) that she knowingly disturbed the peace; and (2) that she did so by making loud or unusual noises. Relying on <em>State v. Ytterdahl </em>(1986), 222 Mont. 258, 721 P.2d 757, Comp\u00e1s contends that insufficient evidence established the \u201cdisturbing the peace\u201d element. Her reliance is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">\u00b615 The defendant in <em>Ytterdahl </em>was convicted of the offense of disorderly conduct under \u00a7 45-8-101(l)(g), MCA, by disturbing or disrupting any lawful assembly or public meeting. His conviction was based on his behavior at a county commissioners\u2019 meeting relating to an easement action taken by the county on his property. Ytterdahl \u201chollered] and scream[ed] at the commissioners\u201d and, after being informed that he could initiate a lawsuit regarding his complaint of trespass by the county, he \u201c\u2019mumbled a bad word,\u201d\u2019 got up, stomped out and slammed the door so hard that the glass in the room rattled.\u201d <em>Ytterdahl, </em>222 Mont. at 259-60, 721 P.2d at 758. We reversed Ytterdahl\u2019s conviction, ultimately holding that the evidence failed to show that his acts were sufficient to constitute the offense of disorderly conduct under \u00a7 45-8-101(l)(g), MCA. <em>Ytterdahl, </em>222 Mont. at 261-62, 721 P.2d at 759-60. In reaching that result, we held that \u201cdisturbing the peace is synonymous with breaching the peace[,]\u201d which we defined \u2014 for purposes of \u00a7 45-8-101(l)(g),MCA \u2014 as tending to create public tumult, or to incite others to break the peace or to cause an immediate disturbance by others. <em>Ytterdahl, </em>222 Mont. at 261, 721 P.2d at 759. In addition, we weighed Ytterdahl\u2019s rights to protest an allegedly unlawful act of his government and to free speech against the state\u2019s interest in preserving the peace and concluded that Ytterdahl\u2019s actual conduct was not sufficient to constitute the charged offense of disorderly conduct. <em>Ytterdahl, </em>222 Mont. at 262, 721 P.2d at 760.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\u00b616 Here, Comp\u00e1s contends that no evidence of record supports the District Court\u2019s finding that her horn honking resulted in a breach of the peace as we defined that term in <em>Ytterdahl. </em>Comp\u00e1s fails to recognize, however, that our definitions of breach of the peace in <em>Ytterdahl </em>were in the context of an alleged violation of subsection (g) of \u00a7 45-8-101(1), MCA, disturbing or disrupting any lawful assembly or public meeting; indeed, we specifically stated that the definitions were applicable \u201c[t]o establish a misdemeanor under Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>45-8-101(l)(g), MCA <em>...\u201d </em>As discussed above, Comp\u00e1s was charged, and convicted, under \u00a7 45-8-101(l)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">\u00b617 Moreover, we expressly limited application of <em>Ytterdahl </em>to disorderly conduct charges brought under \u00a7 45-8-101(l)(g), MCA, in <em>State v. Lowery </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 96, 98-99, 759 P.2d 158, 159-60. Like Comp\u00e1s, the defendant in <em>Lowery </em>was charged with disorderly conduct under a different subsection of \u00a7 45-8-101(1), MCA, than that at issue in <em>Ytterdahl. See Lowery, </em>233 Mont. at 99, 759 P.2d at 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">\u00b618 In this case, the District Court found that Comp\u00e1s\u2019 horn blasts disturbed the Libbeys and the guests of the RV Park. It further found that the horn honkings caused an immediate disturbance to the Libbeys and their guests and thereby disturbed their peace. The record supports the court\u2019s findings and, indeed, Comp\u00e1s does not argue otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">\u00b6 19 When viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found that Comp\u00e1s knowingly disturbed the peace by making loud or unusual noises. We hold, therefore, that sufficient evidence supports the District Court\u2019s conviction of Comp\u00e1s of two counts of disorderly conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">\u00b620 2. Does \u00a7 45-8-101, MCA, as applied in this case, violate Comp\u00e1s\u2019 free speech rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">\u00b621 Comp\u00e1s filed a pretrial motion to dismiss the disorderly conduct charges on the basis, in part, that her horn honking actions were protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution which could not be criminally sanctioned. The District Court orally denied the motion, concluding that Comp\u00e1s had not established an infringement of her free speech rights. Comp\u00e1s asserts error, contending that \u00a7 45-8-101, MCA, as applied in this case, violates her right to free speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">\u00b622  A trial court\u2019s decision to deny a motion to dismiss in a criminal case is a conclusion of law which we review <em>de novo. State v. Cooney </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 500, 502, 945 P.2d 891, 892 (citation omitted). Our review of a trial court\u2019s determination on a question of constitutional law also is plenary. <em>State v. Schnittgen </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 291, 295, 922 P.2d 500, 503 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">\u00b623 Comp\u00e1s contends that her horn honking activities were \u201cexpressive conduct\u201d which has long been recognized as protected speech under the United States Constitution. She cites to no authorities which support her position, however. To prevail on her \u201cas applied\u201d chai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>lenge to \u00a7 45-8-101, MCA, Comp\u00e1s must prove that her horn honking activities are constitutionally protected. <em>See State v. Helfrich </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 452, 458, 922 P.2d 1159, 1163. She has not done so with regard to her \u201cexpressive conduct\u201d contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">\u00b624 Nor is Comp\u00e1s\u2019 reliance on <em>Ytterdahl </em>in this regard well placed. There, we emphasized that the defendant\u2019s actions involved protesting to his government an allegedly unlawful act of his government. <em>Ytterdahl, </em>222 Mont. at 262, 721 P.2d at 760. Comp\u00e1s\u2019 conduct in the present case is of an entirely different type. She was not exercising her right to protest to her government and she was not protesting any allegedly unlawful act by her government or, indeed, by anyone. Thus, <em>Ytterdahl </em>does not support Comp\u00e1s\u2019 position here.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">\u00b625  The right to free speech is not absolute. <em>City of Billings v. Batten </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 64, 69, 705 P.2d 1120, 1124 (citation omitted). Indeed, \u201c[t]here are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problems.\u201d <em>State v. Lance </em>(1986), 222 Mont. 92, 102, 721 P.2d 1258, 1265 (citation omitted). One of those classes of speech not protected by the First Amendment is activity intended to embarrass, annoy or harass. <em>Helfrich, </em>277 Mont. at 460, 922 P.2d at 1164 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\u00b626 Here, Comp\u00e1s\u2019 horn honking activities clearly annoyed and harassed the Libbeys and their guests at the RV Park and, on the face of it, could not have been intended otherwise. Thus, while Comp\u00e1s asserts that her intent was \u201cto protest the location of the RV Park,\u201d her actions did not constitute a protest to government of government acts which would be entitled to protection under the First Amendment. Moreover, under these circumstances, Comp\u00e1s\u2019 \u201cprotest\u201d \u2014 aimed at the Libbeys \u2014 had precisely the effect she intended: it disturbed their peace and that of their guests.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">\u00b627  We conclude that the District Court correctly concluded that Comp\u00e1s did not establish a violation of her free speech rights. Therefore, we hold that the District Court did not err in denying Comp\u00e1s\u2019 motion to dismiss the disorderly conduct charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">\u00b628 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b39-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
