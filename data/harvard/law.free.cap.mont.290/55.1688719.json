Diesen pleaded guilty to this offense reserving his right to appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of his pretrial motion to dismiss, based upon improper venue. While adjudging Diesen guilty of the offense charged, the court nevertheless provided in its judgment \u201c[t]hat the sentencing of the Defendant is deferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>pending the appeal to review the adverse determination of the pretrial motion [to dismiss for improper venue].\u201d The District Court\u2019s judgment further provided \u201c[t]hat in the event the Defendant does not appeal this Judgment within the time provided by law, the Court, upon motion of the State, will set a time and date for a sentencing hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">\u00b62 We hold that we are without jurisdiction to consider Diesen\u2019s appeal and that, as a consequence, his appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\u00b63 \u201cAn appeal may be taken by the defendant only from a final judgment of conviction and orders after judgment which affect the substantial rights of the defendant.\u201d Section 46-20-104(1), MCA. \u201c \u2018Conviction\u2019 means a <em>judgment or sentence </em>entered upon a guilty plea...\u201d[,] \u00a7 46-1-202(6), MCA (emphasis added), and \u201c \u2018[judgment\u2019 means an adjudication by a court that the defendant is guilty or not guilty, and if the adjudication is that the defendant is guilty, <em>it includes the sentence pronounced by the </em>court\u201d[,] \u00a7 46-1-202(10), MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">\u00b64  Since the District Court did not sentence Diesen, there has been \u201cno final judgment of conviction.\u201d Moreover, Diesen is not appealing from a post-judgment order of the District Court. Accordingly, we are without jurisdiction to consider his appeal or to rule on the substantive legal issue which he raises. Section 46-20-104, MCA. <em>See State v. Hegeman </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 49, 52, 808 P.2d 509, 511 (holding that the district court lacked jurisdiction over defendant\u2019s appeal from justice court because the justice court failed to impose a sentence and enter a final judgment against defendant) (citing \u00a7\u00a7 46-17-311(2) and 46-20-104(1), MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">f 5  Jurisdiction involves the fundamental power and authority of the Court to determine and hear an issue. Once we determine that we lack jurisdiction to hear an appeal, then we can take no further action other than to dismiss it. <em>See Lurie v. Blackwell </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 404, 409, 948 P.2d 1161, 1164. That must be the result here.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">\u00b66 For future guidance of the trial courts and the practicing bar and in order to prevent the sort of waste of judicial resources that premature appeals of this nature engender, we admonish the trial courts to refrain from entering judgments in criminal cases where the court reserves sentencing for a time following the resolution of an appeal. Moreover, we admonish defense counsel and prosecutors to resist entry by the trial courts of such judgments. Finally, in the event these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>sorts of premature appeals are filed, we admonish appellate counsel to promptly move to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">\u00b67 Diesen\u2019s appeal being premature,</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\u00b68 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal should be and the same is hereby DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">\u00b69 IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk of this Court give notice of this Opinion and Order by mail to the Hon. John C. McKeon, District Judge, presiding, and to counsel of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">\u00b610 DATED this 25th day of June,1998.</p>\n<judges id=\"b79-8\">/S/J.A.TURNAGE</judges>\n<judges id=\"b79-9\">/S/JAMES C.
