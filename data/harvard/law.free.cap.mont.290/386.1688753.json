We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-18\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to Farmers on the basis of its conclusion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>George\u2019s trailer was not a \u201cutility trailer\u201d for purposes of liability coverage under the Farmers policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\u00b63 On February 4,1997, Angela Arnold (Arnold) was driving along Monad Road in Billings, Montana, when she collided with a fifth wheel trailer owned by George. The trailer was parked on the shoulder of the road and was not attached to any other vehicle. Arnold subsequently filed an action against George seeking damages for bodily injury and property damage resulting from the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">\u00b64 George had an automobile liability policy issued by Farmers and he submitted a claim requesting coverage for any liability incurred as a result of Arnold\u2019s accident. Farmers denied coverage and filed this declaratory judgment action requesting the District Court to determine that it had no obligation under the insurance policy at issue to either defend George or pay any damages awarded in Arnold\u2019s action. George answered the declaratory judgment complaint, alleging that his fifth wheel trailer was covered by the Farmers liability policy, and counterclaimed against Farmers for attorney\u2019s fees incurred in defending the declaratory judgment action, as well as costs and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in defending Arnold\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">\u00b65 Both Farmers and George moved for summary judgment on the issue of whether George\u2019s trailer was a covered vehicle under his Farmers policy. The District Court determined that George\u2019s trailer was not a \u201cutility trailer\u201d as defined in the policy because it was not being towed by another vehicle at the time Arnold collided with it and, as a result, the trailer was not covered by the policy. Therefore, the court concluded that Farmers was not obligated to defend or indemnify George in the action brought by Arnold, granted summary judgment to Farmers and entered judgment accordingly. George appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">\u00b66 We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a summary judgment motion <em>de novo, </em>using the same Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., criteria applied by the district court. <em>Stutzman v. Safeco Ins. Co. of America </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 372, 376, 945 P.2d 32, 34 (citations omitted). The moving party must demonstrate the absence of any genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 376, 945 P.2d at 34. If the moving party meets this burden, the opposing party must come forward with evidence es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>tablishing the existence of genuine issues of material fact precluding summary judgment. <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 376, 945 P.2d at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-3\">\u00b67  Here, the parties stipulated to the material facts of the case and, as a result, the only question before us is whether, under the terms of the insurance policy, Farmers was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The interpretation of an insurance policy presents a question of law (Stutzman, 284 Mont. at 376, 945 P.2d at 34 (citations omitted)), and we review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Herron v. Schutz Foss Architects </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 94, 98, 935 P.2d 1104, 1107.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to Farmers on the basis that George\u2019s trailer was not a \u201cutility trailer\u201d for purposes of liability coverage under the Farmers policy?</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\u00b69  The only vehicle listed on the declarations page of the Farmers policy at issue is a 1988 Ford F250 supercab pickup truck. Thus, George\u2019s trailer was not covered as an expressly insured vehicle. However, the policy\u2019s liability coverage terms state that Farmers \u201cwill pay damages... arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a car or utility trailer.\u201d It is undisputed that George\u2019s trailer is not a \u201ccar\u201d as defined under the policy. Consequently, in order to come within the liability coverage of the policy, George\u2019s trailer must meet the policy\u2019s definition of \u201cutility trailer.\u201d In that regard, the policy states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">\u201cUtility trailer\u201d means a vehicle designed to be towed by a private passenger car or farm car, including a farm wagon or farm implement, while towed by a private passenger car, utility car, or farm car.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">\u00b6 10 The District Court determined that George\u2019s fifth wheel trailer was not a \u201cutility trailer\u201d because it was not being towed by another vehicle at the time of the accident. On that basis, the court concluded that the trailer was excluded from coverage under the policy and Farmers was not obligated to defend or indemnify George in the action brought by Arnold. George argues that the District Court erred in concluding his trailer was not a utility trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">\u00b611 According to George, a utility trailer \u2014 as defined in the policy \u2014 means simply a vehicle designed to be towed by a private passenger car or farm car. He contends that the phrase \u201cwhile towed by a private passenger car, utility car, or farm car\u201d modifies only the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>ceding phrase \u201cincluding a farm wagon or farm implement\u201d and is not a requirement a trailer be in the process of being towed in order to be a utility trailer. Under George\u2019s interpretation, a utility trailer is any vehicle designed to be towed by a passenger or farm car, and one variety of such a vehicle may be \u201ca farm wagon or farm implement while towed by a private passenger car.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">\u00b612  Several well-established principles guide our interpretation of insurance policies. If the language of a policy is clear and explicit, the policy must be enforced as written. <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 376, 945 P.2d at 34. \u201cThis Court is bound to interpret the terms of [the] insurance policy according to their usual, common sense meaning as viewed from the perspective of a reasonable consumer of insurance products.\u201d <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 376, 945 P.2d at 34. Ambiguities are construed against the insurer and exclusions from coverage are construed narrowly because they are contrary to the fundamental protective purpose of insurance policies. <em>Wellcome v. Home Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 354, 356-57, 849 P.2d 190, 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">\u00b613 It is clear from the policy language \u2014 and the parties do not dispute \u2014 that, in order to be a \u201cutility trailer,\u201d a vehicle must be \u201cdesigned to be towed by a private passenger car or farm car....\u201d The subsequent phrase \u201cincluding a farm wagon or farm implement\u201d is set off by commas and, as such, constitutes an expanded and clarified description of a vehicle designed to be towed. The policy definition then goes on to provide that a vehicle designed to be towed is a utility trailer only \u201cwhile towed by\u201d a private passenger, utility or farm car. George\u2019s interpretation would require us to effectively disregard or delete the comma at the end of the \u201cincluding a farm wagon or farm implement\u201d clause, but our obligation to enforce clear and explicit policy provisions as written precludes us from doing so. The policy\u2019s \u201cwhile towed by\u201d language clearly applies to all vehicles designed to be towed. Thus, a vehicle designed to be towed by a private passenger car or farm car is a utility trailer under the Farmers policy before us while being towed by such a car and, conversely, such a vehicle is not a utility trailer if it is not being towed.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">\u00b614 Here, it is undisputed that George\u2019s trailer was parked on the shoulder of the road at the time Arnold collided with it and was not being towed by, or otherwise attached to, any other vehicle. As a result, George\u2019s trailer was not a \u201cutility trailer\u201d and was excluded from coverage under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>\u00b6 15  George contends, however, that construing the utility trailer definition in this manner \u201cresults in completely absurd circumstances\u201d and he presents several hypothetical scenarios under which he asserts liability coverage would be denied contrary to the reasonable expectations of the insured. Because our function is to interpret the law and apply it to the facts before us, we do not address George\u2019s hypothetical scenarios. Moreover, our interpretation of the \u201cutility trailer\u201d definition does not preclude coverage for trailer vehicles under all circumstances, so as to potentially defeat the expectations of a reasonable insurance consumer, but precludes coverage only for those not being towed. In this regard, the policy is clear, explicit and unambiguous and must be enforced as written. <em>See Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 376, 945 P.2d at 34. While the result may seem \u2014 and, indeed, be \u2014 harsh, that does not mean it is absurd. <em>See Canal Ins. Co. v. Bunday </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 100, 107, 813 P.2d 974, 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-3\">\u00b616  George also points out that the language of the policy obligates Farmers to pay damages \u201carising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a car or utility trailer\u201d and he argues therefrom that this express assumption by Farmers of liability for damages is not conditioned on the utility trailer being towed or otherwise attached to another vehicle at the time of the incident resulting in the damages. His argument is without merit. The coverage provision on which George relies includes the term \u201cutility trailer.\u201d That term is defined in the general definitions applicable to the entire policy and that definition contains the exclusion for trailer vehicles which are not being towed at the time the liability is incurred. Thus, replacing the term \u201cutility trailer\u201d in the coverage provision highlighted by George with the policy\u2019s definition of the term, the provision requires Farmers to pay damages \u201carising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a car or \u2018a vehicle designed to be towed by a private passenger car or farm car ... while towed by a private passenger car, utility car, or farm car.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AK1\">\u00b617 We conclude that the term \u201cutility trailer\u201d as defined in the Farmers policy at issue clearly means a vehicle designed to be towed by a private passenger car or farm car while being towed by such private passenger or farm car. We hold, therefore, that the District Court did not err in concluding that George\u2019s trailer was not a \u201cutility trailer\u201d for purposes of liability coverage under the Farmers policy and in granting summary judgment to Farmers on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\u00b618 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>JUSTICES NELSON, TRIEWEILER and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b414-4\">JUSTICE LEAPHART,</author>\n<p id=\"ASY\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">\u00b619 I dissent. The language of the policy presents an ambiguity which should be resolved against the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\u00b620 The language of the policy obligates Farmers to pay damages \u201carising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a car or utility trailer.\u201d George argues that this assumption of liability by Farmers for damages is not conditioned on the utility trailer being towed at the time of the incident in question. The Court purports to resolve this argument by pointing out that when the policy definition of utility trailer is inserted into the coverage provision relied upon, the provision requires Farmers to pay damages \u201carising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a car or...\u201d a \u201cvehicle designed to be towed by a private passenger car or farm car... while towed by a private passenger car, utility car, or farm car.\u201d The fallacy of the Court\u2019s approach becomes apparent however when you consider that the \u201cwhile towed\u201d language has to modify not only \u201cuse\u201d but also \u201cownership\u201d and \u201cmaintenance.\u201d The Court\u2019s resolution does not work with ownership or maintenance. In other words, \u201cwhile towed\u201d can modify \u201cuse,\u201d but it makes no sense to say that there is coverage for maintenance of the trailer while being towed. You do not maintain a trailer while it is being towed. Likewise, it makes no sense to provide coverage for ownership \u201cwhile [being] towed.\u201d Ownership is not temporally divisible. George either owned the trailer or did not. Ownership does not hinge upon whether the trailer is being towed. George owned the trailer for all purposes, both while it was being towed and in its stationary position. Thus there is coverage \u201carising out of [his] ownership\u201d of the trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">\u00b621 In my view, the construction of the policy propounded by Farmers and adopted by the Court is not consistent with the coverage provisions of the policy. The policy, at best, is ambiguous and should be resolved against the insurer. Section 28-3-206, MCA; <em>Bauer v. Mountain West Farm Bureau Mutual Ins. Co. </em>(1985), 215 Mont. 153, 156, 695 P.2d 1307, 1309. 1 would reverse the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
