We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">\u00b62 Ingraham advances twelve issues on appeal, reordered as follows for purposes of our discussion:</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in admitting evidence of various medications detected in Ingraham\u2019s blood and urine, as well as those found in his car?</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in admitting evidence of warnings generally given with the various medications detected in Ingraham\u2019s system and found in his car?</p>\n<p id=\"b44-12\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err in instructing the jury regarding the definition of \u201cknowingly\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b44-13\">\u00b66 4.

Did the District Court commit prejudicial cumulative error, thereby entitling Ingraham to a new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">PERTINENT FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">\u00b615 In the early morning hours of October 13,1995, Ingraham was driving north on Highway 93 near St. Ignatius, in Lake County, Montana. Roughly two miles north of town, Ingraham\u2019s vehicle crossed the center line and struck an oncoming Ford Ranger pickup truck, driven by Cynthia Harriman-Larson. Harriman-Larson died in the collision, and her passenger, Delbert Adams, suffered severe injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"AiY\">\u00b616 On the evening of the accident, Ingraham left his office at roughly 5:00 p.m. He went home, ate a peanut butter sandwich, gathered some hunting gear and his two dogs, and drove to the home of his friend and former client, Ed Starkel. Ingraham arrived at Starkel\u2019s residence at 5:30 p.m. and remained for approximately two hours, during which time he drank one-half of a can of beer while helping his friend prepare for a pack trip. Ingraham left Starkel\u2019s at 7:30 p.m. and drove to the Rustic Hut in Florence, where he met his friend Jeff Lulow and consumed three or four beers, as well as some popcorn and beer nuts. Ingraham and Lulow left the Rustic Hut in separate cars at roughly 11:30 p.m. and drove to Mustang Sally\u2019s in Missoula, where Ingraham had two more beers.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\u00b617 Ingraham left Mustang Sally\u2019s between 1:00 and 1:30 a.m. and began the drive home to Ronan, with his two dogs still in the back seat. Ingraham ate some trail mix while he was driving, and sipped from a beer he found on the floor behind the passenger seat in his car. It was a clear evening, and the two-lane road upon which Ingraham was traveling was dry as he passed through the St. Ignatius area. According to Ingraham\u2019s testimony at trial, just moments before the accident he saw headlights from an oncoming vehicle approaching in his lane of traffic. Ingraham shouted, at which point his dogs jumped into the front seat and he pushed them aside. Ingraham testified that the oncoming vehicle remained in his lane and that he thus swerved to the left, in a failed attempt to avoid the head-on collision in which Harriman-Larson was killed and Adams seriously injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">\u00b618 Adams, according to his testimony at trial, had spent portions of the day and evening preceding the accident drinking in St. Ignatius and Ronan. Although uncertain on the details, Adams indicated he had a few mid-morning beers at a friend\u2019s house, and then, to the best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>of his recollection, went home. Sometime later, he visited friends in Ronan and had a few more drinks. He remembered subsequently visiting two bars and having additional drinks, before attempting to hitch a ride home at roughly 2:00 a.m. on the morning of the accident. Shortly thereafter, Harriman-Larson stopped and offered Adams a ride. Thus, with Adams in the passenger seat, Harriman-Larson turned south on Highway 93, heading toward St. Ignatius. Tests revealed that Adams had a blood alcohol content (BAC) of .278.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\u00b619 Little is known about Harriman-Larson\u2019s activities during the evening hours preceding the accident, save for the fact that she spent approximately two hours visiting with her friend, Kay Palmer. Palmer testified that Harriman-Larson came over to her house at approximately 9:00 that evening, and stayed until 11:00 p.m., during which time Harriman-Larson drank two bourbon and waters. Harriman-Larson\u2019s activities between the time she left Palmer\u2019s house and the time she offered Adams a ride shortly before the accident, remain unknown. Although Harriman-Larson\u2019s exact activities remain unknown, forensic scientist Lynn Kurtz performed an alcohol screen on a blood sample taken from Harriman-Larson, which indicated the presence of .07 grams of alcohol per 100 mills of whole blood. Kurtz testified that the blood sample may have been contaminated, however, and stated that testing of Harriman-Larson\u2019s vitreous sample revealed a higher BAC of .14. Moreover, forensic toxicologist Susan Rasmussen testified that Harriman-Larson\u2019s body fluids contained an \u201cextremely high level\u201d of THC, the chemical substance found in marijuana. Rasmussen explained that tests revealed .297 nanograms of THC per milliliter of blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\u00b620 Adams testified that, shortly after Harriman-Larson began driving south on Highway 93, he saw a vehicle approaching in their lane. Adams remembered Harriman-Larson exclaiming, \u201cHey what\u2019s he doing,\u201d and then slowing down before the impact. Because of his injuries, Adams remembers nothing of the events immediately following the collision. He testified that his next memory was of waking up in the hospital three weeks later.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\u00b621 At 2:30 a.m. that morning Ingraham called his father on the phone from a nearby house which he forcibly entered while its occupants were asleep. Ingraham testified that he told his father, also an attorney, that he had been in an accident and that there were emergency vehicles on the scene. Ingraham\u2019s activities immediately following the accident, including leaving the accident scene to make the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>call, and breaking into the house, gave rise to some of the charges which were ultimately lodged against him. In fact, the State alleged that Ingraham failed to render aid to Adams by leaving the accident scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">\u00b622 Responding to a call from dispatch, Highway Patrol Officer Michael Roth arrived at the accident scene just after 3:00 a.m. and asked Ingraham what had happened. Officer Roth testified that Ingraham first told him he had crossed over the centerline into the southbound lane, but then explained that, \u201cno, we met in the middle of the road, in the middle of the centerline.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">\u00b623 Officer Roth suggested that Ingraham go to the hospital and requested a blood sample. A blood test indicated that Ingraham\u2019s BAC was .07 at 4:12 a.m. While treating Ingraham for his injuries, hospital personnel subsequently drew a second blood sample, the testing of which indicated that Ingraham\u2019s BAC was .05 at 5:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\u00b624 Later that day, Officer Roth examined Ingraham\u2019s vehicle at an auto body shop in Ronan. Among the items he found in the car at that time were a bottle of lithium carbonate capsules and a prescription bottle of Buspar. Indeed, Ingraham\u2019s blood tested positive for the presence of therapeutic levels of lithium, as well as subtherapeutic levels of librium. Moreover, Ingraham\u2019s urine tested positive for the presence of nicotine, as well as ephedrine and phenylpropanolamine, two drugs typically found in nonprescription cold medicine. Ingraham\u2019s blood also contained traces of caffeine.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">\u00b625 Sometime after 5:00 p.m. on the day following the accident, Jeanne Windham, a paralegal and friend of Ingraham\u2019s, picked Ingraham up at the hospital. After first stopping at his house to retrieve some clothing, she drove them to the scene of the accident at Ingraham\u2019s request. At trial, Windham offered testimony regarding her conversation with Ingraham at the scene of the accident. Windham recollected Ingraham telling her that his dogs began playing in the back seat and that, as he attempted to keep them from jumping into the front seat, his car swerved to the left just prior to colliding with Harriman-Larson\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">\u00b626 On October 30,1995, the State filed an information charging Ingraham with the felony counts of negligent homicide, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-104(1), MCA, and criminal endangerment, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-207(1), MCA. The information additionally charged Ingraham with one count of criminal trespass to property, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 45-6-203(l)(a), MCA. Ingraham entered a plea of not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>guilty to each count at his November 1,1995, arraignment. Following a change of venue, Ingraham was tried before a Flathead County jury in July 1996. The jury returned its verdict on July 19, 1996, finding Ingraham guilty on all three counts contained in the information. \u00b627 On December 4,1996, District Court Judge Kath\u00e9rine R. Curtis sentenced Ingraham to eight years in Montana State Prison, with two years suspended for the offense of negligent homicide. Ingraham received a consecutive sentence of eight years in Montana State Prison, with four suspended, for the offense of criminal endangerment. The court sentenced Ingraham to six months in the Lake County Jail, with all time suspended, for the misdemeanor offense of criminal trespass to property. Ingraham filed his notice of appeal on November 18, 1996, and the court entered its written judgment and commitment on December 4,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\u00b628 Did the District Court err in admitting evidence of the various medications detected in Ingraham\u2019s blood and urine, as well as those found in his car?</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\u00b629 On June 20, 1996, Ingraham filed a motion in limine, asking that the court issue an order precluding argument, evidence, and testimony on a number of subjects. Ingraham specifically moved to exclude testimony regarding the presence of lithium, librium, and other chemicals detected in his blood, as well as bottles of prescription medication found in his car. Ingraham asserted there existed no evidence that the lithium detected in his system impaired him in any way, and argued that the State\u2019s own expert toxicologist had testified during a pretrial interview that the presence of librium in his blood had no pharmacological or impairing effect upon Ingraham on the evening of the accident. In the absence of such an effect, Ingraham argued, reference by the State to the presence of either drug in Ingraham\u2019s system would not only be irrelevant, but would also cause undue prejudice, mislead the jury, and confuse the issues. For the same reasons, Ingraham similarly argued, the court should also preclude the State \u201cfrom referring to interactions or warnings about interactions between alcohol and other drugs \u2018prescribed or recommended\u2019 to the defendant or found in his car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\u00b630 In response, the State conceded that its expert, James Hutchison, \u201cwould testify at trial that, in his opinion, the detected concentrations of either drug probably did not substantially impair [Ingraham\u2019s] ability to drive,\u201d but effectively argued that fact was of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>little consequence. Rather, the State asserted the critical fact in this case was that Ingraham had any librium or lithium in his system at all at the time of collision. The State asserted it was entitled to establish that Ingraham\u2019s negligence included his \u201cuse of potentially dangerous, prescription-required drugs in combination [with] one another.\u201d In a July 9,1996, order, the District Court denied Ingraham\u2019s motion to exclude the drug evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">\u00b631  As with any evidentiary ruling, we review the district court\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>See State v. Gollehon </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 293, 301, 864 P.2d 1257, 1263. We leave the determination of whether evidence is relevant and admissible to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and will not overturn the court\u2019s determination absent an abuse of discretion. <em>See Gollehon, </em>262 Mont. at 301, 864 P.2d at 1263. <em>See also State v. Stringer </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 367, 374, 897 P.2d 1063, 1067; <em>State v. Passama </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 338, 341, 863 P.2d 378, 380; <em>State v. Crist </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 442, 445, 833 P.2d 1052, 1054.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">A. <em>Preservation of Objection for Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"AD7\">\u00b632 We first address the State\u2019s procedural argument that Ingraham waived any objection related to the introduction of the prescription drug bottles found in his car by failing to object to their admission during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\u00b633 Highway Patrol Officer Roth testified during the second day of trial that he had examined Ingraham\u2019s vehicle at a Ronan auto body shop on the day of the accident. Officer Roth stated that, at roughly 1:30 p.m. that afternoon, he retrieved a prescription bottle of Buspar from the inside pocket of the door on the driver\u2019s side of Ingraham\u2019s vehicle. According to the prescription label on the bottle, the Family Health Pharmacy in Ronan had dispensed the 10 milligram Buspar tablets, which had been prescribed for Ingraham by a Dr. McDonald. Officer Roth also found a bottle of lithium carbonate capsules, which bore no prescription label, in the pocket of the car door. During the fourth day of trial, the State elicited testimony from Michael Freeman, a pharmacist from the Family Health Pharmacy which dispensed the Buspar tablets found in Ingraham\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">\u00b634 Ingraham argues the court erred in admitting the prescription bottles into evidence, and in permitting jurors to examine those bottles. In response, the State focuses on Ingraham\u2019s motion in limine and argues that Ingraham moved only to prohibit the introduction of the bottles pending the State\u2019s ability to establish a proper foundation. The State points to that portion of the transcript which docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>ments Officer Roth\u2019s testimony, and argues that because Ingraham offered no objection at trial to the foundation established by the State, or to the introduction of the prescription drug bottles, he cannot now appeal their admission into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">\u00b635  Review of Ingraham\u2019s motion in limine confirms that he indeed moved to preclude the State \u201cfrom referring in opening statement or in testimony to the ... presence of other drugs in his ... car ... [only] until proper foundation is established.\u201d A close review of the remainder of his motion in limine, however, indicates Ingraham additionally moved to more generally preclude the State from \u201cmentioning that medications were found in the defendant\u2019s car,\u201d and did not condition that portion of his motion upon the State\u2019s ability to establish adequate foundation at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">\u00b636  We have repeatedly \u201capproved the use of a motion in limine to preserve an objection for appeal, provided the objecting party makes the basis for his objection clear to the district court.\u201d <em>State v. Fuhrmann </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 396, 403, 925 P.2d 1162, 1166 (citations omitted). A motion in limine has special advantages in situations such as this. A party may not wish to register an objection in the presence of the jury for tactical reasons, yet may wish to preserve the objection on appeal. This is precisely what Ingraham did. Having reviewed the entire text of Ingraham\u2019s motion in limine, we conclude Ingraham properly preserved his objection to the State\u2019s introduction of the Buspar and lithium bottles found in his car, and conclude the propriety of their admission by the District Court is an issue properly considered by us on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">B. <em>Relevance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">\u00b637  We turn next to Ingraham\u2019s argument that, because the medications detected in his system and found in his car had no impairing effect upon his ability to drive on the evening of the accident, evidence of their presence was not relevant to the question of his alleged negligence or negligent state of mind, and should not have been admitted by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">\u00b638 To answer this question, we look for initial guidance to the Montana Rules of Evidence which govern the admission of evidence. Pursuant to Rule 402, M.R.Evid., \u201c[a]ll relevant evidence\u201d is generally admissible. Conversely, \u201c[e]vidence which is not relevant is not admissible.\u201d Rule 402, M.R.Evid. Rule 401, M.R.Evid., defines relevant evidence as \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>tion more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">\u00b639 <em>In Havens v. State </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 195, 945 P.2d 941, a recent civil negligence case arising from an automobile accident, we had occasion to determine the relevancy of evidence indicating that one of the drivers had consumed alcohol on the day of the accident and had tested positive for the presence of marijuana consumed some four days earlier. In that case, Havens sustained severe injuries when the motorcycle he was driving collided with an automobile exiting the parking lot of a nearby store. <em>Havens, </em>285 Mont. at 196, 945 P.2d at 942. Havens sued the State of Montana, alleging its negligent failure to install a stop light at the parking lot\u2019s entrance caused the accident in which he was injured. <em>Havens, </em>285 Mont. at 196, 945 P.2d at 942. In its defense, the State alleged contributory negligence on Havens\u2019 part, asserting his consumption of alcohol earlier that day had effectively impaired his ability to react and safely operate his motorcycle. <em>Havens, </em>285 Mont. at 196, 945 P.2d at 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\u00b640 Prior to trial, Havens filed a motion in limine, seeking to exclude evidence of his alcohol consumption on the day of the accident. <em>Havens, </em>285 Mont. at 195, 945 P.2d at 941. Havens objected to the introduction of the results from a toxicology report which indicated he had a BAC of .068 and tested positive for the presence of marijuana. <em>Havens, </em>285 Mont. at 195, 945 P.2d at 941. The District Court denied Havens\u2019 motion in limine in light of the State\u2019s assurance \u201cthat it would produce testimony linking Havens\u2019 alcohol consumption as a contributory factor in the accident.\u201d <em>Havens, </em>285 Mont. at 198, 945 P.2d at 943. At trial, however, the State simply failed to demonstrate a \u201cconnection between Havens\u2019 alcohol consumption and the cause of the accident.\u201d <em>Havens, </em>285 Mont. at 198, 945 P.2d at 943. Instead, the uncontroverted evidence suggested that the presence of alcohol in Havens\u2019 system played no part in causing the collision. <em>Havens, </em>285 Mont. at 198, 945 P.2d at 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">\u00b641 Following a verdict in the State\u2019s favor, Havens moved for a new trial on the grounds that the court should have excluded \u201cthe evidence regarding Havens\u2019 alcohol consumption and the results of the toxicology report.\u201d On appeal from the District Court\u2019s decision denying Havens\u2019 motion for a new trial, we held that, absent a demonstrable causal link between the presence of alcohol and the accident, evidence of Havens\u2019 alcohol consumption was irrelevant and inadmissible. <em>Havens, </em>285 Mont. at 200, 945 P.2d at 944. We specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>concluded that, pursuant to Rule 402, M.R.Evid., the District Court should have excluded \u201cthe results of the toxicology report and evidence of Havens\u2019 alcohol consumption ... because, in the absence of testimony linking the evidence to the question of causation, it was irrelevant.\u201d <em>Havens, 285 </em>Mont. at 200, 945 P.2d at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\u00b642 Similarly, in the present case, whether drug evidence was, in fact, relevant depended upon the State\u2019s ability at trial to demonstrate a link between that evidence and the cause of the accident. At trial, forensic toxicologist James Hutchison testified as an expert on behalf of the State as to the various chemical substances detected in Ingraham\u2019s blood and urine samples and their pharmacological effects. Hutchison explained that Ingraham\u2019s first blood sample, drawn at 4:12 a.m. on the morning of the accident, tested positive for subtherapeutic levels of librium, or chlordiazepoxide, a prescription drug often used to control anxiety. Although Hutchison testified that librium, when present in its therapeutic range, may \u201chave some hypnotic sedative effects,\u201d he explained that the .27 milligrams per liter detected in Ingraham\u2019s blood was \u201cwell below therapeutic range.\u201d Hutchison testified that librium present at such a level would have \u201chad no pharmacological effect\u201d upon Ingraham on the evening of the accident, even in light of Ingraham\u2019s alcohol consumption. Hutchison noted that Ingraham\u2019s 4:12 a.m. blood sample also contained traces of librium\u2019s metabolite, nordiazepam, which he similarly agreed had no effect whatsoever upon Ingraham\u2019s ability to safely operate a motor vehicle on the night of the accident. The record indicates Ingraham\u2019s blood also tested positive for the presence of caffeine, which Hutchison again conceded had no pharmacological effect on Ingraham\u2019s ability to drive on the night of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u00b643 Hutchison additionally testified that a second blood sample, drawn from Ingraham at 5:30 a.m., tested positive for the presence of lithium, a prescription drug used to control manic depression. Hutchison explained that the .82 millimoles per liter of lithium present in Ingraham\u2019s blood was within the drug\u2019s narrow therapeutic index, and stated that, even in combination with alcohol, that amount would have had no adverse effect upon Ingraham\u2019s ability to drive.</p>\n<p id=\"AT\">\u00b644 Hutchison further testified that Ingraham\u2019s urine sample, submitted with the blood drawn at 5:30 a.m., tested positive for the presence of nicotine, and its metabolite, cotinine. During cross-examination, Hutchison agreed that neither the nicotine nor its metabolite had any effect upon Ingraham\u2019s ability to operate a motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>vehicle safely on the night of the accident. In fact, Hutchison explained that \u201c[t]he fact we found these in urine, by itself, implies that there was no impairment, because the urine\u2019s just a reservoir for the drugs after they\u2019ve cleared from the body.\u201d Also detected in Ingraham\u2019s urine, according to Hutchison, were traces of ephedrine and phenylpropanolamine, two drugs typically used as decongestants and commonly found in over-the-counter cold medications. Again, Hutchison agreed that neither of these drugs had any effect upon Ingraham\u2019s ability to drive on the evening of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">\u00b645 With respect to the prescription bottle of Buspar located in Ingraham\u2019s car on the evening of the accident, it was Hutchison\u2019s undisputed testimony at trial that, to his knowledge, no Buspar was found in any of the blood or urine samples submitted for testing. Thus, although Ingraham had a bottle of Buspar in his car, the State presented no evidence at trial to indicate that any traces of the drug were present in his system.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\u00b646 Uncontradicted evidence presented to the jury established that none of the drugs detected in Ingraham\u2019s system, or found in his car, had any impairing effect whatsoever upon his ability to drive on the evening of the accident. As the State failed to demonstrate that any of the drugs detected in his blood and urine, or found in his car, were causally connected to the accident, we conclude that evidence of their presence was irrelevant to the question of Ingraham\u2019s negligence, or negligent state of mind, and was inadmissible on that basis. Accordingly, we conclude the District Court abused its discretion in denying Ingraham\u2019s motion in limine, and hold the court should have excluded all evidence of the librium, nordiazepam, caffeine, lithium, nicotine, cotinine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine, found in Ingraham\u2019s system. We similarly hold the court abused its discretion when it denied Ingraham\u2019s motion to exclude evidence of the bottles of lithium and Buspar found by Officer Roth in Ingraham\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">C. <em>Prejudicial Effect</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">\u00b647  We have recognized that \u201c[e]vidence of the use of drugs is, by its very nature, prejudicial.\u201d <em>Simonson v. White </em>(1986), 220 Mont. 14, 23, 713 P.2d 983, 988. In <em>Simonson, </em>a civil negligence action arising from a fatal automobile accident, certain parties sought to exclude evidence that the driver had smoked marijuana, used cocaine, and ingested one or two capsules of Ephredine Sulphate on the day of the accident. <em>Simonson, </em>220 Mont. at 23, 713 P.2d at 988. The district court granted the joint motion in limine pending the opposition\u2019s ability to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>establish a foundation demonstrating that, \u201c[a]t the time of the collision, the driver was under the influence of drugs, and the passengers knew or should have known that he was under the influence,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he driver\u2019s negligence was the proximate or controlling cause of the injuries to plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Simonson, </em>220 Mont. at 23, 713 P.2d at 988. On appeal, we approved the district court\u2019s \u201cdemand for a [causal] link between the prejudicial evidence and the accident\u201d and held that, in weighing \u201cthe probative value of the evidence against its prejudicial effect,\u201d the appropriate test was \u201cwhether [the driver\u2019s] drug usage \u2018more likely than not\u2019 affected his ability to drive.\u201d <em>Simonson, </em>220 Mont. at 23-24, 713 P.2d at 988-89. Similarly, in <em>Havens, </em>we recognized that evidence that the driver had consumed alcohol on the day of the accident and had tested positive for the presence of marijuana, was of a \u201chighly prejudicial nature\u201d and \u201ccreated a danger of confusion on the issue of causation.\u201d <em>Havens, 285 </em>Mont. at 200, 945 P.2d at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\u00b648 Likewise, in the present case, evidence that Ingraham tested positive for the presence of a variety of chemical substances, including librium and lithium, was of a highly prejudicial nature. The State failed to demonstrate at trial that it was more likely than not that Ingraham\u2019s use of the various drugs detected in his system or those found in his car in any way affected his ability to drive on the evening of the accident. Thus, as we held above, evidence that he had ingested various medications was in fact irrelevant to the question of Ingraham\u2019s negligent state of mind, and had virtually no probative value whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u00b649 Even if, as the State suggests, evidence of the drugs was relevant to show a negligent state of mind, its probative value in that regard would have been substantially outweighed by its prejudicial nature and the evidence should have been excluded. Evidence that Ingraham tested positive for the chemical substances of librium, nordiazepam, lithium, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine is by itself prejudicial. That these drugs are not illegal is of little ultimate consequence. Coupled with testimony regarding the potential effects of the various drugs, and in light of the fact that none of these substances had any effect whatsoever on his ability to drive on the evening of the accident, evidence of their presence in Ingraham\u2019s system and in his car on the evening of the accident was unduly prejudicial. For example, although blood tests revealed only subtherapeutic levels of librium in Ingraham\u2019s system, Hutchison testified as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>drug\u2019s effects when present in higher, therapeutic doses. More specifically, Hutchison stated that, when present at a therapeutic level, librium may \u201chave some hypnotic sedative effects.\u201d Despite the fact that none of the drugs, even in combination with the alcohol in Ingraham\u2019s system, had any effect on his ability to drive, Hutchison was permitted to testify that it would not be advisable \u201cto mix these drugs and alcohol and driving.\u201d Such testimony was not only irrelevant, but was extremely misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">\u00b650 We have held that, if prejudice is alleged in a criminal case, \u201cit will not be presumed but must be established from the record that a substantial right was denied.\u201d <em>State v. Stuit </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 227, 232, 921 P.2d 866, 869 (quoting <em>State v. Wells </em>(1983), 202 Mont. 337, 349, 658 P.2d 381, 388). We have held that \u201c[t]he test of prejudicial error is whether \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt the error did not affect the outcome of the trial.\u2019\u201d <em>Stuit, </em>277 Mont. at 232, 921 P.2d at 869-70 (quoting <em>State v. Alexander </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 192, 198, 875 P.2d 345, 349).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">\u00b651 In the present case, we cannot say, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the District Court\u2019s error in admitting evidence of the drugs did not affect the outcome of Ingraham\u2019s trial. We accordingly conclude admission of the drug evidence in this case constituted prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\u00b652 Did the District Court err in admitting evidence of warnings generally given with the various medications detected in Ingraham\u2019s system and found in his car?</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">\u00b653  Our analysis of this issue is, of course, related to our analysis in Issue 1. In his pretrial motion in limine, Ingraham' asked the court to issue an order precluding the State \u201cfrom referring to interactions or warnings about interactions between alcohol and other drugs \u2018prescribed or recommended\u2019 to the defendant or found in his car.\u201d Ingraham suggested that \u201c[rjeferences to or implications of such interactions would be unduly prejudicial, confuse the issues, mislead the jury, and appeal solely to the jury\u2019s passion and prejudice.\u201d As it did with respect to Ingraham\u2019s motion to generally exclude evidence of the drugs detected in his system and found in his car, the District Court denied Ingraham\u2019s motion to exclude evidence of warnings about drug and alcohol interactions, concluding that evidence was relevant to the question of Ingraham\u2019s alleged negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">\u00b654 At trial, Ingraham objected to the proposed testimony of Michael Freeman, a pharmacist from the Family Health Pharmacy in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Ronan. Ingraham opposed Freeman\u2019s plans to testify about warnings he had \u201cgiven either to Mr. Ingraham directly or to patients generally about the dangers of librium and its use, either in conjunction with alcohol or with other prescription or nonprescription medicines.\u201d Ingraham sought to exclude the proposed testimony on several grounds. Ingraham first argued the proposed testimony was irrelevant in light of Hutchison\u2019s anticipated testimony that none of the drugs, either alone or in combination with alcohol, had any impairing effect upon Ingraham\u2019s ability to drive on the evening of the accident. Ingraham additionally argued that, even if relevant, the prejudicial effect of admitting evidence of warnings generally given in connection with the various medications in this case would \u201cfar exceed[] its probative value.\u201d In response, the State argued that the drugs detected in Ingraham\u2019s system and found in his car would be relevant to demonstrate Ingraham\u2019s negligence and that evidence of warnings generally given was relevant to demonstrate Ingraham\u2019s \u201cgross negligence ... in choosing to self-medicate with prescription drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">\u00b655 The District Court overruled Ingraham\u2019s objection to Freeman\u2019s proposed testimony. The court again reasoned that the question of whether Ingraham\u2019s use of the drugs, in conjunction with alcohol, \u201cconstitutes or is a component of gross negligence, is a fact question for the jury to decide,\u201d and concluded that evidence regarding warnings \u201cis part of the evidence [the jury] need[s] to make that determination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">A. <em>Relevance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\u00b656 As we have with respect to the admissibility of evidence regarding Ingraham\u2019s drug use, we similarly conclude that whether evidence of warnings generally given with those medications is relevant, and thus admissible, depends upon the State\u2019s ability to demonstrate a link between Ingraham\u2019s alleged failure to abide by those warnings and the cause of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">\u00b65 7 At trial, pharmacist Freeman testified as to warnings generally given with the medications at issue. Freeman was employed by the Family Health Pharmacy in Ronan, the pharmacy which dispensed the prescription bottle of Buspar found by Officer Roth in Ingraham\u2019s car. Freeman began his testimony by explaining his general duties as a pharmacist. For example, Freeman agreed that providing patients with information regarding \u201cwarnings or cautions about drug interactions\u201d is \u201cone of [his] main functions,\u201d and proceeded to detail the various methods he generally employs to impart that information. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Freeman then testified that he had provided Ingraham with medications in the past, including the prescription bottle of Buspar. Freeman then read aloud from the auxiliary label affixed to the bottle of Buspar which cautioned patients to \u201c[o]btain medical advice before taking nonprescription drugs which may affect the effect of this medication.\u201d Then, despite the fact that absolutely no traces of Buspar were present in Ingraham\u2019s system on the night of the accident, Freeman explained Buspar\u2019s use and general effects, recognizing that although \u201cmost patients can take [Buspar] without problem... pharmaceutical science is not an exact science.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">\u00b658 The State then elicited testimony from Freeman regarding those warnings which, pursuant to \u201cthe generally-accepted practice in the field of pharmacy ... would accompany the prescription of lithium.\u201d Freeman explained that in dispensing lithium, present at therapeutic levels in Ingraham\u2019s blood on the night of the accident, he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2\">would check a patient\u2019s profile, see if there\u2019s any medications they\u2019re already taking that might interact and give warning to that effect. Medications that would cause sedation or drowsiness, you would want to tell the patient that mixing that with lithium can cause further drowsiness. Any preparation containing alcohol can augment the drowsiness. Any medication such as a diuretic which will alter blood chemistry can augment the electrolyte imbalance that lithium can cause, and the patient would have to be warned about that too.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\u00b659 Freeman then examined the bottle of lithium, noting that it bore no prescription label. Moreover, Freeman testified that Ingraham had no active prescription for lithium with the Family Health Pharmacy as of the October 13,1995, date of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"AY\">\u00b660 The State then asked that Freeman describe those warnings which would accompany the dispensing of librium, pursuant to the general practice in the field of pharmacy. Although the record indicates that the subtherapeutic levels of librium detected in Ingraham\u2019s system on the night of the accident had no pharmacological effect upon him, Freeman nevertheless explained that, \u201cthe very least you would do\u201d is include a label warning that the drug \u201cmay cause drowsiness\u201d and that \u201c[m]ixing alcohol with that augments the drowsiness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\u00b661 As discussed at length above, the State has failed to demonstrate a causal connection between Ingraham\u2019s drug use and the accident. By virtue of that fact, it is correspondingly apparent from a re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>view of the record that the State has similarly failed to demonstrate a link between Ingraham\u2019s alleged failure to abide by those warnings and the cause of the accident. Although Freeman\u2019s testimony establishes that Ingraham, in all likelihood, received warnings which would have accompanied Buspar, no Buspar was found in his system. Thus, whether Ingraham received those warnings, and whether he complied with them, is not relevant and is, accordingly, inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">B. <em>Prejudicial Effect</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\u00b662  We agree with Ingraham\u2019s assertion that Freeman\u2019s testimony regarding warnings generally given was not only unduly prejudicial, but also served to obscure the fact that those medications had no impairing effect upon Ingraham\u2019s ability to drive, and played no causal role in the accident. For example, although the subtherapeutic levels of librium detected in Ingraham\u2019s system had no pharmacological effect upon Ingraham, Freeman nevertheless testified that librium may cause drowsiness, particularly in combination with alcohol. Despite the fact that the therapeutic level of lithium present in Ingraham\u2019s system had no impairing effect upon his ability to drive, Freeman explained that that drug too, would cause drowsiness, particularly in combination with alcohol. We conclude that such testimony was not only irrelevant, but was also unduly prejudicial. In light of the evidence presented, the jury may well have believed that the drugs, combined with alcohol, caused Ingraham to fall asleep at the wheel. Yet, the record indicates there exists no scientific basis for such a conclusion. Accordingly, we hold the District Court abused its discretion in admitting evidence of warnings which generally accompany such prescription medications as Buspar, lithium, and librium.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag\">\u00b663 We cannot here conclude that, beyond a reasonable doubt, the District Court\u2019s erroneous admission of evidence of warnings generally given, did not affect the outcome of the trial. We accordingly conclude admission of that evidence constituted prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">\u00b664 Did the District Court err in instructing the jury regarding the definition of \u201cknowingly\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">\u00b665 Among the charges leveled against Ingraham in the present case was one count of criminal endangerment, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-207(1), MCA. Pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-207(1), MCA, \u201c[a] person who knowingly engages in conduct that creates a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another commits the offense of criminal en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>dangerment.\u201d At the close of trial, Ingraham objected to Instruction No. 19, which defined \u201cknowingly\u201d as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">A person acts knowingly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">(1) when he is aware of his conduct or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">(2) when he is aware under the circumstances that his conduct constitutes a crime or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">(3) with respect to a specific fact, when he is aware of a high probability of that fact\u2019s existence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">\u00b666 Ingraham specifically took issue with the provisions of subsection (1), pursuant to which the jury could determine that Ingraham acted knowingly if \u201che [was] aware of his conduct.\u201d The court effectively overruled Ingraham\u2019s objections, and issued Instruction No. 19 as set forth above. The jury returned its verdict, convicting Ingraham of the offense of felony criminal endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">\u00b667 On appeal, Ingraham asserts the court incorrectly interpreted the law and erroneously instructed the jury regarding the appropriate definition of \u201cknowingly.\u201d Ingraham argues \u201cInstruction No. 19 was erroneous because it permitted the jury to convict Mr. Ingraham without finding that he was aware of \u2018the high probability\u2019 that his conduct would cause a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.\u201d In support of his argument on this point, Ingraham relies on our recent decision in <em>State v. Lambert </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 231, 929 P.2d 846, in which we held the court\u2019s decision to issue a similar instruction constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">\u00b668 In <em>Lambert, </em>decided by this Court five months after Ingraham\u2019s trial, the defendant was charged with criminal endangerment, pursuant to \u00a7 45-2-207(1), MCA, as well as with a number of other offenses. <em>Lambert, </em>280 Mont. at 233, 929 P.2d at 847. The court instructed the jury that:</p>\n<p id=\"b59-11\">A person acts knowingly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-12\">(1) <em>when he is aware of his conduct </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-13\">(2) when he is aware under the circumstances that his conduct constitutes a crime or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-14\">(3) when he is aware there exists the high probability that his conduct will cause a specific result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-15\"><em>Lambert, </em>280 Mont. at 234, 929 P.2d at 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-16\">\u00b669 We held the court specifically erred in instructing the jury that a person charged with criminal endangerment acts knowingly \u201cwhen he is aware of his conduct,\u201d instead concluding \u201cthat the \u2018knowingly\u2019 element of criminal endangerment contemplates a defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>awareness of the high probability that the conduct in which he is engaging, whatever that conduct may be, will cause a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another.\u201d <em>Lambert, </em>280 Mont. at 237, 929 P.2d at 850. In so concluding, we recognized that \u201c[i]t is the appreciation of the probable risks to others posed by one\u2019s conduct that creates culpability for criminal endangerment,\u201d rather than the \u201cmere appreciation of one\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Lambert, </em>280 Mont. at 236, 929 P.2d at 849.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">\u00b670  In the present case, we have already concluded that Ingraham is entitled to a new trial on the grounds that the court committed reversible error in admitting the drug evidence. In light of our determination that Ingraham is entitled to a new trial on the charges of negligent homicide and criminal endangerment on those grounds, we simply advise that, on retrial, the District Court should comply with our holding in <em>Lambert </em>when instructing the jury as to the definition of \u201cknowingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">ISSUE 4</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">\u00b671 Are convictions for negligent homicide and criminal endangerment legally inconsistent?</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">\u00b672 Ingraham argues that his felony convictions for negligent homicide and criminal endangerment are legally inconsistent because \u201c[t]he jury was permitted to conclude that the same conduct \u2014 crossing the center line \u2014 constituted both a negligent act and, inconsistently, a knowing act.\u201d More specifically, Ingraham argues that, with respect to the charge of criminal endangerment, the District Court improperly instructed the jury as to the definition of \u201cknowingly,\u201d because it did not require the jury to \u201cfind that Mr. Ingraham acted with awareness of a high probability that a particular result would occur.\u201d Because the court did not require that the State demonstrate Ingraham acted \u201cwith awareness of the consequences of his acts,\u201d Ingraham argues, \u201cthe common element between the states of mind required for the\u201d offenses of negligent homicide and criminal endangerment was missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">\u00b673 In response, the State first asserts that Ingraham has failed to cite to adequate authority in support of his argument on this issue, and that this Court should decline to address it. The State also argues Ingraham failed to present this issue to the District Court, and he is thus precluded from raising it on appeal. Even if properly raised on appeal, however, the State next asserts that this Court has previously rejected the same argument in the case of <em>State v. Pierce </em>(1982), 199 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Mont. 57, 64-65, 647 P.2d 847, 851, <em>overruled on other grounds by State v.

Pierce, </em>we recognized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-4\">[t]he mental state required to satisfy \u201cknowledge\u201d is more culpable than that for \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d because the actor must know it probable that a result will follow. \u201cCriminal negligence\u201d can be shown if risk to others is disregarded. However, proof of knowledge necessarily proves the elements of criminal negligence. You cannot engage in conduct knowing it likely will harm others without, at the same time, disregarding the risk to those others. The mental states are therefore not mutually exclusive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-5\"><em>Pierce, </em>199 Mont. at 65, 647 P.2d at 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">\u00b674  Ingraham concedes that, had the District Court properly instructed the jury pursuant to <em>Lambert, </em>\u201cthen the State\u2019s argument that proof of knowledge also establishes proof of negligence under <em>State v. Pierce </em>(1982), 199 Mont. 57, 647 P.2d 847, would be correct.\u201d Ingraham asserts, however, that because \u201cthe jury was not required to find that Mr. Ingraham acted with awareness of a high probability that a particular result would occur ... the common element between the states of mind required for the two offenses \u2014 awareness of risk \u2014 was missing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">\u00b675 As discussed above, we have instructed the District Court, on retrial, to comply with our holding in <em>Lambert </em>in instructing the jury on the definition of \u201cknowingly\u201d as an element of criminal endangerment. In so doing, we have effectively mooted Ingraham\u2019s argument that convictions for negligent homicide and criminal endangerment are legally inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">ISSUE 5</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">\u00b676 Is there sufficient evidence of record to support Ingraham\u2019s conviction for criminal endangerment?</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">\u00b677 On appeal, Ingraham argues the State failed to present sufficient evidence at trial upon which the jury could premise its verdict that Ingraham committed the crime of criminal endangerment. More specifically, Ingraham asserts the evidence was insufficient to show Ingraham \u201cknowingly\u201d engaged in conduct that created a substantial risk to Adams, the injured occupant of the vehicle. Ingraham also argues the State\u2019s evidence failed to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that he \u201cknowingly\u201d failed to render aid to Adams.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">\u00b678 Having already held that Ingraham is entitled to a new trial on the charge of criminal endangerment on other grounds, we need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>address Ingraham\u2019s argument that the record contains insufficient evidence to support his conviction for criminal endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">ISSUE 6</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\u00b679 Is there sufficient evidence of record to support Ingraham\u2019s conviction for negligent homicide?</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">\u00b68 0 Ingraham additionally argues there exists insufficient evidence of record to support the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty on the charge of negligent homicide.

The State thus sought Ingraham\u2019s medical records, alleging in its application for an investigative subpoena that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au7\">From previous experience with similar cases I am aware that hospitals routinely perform their own alcohol and drug tests on patients to determine whether those patients are under the influence of any substances which could affect their treatment. Hospital records also reflect statements made by the patient to hospital employees. Both of these items are relevant to the prosecution of this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">\u00b683 The District Court issued the investigative subpoena on October 17,1995, concluding that the \u201capplication has been made in good faith and in the furtherance of a pending criminal investigation,\u201d and that \u201cthere is reason to believe that the aforesaid test results may constitute evidence of possible criminal activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">\u00b684 On February 20, 1996, Ingraham filed a motion to limit the scope of the investigative subpoena, and to preclude the State from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>using any records \u201cthus obtained from St. Luke\u2019s Hospital.\u201d Ingraham argued the subpoena was overly broad, and in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 46-4-301 and -303, MCA. In a June 14, 1996, order, the District Court denied Ingraham\u2019s motion on the grounds that it was \u201cunable to conclude ... that [Ingraham\u2019s] privacy interest in statements made to hospital employees at or near the time of the accident outweighs the public\u2019s right to know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">\u00b685 On June 21,1996, Ingraham filed a motion in limine seeking to specifically \u201cexclude all evidence of the blood alcohol test performed at St. Luke\u2019s Hospital at 5:30 a.m., October 13,199[5].\u201d The court denied Ingraham\u2019s motion in limine, noting in part that \u201cthe State was charged with the responsibility of determining if there was probable cause to believe a crime had been committed.\u201d The court concluded the State had \u201ca clear compelling need for any evidence tending to establish [Ingraham\u2019s] blood alcohol content near the time of the accident.\u201d Moreover, the court reasoned that simply because \u201cthe State had access to the 4:12 test does not mitigate its need for any additional tests performed in the general time period following the collision,\u201d and held that Ingraham\u2019s \u201cprivacy interest in the blood alcohol test is outweighed by the State\u2019s compelling need to establish the facts as to the collision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\u00b686 Ingraham argues on appeal that the District Court abused its discretion in denying his motion to exclude evidence of test results from the 5:30 a.m. blood sample. More specifically, Ingraham asserts the court erred in concluding the State demonstrated that its compelling need for those test results outweighed any expectation of privacy he had in his own medical records, and in concluding the State had demonstrated it had probable cause to justify the court\u2019s issuance of the investigative subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">\u00b687 In <em>State v. Nelson </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 231, 941 P.2d 441, decided by this Court roughly one year after Ingraham\u2019s trial, we had occasion to redefine the standard pursuant to which the State may obtain discovery of protected medical records. In <em>Nelson, </em>we held</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">that in order to establish that there is a compelling state interest for the issuance of an investigative subpoena for the discovery of medical records, the State must show probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed and medical information relative to the commission of that offense is in the possession of the person or institution to whom the subpoena is directed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-8\"><em>Nelson, </em>283 Mont. at 244, 941 P.2d at 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>\u00b688 <em>InNelson, </em>we held the State had probable cause to believe an offense had been committed and that the defendant\u2019s medical records contained evidence of the offense, where the facts indicated \u201cthat Nelson had consumed a couple of drinks before the accident; that the road was bare and dry; that he ran into a guardrail; that he suffered a broken jaw; and that he had received medical treatment at the Glendive Medical <em>Center.\u201dNelson, </em>283 Mont. at 244, 941 P.2d at 450. Under the facts in that case, we affirmed the District Court\u2019s order denying Nelson\u2019s motion to quash the investigative subpoena, or in the alternative to suppress evidence. <em>Nelson, </em>283 Mont. at 244, 941 P.2d at 450.</p>\n<p id=\"AtM\">\u00b689  In the present case, the State\u2019s application for an investigative subpoena set forth facts which demonstrate it had probable cause to believe an offense had been committed and that Ingraham\u2019s medical records contained evidence of the offense. In its application, the State asserted that Ingraham\u2019s vehicle \u201chad crossed over the centerline and struck a pickup truck,\u201d and indicated that \u201c[witnesses at the scene said that Ingraham appeared to be intoxicated, and the officers found a beer bottle and several beer bottle caps in Ingraham\u2019s car.\u201d The State also noted that \u201ctwo prescription medicine bottles\u201d were found in his car. Moreover, it is apparent from the text of its application that the State was aware that Ingraham had received treatment at St. Luke Hospital in the hours following the accident. Applying the standard enunciated by this Court in <em>Nelson, </em>we conclude the State adequately demonstrated it had a compelling state interest for the issuance of an investigative subpoena. We accordingly affirm the District Court\u2019s orders denying Ingraham\u2019s motion to limit the scope of the investigative subpoena, and denying his motion to exclude evidence of test results from the 5:30 a.m. blood sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">ISSUE 8</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\u00b690 Did the District Court err in excluding a demonstrative videotape from evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\u00b691 On appeal, Ingraham argues the District Court abused its discretion in excluding from evidence a demonstrative video prepared by a defense expert to illustrate Ingraham\u2019s theory as to how the accident occurred. Defense expert and accident reconstructionist Dr. Floyd Denman Lee, prepared the videotape to demonstrate that the collision could have occurred had Ingraham swerved to the left in an attempt to avoid Harriman-Larson\u2019s vehicle which he alleges was approaching in his lane of traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>\u00b692 After viewing the videotape, hearing argument by the parties, and listening to foundational testimony by Dr. Lee, the court ordered the demonstrative videotape excluded from evidence. The court explained its decision to exclude the videotape as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-4\">I am not going to allow a video that focuses on one of a minimum six, maximum of 25, equally-probable solutions to be thrust upon the State at the last minute. I find that this particular video is, in fact, with regard to the distance of the vehicles, not even based upon the testimony of any of the witnesses. I think it unduly emphasizes one of several equally probable scenarios in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">I certainly think this witness is as free as a bird to testify about those. But to allow this sort of visual display of one of them to the exclusion of the others, I think, means that its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-6\">As well, I\u2019m concerned about the fact that this is based upon statements of witnesses and not testimony of witnesses, and there are certainly credibility calls for the jury to make with regard to those differences. So I\u2019m not going to allow it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\u00b693 We review the District Court\u2019s evidentiary ruling for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Oatman </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 139, 144, 911 P.2d 213, 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">\u00b694  We have held that \u201c[e]xhibits used for demonstration purposes are admissible if they supplement the witness\u2019s spoken description of the transpired event, clarify some issue in the case, and are more probative than prejudicial.\u201d <em>Palmer by Diacon v. Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 515, 522-23, 761 P.2d 401, 406 (citing <em>Workman v. McIntyre Construction Co. </em>(1980), 190 Mont. 5, 24, 617 P.2d 1281, 1291). Moreover, \u201cmovies of reconstructions ... are admissible if shown to be accurate and relevant, and any change in conditions is adequately explained.\u201d <em>Brown v. North Am. Mfg. Co. </em>(1978), 176 Mont. 98, 117, 576 P.2d 711, 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">\u00b695  Thus, in determining whether to permit the introduction of demonstrative evidence, the court should consider a number of factors, including whether the evidence would supplement a witness\u2019s description of events and clarify some issue in the case. <em>Palmer, </em>233 Mont. at 522-23, 761 P.2d at 406. Furthermore, the court should consider whether the evidence is both accurate and relevant, whether any change in conditions has been adequately explained, and whether the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighs its probative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>value. <em>Palmer, 233 </em>Mont. at <em>522-23, </em>761 P.2d at 406; <em>Brown, </em>176 Mont. at 117, 576 P.2d at 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">\u00b696 Despite Ingraham\u2019s assertions to the contrary, review of the record indicates that the court did indeed consider whether the prejudicial effect of the videotape outweighed its probative value, and expressed concern over admitting a videotape which had been thrust upon the State at the last minute.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">\u00b697 Although the court considered some of the requisite factors, it did not consider all of the factors set forth in our decisions. In light of the fact that we are, in any event, remanding the case for retrial on other grounds, we advise the court to specifically address the factors discussed in <em>Workman, Palmer, </em>and <em>Brown </em>and reconsider the question of whether the videotape may be admissible as demonstrative evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">ISSUE 9</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">\u00b698 Did the District Court err in admitting expert testimony regarding blood alcohol levels?</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">\u00b699 Ingraham argues the District Court erred in permitting State forensic scientist Lynn Kurtz to testify on rebuttal as to the number of drinks Ingraham would have had to consume to reach the BACs later tested, and as to Ingraham\u2019s specific BAC level at the time of the accident. Ingraham argues that because Kurtz acknowledged during the State\u2019s case-in-chief that he could not specifically determine Ingraham\u2019s BAC at the time of the accident, the court erred in permitting him to do \u201cexactly what he ... had agreed could not be done,\u201d and testify during rebuttal as to Ingraham\u2019s specific BAC at the time of the accident. More specifically, Ingraham argues the court \u201cerred in permitting Mr. Kurtz to speculate that defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level, tested at .07 at 4:12 a.m., was higher than .10 at the time of the accident,\u201d and asserts Kurtz\u2019s opinion was dependent upon a number of unspecific factors and unsupported by his earlier testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">\u00b6100 The State, in response, notes that Kurtz agreed on direct examination that he could not estimate Ingraham\u2019s BAC at the time of the accident without certain additional information. Once it had succeeded in getting the missing information into the record, the State asserts, Kurtz was then entitled to rely on a shortened version of the Widmark formula to estimate what Ingraham\u2019s BAC would have been at the time of the accident, were he to have consumed the number of drinks to which he testified. The State additionally argues Kurtz was entitled to estimate that Ingraham would have had to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>sume sixteen Bud Lights to reach the BAC of .07 indicated by the 4:12 a.m. blood test.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">\u00b6101 We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Gollehon </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 293, 301, 864 P.2d 1257, 1263.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">\u00b6102 During the State\u2019s case-in-chief, Kurtz indeed agreed that he did not know what Ingraham\u2019s BAC was at the time of the accident. As illustrated by the following exchange on redirect, however, Kurtz testified that, were there additional facts in the record, he could more accurately estimate what Ingraham\u2019s BAC might have been at the time of the accident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">Q (County Attorney): And the same thing with the Defendant having a .077 BAC at the time he\u2019s tested at 4:12. We don\u2019t know where he was, based upon the information that we have right now at the time of the wreck; isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">A (Kurtz): That\u2019s also correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">Q: Now, if we had the information concerning what he had in his stomach, the number of drinks that he alleges he had, the types of drinks he alleges he had, you stated that you can make some assumption concerning body water content, during direct examination, food type, food quality. [If t]hat information was provided to us and put into evidence, do you think that you can make an educated guess, within a reasonable degree of scientific certainty or probability, as to what his BAC could have been at the time of the wreck?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AY8\">A: I could more fully demonstrate the potential BACs at the time of the incident, given that extra information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\">Q: Which is not in the record as of yet, to your knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-10\">A: To my knowledge, no.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">\u00b6103 Following Kurtz\u2019s initial testimony, much of the information upon which Kurtz explained an estimate of Ingraham\u2019s BAC at the time of the accident depended, entered the record. For example, Ingraham testified as to the number and type of alcoholic beverages he consumed in the hours preceding the accident, and described the food he consumed over the course of the evening. Moreover, he agreed that the weight reflected on his driver\u2019s license might be accurate at 170 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-12\">\u00b6104  Although Ingraham argues it was error for the court to permit Kurtz to testify that Ingraham\u2019s BAC was greater than. 10 at the time of the accident, a close review of Kurtz\u2019s testimony on rebuttal indicates he actually made no such statement. The transcript indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>cates that the State, on rebuttal, asked Kurtz to assume that Ingraham\u2019s eating and drinking history on the night of the accident was as reflected in his testimony. The State additionally asked Kurtz to assume Ingraham weighed 170 pounds. In response to the State\u2019s hypothetical question, Kurtz stated he would have expected to see a BAC of only .018 at 4:15 a.m. Kurtz also testified that, for Ingraham\u2019s BAC to reach .077 by 4:12 a.m., he would have had to consume \u201capproximately 16 drinks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">\u00b6105 Review of the transcript indicates that, by the time the defense rested, the record contained evidence of those factors identified by Kurtz as necessary in order for him to estimate the number of drinks Ingraham would have had to consume to reach a BAC of .077 by 4:12 a.m., and to estimate Ingraham\u2019s BAC at the time of the accident. Although Ingraham takes issue with the shorthand version of the Widmark formula upon which Kurtz relied while testifying, the record indicates that a number of professionals in Kurtz\u2019s field rely upon the same formula. Moreover, we note that Kurtz offered an in-depth explanation of his formula for the jury\u2019s consideration, and that Ingraham\u2019s counsel extensively cross-examined Kurtz on his shortened formula. Based on the foregoing, and having reviewed the record, we conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in permitting Kurtz to estimate the number of drinks that Ingraham would have had to consume on the night of the accident and to estimate Ingraham\u2019s BAC level at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">ISSUE 10</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">\u00b6106 Did the District Court err in admitting testimony by paralegal Jeanne Windham?</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">\u00b6107 Ingraham argues the District Court erred in permitting paralegal Jeanne Windham to testify as to statements Ingraham made to her about the accident. Ingraham asserts that Windham was one of his law firm\u2019s employees, and argues the content of his conversations with her about the accident was protected by the attorney-client privilege and constituted privileged work product. Moreover, Ingraham asserts the court erred in admitting rebuttal testimony regarding additional conversations overheard by Windham, but which did not tend to counteract new matter introduced by the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">\u00b6108 The State, in contrast, argues that neither the attorney-client privilege nor the work product rule apply to protect the content of conversations between Ingraham and Windham in the aftermath of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>accident. The State additionally asserts that Windham\u2019s testimony on rebuttal was proper, and urges the court did not err in overruling Ingraham\u2019s objections to its admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">\u00b6 109 We review the District Court\u2019s evidentiary ruling for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Gollehon </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 293, 301, 864 P.2d 1257, 1263.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">A. <em>Attorney-client privilege</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">\u00b6110 Ingraham first asserts the content of his conversations with Windham was protected by the attorney-client privilege, and that the District Court thus erred in overruling his objections to Windham\u2019s proposed testimony. Ingraham argues that, upon making the telephone call to his father on the night of the accident, he became a client of the Ingraham Law Office. Ingraham asserts that, because Windham worked as a paralegal for the Ingraham Law Office at the time of the accident, the attorney-client privilege extends to her and protects any statements he made to her regarding the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"A_7\">\u00b6111 In support of his argument, Ingraham points to \u00a7 26-1-803(1), MCA, pursuant to which \u201c[a]n attorney cannot, without the consent of his client, be examined as to any communication made by the client to him or his advice given to the client in the course of professional employment.\u201d Ingraham asserts his disclosures to Windham were made \u201cin the course of professional employment,\u201d and thus fall within the protection afforded by the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">\u00b6112 Over Ingraham\u2019s objection, the District Court permitted Windham to testify, concluding that it did not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-8\">believe that the communication that took place between the Defendant and Ms. Windham on October 13th, 1995,... at approximately six o\u2019clock p.m., can reasonably be construed as communication made by a client to the attorney, as the statute defines in the course of professional employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-9\">There are several factors that lead me to that conclusion. The first one is that there\u2019s no indication that Greg Ingraham had retained Ingraham Law Office as his counsel with regard to this accident. There certainly is no indication, even if that had happened, that Ms. Windham had any reason, whatsoever, to believe that that had happened. And I have no reason to believe that Greg Ingraham believed that that had happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-10\">Even if it had, Ms. Windham left her professional employment when she left that office at five o\u2019clock that day, on her own volition, to visit the Defendant as a friend. The only reason she received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>communications from the Defendant that night is because she agreed, as a friend, to transport him to her house so that she could take care of him. And it\u2019s inconceivable to me that that can be construed to be in the course of professional employment. The Defendant then requested her, during that visit, to go to the accident scene, apparently, and said certain things to her. That doesn\u2019t necessarily become an attorney-client communication just because Ms. Windham happens to have been an independent contractor for the Defendant at that time. I think it\u2019s a factor that she wasn\u2019t paid for that time that she spent with him.... And sol don\u2019t believe that this could reasonably have been construed by the Defendant as a conversation by a client with an attorney or a member of his attorney\u2019s office. And so I\u2019m going to deny the motion to exclude her testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">\u00b6113  Windham testified in chambers that, although she worked for Gregory Ingraham as an independent contractor, she performed no paralegal services for Lloyd Ingraham. She also testified that she had done nothing to assist Gregory Ingraham in defending this case, and that to her knowledge, there was no file on this case at the Ingraham Law Firm. Our review of the pertinent testimony indicates that Ingraham\u2019s conservations with Windham were purely personal and not in the course of a professional relationship. Having reviewed the record, we conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the content of Ingraham\u2019s conversations with Windham on the day of the accident were not protected by attorney-client privilege and in admitting her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">B. <em>Work-product</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">\u00b6114  On June 18,1996, Ingraham filed a motion to dismiss all the charges brought against him on \u201cgrounds of violation of the attorney-client privilege and work product rule.\u201d The court denied Ingraham\u2019s motion, concluding in pertinent part that the work product doctrine did not apply to conversations Ingraham had with Windham in the aftermath of the accident. In so concluding, the court reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-9\">[t]he logical extension of this argument would be that no statements of attorney-parties to litigation would ever be admissible. There was never any indication that the Defendant was representing himself in connection with this matter. In fact, in support of his argument concerning the attorney-client privilege, Defendant contends that the relationship was established between himself, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>client, and his father, as attorney, within minutes after the motor vehicle collision that led to these charges. There is no support for the proposition that the information shared by Defendant with his employees should be excluded under the work product doctrine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJJ\">Having reviewed the record, we agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion on this issue and, absent an abuse of discretion, we will not disturb its decision to admit Windham\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">C. <em>Rebuttal testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\u00b6115 Finally, Ingraham argues Windham\u2019s testimony on rebuttal was improper. Ingraham notes that, on rebuttal, Windham testified as \u201cto what she heard Mr. Ingraham say when he described the accident to other persons, when his father was not present.\u201d Ingraham asserts that, although the court agreed the testimony did not constitute proper rebuttal, it nevertheless allowed that testimony. For the court to do so, Ingraham argues, was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">\u00b6116  Contrary to Ingraham\u2019s assertion, the court, in fact, concluded that Windham\u2019s testimony was appropriate rebuttal, even though it did not directly refute Ingraham\u2019s version of his conversation with Windham on the date of the collision. Having reviewed the record, we hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion in so concluding, and in allowing Windham\u2019s testimony on rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">ISSUE 11</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">\u00b6 117 Did the District Court err in ordering the parties not to contact the jurors after they rendered their verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">\u00b6118 Ingraham\u2019s counsel asserts that, following the verdict in this case, he learned of the possibility \u201cthat the jury may have received extraneous prejudicial information, resulting from a highly prejudicial conversation in a juror\u2019s presence.\u201d On August 16, 1996, Ingraham filed a motion for a new trial, on the grounds of alleged juror misconduct. On October 9,1996, the District Court ordered that counsel refrain from contacting the jurors in this case. Ingraham filed a second motion for a new trial on October 24, 1996, and additionally asked that the court lift its \u201corder prohibiting counsel from speaking with trial jurors.\u201d On December 31,1996, the District Court issued its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order denying Ingraham\u2019s motions for a new trial. On appeal, Ingraham argues the court was without authority to \u201cissue a blanket order precluding attempted contact with nonparty witnesses,\u201d and asserts the court\u2019s order that he not contact the jurors prevented a full investigation into allegations of juror misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>\u00b6119 In light of our determination that Ingraham is entitled to a new trial with respect to the charges of negligent homicide and criminal endangerment on other grounds, we need not reach the merits of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">ISSUE 12</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">\u00b6120 Did the District Court commit prejudicial cumulative error, thereby entitling Ingraham to a new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">\u00b6121 We need not address the question of whether Ingraham is entitled a new trial pursuant to the cumulative error doctrine in light of our conclusion that the District Court committed reversible error in admitting evidence of the medications detected in Ingraham\u2019s system and found in his car, and in admitting evidence of warnings generally given along with those medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">\u00b6122 We hold the District Court erred in admitting evidence of medications detected in Ingraham\u2019s system and found in his car. We hold the District Court also erred in admitting evidence of warnings generally given with the various medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">\u00b6 123 We affirm the District Court\u2019s decision admitting expert testimony regarding blood alcohol levels and in admitting testimony by paralegal Jeanne Windham. We also affirm the District Court\u2019s orders denying Ingraham\u2019s motion to limit the scope of the investigative subpoena, and denying his motion to exclude evidence of test results from the 5:30 a.m. blood sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">\u00b6 124 We need not address whether there exists sufficient evidence of record to support Ingraham\u2019s convictions for criminal endangerment and negligent homicide, and need not discuss the cumulative error doctrine. Moreover, we need not address the question of whether the court erred in ordering the parties not to contact the jurors after they rendered their verdict. Finally, we conclude that Ingraham\u2019s argument that convictions for negligent homicide and criminal endangerment are legally inconsistent is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">\u00b6125 We advise the District Court, on retrial, to comply with our decision in <em>Lambert </em>in instructing the jury as to the definition of knowingly. Moreover, we advise the court to reconsider the question of whether the videotape is admissible as demonstrative evidence in light of the specific factors set forth in <em>Palmer, Workman, </em>and <em>Brown.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>\u00b6126 Based on the foregoing, we vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand this case for retrial on charges of negligent homicide and criminal endangerment.</p>\n<judges id=\"b73-4\">JUSTICES NELSON, HUNT and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b73-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE and JUSTICE TRIEWEILER did not participate in this opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b73-6\">JUSTICE GRAY</author>\n<p id=\"AV\">concurs and dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">\u00b6127 I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion on all issues except issue 8. On that issue, which is whether the District Court erred in excluding a demonstative videotape from evidence, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">\u00b6 128 My first concern is with the Court\u2019s decision to remand this issue for reconsideration under our cases involving the admissibility of demonstrative evidence. By failing to address and resolve this issue now, with a full record and an articulated decision by the District Court before us, the Court merely leaves an unresolved issue for potential appeal after retrial. This course strikes me as unwise, particularly in light of the fact that the Court has resolved all other issues on appeal \u2014 including issue 7, which could have been remanded for reconsideration in light of <em>Nelson, </em>which was decided after the present case had been tried. In my view, the Court took the wise approach in deciding issue 7 \u2014 rather than remanding it \u2014 in order to avoid the possibility of leaving a potentially appealable issue for resolution after retrial. The Court should follow the same wise course on issue 8.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay\">\u00b6129 Moreover, I suspect that the Court\u2019s failure to resolve the issue, and its directive that the District Court reconsider its decision, may be a backhanded way of telling the District Court that it erred in this regard and should avoid doing so in the next trial. If it is the Court\u2019s decision that the trial court erred, it should say so. If not, it should say so. To leave the District Court in such a quandary seems inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">\u00b6130 I would address issue 8 on the merits and affirm the District Court. The Court faults the trial court for failing to consider all of the factors set forth in <em>Workman, Brown </em>and <em>Palmer </em>I would not. We have never held that those three cases, or any others, create a mandatory laundry list of factors to be considered to the exclusion of any others. Nor is the Court\u2019s list of relevant cases complete. If the Court desires the trial court to review each and every case addressing the admissibility of demonstrative evidence, and articulate its decision on each factor mentioned therein, I suggest that it asks too much. If that is to be the trial court\u2019s burden, however, the Court should at least include</p>\n<p id=\"b74-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>in its list cases such as <em>State v. Crazy Boy </em>(1988), 232 Mont. 398, 757 P.2d 341, which concludes that the exclusion of cumulative demonstrative evidence does not constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">\u00b6 131 Furthermore, it is my view that the District Court sufficiently addressed the factors in <em>Workman, Brown </em>and <em>Palmer, </em>as well as several other factors appropriate to the circumstances here. In this regard, I observe that the Court has neglected to include the entirety of the District Court\u2019s rationale in excluding the videotape and, to set the record straight, I note that \u2014 in addition to the reasons set forth in the Court\u2019s opinion \u2014 the District Court also determined that the videotape would not assist the jury and, indeed, would mislead the jury by giving visual emphasis to only one of several equally probable scenarios.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">\u00b6132 In <em>Workman, </em>190 Mont. at 24, 617 P.2d at 1291, we stated that the admissibility of demonstrative exhibits depends \u201con whether it would be helpful to permit the witness to supplement his [verbal] description by their use.\u201d Presumably our reference to \u201chelpful\u201d meant helpful to the jury. Here, the District Court determined in that regard that the videotape would not assist the jury, but would mislead it. We also concluded in <em>Workman </em>(190 Mont. at 24, 617 P.2d at 1291) that demonstrative evidence is inadmissible when it does not illustrate or make more clear some issue (that is, when the evidence is irrelevant or immaterial) or when the evidence is \u201cof such a character as to prejudice the jury.\u201d Here, the District Court effectively determined that the videotape would prejudice the jury by overemphasizing one of a number of equally probable scenarios.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">\u00b6133 <em>In </em>Brown, 176 Mont. at 117, 576 P.2d at 722, we required that demonstrative movies be \u201caccurate and relevant.\u201d Here, the District Court determined that the distance depicted on the videotape was not accurate in that it was not based on the testimony of any of the witnesses. The record reflects that the District Court was correct in so determining, because Dr. Lee used a 1/5 mile distance in the videotape and the witness\u2019 testimony was \u201cless than <em>lA </em>mile,\u201d while his interview statement \u2014 on which Dr. Lee relied \u2014 gave the distance as 1/4 to <em>A </em>mile.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">\u00b6134 In <em>Palmer, </em>233 Mont. at 522-23, 761 P.2d at 406, we stated a 3-part test for the admissibility of demonstrative evidence: 1) the evidence must supplement the witness\u2019 spoken description of the transpired event; 2) it must clarify some issue in the case; and 3) it must be more probative than prejudicial. It is true that, in this case, the District Court did not articulate precisely whether the first two parts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>of the <em>Palmer </em>test were met. The Court\u2019s suggestion to the contrary notwithstanding, however, all three parts of the <em>Palmer </em>test clearly need not be addressed if the trial court makes a determination under the third part that the demonstrative exhibit is, in fact, more prejudicial than probative. The Court correctly notes in this regard that the District Court did consider whether the prejudicial effect of the videotape outweighed its probative value and concluded that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">\u00b6 135 On this record, it is clear that the District Court properly considered and addressed the factors set forth in <em>Workman, Brown </em>and <em>Palmer </em>for admissibility of demonstrative evidence. In addition, the District Court could properly have determined \u2014 under <em>Crazy Boy </em>\u2014 that the videotape was merely cumulative to Dr. Lee\u2019s testimony about the one scenario depicted therein. Indeed, the court implicitly did so when it determined that to use the videotape to emphasize only one of the probable scenarios to which Dr. Lee testified would mislead the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">\u00b6 136 I would conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the demonstrative videotape. Therefore, I dissent from the Court\u2019s opinion on issue 8.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b75-6\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"ATr\">specially concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">\u00b6 137 I concur with and have signed the Court\u2019s opinion. I write separately only because I strongly disagree with Justice Gray\u2019s articulated suspicion that our failure to resolve Issue 8 and our directive to the trial court to reconsider its decision on this issue \u201cis a backhanded way of telling the District Court that it erred.\u201d That was not my thinking when I voted for and signed the Court\u2019s decision and I do not believe that was the rationale of any of the other justices in the majority. \u00b6138 Obviously, the videotape was an important piece of evidence in Ingraham\u2019s presentation of his defense as far as he was concerned. Equally obvious, is that the State, considered the videotape damaging to its case. The point is, however, that Ingraham is entitled to have this evidence admitted on retrial if he can satisfy the <em>Workman, Palmer </em>and <em>Brown </em>criteria. If he cannot, then the State is entitled to keep this evidence from the jury. My concern and that of the majority was and is simply that, whatever decision is made on retrial; the court\u2019s discretion must be exercised within the parameters of a full and complete consideration of the factors that this Court, in our prior decisions, has stated are controlling before the admission or rejection of this sort of evidence. In my view, our opinion should not be read as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>standing for anything more or less than that, nor should it be read as a backhanded reversal of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">\u00b6139 Finally, if the dissent\u2019s concern is that resolving, rather than remanding, this issue will prevent a second appeal if Ingraham is again convicted, then I suggest that hope has triumphed over experience.</p>\n<judges id=\"b76-5\">JUSTICE REGNIER concurs in the foregoing special concurrence.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
