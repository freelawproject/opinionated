In June 1997, Lewis filed a motion for contempt and for specified visitation on the grounds that the child\u2019s mother, Melissa Sowers (now known as Melissa Greene and hereinafter referred to as Sowers) had denied him reasonable visitation. Sowers later filed a motion asking that the District Court decline to exercise continuing jurisdiction over the matter. The court denied Sowers\u2019 motion to decline jurisdiction, and subsequently entered an oral order granting Lewis much of the relief he sought by way of his motion for contempt and specified visitation. Sowers appeals from the District Court\u2019s order denying her motion to decline jurisdiction and from the court\u2019s oral order granting Lewis\u2019s motion for specified visitation and request for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>\u00b62 The sole dispositive issue presented by Sowers on appeal is whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying her motion to decline jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\u00b63 B.E.S. was born in Great Falls, Montana, on March 29,1992, to Melissa Sowers and James Lewis. The relationship between Sowers and Lewis had begun to deteriorate prior to B.E.S.\u2019s birth, and the two never married. The record indicates that Lewis\u2019s paternity was initially established by blood tests performed in 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\u00b64 B.E.S. has lived with her mother for her entire life. B.E.S. lived in Great Falls with her mother from the time of her birth until the summer of 1997, when she and her mother moved to Fargo, North Dakota, to live with Sowers\u2019 new husband. On August 15, 1995, while B.E.S. and her mother were still living in Great Falls, Lewis filed a petition in Cascade County District Court to establish paternity, custody, and visitation rights as B.E.S.\u2019s father. Lewis is a Wisconsin resident, as he was at the time he filed the petition in August 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">\u00b65 On March 6,1996, Lewis filed a motion for temporary visitation on the grounds that he and Sowers had been unable to negotiate an acceptable visitation schedule. On March 15,1996, Sowers filed a motion for an order requiring Lewis to pay temporary child support, to maintain health insurance for B.E.S. and to pay all of the child\u2019s uncovered medical expenses. The court held a hearing on March 18, 1996, to address the parties\u2019 respective motions. Prior to the hearing, the parties reached an agreement with respect to temporary visitation, temporary child and medical support, and a variety of other issues. The parties entered their stipulations upon the record during the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">\u00b66 More than one year later, on June 24,1997, Lewis filed a \u201cmotion for contempt, for specified visitation, and other relief.\u201d Lewis asserted he had been denied visitation with his daughter on a regular basis, and asked the court to order \u201ca set visitation schedule.\u201d Lewis additionally asked that the court hold Sowers \u201cin contempt for her failure to abide by past orders, and to live up to her obligations under the joint custody statutes regarding maintaining contact between\u201d B.E.S. and Lewis. Among Lewis\u2019s remaining requests were that the court issue an order temporarily prohibiting Sowers from removing B.E.S. from the court\u2019s jurisdiction, and that it order Sowers to pay the attorney fees and costs he incurred in connection with filing the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>\u00b67 On July 10,1997, the District Court issued a temporary order mandating that B.E.S. \u201cremain in Great Falls, Montana, with her maternal grandmother, until a hearing can be held in this matter.\u201d The court set a hearing to address the remainder of Lewis\u2019s motion for October 31,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">\u00b68 OnSeptember 19,1997, Sowers filed a motion for an order declining jurisdiction. Sowers asked that the court decline \u201cto exercise continuing jurisdiction in this matter for the reasons that this state is an inconvenient forum, pursuant to Section 40-7-108, MCA, and the child\u2019s home state of North Dakota is a more appropriate forum for this case.\u201d Sowers noted that Lewis was a resident of Wisconsin, and argued that because she and B.E.S. were residents of North Dakota, \u201c[a]ny evidence regarding the child\u2019s present or future care, protection, training, and personal relationships is more readily available in North Dakota than in Montana.\u201d Sowers argued that \u201c[t]he state of North Dakota obviously has a closer connection with the child and her family than Montana has,\u201d and asserted that the continued exercise of jurisdiction by Montana\u2019s courts would contravene the purpose of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\u00b69 On October 29,1997, the District Court issued an order denying Sowers\u2019 motion for an order declining jurisdiction, finding that, at the time Lewis filed his motion for contempt, for specified visitation, and other relief, \u201cMontana was clearly the home state of the child and it is at that point that the determination is made.\u201d The court additionally noted that, as of the October 29,1997, date of its order, B.E.S. had \u201cyet to live for a six month period of time in North Dakota.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">\u00b610 OnOctober31,1997, the court held a hearing on Lewis\u2019s motion for contempt, visitation, and other relief. At the close of the hearing, the court entered an oral order granting Lewis certain visitation rights, and mandating that Sowers pay a portion of Lewis\u2019s attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">\u00b611 On November 26,1997, Sowers filed her notice of appeal from the District Court\u2019s October 29,1997, order denying her motion to decline jurisdiction, and from its October 31,1997, oral order regarding visitation and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">\u00b612 Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Sowers\u2019 motion to decline jurisdiction?</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">\u00b6 13  As noted, Sowers appeals from the District Court\u2019s order denying her motion to decline jurisdiction, as well as from its subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>quent order granting Lewis certain visitation rights and mandating that she pay a portion of his attorney fees and costs. Although Sowers appeals from both orders, the sole issue she raises on appeal is whether the court erred in denying her motion to decline jurisdiction. We review the District Court\u2019s decision denying Sowers\u2019 motion to decline jurisdiction for an abuse of discretion. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>In re Marriage of Irwin </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 176, 179, 855 P.2d 525, 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">\u00b614 On appeal, Sowers argues the District Court failed to complete the two-tiered jurisdictional analysis required by the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA), and that it was thus an abuse of discretion for the court to deny her motion to decline jurisdiction. Although Sowers does not specifically dispute the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Montana was B.E.S.\u2019s \u201chome state\u201d at the time of Lewis\u2019s motion for contempt and visitation, she does assert the court erred in ending its jurisdictional inquiry at that point. Sowers argues that once the court had evaluated the jurisdictional prerequisites of \u00a7 40-4-211, MCA, it was bound to then determine whether Montana\u2019s courts were an inconvenient forum to make a custody determination under the circumstances present at the time of her September 19, 1997, motion to decline jurisdiction. More specifically, Sowers argues the court abused its discretion in failing to address those factors identified in \u00a7 40-7-108(3), MCA, as relevant to an inconvenient forum determination. For example, although Sowers concedes the court considered whether another state was B.E.S.\u2019s home state, she argues the court failed to consider whether another state had a closer connection with the child and whether substantial evidence regarding B.E.S.\u2019s welfare was more readily available in another state. Sowers also argues the court failed to consider whether the continued exercise of jurisdiction by Montana\u2019s courts would contravene the purposes of the UCCJA as set forth in \u00a7 40-7-102, MCA. Based on the foregoing, Sowers asks that we vacate the District Court\u2019s decision, and remand this matter \u201cwith instructions to stay the District Court proceedings pending assumption of jurisdiction over these matters by the North Dakota court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\u00b615 Lewis, in contrast, argues the District Court correctly concluded it had jurisdiction over the present case pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-211, MCA, and asserts the court did not abuse its discretion in deciding to maintain jurisdiction over the matter. More specifically, Lewis argues the District Court correctly concluded that Montana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>was B.E.S.\u2019s \u201chome state,\u201d and argues the court thus had jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-211, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">\u00b616 Lewis next recognizes that \u00a7 40-7-108, MCA, authorizes a Montana court to decline jurisdiction \u201cat any time before making a decree if it finds that it is an inconvenient forum to make a custody determination under the circumstances of the case and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum,\u201d but argues the court was not obligated to undertake such an analysis. Even if it was necessary for the court to address the inconvenient forum question, however, Lewis argues there was no more appropriate forum in this case than that presented by Montana\u2019s courts. For example, Lewis asserts that \u201call relevant evidence pertaining to B.E.S.\u2019s care, training, [and] personal relationships\u201d was located in Montana at the time he filed his motion for contempt and visitation. Moreover, unlike Sowers, Lewis asserts that the District Court\u2019s decision to maintain jurisdiction in this case actually complies with the stated purposes of the UCCJA. Based on the foregoing, Lewis argues the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Sowers\u2019 motion to decline jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\u00b617  We have previously stated that the UCCJA \u201cestablishes a two-tiered jurisdictional test which a court must find satisfied before it makes even an initial custody decree.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Bolton </em>(1984), 212 Mont. 212, 216, 690 P.2d. 401, 403 (quoting <em>Wenz v. Schwartze </em>(1979), 183 Mont. 166, 178, 598 P.2d 1086, <em>1093, cert. denied </em>(1980), 444 U.S. 1071, 100 S. Ct. 1015, 62 L. Ed. 2d 753). The first tier \u201cmandates that one of the four disjunctive requirements of Section 40-4-211, MCA, be satisfied before a district court may take jurisdiction to make a child custody determination.\u201d <em>Bolton, </em>212 Mont. at 216, 690 P.2d at 403. Section 40-4-211(1), MCA, provides in pertinent part that \u201c[a] court of this state competent to decide parenting matters has jurisdiction to make a parenting determination by initial or amended decree if: (a) this state: (i) is the home state of the child at the time of the commencement of the proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">\u00b618 In the present case, the District Court specifically concluded that because B.E.S. had \u201cyet to live for a six month period of time in North Dakota\u201d at the time of Lewis\u2019s motion for contempt and specified visitation, or the time of its order, \u201cMontana was clearly the home state of the child.\u201d Because Sowers does not specifically dispute this conclusion on appeal, we need not determine whether the court erred in concluding that Montana qualified as B.E.S.\u2019s \u201chome state\u201d as that term is defined by \u00a7 40-7-103(5), MCA. It is thus apparent that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>first tier' of the UCCJA\u2019s jurisdictional test was met in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">\u00b619 The second tier of the UCCJA\u2019s jurisdictional test \u201cdemands that a court which has satisfied the prerequisites of Section 40-4-211, MCA, then determine whether jurisdiction <em>should </em>be exercised.\u201d <em>Bolton, </em>212 Mont. at 220, 690 P.2d at 405. Under this second tier, the district court has \u201cdiscretionary authority to \u2018decline to exercise its jurisdiction\u2019 upon a determination that it is an \u2018inconvenient forum\u2019 and that a court of another state is a \u2018more appropriate forum.\u2019\u201d <em>Bolton, </em>212 Mont. at 216-17, 690 P.2d at 403 (citing \u00a7 40-7-108, MCA). We have explicitly recognized that \u201c[t]he decision to decline jurisdiction on inconvenient forum grounds is purely discretionary with the District Court.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Cook </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 293, 297, 725 P.2d 562, 564-65. We have stated that the court, in determining whether it is an inconvenient forum, \u201cshall consider if it is in the child\u2019s best interest for another state to assume jurisdiction, taking into account such factors as whether another state is the child\u2019s home state, whether substantial evidence concerning the child\u2019s welfare is more readily available in another state, and whether the exercise of jurisdiction by a Montana court would contravene the UCCJA\u2019s stated purposes.\u201d <em>Irwin, </em>259 Mont. at 179, 855 P.2d at 527 (citing \u00a7 40-7-108(3), MCA). Section 40-7-108(3), MCA, specifically provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">In determining if it is an inconvenient forum, the court shall consider if it is in the interest of the child that another state assume jurisdiction. For this purpose it may take into account the following factors, among others:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">(a) if another state is or recently was the child\u2019s home state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">(b) if another state has a closer connection with the child and his family or with the child and one or more of the contestants;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\">(c) if substantial evidence concerning the child\u2019s present or future care, protection, training, and personal relationships is more readily available in another state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-9\">(d) if the parties have agreed on another forum which is no less appropriate; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-10\">(e) if the exercise of jurisdiction by a court of this state would contravene any of the purposes stated in 40-7-102.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">\u00b620  Although the District Court considered the \u201chome state\u201d factor, it is clear from the text of its order denying Sowers\u2019 motion to decline jurisdiction that it did not specifically evaluate any of the remaining statutory factors before deciding to maintain jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>over the present case. Despite the fact that the court did not expressly discuss the remaining criteria identified by \u00a7 40-7-108(3), MCA, we nevertheless conclude the court did not abuse its discretion in denying Sowers\u2019 motion to decline jurisdiction. Nowhere does \u00a7 40-7-108(3), MCA, mandate that the court consider each of the five factors set forth within. Instead, the statute simply lists a number of elements which the court <em>may </em>consider in making an inconvenient forum determination. In the present case, the court clearly considered the first factor set forth in \u00a7 40-7-108(3), MCA, and concluded that Montana was B.E.S.\u2019s home state. The record indicates that B.E.S. spent the first five years of her life in Great Falls, Montana, and moved to North Dakota in early July 1997, just days after Lewis filed his motion for contempt and for specified relief. Sowers filed her motion asking that the court decline to exercise continuing jurisdiction over the case just two and one-half months after B.E.S. had moved to North Dakota. At the time of Sowers\u2019 motion to decline jurisdiction, B.E.S. had lived in Montana for all but two and one-half months of her life. Under these circumstances, there is no indication that B.E.S. and her family had any closer connection to North Dakota then they did to Montana, and no indication that evidence regarding B.E.S.\u2019s welfare was any more readily available in North Dakota than it was in her home state of Montana. Finally, we note there is no indication that the exercise of continuing jurisdiction by the Montana court in this case contravenes any of the nine general purposes of the UCC JA, among which is the deterrence of \u201cunilateral removals of children undertaken to obtain custody awards.\u201d Section 40-7-102(l)(e), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">\u00b621 Based on the foregoing, we hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Sowers\u2019 motion to decline jurisdiction, and accordingly affirm the court\u2019s October 31,1997, oral order regarding visitation and attorney fees.</p>\n<judges id=\"b217-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, HUNT and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
