California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Gonzalez has filed a response. The record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration at this time of Gonzalez\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel; such claims generally \u201ccannot be resolved on direct appeal when [they have] not been raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Gonzalez\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivo-lous issue for appeal. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b748-38\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
