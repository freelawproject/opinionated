The BIA denied Khan\u2019s appeal in June 2006; and, in December 2006, it denied his motion to reopen the proceeding. In November 2007, our court denied Khan\u2019s motion to remand to the BIA for reconsideration and dismissed his petition for review. <em>See Khan v. Keisler, </em>253 Fed.Appx. 393 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">In January 2008, more than a year after our denial of his petition for review, Khan filed a second motion with the BIA to reopen his removal proceeding. Khan conceded untimeliness, but claimed exceptional circumstances justified reopening his proceeding. The BIA denied that motion as untimely, its having been filed more than 90 days after the BIA\u2019s prior order denying relief; and, it declined to reopen Khan\u2019s removal proceeding <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-16\">Khan claims his removal proceeding should have been reopened, despite the untimeliness of his motion, because new facts exist that were not available at the time of his hearing before the IJ. According to Khan: his 1-140 (employment-based immigrant visa) labor certification had been erroneously denied by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS); he, therefore, had not had an opportunity to present his application to adjust status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i) to the IJ; and CIS delayed more than 18 months in forwarding a notice of appeal to its administrative appeals office. He claims CIS\u2019 delay caused him to be ordered removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-17\">Khan\u2019s exceptional-circumstances assertion fails because he did not satisfy the conjunctive requirement that the motion to reopen be filed within 180 days of the removal order. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) (establishing the 180-day filing period); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2 (providing that the section\u2019s 90-day filing period (for motions to reopen removal proceedings in the BIA) does not apply to motions brought pursuant to \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(h)). Claimed exceptional circumstances need not be addressed if the accompanying motion is not filed within the period established by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>Because Khan\u2019s motion was untimely, reopening depended entirely on the BIA\u2019s choosing to do so <em>sua sponte. See Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 216, 220 (5th Cir.2008). Because the regulation governing <em>sua sponte </em>reopening vests the BIA with complete discretion to deny untimely motions to reopen, our court \u201chas no legal standard by which to judge the ... ruling, and therefore ... lacks jurisdiction\u201d. <em>Id.; see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Nor may Khan create jurisdiction under the guise of due process. Neither the filing nor the granting of an application for labor certification affects \u201cthe discretionary removal relief\u2019 provided by statute. <em>Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 433, 438-39 <em>&amp; </em>n. 3 (5th Cir.2006). Because \u201cthe failure to receive relief ... is purely discretionary in nature\u201d, it \u201cdoes not amount to a deprivation of a liberty interest\u201d. <em>Assaad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 475 (5th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Mejia Rodriguez v. Reno, </em>178 F.3d 1139, 1146 (11th Cir.1999)); <em>see also Manzano-Garcia v. Gonzales, </em>413 F.3d 462, 471 (5th Cir.2005). Because he has no protected liberty interest in a motion to reopen, Khan is unable to demonstrate a due process violation. <em>See Altamirano-Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 547, 551 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b684-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
