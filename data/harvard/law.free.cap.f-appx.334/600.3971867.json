He contends: the district court incorrectly raised his base offense level by determining he qualified as a career offender; and, it erred in refusing to grant him a minimal or, in the alternative, minor, role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-23\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 598, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the guidelines is reviewed <em>de </em>novo; its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-24\">Garza had prior convictions in North Carolina for possession with intent to sell or deliver both marijuana and co<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>caine. He contends the district court committed reversible error in concluding his prior North Carolina offenses were \u201ccontrolled substance offenses\u201d and in using those convictions to sentence him as a career offender under Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Pursuant to Guideline \u00a7 4Bl.l(a), a defendant is a cai'eer offender if, in relevant part, he \u201chas at least two prior felony-convictions of ... a controlled substance offense\u201d. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a)(3). A \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d is defined as \u201can offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that prohibits the ... possession of a controlled substance ... with intent to manufacture, import, expoi\u2019t, distribute, or dispense\u201d. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b). Whether a conviction is \u201cpunishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d depends on whether the offense carries a potential sentence of more than one year, rather than whether an individual defendant convicted of that offense meets the criteria for a sentence of that length. <em>See United States v. Caicedo-Cuero, </em>312 F.3d 697, 699-700, 705-06 (5th Cir.2002); see <em>also United States v. Harp, </em>406 F.3d 242, 245-46 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Under North Carolina\u2019s sentencing scheme, Garza\u2019s conviction for possession with intent to sell or deliver marijuana was a Class I offense, which carries a maximum potential sentence of 15 months. N.C. Gen.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 15A-1340.17(d). His conviction for possession with intent to deliver cocaine was a Class H offense, which has a maximum potential sentence of 30 months. N.C. Gen.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 15A-1340.17(d). Because the maximum statutory sentence for each of Garza\u2019s North Carolina convictions exceeded one year, they constituted \u201ccontrolled substance offenses\u201d supporting the Guideline \u00a7 4B1.1 enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Garza also maintains the district court erred by denying his motion for a mitigating-role adjustment under Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 3B1.2 (providing a decrease in offense level if the defendant was a minor or minimal participant in the criminal activity at issue). Whether the defendant is a minor or minimal participant is a factual determination, reviewed only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Garza\u2019s courier status alone did not entitle him to a role adjustment because a defendant may be a courier without being \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant\u201d. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>54 F.3d 234, 241 (5th Cir.1995). If a sentence is based on activity in which a defendant was actually involved, Guideline \u00a7 3B1.2 does not require a reduction in the base offense level even though the defendant\u2019s activity in a larger conspiracy may have been minor. <em>United States v. Atando, </em>60 F.3d 196, 199 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Garza admitted he was aware he was driving a vehicle with drugs concealed in the engine. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in denying his request for a reduction based on his role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b629-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
