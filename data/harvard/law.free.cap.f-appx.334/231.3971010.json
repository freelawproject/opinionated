She raises two ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>guments on appeal. First, she contends that the government violated her due process rights by substantially interfering with a witness\u2019s decision to testify on her behalf. Second, she contends that the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">A federal grand jury returned a second superseding indictment against Petit Frere, charging her with conspiracy to: traffic in or use unauthorized access devices (credit cards), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(2); possess with intent to defraud 15 or more unauthorized access devices, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(8); and possess with intent to defraud device-making equipment (a credit card skimming device), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(4); all in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(b)(2). The indictment also charged Petit Frere with five related substantive counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Four co-conspirators who were originally indicted with Petit Frere \u2014 Jeffrey Pierre, Daruco Pacouloute, Hassan Pacoul-oute (\u201cHassan\u201d), and Chantal Tejada\u2014 pled guilty, pursuant to written plea agreements. In Hassan\u2019s plea agreement, he agreed to \u201cprovide truthful and complete information and testimony....\u201d In exchange, the government agreed that it would recommend a sentencing reduction for acceptance of responsibility and would consider filing a motion for a downward departure based on his substantial assistance. After pleading guilty on May 9, 2008, Hassan notified the court through his attorney that, if he was called by Petit Frere as a witness at her trial, he would invoke his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Petit Frere then filed a pre-trial motion to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the government violated her due process rights by intimidating Hassan into not testifying on her behalf. Petit Frere\u2019s argument was premised on the following email, which had been sent by the prosecutor to Hassan\u2019s attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-10\">It is my understanding that Juliette Pet-it Frere intends to call your client as a witness at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-11\">I wanted to let you and [Petit Frere\u2019s attorney] know that [the] United States intends to ask the Court to instruct Has-san Pacouloute as to his Fifth Amendment rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-12\">You should know that, in additional [sic] to further criminal prosecution, your client could face adverse consequences for providing untruthful testimony at trial. The plea agreement specifically requires his truthful cooperation and any possible 5K or other benefits (e.g. acceptance of responsibility) that he is entitled to under the plea agreement could be lost.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-13\">Petit Frere\u2019s argument was also premised on her belief that Hassan would have testified that Petit Frere was not involved in the conspiracy. For support, she attached a May 27, 2008, report prepared by U.S. Secret Service Agent Michael Moore, which memorialized Hassan\u2019s account of the conspiracy. According to the report, Hassan had worked as a waiter at the Tap Tap Haitian Restaurant with Tejada, a good friend of his, and Petit Frere, his girlfriend of five years. After Hassan quit his job there, he and his brother Daruco accepted a proposal from Pierre to steal credit card numbers using an electronic skimming device. Hassan recruited Teja-da to steal her customers\u2019 credit card information, but Tejada apparently did not use the skimming device correctly. As a result, Hassan decided to use the device himself, which he did at Tap Tap on three to four days in December 2007. Significantly, Hassan stated that he covertly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>skimmed Petit <em>Frere\u2019s </em>customer\u2019s credit cards without her knowledge. At the same time, however, Hassan was also quoted in the report as stating that Petit Frere once told him to \u201ctake it easy with\u201d the skimming device.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">The district court ultimately entered an order denying the motion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">[T]he undersigned finds that the Government\u2019s e-mail in this case \u2014 which was sent to Hassan\u2019s counsel, did not involve direct contact with Hassan himself, and which, by its plain terms, merely apprised counsel that his client \u201ccould\u201d face additional criminal prosecution and other adverse consequences for providing untruthful testimony at trial\u2014 does not rise to the level of \u201csubstantial interference\u201d with Hassan\u2019s free and unhampered choice to testify such that Defendant\u2019s due process rights have been violated. In addition, despite Defendant\u2019s categorization of the e-mail as a \u201cthreat,\u201d given the language used in the communication and the fact that the email was sent to counsel, the Court fails to see the vice in the Government\u2019s conduct, especially because a prosecutor is always entitled to attempt to avert perjury and to punish criminal conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">In addition to confirming the general contours of the conspiracy as set forth in Hassan\u2019s May 27, 2008, statement to Agent Moore, the following testimony was elicited at trial. The government called Gary Sanon Jules, the manager of Tap Tap, who testified that Petit Frere worked from December 12-15, 2007, but neither Tejada nor Hassan were employed at that time. Although Hassan was not an employee, Jules testified that, in December 2007, Hassan came into Tap Tap once or twice a week around closing time and helped Petit Frere \u201cbring the tables in.\u201d Jules never saw Hassan take credit cards or checks from any customers and, if he had seen this, he would have challenged both Has-san and Petit Frere about it, as Hassan was \u201cnot working there\u201d and \u201cha[d] no business\u201d doing that.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">The government called Agent Moore, the lead investigator in the case, who testified that \u201c[tjhere were 15 names on the credit card device and when I tracked back their histories, they were used at Tap Tap and the defendant was the server that processed all the transactions,\u201d which occurred from December 12-15, 2007. Moore also testified that he had met with Hassan on at least four occasions, but the only time that Hassan told him that he personally skimmed the credit cards at Tap Tap was at the May 27, 2008, meeting. Prior to that meeting, Hassan had given statements that were inconsistent with this admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">The government called Benikia Taylor, who testified that she, her boyfriend, and another couple had dinner at Tap Tap during the second week of December 2007. She testified that Petit Frere was their server and, at the end of the meal, Taylor\u2019s boyfriend and the other gentleman split the bill, each putting down a credit card. After Petit Frere personally took the credit cards inside for processing, Taylor testified that they \u201cnoticed [that] it was taking a long time for her to bring back the bill so we could sign it and go. We were wondering what the problem was. So we were kind of concerned about why it was taking so long.\u201d Eventually, Petit Frere returned with the credit cards, but the two men noticed that there was \u201csome sort of issue\u201d with the bill, which they ultimately had to straighten out with Petit Frere. Some time later, Taylor\u2019s boyfriend was informed that several unauthorized charges were being made on his credit card.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">After the court denied the defense\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal, Petit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Frere testified on her own behalf that she did not personally skim any credit cards at Tap Tap and had no knowledge that Has-san, who was her boyfriend of five years, \u2022was doing so. She also testified that Has-san would sometimes come to Tap Tap for her entire shift, which lasted six to seven hours, and help her clean tables and pick up her customers\u2019 checks. Petit Frere did not remember whether Hassan did this from December 12-15, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">After the court denied Petit Frere\u2019s renewed motion for a judgment of acquittal and the parties presented their closing arguments, the court brought Hassan in to testify out of the jury\u2019s presence in connection with the defense\u2019s request for a missing-witness jury instruction. Hassan confirmed that his attorney had previously shown him the government\u2019s e-mail, and he was aware that his attorney thereafter filed a notification invoking Hassan\u2019s right to remain silent. Hassan also testified that he wras willing to testify on behalf of either the government or Petit Frere, but he would not do so without his attorney, who was out of town on his honeymoon. As a result, the court ultimately ruled that Hassan was unavailable as a witness, and he did not testify in front of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The jury thereafter returned a verdict, finding Petit Frere guilty of the conspiracy count but not guilty of the five substantive counts. Petit Frere subsequently filed a motion for a judgment of acquittal or, in the alternative, a motion for a new trial, in which she, <em>inter alia, </em>essentially repeated her motion to dismiss the indictment and argued that the evidence was insufficient to sustain her conviction. The district court denied the motion. The court ultimately sentenced Petite Frere to five months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for new trial for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Sweat, </em>555 F.3d 1364, 1367 (11th Cir.2009). We also review the denial of a motion to dismiss the indictment for abuse of discretion, \u201cbut underlying legal errors, including due process claims, are reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Robison, </em>505 F.3d 1208, 1225 n. 24 (11th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 627, 172 L.Ed.2d 609 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">\u201cThe Supreme Court has recognized that a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to \u2018present [her] own witnesses to establish a defense.\u2019\"<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Terzado-Madruga, </em>897 F.2d 1099, 1108 (11th Cir.1990) (quoting <em>Washington v. Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 19, 87 S.Ct. 1920, 1923, 18 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1967)). \u201cSubstantial interference with a defense witness\u2019s free and unhampered choice to testify violates [the] due process rights of the defendant. When such a violation of due process rights occurs, a court must reverse the conviction without regard to prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Demps v. Wainwright, </em>805 F.2d 1426, 1433 (11th Cir.1986) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">For purposes of this appeal, the seminal illustration of substantial interference with a defense witness\u2019s decision to testify comes from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Webb v. Texas, </em>409 U.S. 95, 93 S.Ct. 351, 34 L.Ed.2d 330 (1972). In that case, the Supreme Court held that the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>due process rights were violated under the following circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-4\">The trial judge gratuitously singled out [a defense] witness for a lengthy admonition on the dangers of perjury. But the judge did not stop at warning the witness of his right to refuse to testify and of the necessity to tell the truth. Instead, the judge implied that he expected [the witness] to lie, and went on to assure him that if he lied, he would be prosecuted and probably convicted for perjury, that the sentence for that conviction would be added on to his present sentence, and that the result would be to impair his chances for parole.... [I]n light of the great disparity between the posture of the presiding judge and that of a witness in these circumstances, the unnecessarily strong terms used by the judge could well have exerted such duress on the witness\u2019 mind as to preclude him from making a free and voluntary choice whether or not to testify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 97-98, 93 S.Ct. at 353 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">In this case, Petit Frere contends that the government\u2019s e-mail to Hassan\u2019s attorney violated her due process rights because, like the trial judge\u2019s comments in <em>Webb, </em>it substantially interfered with Hassan\u2019s decision of whether to testify on her behalf. To reiterate, the e-mail at issue informed Hassan\u2019s attorney that the government would ask the court to instruct Hassan on his Fifth Amendment rights if he took the stand and that, if Hassan testified untruthfully, he could face further prosecution and lose certain sentencing benefits to which he was entitled under the plea agreement. As a result, Hassan conferred with his attorney and notified the court that he was invoking his right to remain silent. <em>See United States v. Cuthel, </em>903 F.2d 1381, 1384 (11th Cir.1990) (\u201cWhile there is arguably a conflict between a witness\u2019s fifth amendment privilege and a defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to compulsory process, such conflict long ago was resolved in favor of the witness\u2019s right to silence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">However, we conclude that the government\u2019s e-mail did not violate Petit Frere\u2019s due process rights for several reasons. First, it is well-established under our case law that the government was permitted to inform Hassan\u2019s attorney that his client could be prosecuted if he testified untruthfully. <em>See United States v. Nunn, </em>525 F.2d 958, 960 <em>&amp; </em>n. 3 (5th Cir.1976) (holding that there was no due process violation under <em>Webb </em>where the trial judge \u201cread and explained in detail the perjury laws, after which the witness changed his testimony\u201d); <em>United States v. Gloria, </em>494 F.2d 477, 484 (5th Cir.1974) (same, where the witness \u201cwas merely advised of the possibility of prosecution if his testimony materially differed from his prior plea, not that he would be prosecuted if he testified\u201d); <em>Griffin v. Weinberger, </em>492 F.2d 969, 970 (5th Cir.1974) (same, in the social security context, where \u201cthe [administrative law judge\u2019s] admonition did no more than lay out accurately the consequences of testifying falsely\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">In this respect, the government no more violated Petit Frere\u2019s due process rights by accurately reminding Hassan\u2019s attorney that his client was bound under the plea agreement to provide truthful information and that, if he testified falsely, he could lose certain sentencing benefits to which he was entitled under the plea agreement. Nor did the plea agreement itself substantially interfere with Hassan\u2019s decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>whether to testify. <em>See Terzado-Madruga, </em>897 F.2d at 1108-09 (holding that there was no due process violation where the plea agreement required the defense witness to provide truthful testimony); <em>cf. United States v. Henricksen, </em>564 F.2d 197, 198 (5th Cir.1977) (holding that the defendant\u2019s due process rights were violated because the plea agreement prohibited a defense witness from testifying \u201cin any manner\u201d regarding the defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Significantly, the government\u2019s e-mail was also not impermissibly threatening or coercive. Unlike the judge\u2019s comments in <em>Webb, </em>the e-mail did not contain a \u201clengthy admonition of the dangers of perjury,\u201d did not \u201cassure [Hassan] that if he lied, he would be prosecuted and probably convicted for perjury,\u201d and did not use \u201cunnecessarily strong terms\u201d to convey its message. <em>See Webb, </em>409 U.S. at 97-98, 93 S.Ct. at 353. Instead, as discussed above, the email did no more than briefly and mildly remind Hassan\u2019s attorney of what could happen if his client testified untruthfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The non-threatening nature of the e-mail is further illustrated by contrasting it to the conduct that this Court <em>has </em>found to violate a defendant\u2019s right to due process. <em>See United States v. Heller, </em>830 F.2d 150, 152 (11th Cir.1987) (holding that the defendant\u2019s due process rights were violated where IRS agents admittedly coerced the defendant\u2019s accountant to provide false testimony by informing him that, unless he testified, he would become a defendant himself); <em>Hammond, </em>598 F.2d at 1012-13 (same, where an FBI agent, during a court recess, told the defense witness that if he continued with his testimony, he would have \u201cnothing but trouble\u201d at his own, separate trial).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Petit Frere\u2019s contention that the e-mail constituted a threat is also undermined by the fact that it was sent to Hassan\u2019s attorney, not Hassan himself. <em>See United States v. Stuart, </em>507 F.3d 391, 399 (6th Cir.2007) (\u201c[C]ounsel even admitted that the prosecution never directly threatened these witnesses, stating that she herself relayed that the government would prosecute them for perjury.\u201d) (quotation and alteration omitted); <em>United States v. Viera, </em>839 F.2d 1113, 1115 (5th Cir.1988) <em>(en </em>banc) (\u201c[T]he prosecutor cannot be charged with harassment, particularly when the statement was made to defense counsel rather than to a prospective lay witness.... \u201d). Thus, despite the fact that the government\u2019s e-mail led to Hassan\u2019s decision not to testify, that decision was ultimately his own, made freely after consulting with his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">Finally, the record supports the government\u2019s position that, based on Hassan\u2019s inconsistent pre-trial statements, it had reason to believe that he would in fact testify untruthfully. <em>See Viera, </em>839 F.2d at 1115 (\u201cA prosecutor is always entitled to attempt to avert perjury....\u201d). First, in Agent Moore\u2019s May 27, 2008, report, which Petit Frere attached to her motion to dismiss, Hassan stated both that Petit Frere had no knowledge that he was skimming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>credit cards <em>and </em>that she once told him to \u201ctake it easy\u201d with the skimming device. Second, Agent Moore testified at trial that, before Hassan\u2019s statement on May 27, 2008, he had repeatedly denied skimming any credit cards at all. Finally, in his objections to the PSI, Hassan stated that Petit Frere \u201cmay have been aware\u201d that he was skimming credit cards. Based on these materially inconsistent statements, the government had a reasonable basis to question whether Hassan would testify truthfully, thus further undermining Petit Frere\u2019s argument. <em>See United States v. Whittington, </em>783 F.2d 1210, 1219 (5th Cir.1986) (\u201cThe government simply told [the defense witness] that it believed he had already given false statements to government agents and that, if he repeated those statements under oath at trial, they would support an indictment for perjury. We do not feel that this was governmental interference in violation of the defendants\u2019 due process rights.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">In sum, we conclude that the government\u2019s e-mail did not substantially interfere with Hassan\u2019s decision whether to testify and, therefore, did not violate Petit Frere\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">We review the denial of a defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal <em>de novo, </em>\u201cviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 744 (11th Cir.2008). In conducting this review, \u201c[w]e must determine whether a reasonable jury could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Mercer, </em>541 F.3d 1070, 1074 (11th Cir.2008). Thus, \u201cour sufficiency review requires only that a guilty verdict be reasonable, not inevitable, based on the evidence presented,\u201d as \u201cthe jury is free to choose between or among the reasonable conclusions to be drawn from the evidence presented at trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Woodard, </em>531 F.3d 1352, 1360 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">Petit Frere disputes a critical aspect of the above standard of review, arguing that, because the jury returned an inconsistent verdict \u2014 and it is unclear which party benefitted from that verdict-\u2014 we should conduct a \u201cneutral\u201d review of the facts instead of viewing them in the light most favorable to the government.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Petit Frere relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Powell, </em>which does support the proposition that it is unclear which party benefits when a jury renders an inconsistent verdict. <em>See </em>469 U.S. 57, 65, 105 S.Ct. 471, 477, 83 L.Ed.2d 461 (1984) (\u201cInconsistent verdicts therefore present a situation where \u2018error,\u2019 in the sense that the jury has not followed the court\u2019s instructions, most certainly has occurred, but it is unclear whose ox has been gored.\u201d). However, the consequence of this proposition is simply that Petit Frere receives \u201cthe benefit of her acquittal on the counts on which she was acquitted\u201d and \u201caceept[s] the burden of conviction on the count[ ] on which the jury convicted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69, 105 S.Ct. at 479. Indeed, the Court in <em>Pawell </em>rejected the suggestion that an inconsistent jury verdict affects our sufficiency review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-11\">Finally, we note that a criminal defendant already is afforded protection against jury irrationality or error by the independent review of the sufficiency of the evidence undertaken by the trial and appellate courts. This review should not be confused with the problems caused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>by inconsistent verdicts. Sufficiency-of-the evidence review involves assessment by the courts of whether the evidence adduced at trial could support any rational determination of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. This review should be independent of the jury\u2019s determination that evidence on another count was insufficient. The Government must convince the jury with its proof, and must also satisfy the courts that given this proof the jury could rationally have reached a verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. We do not believe that further safeguards against jury irrationality are necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 67, 105 S.Ct. at 478 (citations omitted). Thus, we have cited <em>Powell </em>for the proposition that \u201csufficiency-of-the-evidence review is separate from, and should not be confused with, problems caused by inconsistent verdicts.\u201d <em>United States v. Church, </em>955 F.2d 688, 695 (11th Cir.1992). Moreover, <em>Powell </em>makes clear that \u201cfurther safeguards\u201d against jury irrationality or error \u2014 such as, for example, Petit Frere\u2019s proposed \u201cneutral\u201d evaluation of the facts \u2014 are \u201cunnecessary.\u201d 469 U.S. at 67, 105 S.Ct. at 478. Finally, we have previously applied the traditional sufficiency-of-the-evidence standard of review in cases where the defendant asserted that there was an inconsistent jury verdict. <em>United States v. Veal, </em>153 F.3d 1233, 1252-53 (11th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Lozano-Hernandez, </em>89 F.3d 785, 789 (11th Cir.1996). Thus, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the jury returned an inconsistent verdict in this case, we conduct our traditional sufficiency review and view the facts in the light most favorable to the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Nonetheless, Petit Frere contends that, even applying such a standard, the evidence was insufficient to support her conspiracy conviction. To obtain a conviction for conspiracy, \u201cthe government must have proven beyond a reasonable doubt, even if only by circumstantial evidence, that a conspiracy existed and that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily joined the conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Miranda, </em>425 F.3d 953, 959 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cAlthough mere presence at the scene of a crime is insufficient to support a conspiracy conviction, presence nonetheless is a probative factor which the jury may consider in determining whether a defendant was a knowing and intentional participant in a criminal scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Indeed, a \u201cconspiracy conviction will be upheld when the circumstances surrounding a person\u2019s presence at the scene of conspiratorial activity are so obvious that knowledge of its character can fairly be attributed to [her].\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>447 F.3d 1327, 1338 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Petit Frere concedes that there was a conspiracy to steal credit card information from Tap Tap customers, but she contends that there was no evidence establishing her awareness of, or participation in, that conspiracy. However, the government did introduce strong circumstantial evidence which, when viewed in the light most favorable to the government, could have allowed a reasonable jury to find that Petit Frere knowingly participated in the conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>405 F.3d 1260, 1269 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that the government may use circumstantial evidence to prove that the defendant joined a conspiracy); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>390 F.3d 1319, 1325 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201cThis Court has previously held that circumstantial evidence may prove knowledge and intent.\u201d). Most importantly, the government established that 15 credit card numbers stored in the electronic skimming device belonged to customers who Petit Frere served on four consecutive days in December 2007. In addition, Benikia Taylor, the girlfriend of one of the victims, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>testified that Petit Frere served her, her boyfriend, and another couple, personally picked up two credit cards from their table at the end of the meal, and took an unusually long time to process the cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Relying exclusively on her own testimony, Petit Frere\u2019s defense at trial was that Hassan was skimming the credit cards without her knowledge. \u201cHowever, the jury, hearing her words and seeing her demeanor, was entitled to disbelieve the Defendant\u2019s testimony and, in fact, to believe the opposite of what she said.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>390 F.3d at 1326 (stating that this rule \u201capplies with special force\u201d where the defendant\u2019s intent or knowledge is at issue). Furthermore, the jury could have also disbelieved Petit Frere\u2019s testimony because, even if Hassan was the one skimming her customers\u2019 credit cards, it was unlikely that Petit Frere would have been unaware of this fact, especially in light of the number of credit cards involved. While Petit Frere testified that Hassan would come to Tap Tap for entire shifts at a time and help her pick up customers\u2019 checks, Taylor\u2019s testimony established that Petit Frere personally picked up at least two of the credit cards herself. Moreover, Jules, the manager at Tap Tap, testified that Hassan only came in once or twice a week at closing time \u2014 as opposed to several consecutive days for Petit Frere\u2019s entire shift \u2014 and never saw Hassan handle customers\u2019 checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The only other evidence introduced at trial supporting Petit Frere\u2019s defense was Hassan\u2019s May 27, 2008, statement to Agent Moore, in which he admitted skimming the credit cards without Petit Frere\u2019s knowledge. However, Agent Moore testified that this statement \u2014 which, notably, was made after Hassan had already pled guilty \u2014 was inconsistent with Hassan\u2019s previous statements, where he denied skimming the credit cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">In sum, the circumstantial evidence in this case was sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that Petit Frere participated in the conspiracy either by personally skimming her customers\u2019 credit cards or by providing Hassan access to those cards. Thus, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Accordingly, we affirm Petit Frere\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b263-7\">.
