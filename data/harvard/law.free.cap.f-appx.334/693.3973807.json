For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-14\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b722-15\">On December 28, 2001, Turner fell from a ladder while working as a tugboat welder and suffered a laceration to his forehead and a broken nose. Weeks later, he stopped working because of difficulty breathing, a burning sensation in his nose, and headaches. An ear, nose and throat specialist and a neurologist treated Turner for the nose injury and headaches, respectively. As of May 3, 2002, they determined that Turner had reached maximum medical improvement, released him from their care and approved his return to work. However, Turner did not resume his employment as a welder because of alleged back pain that he first complained about nearly three months after the fall. National Maintenance and Repair, Turner\u2019s employer, paid Turner temporary total disability benefits from January 22, 2002, through May 3, 2002, and covered some of his medical expenses, but it refused to authorize treatment for Turner\u2019s alleged back injury. On April 4, 2002, without authorization, Turner began to receive treatment for back pain from another doctor, who his attorney had recommended.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-16\">Turner then filed a claim for compensation under the LHWCA. The ALJ found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>the employer liable for all necessary treatment for Turner\u2019s broken nose and headaches; however, the ALJ denied benefits for Turner\u2019s claim of a related back injury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ALJ found Turner\u2019s testimony \u201criddled with contradictions, inconsistencies, inexplicable denials, and falsehoods,\u201d particularly in light of the three-month lapse between the fall and his report of back pain,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> his admissions of lies to receive related disability benefits from the Social Security Administration and Veterans Administration, surveillance video of Turner lifting heavy baskets of shrimp while working at a seafood market after the fall, and psychological testing that diagnosed him as a malingerer. The ALJ also gave no credit to the opinions of Turner\u2019s medical experts because they were either similarly unconvincing or based on Turner\u2019s false reporting of symptoms and physical limitations. Accordingly, the ALJ found no credible evidence to support Turner\u2019s claim that he suffered a back injury stemming from his fall. Therefore, the ALJ denied benefits for this claim. The BRB affirmed, declining to question the ALJ\u2019s factual findings or credibility determinations. Turner appeals to this court. We have jurisdiction to review an order of the BRB pursuant to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">The LHWCA requires the BRB to accept the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact as conclusive when \u201csupported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b)(3). \u201cThe BRB may not substitute its judgment for that of the ALJ or engage in a <em>de novo </em>review of the evidence.\u201d <em>Gulf Best Elec., Inc. v. Methe, </em>396 F.3d 601, 603 (5th Cir.2004). In turn, \u201c[t]his court ... reviews decisions by the BRB to determine whether it has adhered to its proper scope of review....\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we must affirm so long as the ALJ followed the correct legal standard and supported its factual findings with substantial evidence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">Turner challenges the ALJ\u2019s decision, asserting that he presented sufficient evidence- \u2014 by simply alleging that he suffered a back injury \u2014 to trigger the LHWCA \u00a7 20(a) presumption of a compensable work-related injuiy. Section 20(a) provides that \u201cit shall be presumed, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary ... [t]hat the claim comes within the provisions of this chapter.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 920(a). To invoke the presumption, a claimant must prove that (1) he suffered an injury and (2) an accident or conditions at work could have caused the injury. <em>Conoco, Inc. v. Dir., Office of Worker\u2019s Comp. Programs, </em>194 F.3d 684, 687 (5th Cir.1999). Proof of both required elements triggers the presumption of a work-related injury compensable under the LHWCA. <em>Amerada Hess Corp. v. Dir., Office of Worker\u2019s Comp. Programs, </em>543 F.3d 755, 761 (5th Cir.2008). If the employer, in turn, presents sufficient evidence that the injury was not work related, the presumption drops out of the case and leaves the ALJ to determine causation based on weighing all of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>Essentially, \u00a7 20(a) provides a presumption of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>causal connection between the claimant\u2019s injury and his or her employment, not a presumption of a compensable injury itself. To invoke the presumption, Turner bore the burden to prove \u2014 not merely allege\u2014 that he suffered a back injury and that the back injury could have resulted from his fall at work. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Here, the ALJ found that Turner failed to establish that he suffered a back injury stemming from the fall, based largely on discrediting the testimony of Turner and his medical experts. As the fact finder, the ALJ is entitled to make credibility determinations and accept or reject any part of an expert\u2019s testimony. <em>Mendoza v. Marine Pers. Co., </em>46 F.3d 498, 500-01 (5th Cir.1995). The ALJ determined that Turner\u2019s testimony and the opinions of Turner\u2019s medical experts were not credible. Without credible evidence to support Turner\u2019s allegation of a back injury, the ALJ properly exercised his discretion to conclude that Turner failed to prove the predicate injury necessary to invoke the \u00a7 20(a) presumption. Accordingly, the ALJ found it unnecessary to determine the sufficiency of the employer\u2019s contrary evidence to rebut Turner\u2019s claim of a work-related injury. In sum, the ALJ followed the correct legal standard in refusing to apply the \u00a7 20(a) presumption given that Turner did not provide sufficient evidence to prove \u2014 not merely allege \u2014 that he suffered a back injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Even assuming that the ALJ should have applied the presumption of causation in this case, the employer presented substantial evidence to rebut the presumption and support the ALJ\u2019s determination based on a weighing of all of the evidence. \u201c\u2018Substantial evid\u00e9nce is that relevant evidence \u2014 more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance \u2014 that would cause a reasonable person to accept the fact finding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coastal Prod. Servs. Inc. v. Hudson, </em>555 F.3d 426, 430 (5th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Dir., Office of Worker\u2019s Comp. Programs v. Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc., </em>125 F.3d 303, 305 (5th Cir.1997)). Here, the ALJ addressed all of the relevant testimony and medical evidence in an exhaustively detailed seventy-five page Decision and Order and provided cogent reasoning for his determination that Turner did not prove he suffered a back injury. A reasonable person could accept the ALJ\u2019s fact finding based on the surveillance video alone, which showed Turner\u2019s ability to perform heavy lifting while working at a seafood market after his fall. Additionally, Turner\u2019s admissions of lies and his diagnosis as a malingerer presents far more than a scintilla of evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Turner did not suffer a back injury from his fall at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">We find no basis for holding that the ALJ failed to follow the correct legal standard or erred in his factual findings. Substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Turner did not suffer a back injury, even if the \u00a7 20(a) presumption applied. However, because Turner failed to prove that he suffered a back injury, he was not entitled to a presumption of causation between the injury and conditions at work. In essence, Turner simply takes issue with the ALJ\u2019s factual findings and credibility determinations, which we decline to disturb given the record in this case. Therefore, we affirm the BRB\u2019s decision denying Turner benefits under the LHWCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b722-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b723-7\">. The ALJ also denied benefits for an alleged aggravation of Turner's pre-existing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, which the BRB affirmed as unchallenged on appeal. Turner similarly does not raise this issue to this court, appealing only the denial of benefits for his back injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b723-11\">. Turner explains the three-month delay by stating that he began experiencing the back pain only after he stopped taking prescribed pain medication in preparation for a functional capacity evaluation. The ALJ heard this testimony and implicitly discounted it as part of his credibility determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
