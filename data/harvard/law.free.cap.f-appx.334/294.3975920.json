The defendants argue that the district court erred by: (1) not liberally construing two of them motions to constitute a general denial of the complaint; (2) granting the government\u2019s motion for default judgment; (3) ignoring their challenges to the assessment; and (4) not alerting them to the consequences of failing to file a proper answer. The defendants contend that the government\u2019s application for default was invalid because it did not comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(a). The defendants further contend that the government was required to submit a Form 4340 Certificate of Assessment; that the government did not establish that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction; and that the district court needed to conduct a hearing prior to granting the government\u2019s motion for default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s grant of default judgment for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Sanderford v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, </em>902 F.2d 897, 898 (11th Cir.1990). The abuse of discretion standard recognizes that \u201cthere is a range of choice for the district court and so long as its decision does not amount to a clear error of judgment\u201d we will not disturb the decision, even if we would have chosen differently. <em>McMahan v. Toto, </em>256 F.3d 1120, 1128 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-14\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55 provides that the clerk shall enter a party\u2019s default if the party fails to plead or otherwise defend an action brought against it, and this \u201cfailure is shown by affidavit or otherwise.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(a). When a court enters a default judgment against the defendant, upon request by the plaintiff, the clerk shall enter judgment for the amount sought by the plaintiff if the amount is \u201cfor a sum certain or for a sum which can by computation be made certain.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(a) and (b)(1). In all other cases, the party entitled to default judgment must apply to the court. Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-15\">Rule 55(b)(2), which covers \u201call other cases,\u201d requires the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine damages. Fed.R.CivJP. 55(b)(2); <em>see also SEC v. Smyth, </em>420 F.3d 1225, 1231 (11th Cir.2005). However, an \u201cevidentiary hearing is not a <em>per se </em>requirement,\u201d and is not needed when \u201call essential evidence is already of record.\u201d <em>Smyth, id. </em>at 1232 n. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-16\">A defaulted defendant is deemed to \u201cad-mitt] the plaintiffs well-pleaded allegations of fact.\u201d <em>Nishimatsu Constr. Co., Ltd. v. Houston Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>515 F.2d 1200, 1206 (5th Cir.1975).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant, however, \u201cis not held to admit facts that are not well-pleaded or to admit conclusions of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(a) provides, in relevant part, that a defendant shall serve its answer \u201cwithin 20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>days after being served with the summons and complaint.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(c) allows a court to set aside entry of default \u201cfor good cause.\u201d Thus, a district court may set aside an entry of default only if the defaulting party can provide a good reason for the district court to do so. <em>See In re Knight, </em>833 F.2d 1515, 1516 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\u201cPro <em>se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1110 (11th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). However, even pro <em>se </em>pleadings must follow time requirements. <em>See Garvey v. Vaughn, </em>993 F.2d 776, 780 (11th Cir.1993). A court is not permitted to serve as <em>\u201cde facto </em>counsel\u201d or to rewrite otherwise deficient pleadings to sustain an action. <em>GJR Inv., Inc. v. County of Escambia, Fla., </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998). Issues that a party does not raise below are \u201cdeemed waived.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) (dictum).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The record here demonstrates that the defendants do not even discuss good cause or their reasons for failing to answer. Instead, they make arguments on appeal similar to those that the district court deemed frivolous. Upon service of the summons and complaint, the defendants were on notice that default would be entered against them if they failed to answer the complaint. The defendants did not answer the complaint as directed by the district court, and thus there was no error in entering the default. The district court had the \u201cessential evidence\u201d necessary to determine whether to grant default judgment as requested on the government\u2019s motion, so a hearing was not required. The defendants did not show good cause to relieve them from the ordinary consequences of their default.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">Thus, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by granting default judgment to the government. The district court\u2019s rulings were all based on a permissible view of the record, and the defendants\u2019 rights were duly respected. Accordingly, we affirm the grant of default judgment in favor of the government.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-10\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all of the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b324-7\">. The defendants failed to raise the argument before the district court that the government was required to submit a Form 4340 Certificate of Assessment. Therefore, they have waived this argument and are unable to raise it before this court. <em>See Tannenbaum, </em>148 F.3d at 1263.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
