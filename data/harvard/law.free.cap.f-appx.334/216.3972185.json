Hurtado, </em>508 F.3d 603 (11th Cir.2007), <em>abrogated by Flores-Figueroa v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1886, 173 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009). Ehrlich contends that the stipulated facts at his bench trial did not establish that he acted with the requisite knowledge and asks that his conviction for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) be vacated in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Flores-Figueroa v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1886, 173 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-16\">We review questions of statutory interpretation <em>de novo. Hurtado, </em>508 F.3d at 607 n. 5. \u201c[T]o support a conviction under \u00a7 1028A(a)(l), the government must prove that the defendant: (1) knowingly transferred, possessed, or used; (2) the means of identification of another person; (3) without lawful authority; (4) during and in relation to a felony enumerated in \u00a7 1028A(c).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606-07. Previously, we had held that the government did not need to prove that the defendant \u201cknew that the means of identification that he possessed and used belonged to another actual person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 610. The Supreme Court, however, recently has held that \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) requires the government \u201cto show that the defendant knew that the means of identification at issue belonged to another person.\u201d <em>Flores-Figueroa, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1894. We may \u201cdepart from a prior panel decision based upon an intervening Supreme Court decision only if that decision actually overruled or conflicted with it.\u201d <em>United States v. Marte, </em>356 F.3d 1336, 1344 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). We remand for further proceedings where the district court did not make findings of fact on an issue. <em>See United States v. Barner, </em>441 F.3d 1310, 1322 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-18\">Because the Supreme Court has now held that the government must show the defendant knew the identification he used belonged to another person to sustain a conviction under \u00a7 1028A(a)(l), we vacate Ehrlich\u2019s conviction on that count and remand this case to the district court for it to determine in the first instance if Ehrlich knew that the identification he used belonged to another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-19\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
