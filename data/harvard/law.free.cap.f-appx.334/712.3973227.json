Heard appeals the sentence imposed following the district court\u2019s granting of his motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Heard challenges the district court\u2019s determination that it lacked authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce the sentence below the amended guidelines range and argues that, if the district court had such authority, it erred in determining that it could not consider Heard\u2019s assistance to the Government as a factor under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), absent a motion by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-23\">Heard argues that the holding in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), applies to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, that \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u2019s requirement that the reduction be consistent with applicable Guideline policy statements is not a jurisdictional impediment to a sentence below the amended guidelines range, and that the Sentencing Commission, which has the power to specify the circumstances and amounts of sentence reductions, cannot ignore the Supreme Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Booker </em>or in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), regarding the weight courts should give the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when they impose sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-24\">Heard\u2019s arguments are foreclosed in light of our recent decision in <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 236-39 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Sept. 21, 2009) (No. 09-6657). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b740-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
