She now appeals her conviction for aggravated identity theft on the ground that the evidence adduced at her bench trial was insufficient to support the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">The parties submitted the case to the district court on stipulated facts and Ross\u2019s signed confession. The joint trial stipulation provided that Ross had \u201cused a social security number belonging to M.D. to apply for the credit card\u201d and that over the next two weeks she had charged over $19,000 on the card. Her confession stated that she had \u201cuse[d] my name and someone el[s]es social security number to obtain a credit card which I used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The defense moved for a judgment of acquittal on the aggravated identity theft count, arguing that Ross had not known she was using a real person\u2019s social security number when she applied for the credit card. The government responded, first, that under existing Eleventh Circuit precedent, aggravated identity theft did not require knowledge of a real person\u2019s identity, <em>United States v. Hurtado, </em>508 F.3d 603, 610 (11th Cir.2007), and, second, that the evidence before the court was nevertheless sufficient to support a finding that Ross had known she was using someone else\u2019s real identity. Without specifically addressing the government\u2019s arguments, the district court found Ross guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">On appeal, Ross cites <em>Flores-Figueroa v. United States</em>, \u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1886, 1894, 173 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009), in which the Supreme Court, after Ross had been sentenced, overruled <em>Hurtado </em>and held that \u201c\u00a7 1028A(a)(l) requires the Government to show that the defendant knew that the means of identification at issue belonged to another person.\u201d She argues that the government failed to meet its burden under <em>Flores-Figueroa </em>and that the district court did not make findings sufficient to justify a guilty verdict on the aggravated identity theft charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">We review the sufficiency of evidence supporting a conviction <em>de novo. United States v. Taylor, </em>480 F.3d 1025, 1026 (11th Cir.2007). For bench trials involving stipulated facts, the test is \u201cwhether the judge could accept the stipulated facts, considered in the light most favorable to the government, as adequate and sufficient to support the conclusion that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>427 F.2d 38, 41-42 (5th Cir.1970).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">At the time Ross was convicted and sentenced, the district court was bound by our holding in <em>Hurtada </em>that \u201c\u00a7 1028A(a)(l) did not require the government to prove that [Ross] knew that the means of identification that [s]he possessed and used belonged to another actual person.\u201d 508 F.3d at 610. Although the <em>Hurtado </em>standard was later displaced by the stricter requirements of <em>Flores-Figueroa, </em>we conclude that the evidence before the district court was sufficient to support a guilty verdict under either standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">The joint stipulation submitted to the district court provided that Ross had \u201cused a social security number belonging to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>M.D.,\u201d and her confession stated that she had \u201cuse[d] my name and someone el[s]es social security number.\u201d This uncontested evidence,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> viewed in the light most favorable to the government, supports the conclusion that Ross knew she was using another person\u2019s identity when she applied for the credit card. Ross\u2019s conviction is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"A3i\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-17\">. \"Whoever, during and in relation to any felony violation enumerated in subsection (c), <em>knowingly </em>transfers, possesses, or uses, without lawful authority, a means of identification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>of another person shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such felony, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 years.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b346-14\">.
