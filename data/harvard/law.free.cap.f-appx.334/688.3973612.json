The district court dismissed Adams\u2019s lawsuit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), (g) for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. Adams has appealed the district court\u2019s decision, arguing that he should be transferred because his life is at risk, and he moves to expedite the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Adams does not have any constitutional interest in educational or rehabilitation programs provided by the prison pursuant to the ICC. <em>See Esparza v. Deputy, </em>No. 93-8665,1994 WL 122158 (5th Cir. Mar.25, 1994). Furthermore, Adams does not have a protectable property or liberty interest in where he is housed. <em>See Montanye v. Haymes, </em>427 U.S. 236, 242, 96 S.Ct. 2543, 49 L.Ed.2d 466 (1976); <em>Wilson v. Budney, </em>976 F.2d 957, 958 (5th Cir.1992). Finally, Adams has failed to allege facts which warrant judicial intervention with respect to the prison\u2019s decisions regarding Adams\u2019s housing assignment. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 833, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994); <em>Horton v. Cockrell, </em>70 F.3d 397, 400-02 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Adams\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim counts as a strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Adams is cautioned that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed <em>informa pau-peris </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">AFFIRMED; MOTION TO EXPEDITE APPEAL DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b716-17\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
