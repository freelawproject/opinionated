After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-14\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b970-15\">In April 2007, Drug Enforcement Agency (\u201cDEA\u201d) agents received information from a confidential source that members of a cocaine distribution organization that brought drugs from Mexico were looking for new distributors in the Atlanta area. An undercover agent, posing as a cocaine dealer looking for a new supplier, met with members of the cocaine distribution organization and arranged for a shipment of cocaine to be delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-16\">After conducting surveillance of the cocaine shipment\u2019s delivery to Atlanta, agents stopped the vehicles of members of the cocaine distribution organization. Inside one of the vehicles, agents found three suitcases containing 60 kilograms of cocaine. DEA agents debriefed one of the members and learned that the cocaine had been transported from Texas by Defendant Bodenhamer, who had not yet been arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-17\">When agents approached Bodenhamer in Texas, he agreed to cooperate. Boden-hamer admitted that he had transported the cocaine to Atlanta and that, since January 2007, he had been paid $600 per kilogram of cocaine he transported. Bo-denhamer also turned over to agents a ledger for 2007 that showed seven prior cocaine pickups or deliveries involving a total of 235 kilograms of cocaine. Boden-hamer indicated that he currently was storing 71 kilograms of cocaine, 50 kilograms of which he was to deliver to Atlanta, with the remainder to be delivered to Grand Rapids, Michigan. After Boden-hamer told agents where they could find the cocaine in his backyard, agents seized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>the 71 kilograms of cocaine and $65,000 in cash. Later, while under law enforcement supervision, Bodenhamer made controlled deliveries of the cocaine found in his backyard to Atlanta and Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">A. Drug Quantity Calculation</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">Bodenhamer argues that the district court erred in calculating the drug quantity attributed to him for sentencing purposes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">A district court must take into account all \u201crelevant conduct\u201d when determining the drugs attributable to the defendant for sentencing purposes. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l). Thus, \u201cthe defendant is accountable for all quantities of contraband with which he was directly involved and, in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity, all reasonably foreseeable quantities of contraband that were within the scope of the criminal activity that he jointly undertook.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 cmt. n. 2. Where \u201cthe amount [of drugs] seized does not reflect the scale of the offense,\u201d the sentencing court shall estimate the drug quantity by considering, <em>inter alia, </em>financial or other records. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 12. \u201cWhen a defendant objects to a factual finding that is used in calculating his guideline sentence, such as drug amount, the government bears the burden of establishing the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1296.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">Bodenhamer\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) attributed 366 kilograms of cocaine to Bodenhamer and included the 235 kilograms of cocaine deliveries/pickups listed in Bodenhamer\u2019s ledger. Specifically, the relevant conduct section of the PSI included a chart that detailed the ledger entries by date, drug amount, location and amount of money paid, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-11\">Date_Drug/Amount_Location_Amount Paid</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-12\">January 11,2007 20 kilograms Houston, Texas $12,000 _of cocaine_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-14\">January 18,2007 40 kilograms Grand Rapids, Michigan $24,000 _of cocaine_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-16\">February 5,2007 20 kilograms Houston, Texas $ 9,000 _of cocaine_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-18\">February 15, 2007 30 kilograms Grand Rapids, Michigan $24,000 _of cocaine_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-20\">March 8,2007 40 kilograms Grand Rapids, Michigan unknown amount _of cocaine_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-22\">March 16,2007 41 kilograms transported 20 to unknown amount of cocaine Tampa, Florida, and 21 _to Ocala, Florida__</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-25\">April 4,2007 44 kilograms Grand Rapids, Michigan unknown amount of cocaine, and picked up _\u25a0 $750,000 cash_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-28\">Totals_235$69,000</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b971-29\">The PSI recommended holding Bodenhamer accountable for the 235 kilograms set forth in the chart, as well as the 131 kilograms of cocaine seized during the un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>dercover investigation, for a total of 366 kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">At sentencing, Bodenhamer objected to the inclusion of the 235 kilograms of cocaine from the ledger. Bodenhamer argued that these amounts reflected in the ledger should not be counted because the ledger was not supported by any other corroborating evidence and thus was insufficient to carry the government\u2019s burden of proof. The district court overruled Boden-hamer\u2019s objection, stating \u201cunder the rules it counts, so I\u2019m going to count it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">We conclude that the district court\u2019s drug quantity determination was not clearly erroneous. Bodenhamer admitted to agents that he had been delivering cocaine for the drug distribution ring since January 2007 and was paid $600 per kilogram he delivered. Bodenhamer then turned over his ledger, which showed seven prior drug deliveries. Bodenhamer also completed his last two deliveries under law enforcement supervision, one of which was to the Grand Rapids area of Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">Although the ledger was not introduced into- the record, the chart within the PSI provided the ledger\u2019s actual entries. Notably, Bodenhamer did not dispute that the contents of the chart came from his ledger or claim that the chart was inaccurate. <em>See United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 832 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cA sentencing court\u2019s findings of fact may be based on undisputed statements in the PSI.\u201d). According to the chart, the first cocaine delivery in the ledger occurred on January 11, 2007. Some of the ledger entries reflect a pay equal to $600 per kilogram, and four of the deliveries were to Grand Rapids, Michigan, where the final controlled delivery occurred. These undisputed facts are sufficient to support the district court\u2019s finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Bodenhamer was involved with the seven cocaine deliveries listed in the ledger and that these deliveries were relevant conduct to the instant offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">Contrary to Bodenhamer\u2019s claims, his case is not analogous to <em>United States v. Lawrence, </em>47 F.3d 1559 (11th Cir.1995). In Lawrence, the PSI\u2019s undisputed factual statements about drug quantity related only to the number of transactions that occurred in four hours of surveillance tape and the average weight of the drugs sold on that day. <em>Id. </em>at 1562-64. The sentencing court used these figures to extrapolate the defendants\u2019 drug quantities over the life of the conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>at 1565. The PSI also failed to reveal the source for much of the information it contained. <em>Id. </em>at 1567-68. The Lawrence Court concluded that the PSI \u201cdid not provide the necessary evidentiary foundation,\u201d particularly with regard to each defendant\u2019s individual involvement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">Here, unlike in <em>Lawrence, </em>the PSI contained undisputed facts about each individual drug shipment attributed to Boden-hamer. The source of this information\u2014 the ledger provided by Bodenhamer himself \u2014 was clearly identified and not in dispute. The undisputed facts in the PSI were sufficient to support the sentencing court\u2019s drug quantity finding by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-10\">Additionally, there is no merit to Boden-hamer\u2019s argument that the district court failed to make a factual finding as to whether the ledger reflected relevant conduct. The district court explicitly stated that the Sentencing Guidelines required the drug shipments in the ledger to be counted and indicated that it would count them.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-11\">B. Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b972-12\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion using a two-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>step process. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189-90 (11th Cir.2008). First, we look at whether the district court committed any significant procedural error, such as miscalculating the advisory guidelines range, treating the guidelines as mandatory or failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>Then, we look at whether the sentence is substantively reasonable under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>The party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although we do not apply a presumption of reasonableness to a sentence imposed within the correctly calculated advisory guidelines range, we ordinarily expect such a sentence will be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">The only procedural irregularity Boden-hamer identifies is the calculation of the drug quantity attributed to him. As already discussed, the district court did not err in determining the drug quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-1\">Furthermore, Bodenhamer\u2019s 120-month sentence, which was below the advisory guidelines range of 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment, is not substantively unreasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Bodenhamer argues that the district court failed to adequately consider his cooperation with the government, his first-time offender status and the fact that his co-defendants, who were equally or more culpable, received lower sentences. The record does not bear this out. Among other things, the district court specifically noted that Bodenhamer had cooperated with the government and was a first-time offender. Indeed, the district court granted Bodenhamer safety-valve relief and a downward variance based on that cooperation. The district court also acknowledged that one of Bodenhamer\u2019s codefendants had received a lighter sentence, and explained that this was because the co-defendant\u2019s cooperation was even more valuable than Bodenhamer\u2019s cooperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-10\">Although Bodenhamer asserts that all of his co-defendants received lower sentences, Bodenhamer has not provided the kind of information needed to show that any disparity in their sentences is unwarranted. For example, Bodenhamer does not dispute the government\u2019s claim that two co-defendants, Cesar and Jesus Cha-con, were sentenced based on substantially smaller drug quantities. In sum, Boden-hamer has not carried his burden to show his sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b970-12\">.
