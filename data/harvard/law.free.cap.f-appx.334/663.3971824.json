Castillo was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment and 10 years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">Castillo argues that the 10-year supervised release term is unreasonable. He argues that this term exceeds that required to effectuate Congress\u2019s sentencing goals stated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). This is so, he argues, because it is likely that he will be deported from the United States following completion of his term of imprisonment, thereby making it impossible to fulfill the rehabilitative or monitoring goals of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-15\">Because Castillo did not object to his term of supervised release, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2959, 171 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008). To show plain error, the appellant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If the appellant makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-20\">The district court heard at sentencing Castillo\u2019s argument that he committed the instant offense because he needed money to support his grandparents and that he agreed to take part in the offense because he was unaware of the mandatory minimum sentence he faced if caught and convicted. Although the supervised release term is non-reporting, it serves to deter Castillo for a longer period of time from recidivist behavior and committing another offense in this country. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)-(C). Moreover, the supervised release term imposed by the district court was within the statutory and guideline range of eight years to life. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)(vii), 960(b)(2)(G); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.2(c). Castillo has not shown plain error with respect to the district court\u2019s imposition of a 10-year term of supervised release. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b692-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
