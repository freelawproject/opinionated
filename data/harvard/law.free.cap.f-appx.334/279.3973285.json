No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-15\">Jones pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to a crack cocaine offense and was sentenced originally to a term of 100 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That sentence reflected a downward departure from Jones\u2019s guideline range based on a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 substantial assistance motion filed by the government. In March 2008, Jones filed a motion pursuant to section 3582(c)(2) for retroactive application of Amendment 706 to the sentencing guidelines.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court determined that Amendment 706 was applicable to Jones, reduced Jones\u2019s offense level by two levels, and imposed a new revised total sentence of 84 months (again reflecting a comparable downward departure to the guideline range to reflect Jones\u2019s substantial assistance). Jones does not dispute that his revised guideline range after application of the two-level adjustment and credit for substantial assistance was 84 to 105 months. Jones argued before the district court \u2014 and argues on appeal \u2014 that a further reduction below the guideline range is supported by application of the sentencing factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Jones maintains that post<em>-Booker, United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the guidelines are advisory in the context of a section 3582 resentencing: the district court has authority to depart from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>guidelines when imposing a new sentence under section 3582.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under section 3582, <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), if section 3582 applies, a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a sentence reduction is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">If a district court is authorized to reduce a sentence pursuant to section 3582(c)(2), it may do so \u201cafter considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A sentencing adjustment under section 3582(c)(2) allows no full <em>de novo </em>resentenc-ing. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(3) (\u201cproceedings under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement do not constitute a full resentencing of the defendant\u201d). All original sentencing determinations are to remain unchanged with only the amended guideline range substituted for the unamended guideline range used at sentencing. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, n. 2; <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 n. 4 (11th Cir.1998). The 84-month sentence imposed represents the minimum sentence the district court had authority to impose consistent with section 3582(c)(2) and applicable policy statements of the Sentencing Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Jones argues nonetheless that <em>Booker </em>trumps application of the policy statements: once a guidelines amendment is made retroactive, the Sentencing Commission has no power to cabin the district court\u2019s jurisdiction and discretion on the application of that guideline. Our decision in <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009), precludes Jones\u2019s claim of <em>Booker </em>error. In <em>Melvin, </em>we concluded that <em>Booker </em>and its progeny have no application to section 3582(c)(2) resentencing proceedings. Under <em>Melvin, </em>a district court is bound by the limitations on its discretion imposed by section 3582(c)(2) and the applicable Sentencing Commission policy statements. Resentencing under section 3582(c)(2) allows a district court no discretion to impose a non-guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-13\">. The government's argument that the appeal waiver in Jones's plea agreement bars this appeal is without merit. Neither the language of the plea agreement nor the Rule 11 colloquy attending the district court\u2019s acceptance of Jones's guilty plea contemplated a waiver of rights in the event of a retroactive guidelines amendment; the record fails to support a knowing waiver of the right to appeal a ruling in a section 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>541 F.3d 1064, 1066 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b308-17\">.
