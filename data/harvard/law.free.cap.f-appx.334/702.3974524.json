United </em>States<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because it is not empirically-based. He also argues that his sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) because the Guidelines account for his pri- or conviction both to increase his offense level and to calculate his criminal history score.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">We have rejected Valenzuela\u2019s first argument in <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>holding that <em>Kimbrough </em>does not address the appellate presumption of reasonableness, instead reminding that it is within the discretion of the district court \u201cto consider the policy decisions behind the Guidelines, including the presence or absence of empirical data, as part of their \u00a7 3553(a) analysis.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As in <em>Mondragon-Santiago, </em>we decline to second guess the district court\u2019s decision simply because a Guideline may not be empirically-based.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-16\">Valenzuela\u2019s second argument that the Guidelines double counted his prior conviction is also unavailing. The Guidelines do not prohibit double counting.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And we have approved of double counting under similar circumstances.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, Valenzuela has not shown that the district court erroneously calculated the guideline range of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b731-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
