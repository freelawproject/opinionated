For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Section 1915(g), the three strikes provision, bars a prisoner, who has filed three or more complaints that have been dismissed as frivolous or malicious or for failure to state a claim, from filing a complaint <em>in forma pauperis, </em>unless the prisoner is \u201cunder imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d On appeal, Sutton does not dispute that he has more than three strikes under section 1915(g). Sutton, therefore, may not bring his action <em>in for-ma pauperis </em>unless he sufficiently alleges that he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See Brown v. Johnson, </em>387 F.3d 1344, 1349-50 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that complaint sufficiently alleged imminent danger of serious physical injury where prisoner asserted that he was in danger of more serious afflictions if he continued to not be treated for his HIV and hepatitis).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Sutton filed his Petition for Injunctive Relief <em>in forma pauperis, </em>alleging that during his 1997 criminal trial, the District Attorney\u2019s Office of Gwinnett Superior Court, the State of Georgia, and unnamed additional defendants wrongfully withheld evidence which Sutton alleged would have been favorable to his defense. It is uncontested that the Petition did not allege that Sutton was in any imminent danger of serious physical injury. Accordingly, after taking judicial notice of the five prior cases filed by Sutton which were dismissed as frivolous, the district court properly dismissed the Petition pursuant to the \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">In his brief on appeal, Sutton provides no argument regarding the district court\u2019s dismissal pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g), opting instead to argue the merits of his underlying complaint. After commencing his appeal, however, Sutton submitted an \u201cAffidavit of Indigency,\u201d in which he asserted that he is \u201cin imminent physical danger of growing older and is in grave danger of perhaps dying here in this prison system.\u201d He also asserted that his allegedly \u201cillegal sentence and conviction\u201d has \u201cendangerfed his] physical health\u201d by \u201ccausing him stress, anxiety, depression, and further his life is deteriorating here inside this Georgia state prison for no reason at all.\u201d We conclude that these types of general assertions, even construed liberally, are \u201cinsufficient to invoke the exception to \u00a7 1915(g) absent specific fact allegations of ongoing serious physical injury, or of a pattern of misconduct evidencing the likelihood of imminent serious physical injury.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>387 F.3d at 1350 (citing <em>Martin v. Shelton, </em>319 F.3d 1048, 1050 (8th Cir.2003)). Thus, we agree with the district court that Sutton has failed to establish that he is entitled to the imminent danger exception to the three strike rule and we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
