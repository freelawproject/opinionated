On appeal, he contends that the district court erred in instructing the jury that Alabama\u2019s second-degree rape statute prohibits sexual intercourse with a child who is 12 years old, and asserts that this erroneous jury instruction constituted a constructive amendment to the indictment. Specifically, Nelson argues that, because the statute prohibits sexual intercourse with a child who is over 12 years old but less than 16 years old, the victim must have attained the age of at least 13 in order for the statute to apply. In addition, Nelson argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(a) because the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions, as his offense mvolved a minor who was 11 years old, not 12 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-16\">We review a district court\u2019s jury instructions <em>de novo </em>to determine \u201cwhether they misstate the law or mislead the jury to the prejudice of the objecting party.\u201d <em>United States v. Bender, </em>290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation omitted). \u201cWe give the district court wide discretion as to the style and wording employed in the instructions, ascertaining that the instructions accurately reflect the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA constructive amendment to the indictment occurs where the jury instructions so modify the elements of the offense charged that the defendant may have been convicted on a ground not alleged by the grand jury\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>indictment.\u201d <em>United States v. Starke, </em>62 F.3d 1374, 1380 (11th Cir.1995) (internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">We have articulated the following principles regarding statutory interpretation: First, if the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning, then that meaning controls, and the inquiry ends. <em>United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 798 (11th Cir.2006). Furthermore, we will not \u201clook at one word or term in isolation, but instead will look to the entire statutory context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and alteration omitted). Finally, we avoid interpreting statutory language in a manner that produces an absurd result, even if the resulting interpretation is not wholly consistent with the plain language of the statute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Alabama\u2019s first-degree rape statute provides, in pertinent part, \u201cA person commits the crime of rape in the first degree if ... [h]e or she, being 16 years or older, engages in sexual intercourse with a member of the opposite sex who is less than 12 years old.\u201d Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-6-61(a)(3). Alabama\u2019s second-degree rape statute provides, in pertinent part, \u201cA person commits the crime of rape in the second degree if ... [b]eing 16 years old or older, he or she engages in sexual intercourse with a member of the opposite sex less than 16 and more than 12 years old.\u201d Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-6-62(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">If Alabama\u2019s second-degree rape statute did not apply to 12-year-olds, then 12-year-olds would lack statutory protection from rape because Alabama\u2019s first-degree rape statute expressly applies only to those children who are under the age of 12. Thus, the interpretation of Alabama\u2019s second-degree rape statute that Nelson urges on appeal is rejected by us because it produces an absurd result. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not err in its jury instruction on Alabama\u2019s second-degree rape statute. Because the district court\u2019s jury instructions accurately described the law, the court did not constructively amend the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides, in pertinent part, \u201cAfter the government closes its evidence or after the close of all the evidence, the court on the defendant\u2019s motion must enter a judgment of acquittal of any offense for which the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(a). We review a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 29 motion <em>de novo, </em>\u201cviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 744 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cIt is not necessary that the evidence exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilt, provided a reasonable trier of fact could find that the evidence establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Young, </em>906 F.2d 615, 618 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">Nelson was charged under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-12\">Whoever, using the mail or any facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce, or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States knowingly persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any individual who has not attained the age of 18 years, to engage in prostitution or any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense, or attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not less than 10 years or for life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b); <em>{See </em>Doc. 12 at 1). As noted above, Nelson\u2019s \u00a7 2422(b) charge referenced Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-6-62(a)(l), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>which prohibits sexual intercourse between a person over the age of 16 and a child who is more than 12 years old and less than 16 years old. Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-6-62(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">In order to support a conviction for attempt, the government must show not only that the defendant took a substantial step toward committing the charged offense, but also that the defendant had the specific intent to commit the underlying charged crime. <em>United States v. Yost, </em>479 F.3d 815, 819 (11th Cir.2007). In <em>United States v. Root, </em>we rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction under \u00a7 2422(b) because, in his attempts to communicate with a 13-year-old girl over the internet in order to induce her to engage in sexual intercourse, he had actually been communicating with an undercover agent. <em>United States v. Root, </em>296 F.3d 1222, 1224, 1227 (11th Cir.2002). We held that a defendant\u2019s offense need not involve an actual minor in order to support a conviction for attempt under \u00a7 2422(b), explaining that it was sufficient that the defendant believed that his offense involved a minor. <em>Id. </em>at 1228-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Under the principle set forth in <em>Root, </em>we conclude that sufficient evidence supported Nelson\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 2422(b) and Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-6-62(a)(l) because the evidence permitted a reasonable jury to conclude that Nelson believed that he was enticing a 12-year-old girl to have sexual intercourse. Because sufficient evidence supported Nelson\u2019s \u00a7 2422(b) conviction, sufficient evidence also supported his conviction under \u00a7 2260A.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm Nelson\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
