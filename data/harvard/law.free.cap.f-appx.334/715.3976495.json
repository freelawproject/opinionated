Following amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines that lowered the offense levels for crack cocaine offenses, the district court granted a motion by Joseph pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and reduced his sentence to 130 months, which was at the bottom of the amended guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-23\">Joseph now appeals, arguing that the district court\u2019s failure to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors or a sentence below the amended guidelines range when it resentenced him violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-24\">Joseph\u2019s arguments are foreclosed in light of our recent decision in <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 236-39 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Sept. 21, 2009) (No. 09-6657).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-25\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the Government\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b743-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
