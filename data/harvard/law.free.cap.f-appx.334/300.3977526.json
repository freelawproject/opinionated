Lin contends that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution based on an imputed political opinion, namely that Chinese authorities perceived him as being a supporter of Falun Gong.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-14\">Because the BIA issued its own decision and did not adopt the IJ\u2019s one, our review is limited to BIA\u2019s decision. See <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). The BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test. <em>Id. </em>at 1283. Under that test, we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1283-84 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). We will reverse the BIA only when the record compels us to, and the fact that the record also supports the petitioner\u2019s case is not enough to reverse. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1029 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). Moreover, in our review we may not find or consider facts not raised in the administrative record, nor may we reweigh the evidence from scratch. <em>Id. </em>at 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-15\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). An alien is eligible for asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). Under the INA, a \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaS\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-16\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>Id. </em>at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. An imputed belief, whether correctly or incorrectly attributed, may constitute a ground for a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of persecution under the INA. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Lin contends that he will be persecuted if he is returned to China because of his imputed association with Falun Gong. Specifically, he argues that he will be arrested and persecuted because the Chinese government assumes he is a Falun Gong supporter because he sold Falun Gong literature at his bookstore. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding to the contrary. Lin has the burden of demonstrating that his \u201cfear of persecution is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. To do, he must present \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be singled out for persecution on account of\u201d the statutorily listed factor. <em>D-Muhumed v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Lin\u2019s fear-of-perseeution argument is based on theory that the Chinese government shut down his bookstore because he was selling Falun Gong literature, and therefore that the Chinese government believes he supports Falun Gong. That argument fails. The only supporting evidence that Lin presented was a statement in his asylum application that a friend advised him that he was perceived as selling Falun Gong literature and may be investigated. That is not enough evidence, however, to compel the conclusion that Lin\u2019s bookstore was shut clown because he was selling Falun Gong literature, much less that the government will persecute Lin upon his return.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">The BIA concluded that the Chinese authorities did not shut down Lin\u2019s bookstore on account of Lin\u2019s perceived support of Falun Gong. Lin argues that it is nonetheless reasonable to conclude from the record that he will be persecuted if he returns to China. It is not enough that the record supports the petitioner\u2019s claim. <em>See Adefemi, </em>386 F.3d at 1027 (\u201c[T]he mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion in not enough to justify a reversal of administrative findings.\u201d). The record must compel us to reverse the BIA. <em>Id. </em>Here it does not. Instead, the record provides substantial evidence to support the BIA\u2019s determination that Lin has not demonstrated a well-founded fear of future persecution if he returns to China.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
