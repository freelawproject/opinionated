Rivera\u2019s \u00a7 3582(e)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine. On appeal, Rivera argues it was error for the district court to deny his \u00a7 3582 motion on the ground he was held accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, because he was not held liable for that amount of crack cocaine at his original sentencing. Rivera also asserts the district court erred in failing to address his arguments concerning drug quantity and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Rivera next argues his sentence should be reduced because the Guidelines are advisory in the \u00a7 3582 context following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He asserts the district court should have considered the factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), as well as his post-sentencing conduct. Finally, he argues, for the first time on appeal, his equal protection and due process rights are violated by the fact that he was sentenced pre-Booker and now is being denied an opportunity to be resen-tenced under the advisory Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). We review for plain error issues not raised before the district court. <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1301 (11th Cir.2005). Under plain-error review, we can correct an error where: (1) there is error; (2) the error is plain; (3) the error affected substantial rights; and (4) the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\"><em>A </em>district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d \u2014 and is, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>not authorized under \u00a7 <em>3582(c)(2) </em>\u2014 if <em>the </em>retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The district court properly denied \u00a7 3582 relief because Rivera\u2019s guideline range was not lowered as a result of Amendment 706. Rivera was held accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine and Amendment 706 only lowered base offense levels for quantities of crack cocaine less than 4.5 kilograms. <em>See James, </em>548 F.3d at 986 (holding that the defendant was not entitled to a reduction in sentence because he had been held accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, and Amendment 706 did not lower his guideline range). Furthermore, Rivera\u2019s argument the court improperly attributed more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine to him is meritless because the district court must keep all the original factual findings the same during \u00a7 3582 proceedings, and he was held accountable for just over 10 kilograms at the original sentencing. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (holding that proceedings under \u00a7 3582 do not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing, and \u201call original sentencing determinations remain unchanged\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Additionally, Rivera\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>arguments were meritless, and any error the district court made in not discussing these arguments was harmless. Rivera\u2019s arguments under <em>Booker </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>fail because those cases are not retroactively applicable guideline amendments, and, therefore, cannot be a basis for \u00a7 3582 relief. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that Booker did not provide a jurisdictional basis for \u00a7 3582 relief because it was not a sentencing amendment). Furthermore, <em>Booker </em>did not render the Guidelines advisory in the \u00a7 3582 context. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009) (holding <em>Booker </em>does not render a guideline range advisory in the context of a \u00a7 3582 proceeding), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Rivera\u2019s argument that a lower sentence would be appropriate in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and his post-sentencing conduct also is meritless. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors and post-sentencing conduct can be considered only if the defendant is eligible for \u00a7 3582 relief, and Rivera was not eligible for relief. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(B) (stating that, in determining the extent of the reduction to be given, the court \u201cmay consider post-sentencing conduct\u201d); <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998) (stating a district court first must discern whether an amendment would lower a guideline range and then consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine whether, and to what extent, to lower a defendant\u2019s sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Finally, Rivera argues refusing to apply the Guidelines as advisory would violate his equal protection and due process rights. This argument is' meritless because it constitutes an extraneous sentencing issue, which cannot be raised in a \u00a7 3582 proceeding. <em>See Duncan, </em>400 F.3d at 1301; <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 782 (stating \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not \u201cgrant to the coui't jurisdiction to consider extraneous sentencing issues\u201d). Therefore, the district court properly denied the \u00a7 3582 motion, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
