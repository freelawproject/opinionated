A collateral attack on or direct appeal from the 1995 sentence would be untimely, and Spencer disavows such a challenge. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f); Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-18\">Spencer contends that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B) provides an avenue for applying 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) to modify the sentence. This contention lacks merit because \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B) allows a district court to modify an existing term of imprisonment to the extent \u201cexpressly permitted by statute,\u201d and \u00a7 3553(b)(1) does not expressly permit the modification of a sentence that has already been imposed. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3553(b)(1), \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B). Section 3582(c)(1)(B) therefore does not provide a means for applying \u00a7 3553(b)(1). <em>See United States v. Garcia-Quintanilla, </em>574 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir.2009) (refusing to use \u00a7 3582(c) as a means to apply a statute that does not expressly permit modification of a sentence that has already been imposed). Moreover, \u00a7 3553(b)(1), which required treating the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, is unconstitutional. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 245, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-24\">Any clerical error was corrected by the Second Amended Judgment reflecting that the district court recommended but did not order that the Bureau of Prisons run Spencer\u2019s federal sentence consecutively to an undischarged state sentence. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b733-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
