Barajas argues for the first time on appeal that the district court failed to comply with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-23\">When a defendant fails to raise an objection in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1019 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). To satisfy that standard, a defendant must establish an error that is plain and affects his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>When he has pleaded guilty, the defendant \u201cmust show a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 2340, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-24\">There was no plain error in Barajas\u2019s guilty plea. Barajas argues that the district court was required to inform him that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>he had agreed not to request a sentence below the guideline range. When it accepts a plea of guilt, the district court must comply with Rule 11 and address three \u201ccore principles\u201d to \u201censurfe] that [the] defendant (1) enters his guilty plea free from coercion, (2) understands the nature of the charges, and (3) understands the consequences of his plea.\u201d <em>Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d at 1019 (citing <em>United States v. Jones, </em>143 F.3d 1417, 1418-19 (11th Cir.1998)). The district court satisfied these requirements when it determined that Barajas had knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to a trial and discussed with Barajas the applicable guideline range and the sentencing factors. <em>See United States v. Mosley, </em>173 F.3d 1318, 1328 (11th Cir.1999). Barajas cannot establish that any error affected his substantial rights because he was permitted to request a downward departure at his sentencing hearing, despite the terms of his plea agreement. Barajas also has not alleged that, but for the error, he would not have pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Barajas\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
