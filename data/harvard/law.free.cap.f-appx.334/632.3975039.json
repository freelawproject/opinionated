Mosso-Guz-man argues that the district court plainly erred in applying the 16-level enhancement of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) based on his prior conviction under California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11352. He argues that his sentence was enhanced in plain contravention of <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 273-74 (5th Cir.2005), in which this court held that California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11379(a), which criminalized offers to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>sell a controlled substance, was overbroad and encompassed activity that did not fall within the definition of \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Because Mosso-Guzman did not object to the 16-level enhancement in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Ochoa-Cruz, </em>442 F.3d 865, 866-67 (5th Cir.2006). To show plain error, the appellant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If the appellant makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">The district court applied the 16-level enhancement based on Mosso-Guzman\u2019s conviction under California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11351.5, not \u00a7 11352. In <em>United States v. Palacios-Quinonez, </em>431 F.3d 471, 474-77 (5th Cir.2005), we held that the offense conduct constituting a violation of \u00a7 11351 is a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). The two statutes are identical in that both criminalize the possession for sale or the purchase for purposes of sale, except for the fact that \u00a7 11351 applies to controlled substances in general and \u00a7 11351.5 applies to cocaine base in particular. There is no basis upon which to distinguish the two statutes for purposes of applying the holding of <em>Palac-ios-Quinonez </em>to \u00a7 11351.5. The district court clearly applied the 16-level enhancement based on the conviction under \u00a7 11351.5. The district court did not plainly err in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b660-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
