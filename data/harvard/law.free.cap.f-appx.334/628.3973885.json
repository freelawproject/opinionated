Davila argues that the BIA erred in denying his motion to reopen because he has an absolute right to de novo review of the denial of Temporary Protected Status (TPS). He further asserts that the motion to reopen was timely as to the denial of TPS because he was not denied TPS until January 8, 2008. He argues that the denial of his motion to reopen would lead to an absurd result and that he is entitled to a waiver for his conviction of marijuana possession. Davila also argues that the denial of his motion to reopen violated his due process right to an administrative review of the denial of TPS. The Government responds by arguing that this court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s refusal to grant discretionary relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Because Davila seeks review of the BIA\u2019s sua sponte authority to deny a motion to reopen and such authority is discretionary, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 216, 219-20 (5th Cir.2008). Davila\u2019s argument that his due process rights were violated by the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen is unavailing. There is no liberty interest in a motion to reopen. <em>Altamirano-Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 547, 550 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Davila\u2019s argument in his reply brief that the BIA is without discretion to deny his motion to reopen was not raised before the BIA. Likewise, Davila\u2019s argument that his motion to reopen was timely filed was not raised before the BIA. Davi-la has not exhausted his administrative remedies. As such, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider these issues. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Accordingly, the petition is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b656-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
