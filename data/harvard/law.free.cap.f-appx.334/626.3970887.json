He appeals the denial of his motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based upon Amendments 706 and 711 of the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered the applicable offense level for crack cocaine offenses. The district court held that, because Bradford\u2019s total offense level was calculated under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b), and not U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, Amendments 706 and 711 did not lower his sentencing range, and therefore Bradford did not qualify for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-23\">Section 3582(c)(2) provides, in relevant part, that a district court \u201cmay not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>imposed except ... in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d The decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is discretionary, and this court reviews the denial of a \u00a7 3582 motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Boe, </em>117 F.3d 830, 831 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Bradford contends that the district im-permissibly treated \u00a7 1B1.10 as mandatory. By doing so, Bradford argues, the district court failed to consider 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors as required by \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and also violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and its progeny. In a closely related argument, Bradford asserts that the Sentencing Commission exceeded its statutory authority by imposing a mandatory sentencing scheme through \u00a7 1B1.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Each of these arguments fails because the district court\u2019s decision is supported by the plain language of 3582(c)(2). A reduction in Bradford\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1 pursuant to Amendments 706 and 711 would not affect his guideline range because the range was calculated under \u00a7 4B1.1. Because Bradford\u2019s guideline range was not derived from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense, he was not sentenced \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission,\u201d and a reduction is not permitted. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Further, to the extent Bradford argues that the district court had the discretion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(e)(2) in light of <em>Booker, </em>the argument is unavailing because <em>Booker </em>was not \u201cbased on a retroactive amendment to the Guidelines.\u201d <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Bradford also argues that his career offender enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) was improper. As this contention does not relate to any Guideline amendment that has lowered Bradford\u2019s applicable guidelines range, \u00a7 3582 is not the appropriate vehicle to raise it. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994); <em>see also Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000) (observing that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 \u201cis the primary means of collaterally attacking a federal sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">Bradford has not repeated on appeal his argument that the district court was required to address his objections to his receipt of a firearm enhancement and to the composition of the cocaine at issue. Accordingly, he has abandoned this argument. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993) (\u201cAlthough we liberally construe the briefs of pro se appellants, we also require that arguments must be briefed to be preserved.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A) (appellant\u2019s argument must contain contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying a sentence reduction. <em>See Boe, </em>117 F.3d at 831. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b654-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
