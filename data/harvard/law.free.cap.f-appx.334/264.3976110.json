Smith was convicted of drug offenses involving crack cocaine, and he filed his motion pursuant to Amendment 706 to the sentencing guidelines, which lowered the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. The district court denied \u00a7 3582 relief because, even though his sentence was reduced pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 as a result of his substantial assistance to the government, Smith was originally sentenced to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-15\">Smith argues that he was eligible for \u00a7 3582 relief because his statutory mandatory minimum \u201cguideline sentence\u201d of life imprisonment was not his \u201cguideline range.\u201d After a lengthy discussion of the terms \u201cguideline sentence\u201d and \u201cguideline range,\u201d Smith claims that since \u00a7 3582 authorizes a reduction based on a sentencing \u201crange\u201d that has been lowered, his mandatory \u201cguideline sentence\u201d did not prohibit a reduction pursuant to Amendment 706. Smith also argues that because he was originally sentenced to an indeterminate life sentence, his substantial assistance reduction was at least partly based on his original guideline range. Smith points out that should the relevant language in this sentencing scheme be subject to two equally rational constructions, the rule of lenity requires that we rule in his favor. Finally, Smith notes that had Amendment 706 been applied at his initial sentencing, he would have been declared a career offender, and he requests that we reduce his guideline range accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-16\">In his reply brief, Smith acknowledges that <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337 (11th Cir.2008), controls the argument presented in his case. However, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>argues that <em>Williams </em>was wrongly decided, citing policy reasons and repeating arguments presented in his initial brief as they apply to <em>Williams. </em>Smith requests that we await the rehearing decision in <em>Williams.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">' Since the time of his final brief, this court has rejected the rehearing request in <em>Williams. United States v. Williams, </em>\u2014 F.3d - (11th Cir. Mar. 5, 2009). \u201cUnder the well-established prior panel precedent rule of this Circuit, the holding of the first panel to address an issue is the law of this Circuit, thereby binding all subsequent panels unless and until the first panel\u2019s holding is overruled by the Court sitting en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Smith v. GTE Corp., </em>236 F.3d 1292, 1300 n. 8 (11th Cir.2001). Therefore this case is due to be</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
