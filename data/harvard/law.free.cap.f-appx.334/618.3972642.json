Brewer also alleged that the former sheriff, William Belt, failed to respond properly to the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">At the close of Brewer\u2019s case in the bench trial, the district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Brewer\u2019s claims against Belt. The court concluded that Brewer had failed to prove that he suffered more than a <em>de minimis </em>injuiy and had failed to demonstrate that the use of force was clearly excessive or was clearly unreasonable. The court dismissed the \u00a7 1983 action with prejudice and denied Brewer leave to proceed <em>in forma pauper-is </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d) on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Brewer moves to proceed IFP in this court. By doing so, he is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(c)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a). He does not challenge the dismissal of his claims against Belt, so those claims are abandoned. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Instead, Brewer contends that the evidence supports his contention that Prier used excessive force that resulted in injuiy.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">To prevail on a claim of excessive force, Brewer must establish that the force was not applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, but maliciously and sadistically to cause harm, and that he suffered injury. <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 6-7, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992). Factors relevant to that inquiry include the following non-exclusive list: (1) the extent of the injury suffered; (2) the need for the application of force; (3) the relationship between the need and the amount of force used; (4) the threat reasonably perceived by the responsible offi-ci\u00e1is; and (5) efforts made to temper the severity of a forceful response. <em>Baldwin v. Stalder, </em>137 F.3d 836, 838-39 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">The evidence demonstrates that Prier tried to obtain Brewer\u2019s compliance through non-forceful means, but Brewer\u2019s continued noncompliance made the use of force necessary. Further, the application of that force was not clearly excessive to the need to restore discipline such that it constituted a constitutional violation. <em>See id. </em>at 838-39; <em>Hudson, </em>503 U.S. at 6-7, 112 S.Ct. 995. Thus, even if Prier could demonstrate a more than <em>de minimis </em>injury, he has failed to show a constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">Brewer has not established that he will present a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, leave to proceed IFP is denied, and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b646-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
