Chappell argues that he was entitled to a downward adjustment for his acceptance of responsibility, and he challenges the enhancement of his sentence for possession of ammunition in connection with another felony offense. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">While Chappell was a passenger in Bobby Glass\u2019s vehicle, the two men were arrested on outstanding arrest warrants. Officer William Hudson searched the vehicle and discovered in the passenger floorboard fragments of a crystal substance that he believed to be methamphetamine and a black book bag and under the passenger seat a .380 caliber handgun. Chap-pell admitted to an officer that he had crushed the crystal substance with his shoe, and Chappell admitted ownership of the book bag but denied knowledge of the gun. Inside the book bag, officers discovered seven rounds of .380 caliber ammunition. Chappell later told authorities that he \u201ct[oo]k responsibility for making the decision to get in the car that night. I knew the person I was riding with, and that I was on state probation. I knew I shouldn\u2019t have been in that car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">Chappell was indicted for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and possession of ammunition by a convicted felon, <em>id. </em>Chappell agreed to plead guilty to the ammunition charge and submit to the court a factual resume in exchange for a recommendation by the government for a sentence at the low end of the guideline range and dismissal of the firearm charge. In the final paragraph of his factual resume, Chappell admitted that he had \u201cknowingly possessed [the seven (7) rounds of .380 caliber] ammunition\u201d that police discovered in his book bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">At the change of plea hearing, Chappell acknowledged that the government would have to prove that he knowingly possessed ammunition. Chappell also agreed that the government could prove the facts contained in his factual resume. The district court accepted Chappell\u2019s plea of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-9\">The presentence investigation report provided a base offense level of twenty, United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) (Nov.2007), and increased that level by four points for possession of ammunition in connection with another felony offense, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). The report also decreased the base level by three points because Chappell accepted responsibility for his conduct and timely notified authorities of his intent to plead guilty. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1. With a criminal history of IV, the report provided a sentencing range between 57 and 71 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-10\">Chappell objected to the presentence report and challenged the application of section 2K2.1(b)(6). Chappell argued that he had not conceded in his factual resume actual knowledge of the bullets found in his book bag and he had pleaded guilty because the government could prove a pri-ma facie case based on his \u201c \u2018joint constructive possession\u2019 of certain inculpatory evidence found in the vehicle.\u201d Chappell added that he had taken and continued to take \u201cresponsibility for his conduct in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b999-11\">During the sentencing hearing, Chappell repeated his objection to the enhancement. Chappell acknowledged that the government could \u201ctechnically\u201d argue that the ammunition was discovered \u201cduring the course of possession of drugs that were found in the ear[,]\u201d but he argued that he had never been charged with a drug offense. Based on Chappell\u2019s argument, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>district court questioned whether Chappell had accepted responsibility for the possession of ammunition when he disavowed knowledge of the bullets. Chappell responded that \u201cafter he got in the car, he knew or should have known\u201d about the ammunition and he was unaware how the ammunition got into his backpack. The district court stated that Chappell could not be held responsible for the ammunition without actual knowledge and the court was not inclined to reduce the offense level for an acceptance of responsibility. The court continued the hearing for Chappell and counsel to discuss the matter and for the government to call witnesses to establish that Chappell was subject to section 2K2.1(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">When the hearing resumed, the district court stated that Chappell construed his guilty plea as an \u201cAlford type plea.\u201d Chappell confirmed that he contested whether he possessed the ammunition but acknowledged that the government could prove the charge. The government asked the district court to consider whether Chappell\u2019s argument was consistent with an acceptance of responsibility. After Chappell again denied actual knowledge of the ammunition, the court ruled that Chap-pell had not accepted responsibility. The government presented testimony from Officer Hudson about the traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">Based on the officer\u2019s testimony and Chappell\u2019s admissions, the court found \u201cthat the possession of the ammunition was likely to facilitate [the possession of the methamphetamine], if not that it actually did facilitate that,\u201d and applied the four-level enhancement. The district court calculated Chappell\u2019s offense level at 24 and ruled, based on the guidelines and the statutory factors, \u201cthat the low end of the guidelines provide for an appropriate sentence.\u201d The district court sentenced Chappell to 77 months of imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release. Counsel objected to the application of section 2K2.1(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">We review the interpretation and application of the Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and related findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Foley, </em>508 F.3d 627, 632 (11th Cir.2007). Because the district court is in a unique position to evaluate whether a defendant has accepted responsibility, we review with \u201cgreat deference\u201d the decision to deny a reduction and will not overturn that decision \u201cunless the facts in the record clearly establish that the defendant has accepted responsibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1022-23 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Objections or arguments that are not raised in the district court are reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Beckles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 842 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-10\">Chappell challenges his sentence on two grounds. First, Chappell argues that he was entitled to a downward adjustment for his acceptance of responsibility. Second, Chappell argues for the first time on appeal that the ammunition did not facilitate or have the potential to facilitate the possession of methamphetamine. These arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-11\">The record supports the denial of the downward adjustment. A defendant may receive a two-level downward adjustment of his offense level if he \u201cclearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense[.]\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). A plea of guilty before trial and truthful admissions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>about the charged conduct constitutes \u201csignificant evidence of acceptance of responsibility!,]\u201d but may be \u201coutweighed by conduct ... that is inconsistent with such acceptance....\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 1. Chappell admitted in his factual statement and during his plea colloquy that he \u201cknowingly possessed\u201d the ammunition found in his book bag, but he disavowed that admission after the court accepted his plea of guilt. The district court did not clearly err by denying Chappell a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">The record also supports the enhancement of Chappell\u2019s sentence for possessing ammunition in connection with another felony offense. A defendant is subject to a four-level enhancement if he \u201cused or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense!.]\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). The enhancement applies \u201cif the firearm or ammunition facilitated, or had the potential of facilitating, another felony offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>cmt. n. 14(A). The district court was entitled to find that the ammunition had the potential to facilitate Chappell\u2019s felony possession of methamphetamine. In the absence of a contrary interpretation from this Court or the Supreme Court, the district court did not plainly err by applying the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">Chappell\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
