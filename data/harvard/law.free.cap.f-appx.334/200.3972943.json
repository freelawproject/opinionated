The administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) initially determined that Parrish was disabled in 1991. Following a periodic reexamination of Parrish\u2019s condition, the Commissioner found that, on August 1, 1995, Parrish had medically improved and her residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) had increased. Accordingly, it terminated her DIB as of that date. Subsequent to that finding of medical improvement, this case has been remanded by the district court on two occasions. Following each remand, the ALJ again found that Parrish had medically improved and her disability had ceased as of August 1, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">On appeal, Parrish argues that the ALJ improperly disregarded evidence that (1) in 1990, she received state workers\u2019 compensation benefits for her disability, and (2) the symptoms that a doctor found that she was suffering in 2002 were essentially the same as those for which she originally was granted DIB, limiting her ability to work to four hours per day.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">\u201cWe review the Commissioner\u2019s decision to determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and based upon proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1439 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cSubstantial evidence is defined as more than a scintilla, i.e., evidence that must do more than create a suspicion of the existence of the fact to be established, and such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support the conclusion.\u201d <em>Foote v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 1553, 1560 (11th Cir.1995) (per curiam) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">A claimant\u2019s continued entitlement to disability benefits must be reviewed periodically. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1594(a). Generally, the Commissioner must determine if there has been any medical improvement in the person\u2019s impairments and, if so, whether the medical improvement is related to the person\u2019s ability to work. <em>Id.; see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1594(c) (discussing the Commissioner\u2019s determination of medical improvement and its relationship to a claimant\u2019s abilities to do work). Medical improvement is any decrease in the medical severity of a claimant\u2019s impairment that was present at the most recent finding of disability. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1594(b)(1). We have held that \u201cthere can be no termination of benefits unless there is substantial evidence of improvement to the point of no disability.\u201d <em>McAulay v. Heckler, </em>749 F.2d 1500, 1500 (11th Cir.1985) (per curiam). In making such a determination, \u201ca comparison of the original medical evidence and the new medical evidence is necessary to make a finding of improvement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>First, as to the workers\u2019 compensation benefits, we find that the district court committed no error. Because a decision by another agency about whether a claimant is disabled is based on its rules, and because the Commissioner must make its own determination based on social security law, a determination made by another agency that a claimant is disabled is not binding on the Commissioner. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1504. Nevertheless, \u201c[t]he findings of disability by another agency, although not binding on the [Commissioner], are entitled to great weight.\u201d <em>Bloodsworth v. Heckler, </em>703 F.2d 1233, 1241 (11th Cir.1983). How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>ever here, the state decided to grant workers\u2019 compensation benefits to Parrish in 1990, well before the finding of medical improvement and termination of benefits in 1995. As such, the state\u2019s determination regarding benefits has little, if any, relevance to the determination of medical improvement and termination of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Second, as to a prior doctor\u2019s evaluation in 2002, we find that Parrish\u2019s argument fails for similar temporal reasons as noted above with regard to workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Parrish relies upon a medical evaluation performed in 2002, well <em>after </em>the finding of medical improvement and termination of benefits in 1995. Hence, that 1995 evaluation does not, and cannot, undermine the finding of medical improvement in 1995 because the subsequent 2002 evaluation did not purport to consider Parrish\u2019s condition in 1995. At best, the subsequent 2002 evaluation may constitute evidence that, since the termination of benefits, Parrish\u2019s impairments have worsened.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-14\">Upon careful review of the administrative proceedings, the medical record, the proceedings in the district court, and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no error. We find that the ALJ did not err in excluding these items from his evaluation of medical improvement. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
