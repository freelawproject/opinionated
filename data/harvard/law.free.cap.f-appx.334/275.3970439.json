On appeal, Anderson argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">A grand jury indicted Defendant Anderson and four co-defendants: Eulices Soto, Christian Soto, Veronica Ramos, and Christian Gaviria. Anderson pled guilty to Count Six of the indictment, which charged that he possessed with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), a confidential source negotiated with Eulices Soto and Ramos several purchases of crack cocaine. Defendant Anderson accompanied Ramos to a meeting, where Ramos sold the confidential source 50.1 grams of crack cocaine. Defendant Anderson told the confidential source that he had \u201ccooked\u201d the crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">The PSI recommended a base offense level was 80, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(a)(3). The PSI then noted that Defendant Anderson previously had been convicted of two felonies involving violence,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> characterized Anderson as a career offender pursuant to \u00a7 4Bl.l(a), and thus increased his offense level to 37. After a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Anderson\u2019s total offense level was 34. Based on this total offense level of 34 and a criminal history category of VI, Anderson\u2019s advisory guidelines range was 262 to 327 months. Anderson did not object to the PSI\u2019s calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">Defendant Anderson filed a sentencing memorandum requesting a downward variance from the advisory guidelines range. Anderson argued that the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) warranted a downward variance and reasoned that a 10-year sentence was appropriate. Anderson claimed that injuries suffered after a gang attack in high school caused him to abuse drugs, that his role in the drug offense was insignificant, and that he was less culpable than his co-defendant, Eulices Soto, who received a 210-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-13\">At sentencing, Defendant Anderson reiterated his request for a downward variance and called several witnesses to speak on his behalf.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Anderson\u2019s attorney then re-emphasized that, based on Anderson\u2019s offense conduct compared to Eulices Soto\u2019s, a sentence within the guidelines range would be unreasonable. Last, Anderson personally apologized to his family, the court, and the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-14\">The district court acknowledged that Anderson had two prior felony convictions: (1) aggravated assault and battery on a law enforcement officer and resisting or obstructing with violence and (2) resisting an officer with violence and battery on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>law enforcement officer. The district court also noted that Anderson had a history of drug offenses and that Eulices Soto had no criminal history. The district court explained that it \u201cpays particular emphasis to [Anderson\u2019s] criminal history in determining the weight to give the 3558 factors vis-a-vis the weight to give to the advisory guidelines.\u201d \u201cThe Court [ ] considered the statements of all the parties, the presen-tence report which contains the advisory guidelines as well as the statutory factors set forth in 18 United State Code, Section 355S(a)[,] and[,] with particular emphasis on the defendant\u2019s criminal history which does qualify him as a career offender and, of course, any criminal history in th[e] Court\u2019s mind is serious,\u201d the district court granted Anderson a downward variance from the 262 \u2014 to 327-month advisory guidelines range and sentenced Anderson to 210-months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Anderson appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Anderson argues that his 210-month sentence is substantively unreasonable because it created an unwarranted sentencing disparity between himself and his co-defendants, whom he asserts are more culpable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Anderson asserts that he should have not received the same sentence as his co-defendant, Eulices Soto, and notes that Ramos, whom he alleges received a 57-month sentence, was more culpable than him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">Reasonableness review is deferential and the \u201cthe party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). One of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors that a district court consults when determining a reasonable sentence is \u201cthe need to avoid unwanted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007). Moreover, a district need not discuss each factor. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. \u201c[A]n acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[Ojrdinarily, [this Court] would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-13\">Anderson has not carried his burden to show that the district court abused its discretion in imposing this 210-month sentence, which is below the advisory guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>lines range of 262 to 327 months. Anderson\u2019s argument that there is an unwarranted disparity between his sentence and Eulices Soto\u2019s or Ramos\u2019s sentence is without merit because he has not shown that he is similarly situated to either Eul-ices Soto or Ramos. The record affirmatively reflects that Eulices Soto had no criminal history. And Anderson has not come forward with any evidence that Ramos had a criminal history comparable to his own. Because Anderson\u2019s sentence reflected, at least in part, his own significant criminal history, he has failed to show that any disparity between the sentences is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-9\">. According to the PSI, Defendant Anderson had two prior felony convictions for aggravated assault and battery on a law enforcement officer. Anderson also had two prior felony convictions for possession of cocaine, oxyco-done, and alprazolam.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b304-10\">. First, Anderson called his former attorney, Ralph Hagans, to speak about his prior battery convictions. According to Hagans, Anderson's altercations with police officers that led to his prior convictions were a result of Anderson attempting to defend himself against the officers. Hagans stated that Anderson had a drug problem and needed further treatment. Next, Anderson called his father, mother, and brother-in-law. Each stated that Anderson had accepted responsibility for his actions, wanted to clean up his life, and had the support of his family.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b305-8\">. We review the reasonableness of a sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b305-9\">. The government argues that Anderson waived his disparity argument with respect to Ramos because he is raising it for the first time on appeal. We do not address the government's claim because we find no merit in Anderson's argument regarding Ramos in any event.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b305-10\">. The other \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; and (9) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
