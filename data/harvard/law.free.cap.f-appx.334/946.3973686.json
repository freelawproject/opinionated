No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"A8uo\">The basis of Mills\u2019s motion for a new trial is an immigration document \u2014 an application for a Significant Public Benefit Parole (\u201cSPBP\u201d) visa \u2014 filed by the Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) on behalf of George Hall, an informant for the DEA. According to Mills, the Government withheld this document; and, had it been disclosed, it would have allowed additional impeachment of DEA Agent Wilson, with whom Hall had worked in the investigation of Mills. Mills argues that the \u2022withheld document would have shown that Agent Wilson perjured himself when he testified about how long he had known informant Hall; and undermining Agent Wilson\u2019s credibility was critical to Mills\u2019s entrapment defense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to Mills, Agent Wilson was the strongest witness against him. The district court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"AQc\">We first address Mills\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s failure to make specific fact findings precludes us from engaging in meaningful appellate review. While explicit fact determinations are preferred, a district court\u2019s failure to make such determinations does not require remand if meaningful appellate review is possible. <em>See United States v. Villarino, </em>930 F.2d 1527, 1528-29 (11th Cir.1991) (sentencing context). Here, the district court made no fact findings beyond stating that it considered \u201call relevant transcripts and other materials;\u201d but the court also presided over Mills\u2019s trial and ruled on Mills\u2019s other post-trial motions. In the light of the district court\u2019s first-hand familiarity with the extensive record, together with our own affirmance of Mills\u2019s conviction on direct appeal, the absence of specific fact findings in the district court order denying Rule 33(b) relief does not defeat meaningful appellate review. <em>See United States v. Robertson, </em>493 F.3d 1322, 1334 (11th Cir.2007) (when reasonable to do so, appellate court may infer implied factual findings consistent with the judgment under review).</p>\n<p id=\"AV_r\">We review the denial of a motion for a new trial based on a <em>Brady </em>violation, <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Vallejo, </em>297 F.3d 1154, 1163 (11th Cir.2002). To obtain a new trial based on a <em>Brady </em>violation, a defendant must show these things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASiN\">(1) the government possessed favorable evidence to the defendant; (2) the defendant does not possess the evidence and could not obtain the evidence with any reasonable diligence; (3) the prosecution suppressed the favorable evidence; and (4) had the evidence been disclosed to the defendant, there is a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATuB\"><em>Id. </em>at 1164.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Impeachment evidence falls within the <em>Brady </em>rule. <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3380, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"ATAN\">We cannot say that the district court abused its discretion here because</p>\n<p id=\"b976-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>Mills did not demonstrate a <em>Brady </em>-violation. Mills\u2019s trial ended on 10 January-2003, but the SPBP visa form that Mills characterizes as withheld in violation of <em>Brady </em>is dated 31 January 2003. Even if we were to accept that the pertinent document otherwise would be <em>Brady </em>material, the immigration document was unavailable \u2014 it did not exist \u2014 at the time of Mills\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">And even if Mills could show that the prosecution suppressed the evidence and the evidence was subject to <em>Brady, </em>he cannot show that, had the evidence been disclosed to him, the outcome of his trial would have been different. To the extent that Mills sought a new trial based on the impeachment value of the evidence, Mills had an adequate opportunity to cross examine Agent Wilson about the Government\u2019s conduct in investigating him. In an effort to discredit Agent Wilson, Mills focused at trial on Agent Wilson\u2019s use of informant Hall without court permission and in violation of the terms of Hall\u2019s supervised release. The date discrepancy between when the SPBP visa application indicated that Hall had provided information about Mills \u2014 1997\u2014and when Agent Wilson testified he was approached by Hall about Mills \u2014 2002\u2014provides, at most, cumulative impeachment. <em>See United States v. Schlei, </em>122 F.3d 944, 991 (11th Cir.1997) (a court should not grant a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence when that evidence merely is cumulative or impeaching).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">Mills suggests that the date conflict bolsters his entrapment defense: the DEA had been working to entrap him since 1997. But no other evidence at trial showed that Hall worked with Wilson as an informant from 1997 to 2002; and the jury otherwise received sufficient evidence to convict Mills, including Hall\u2019s testimony about his dealings with Mills, tape-recorded conversations between Mills and Hall, and the testimony of a former cellmate about admissions made to him by Mills. Mills fails to demonstrate that had the document been disclosed to him before trial, a reasonable probability existed that the outcome would have been different. <em>See Bagley, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3383 (a reasonable probability of a different outcome is one sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome). In the light of the abundant evidence supporting the charges against Mills, his conviction is still \u201cworthy of confidence.\u201d <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 1566, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">Given the entirety of the record and notwithstanding the district court\u2019s lack of specific findings, we see no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Mills\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Aq6z\">. The jury was deadlocked initially and seemed initially receptive to Mills's entrapment defense.
