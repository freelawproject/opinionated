We review the district court\u2019s discretionary determination on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 236-37 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W. - (U.S. Sept. 21, 2009)(No. 09-6657).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">Washington argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his request for a reduced sentence without considering his objections to the recalculation of his base offense level in conjunction with the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He contends that the district court should have considered that his counsel had no reason to object to Washington being held responsible for amounts over 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base at sentencing. Finally, he also argues that the district court abused its discretion in not granting a comparable sentence reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">Because Washington was held accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base when he was sentenced, his guidelines computation did not change following Amendment 706, and his sentencing range was not lowered. <em>See </em>Amend. 706; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1). With respect to his argument that he should now be able to challenge the drug quantity for which he was held responsible, a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion \u201cis not a second opportunity to present mitigating factors to the sentencing judge, nor is it a challenge to the appropriateness of the original sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995); <em>see </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(a)(3). Therefore, Washington was not entitled to have his sentencing guidelines range recalculated. <em>See Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 237-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-13\">Washington argues that guidelines section lB1.10(b)(2)(B) provides that if the original sentence imposed was below the guidelines range, a reduction comparably less than the amended range may be made. Because Washington\u2019s sentencing range was not lowered as a result of the amendment, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to make such a reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-14\">The denial of the motion is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b734-33\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
