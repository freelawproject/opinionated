After his original sentence was vacated on direct appeal, he was re-sentenced to 135 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release. Following amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines that lowered the offense levels for crack cocaine offenses, the district court granted a motion by Parker pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>ant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and reduced his sentence to 108 months of imprisonment, at the bottom of the amended guidelines range. Parker now appeals, challenging the limits on the distinct court\u2019s discretion set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 and arguing that the district court had the authority to impose an even lower sentence. The Government argues that the district court could not reduce Parker\u2019s sentence further.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Parker\u2019s arguments are foreclosed in light of our recent decision in <em>United Staten v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 236-39 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for </em>cert. <em>filed </em>(Sept. 21, 2009) (No. 09-6657). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b737-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
