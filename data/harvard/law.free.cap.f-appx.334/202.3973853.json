In determining the sentencing guidelines range, the probation officer noted that Harvey qualified as a career offender, which resulted in an offense level of 37 and a guidelines range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. Because the conspiracy conviction carried a statutory mandatory minimum of life imprisonment, however, the guidelines range became life. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). After the government informed the court of Harvey\u2019s substantial assistance and moved for a reduction in sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, the court sentenced Harvey to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment. Harvey did not file a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">Harvey subsequently moved for a reduction in sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(e) based on Amendment 706 to the sentencing guidelines, which reduced base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. The district court denied the motion on the ground that the amendment would not change Harvey\u2019s guideline range due to his status as a career offender. The court further stated that \u201cunder the facts and circumstances of this case 180 months is still the appropriate sentence.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-13\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion. However, where the issue presented involves a legal interpretation, our review is <em>de novo. </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1338-39 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations and citations removed).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-14\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce the sentence of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Where a defendant was sentenced as a career offender and not based on the amount of drugs involved, his sentence is not \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-15\">Moreover, where a statutory mandatory minimum sentence becomes the defendant\u2019s guideline range, any changes to the guideline range associated with the original offense do not affect that defendant\u2019s guideline range. <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1339-40. Accordingly, even where the defendant benefitted from a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion and ultimately received a sentence below the guideline range for his original cocaine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>offense, Amendment 706 does not entitled the defendant to \u00a7 3582 relief. <em>Id. </em>at 1340 \u2014 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Although Harvey acknowledges on appeal that his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), and <em>cert. denied, Moore v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), he contends that <em>Moore </em>was wrongly decided because this court misinterpreted \u00a7 3582\u2019s use of the terms \u201csentencing range\u201d and \u201capplicable category of offense committed.\u201d We disagree and are bound by decisions of our prior panels unless or until such decision is overruled by this court sitting <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court. <em>United States v. Steele, </em>147 F.3d 1316, 1317-18 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">Here, Harvey\u2019 guidelines range was determined by the statutory mandatory minimum. Therefore, Amendment 706 had no effect on his guideline range, and did not entitle him to relief under \u00a7 3582. Accordingly, Harvey\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by this court\u2019s decisions in <em>Moore </em>and Williams.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b232-12\">. To the extent Harvey's brief constitutes a petition for hearing <em>en banc, </em>it is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
