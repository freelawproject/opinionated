On appeal, Peterson concedes that her argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337 (11th Cir.2008), but in order to preserve her claim, she argues that <em>Williams </em>was wrongly decided. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-10\">We conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of issues of legal interpretation in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context. <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1338-39. We are bound to follow our prior binding precedent \u201cunless and until it is overruled by this [C]ourt <em>en bane </em>or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-11\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). However, when a defendant is subject to a statutory mandatory minimum that replaces her guideline range, that defendant is ineligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706. <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1338-39, 1342. This ineligibility is not rectified by a downward departure below the statutory minimum, when that departure is made pursuant to a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 substantial assistance motion. <em>Id. </em>at 1342.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-12\">Because Peterson was subject to a mandatory minimum term of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, Amendment 706 did not change her guideline range, even though she ultimately received a \u00a7 5K1.1 downward departure and was sentenced to 75 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See id. </em>As a result, under <em>Williams, </em>Peterson was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. <em>See id. </em>Moreover, Peterson\u2019s argument that <em>Williams </em>was wrongly decided is misplaced at this stage of the appellate process because we ai\u2019e bound by our prior decision in <em>Williams. See Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d at 1236. Therefore, the district court lacked the authority to modify Peterson\u2019s sentence, and we affirm its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
