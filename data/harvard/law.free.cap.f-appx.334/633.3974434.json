The district court also made alternative findings regarding Davis\u2019s petition, determining that Davis\u2019s allegations were insufficient to support a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause and that Davis was not entitled to injunctive relief under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Although Davis challenges the district court\u2019s alternative findings, he has failed to challenge the district court\u2019s primary determination that his \u00a7 2241 petition was repetitious. Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Failure to identify an error in the district court\u2019s analysis is the same as if Davis had not appealed the judgment. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">This court may affirm the district court's denial of relief on any ground supported by the record. <em>See Scott v. Johnson, </em>227 F.3d 260, 262 (5th Cir.2000). Because Davis has failed to challenge the district court's determination that his petition was repetitious, Davis is not entitled to relief. <em>See Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748; <em>Scott, </em>227 F.3d at 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b662-8\"> Pursuant to 5tu Cut. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
