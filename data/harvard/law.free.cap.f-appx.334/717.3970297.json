He argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the illegal reentry guidelines double count a defendant\u2019s criminal record, resulting in a sentencing range that is greater than necessary to meet the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He also argues that this court should not afford his sentence a presumption of reasonableness because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based. He contends that his sentence failed to reflect that he had no prior immigration convictions, that he did not realize he faced such a high sentence, that the longest sentence he had served was three years, and that he reentered this country to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-22\">Serrano-Meza\u2019s challenge to the presumption of reasonableness is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>2009 WL 3162196 (Oct. 5, 2009); <em>see also United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>2009 WL 1849974 (Oct. 5, 2009). We have also rejected the argument that using a prior conviction to increase the offense level and in calculating criminal history is impermissible \u201cdouble counting.\u201d <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number><em>United States v. Calbat, </em>266 F.3d 358, 364 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Serrano-Meza has not rebutted the presumption that the district court sentenced him to a reasonable, properly calculated within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554-55 (5th Cir.2006). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b745-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
