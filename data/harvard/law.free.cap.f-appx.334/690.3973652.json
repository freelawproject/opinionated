His argument is based on the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). As he properly concedes, his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Gamez-Gonzalez, </em>319 F.3d 695, 699-700 (5th Cir.2003). He raises it here solely to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-19\">Medrano also appeals the district court\u2019s revocation of his supervised release for his prior conviction of possession with intent to distribute marijuana. He argues that the district court based its revocation sentence solely on his jury-trial conviction of possession with intent to distribute and conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute. He reiterates that this conviction was invalid under <em>Apprendi </em>and asserts that the basis for the district court\u2019s revocation sentence therefore was improper. He argues that remand is appropriate to permit the district court to reconsider and clarify its revocation sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-20\">As detailed above, Medrano\u2019s jury-trial conviction was validly obtained. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>The Government was not required under this court\u2019s precedent to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Medrano knowingly possessed more than 100 kilograms of marijuana. Therefore, because there is no basis upon which to vacate Medrano\u2019s jury-trial conviction and sentence, there are no grounds upon which to conclude that the revocation sentence was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgments are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b719-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
