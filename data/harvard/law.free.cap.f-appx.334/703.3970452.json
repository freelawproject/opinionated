We DENY the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">Esmaili, who was a lawful permanent resident, was convicted in state court of marijuana possession on two separate occasions \u2014 April 4, 2001 and February 6, 2007. Thereafter, he was convicted in state court of possession of cocaine on August 8, 2008, following an April 8, 2008 arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">The IJ found that the August 2008 conviction was a controlled substance violation, and the BIA affirmed. The IJ also found that Esmaili was ineligible for relief from removal because he was convicted of the equivalent of an aggravated felony. As to the latter determination, the IJ placed the burden of proof on Esmaili. The BIA, relying upon its decision in <em>In the Matter of Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>24 I &amp; N Dec. 382 (BIA 2007), similarly affirmed this finding and holding. The BIA in <em>Car-achuri-Rosendo </em>concluded that, under our precedent, a second drug possession offense committed after a first drug possession offense was final is the equivalent of an aggravated felony under federal law, even if no recidivist prosecution was conducted in state court. <em>Cf. </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B) &amp; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-15\">In his appeal to our court, Esmaili relied entirely upon the fact that the BIA\u2019s decision in <em>Carachuri-Rosendo </em>was on appeal to this court and might be reversed. However, after Esmaili filed his opening brief (but before the deadline for the Government\u2019s brief and Esmaili\u2019s reply), we affirmed our prior precedent in <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>570 F.3d 263, 268 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>78 U.S.L.W. 3058 (U.S. Jul. 15, 2009)(No. 09-60). Esmaili has made no argument in this case that survives our holding in that case. Accordingly, we are bound by prior precedent to deny Esmaili\u2019s petition for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Review DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b732-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b732-12\">. The question of whether an offense constitutes an \"aggravated felony\u201d under the immigration laws is a question of law over which we have jurisdiction. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) &amp; (D). However, tire Government argues that we lack jurisdiction over this case because Esmaili does not have a \"colorable\u201d question of law concerning his conviction. Although we conclude that Es-maili\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by our precedent, we do not find his arguments so frivolous that they deprive us of our jurisdiction over questions of law, such as this one. Unlike the case cited by the <em>Government </em>\u2014 Mar<em>quez-Marquez v. Gonzales, </em>455 F.3d 548, 561 (5th Cir.2006) \u2014 Esmaili does not challenge a discretionary determination. His challenge is solely to the question of whether his convictions <em>preclude </em>the exercise of discretion. We conclude that we have jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
