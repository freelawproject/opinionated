After thorough review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-15\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the Board adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, the BIA agreed with the reasoning of the IJ. Accordingly, we will discuss both decisions. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-16\">To the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir.2001). We review the BIA\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial-evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84 (quotation omitted). The substantial evidence test is \u201cdeferential\u201d and does not allow \u201cre-weigh[ing] the evidence from scratch.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. Office of U.S. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number><em>Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation omitted). \u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">First, we reject petitioners\u2019 argument that substantial evidence does not support the denial of Seriani\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal. An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(a)(1), 1231(b)(3)(A). The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). In order to meet this burden, \u201cthe applicant must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground or (2) a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1256 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cDemonstrating such a connection requires the alien to present specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be singled out for persecution\u201d on account of a statutorily protected ground. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">An alien seeking withholding of removal must show that it is more likely than not that she will be persecuted or tortured upon being returned to her country. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1232 (11th Cir.2005). This standard is more stringent than the standard for asylum. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, an alien who fails to establish eligibility for asylum generally cannot satisfy the higher burden for withholding of removal. <em>Id. </em>at 1232-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">The alien\u2019s testimony, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof for asylum or withholding of removal without corroboration. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(a), 208.16(b); <em>De Santamaria v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1012 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cThe weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony, however, the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). In <em>In re S-M-J-, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 722 (BIA 1997) <em>(en </em>banc), the BIA held that, where the record contains general country condition information and the claim of an asylum applicant relies primarily on personal experiences not reasonably subject to verification, corroborating documentary evidence of the applicant\u2019s particular experience is not required, but where it is reasonable to expect such corroborating evidence for certain alleged facts pertaining to the specifics of an applicant\u2019s claim, the evidence should be provided or an explanation should be given as to why the information was not presented. <em>Id. </em>at 725. The failure to provide such corroborating evidence informs the determination of whether credible testimony meets the burden of proof. <em>Id. </em>at 725-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">As an initial matter, petitioners\u2019 argument that the BIA dismissed their petition on considerations relevant to an adverse credibility finding is without merit, since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the BIA explicitly found that the IJ made no adverse credibility finding and denied relief because Seriani failed to satisfy her burden of proof by not producing sufficient corroborating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">As to the merits of Seriani\u2019s claim, the IJ\u2019s decision to deny relief, affirmed by the BIA, is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. Although the IJ and the BIA did not find Seriani incredible, they found her testimony to be weak, given its vague and confusing nature. <em>See Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1201. Because Seriani could offer no explanation of the month-long treatment she received from an Albanian doctor or more details concerning her 2003 speech, as the IJ noted, the record does not compel a different finding. <em>See Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Moreover, on this record, corroborative evidence was needed. <em>See Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1201. The corroborating evidence produced by Seriani included (1) a copy of Seriani\u2019s Democratic Party of Albania (\u201cDP\u201d) membership card; (2) a letter from her father, Agron Kroi, stating that Seria-ni had been beaten and mistreated in a police station where he was being held after the October 1, 2000, election; (3) a letter from a family friend indicating that Seriani and her husband Artan had received shelter in his home after fleeing to a different city; (4) a doctor\u2019s letter indicating that Seriani had received a medical examination because she was hemorrhaging and had hematoma on areas of her body; and (5) Seriani\u2019s obstetrical and gynecological records concerning the 2005 birth of her son. The IJ and the BIA found this evidence to be lacking because no document made reference to Seriani\u2019s abduction or sexual assault, a fact central to her claim, and the evidence did not include documentation from the DP.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The IJ also noted that the Country Profile for 2001 called into question claims for asylum based on political persecution, as well as the reliability of Albanian medical evidence. Given Seriani\u2019s extensive involvement in the DP, the widespread recognition of her family\u2019s opposition to communism, the particularity of her claim, and the additional time she was provided in which to obtain supporting documents, it was not unreasonable to expect her to provide more meaningful corroboration. <em>See In re S-M-J- </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 724-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">While Seriani explained that her obstetrical records made no reference to her sexual assault because she was too embarrassed to discuss the incident in the presence of her friend and interpreter, she offered no explanation for the insufficien-cies in the Albanian doctor\u2019s letter or the absence of corroborating evidence from the DP. <em>See id. </em>at 725. Also, it is notable that Seriani\u2019s husband was present during the hearing and did not testify, although he had witnessed Seriani\u2019s condition after the rape and took her to see the Albanian doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Because Seriani could have obtained additional corroborative evidence, including medical records attesting to her rape and documentation from the DP attesting to her active participation in the party, the record does not compel a different conclusion than that reached by the IJ and the BIA. <em>See Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. Thus, the IJ did not err by requiring Seriani to produce additional corroborating evidence in order to sustain her burden of proof for her asylum claim. <em>See id.; In re S-M-J-, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 724-25. And because Seriani failed to satisfy her burden of proof for asylum, she necessarily failed to satisfy the higher burden for withholding of removal. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Lastly, we agree with the government\u2019s claim that petitioners have abandoned their opportunity to challenge the denial of CAT relief because they offer no argument in support of their statement that they are challenging the denial of CAT protection. When a party fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned. <em>See id. </em>at 1228 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">In their brief, petitioners identify proper consideration of CAT as an issue on appeal and provide law on CAT. However, they do not advance an argument on the matter. Because petitioners fail to offer any argument in support of their identification of CAT relief as an issue on appeal, they have abandoned the issue, and we deny their petition in this regard. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-12\">. Upon their arrival in the United States, Ser-iani requested asylum and/or withholding of removal under CAT, and Artan requested derivative relief as Seriani's spouse.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
