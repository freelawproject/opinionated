Mackey appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his pro se 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights complaint in.which he alleged that the defendants conspired to have him falsely arrested and convicted on drug charges. Mackey was on parole following his 15-year sentence for delivery of a controlled substance at the time he filed the instant \u00a7 1983 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">The district court determined that Mackey\u2019s claims were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), because Mackey had failed to satisfy the favorable termination requirement enunciated in <em>Heck. </em>Although Mackey asserts that the district court\u2019s decision was \u201cerroneous\u201d and that he should be granted an eviden-tiary hearing, Mackey does not discuss how the district court\u2019s determination was erroneous nor. does he challenge the district court\u2019s determination that he failed to satisfy the <em>Heck </em>requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-14\">This court will not raise and discuss legal issues that an appellant has failed to assert. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987); <em>see Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995) (emphasizing that although pro se briefs are construed liberally, pro se parties must still brief the issues and reasonably comply with Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)). Issues not adequately argued in the body of the brief are deemed abandoned. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). By failing to challenge the district court\u2019s determination or to identify any error in the district court\u2019s order regarding his claims for relief, Mackey has abandoned his claims on appeal. <em>See id.; Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748 (noting that the failure to identify any error in the court\u2019s analysis is the same as if the appellant had not appealed the judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-15\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b664-10\"> Pursuant to 5th <em>Cut </em>R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
