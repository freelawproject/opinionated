He argues, for the first time on appeal, that his sentence should be vacated because the district court failed to comply with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(i)(l)(A) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">Generally, this court uses a bifurcated approach to review sentences for reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Because Simon failed to raise these arguments in the district court, however, review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Esparza-Gonzalez, </em>268 F.3d 272, 274 (5th Cir.2001). A plain error is a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, - L.Ed.2d - (2009). Where those elements are shown, this court has the discretion to correct the error, but only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-15\">The district court imposed the statutorily-mandated minimum sentence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 924(e). Simon has not demonstrated how any of the alleged errors could have resulted in a different sentence. <em>See Mon-dragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 361. Accordingly, he has not demonstrated reversible plain error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b734-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
