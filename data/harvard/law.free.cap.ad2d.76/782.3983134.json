Griffith, J.), rendered December 16, 2008. The judgment convicted defendant, upon a jury verdict, of promoting prison contraband in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">Memorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him upon a jury verdict of promoting prison contraband in the first degree (Penal Law \u00a7 205.25 [2]). Contrary to the contention of defendant, County Court did not err in refusing to suppress his statement to a police investigator. The testimony of defendant at the suppression hearing that the statement was coerced by correction officers and thus was not voluntary presented a credibility issue that the suppression court was entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>to resolve against defendant <em>(see People v Collins, </em>302 AD2d 958 [2003], <em>lv denied </em>99 NY2d 653 [2003]). Here, \u201c[t]he testimony of the [investigator] . . . supports the court\u2019s determination that defendant\u2019s statement ] [was] preceded by <em>Miranda </em>warnings and voluntarily made by defendant, without any promises, threats, or coercion on the part of [the correction officers]\u201d <em>(People v Pennick, </em>2 AD3d 1427, 1428 [2003], <em>lv denied </em>1 NY3d 632 [2004]).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s further contention, viewing the evidence in light of the elements of the crime as charged to the jury <em>(see People v Danielson, </em>9 NY3d 342, 349 [2007]), we conclude that the verdict is not against the weight of the evidence <em>(see People v Livingston, </em>262 AD2d 786, 787-788 [1999], <em>lv denied </em>94 NY2d 881 [2000]; <em>see generally People v Bleakley, </em>69 NY2d 490, 495 [1987]). Defendant preserved for our review his contention that he was denied a fair trial based on prosecutorial misconduct on summation only with respect to two of the prosecutor\u2019s comments <em>(see </em>CPL 470.05 [2]). In any event, that contention is without merit inasmuch as all of the prosecutor\u2019s allegedly improper comments were either a fair response to defense counsel\u2019s summation or fair comment on the evidence <em>(see People v Anderson, </em>52 AD3d 1320, 1321 [2008], <em>lv denied </em>11 NY3d 733 [2008]).
