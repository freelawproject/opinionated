Following a final revocation hearing, an Administrative Law Judge found that a parole violation had been established and imposed a 30-month delinquent time assessment. When petitioner did not receive a timely response to his administrative appeal, he commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding.</p><p id=\"b1176-9\">We confirm. It is well settled that \u201c \u2018a determination to revoke parole will be confirmed if the procedural requirements were followed and there is evidence which, if credited, would support such determination\u2019 \u201d <em>(Matter of Hurd v New York State Div. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number><em>Parole, </em>72 AD3d 1388, 1388 [2010], <em>lv denied </em>15 NY3d 705 [2010], quoting <em>Matter of Layne v New York State Bd. of Parole, 256 </em>AD2d 990 [1998], <em>lv dismissed </em>93 NY2d 886 [1999]). Here, the police officers who arrested petitioner testified at the hearing that when they approached petitioner, he began to ran and a foot-pursuit ensued. During the chase, petitioner kept his right hand in his jacket pocket until he tripped when he attempted to jump over a bush. Petitioner was then apprehended and a loaded revolver was discovered under the bush. In light of this testimony, we find that the evidence supports the determination that petitioner possessed a loaded weapon in violation of the conditions of his parole. Any inconsistencies in the testimonies of the arresting officers presented a credibility issue for the Administrative Law Judge to resolve <em>(see Matter of Hurd v New York State Div. of Parole, </em>72 AD3d at 1388; <em>Matter of Simpson v Alexander, </em>63 AD3d 1495, 1496 [2009]).</p><p id=\"b1177-4\">We have examined petitioner\u2019s remaining contentions and find them to be without merit.</p><p id=\"b1177-5\">Cardona, P.J., Mercure, Rose, Lahtinen and Stein, JJ., concur. Adjudged that the determination is confirmed, without costs, and petition dismissed.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
