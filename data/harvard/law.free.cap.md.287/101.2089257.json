These include that there shall be no tax applicable \u201cto the initial transfer of property on which there is new construction or on which major betterments have been constructed subsequent to the date of finality immediately preceding the date of recognition,\u201d transfers by certain nonprofit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>organizations, and other exemptions not relevant to our discussion here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The act further provided that the transferor of property subject to the tax was \u201csolely liable for the payment of the tax\u201d; that it should \u201cbe paid at the time of or prior to the presentation of any instrument to the County Supervisor of Assessments for transfer ... on the assessment records of the County\u201d; and that in the case of a transfer of an interest in real property \u201cwhich is not required by law or ordinance to be transferred on the assessment records of the County, the tax shall be paid before any instrument conveying such interest shall be presented to the Clerk of the Circuit Court for recordation.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Further provision was made for appraisal by the Director of Finance if he had reason to believe that the consideration had been incorrectly stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Appellants John C. Walker Realty Corp. and Edward W. Schultz had sold property said to be subject to the tax. Montgomery County Board of Realtors, Inc., owns real property in Montgomery County. Also, in the bill of complaint brought by it, Walker and Schultz, it is said that it \u201crepresents over 8,500 real estate brokers and sales persons in Montgomery County ....\u201d The three filed a suit praying that the statute in question might \u201cbe declared illegal, unconstitutional and void\u201d and that the County might be directed to refund the monies previously paid by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>The contentions of the parties were summed up by the chancellor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-4\">Plaintiffs in asking the Court to declare Section 52-16C unconstitutional claim:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\">1. That the law imposes an additional property tax at the time of transfer of certain properties and that it is therefore a property tax and as such violates the uniformity provision of Article 15 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">2. That the Act is in violation of State law regulating real property assessments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">8. That alternatively, if the Act is deemed to impose a transfer tax it is invalid because there are specific provisions elsewhere in the Montgomery County Code governing imposition of transfer taxes, which provisions were not here complied with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">4. That alternatively, if the Act is held to impose neither a property tax nor a transfer tax, the tax imposed would amount to an illegal and arbitrary excise tax.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-9\">The defendant, Montgomery County, contends that the Act imposes an excise tax (other than a transfer tax) and that said tax is not arbitrary under constitutional standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">He concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-11\">In brief, we find the tax imposed is an excise. We agree with defendant that it imposes a tax on \"windfall\u201d profits. As such, we think it meets the expanded definition of an excise as discussed in <em>Weaver v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>281 Md. 349, where the Court at page 357 said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-12\">\u201cMore recently, courts have employed a more expanded definition. In <em>Continental Motors Corp. v. Township of Muskegon, </em>376 Mich. 170, 135 N.W.2d 908, 911 (1965), an excise was defined as \u2018a tax imposed upon the performance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>of an act, the engaging in an occupation, or the enjoyment of a privilege.\u2019 <em>Accord, Village of Lombard v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., </em>405 Ill. 209, 90 N.E.2d 105, 108 (1950); <em>Callaway v. City of Overland Park, </em>211 Kan. 646, 508 P.2d 902, 907 (1973). Indeed, an excise is said to embrace every form of taxation that is not a burden directly imposed on persons or property. <em>Gila Meat Co. v. State, </em>35 Ariz. 194, 276 P. 1, 2 (1929); <em>City of Glendale v. Trondsen, </em>48 Cal. 2d 93, 308 P.2d 1, 7 (1957).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Thus, he declared the tax in question \u201cto be a constitutionally valid and enforcible Act of the County Council for Montgomery County..., enacted pursuant to its legislative powers.\u201d The appellants entered an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. We granted a writ of certiorari prior to hearing in that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Montgomery County is a \u201ccharter\u201d county, the first county in the State (as distinguished from Baltimore City) to invoke the provisions of Maryland Constitution Art. XI-A relative to home rule. Art. XI-A, \u00a7 2 provides that the General Assembly \u201cshall by public general law provide a grant of express powers for such County or Counties as may thereafter form a charter\u201d and that such powers \u201cshall not be enlarged or extended by any charter formed under the provisions of th[at] Article, but such powers may be extended, modified, amended or repealed by the General Assembly.\u201d By Art. XI-A, \u00a7 3 the County Council of Montgomery County has \u201cfull power to enact local laws of said ... County including the power to repeal or amend local laws of said ... County enacted by the General Assembly, upon all matters covered by the express powers granted,\u201d with certain limitations not here applicable, except for the provision \u201cthat in case of any conflict between said local law and any Public General Law ... the Public General Law shall control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">Maryland Code (1957, 1973 Repl. Vol., 1979 Cum. Supp.) Art. 25A, \u00a7 5 (O), a part of the Express Powers Act, grants all home rule counties the power to levy a property tax. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>appears to grant no general taxing power. See <em>Mont. Co. v. Md Soft Drink Ass\u2019n, </em>281 Md. 116, 129-30, 377 A.2d 486 (1977). The County claims its power to enact this taxing statute is derived from Chapter 808 of the Acts of 1963 which authorizes the County Council for Montgomery County \u201cto have and exercise, within the limits of the county, in addition to any and all taxing powers [t]heretofore granted by the General Assembly, the power to tax to the same extent as the state has or could exercise said power within the limits of the county as a part of its general taxing power,\u201d with certain limitations, one of which we shall hereafter mention relative to income taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">The tax with which we are here involved has earmarks of a property tax but does not completely coincide with the definitions of a property tax set forth by Judge Levine for the Court in <em>Weaver v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>281 Md. 349, 357, 379 A.2d 399 (1977). Admittedly it is difficult to draw a distinction between a property tax and an excise tax. <em>Id </em>353-65. In the view which we take of this case, however, we do not believe it is necessary to catalog this tax as a particular type of tax. This is because Constitution Article XI-A, \u00a7 3 provides, \u201cthat in case of any conflict between said local law and any Public General Law... the Public General Law shall control.\u201d We point out, however, that if this tax could properly be held to be one upon \u201c \u2018windfall\u2019 profits,\u201d as held by the chancellor and at least suggested by the County, then it would be ineffective since Chapter 808 of the Acts of 1963 in granting powers to Montgomery County stated specifically \u201cthat the Council shall not have the power to impose any tax ... upon the subject matter of ... Code ... [(1957)] ... Sections 279 to 323 of Article 81 (Tax on Incomes)____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Code (1957, 1975 Repl. Vol.) Art. 81 provides a detailed scheme for the assessment and levy of taxes. Under \u00a7 13 (a) \u201c[e]xcept as in th[at] section otherwise provided, all property, real or personal, subject to ordinary taxation under th[at] article, [is to] be valued and assessed for purposes of State and county ... taxation by the supervisors of assessment of the county ... in which the same shall be subject to taxation [under Art. 81].\u201d This includes real property. The method of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>assessments is set forth in \u00a7 14 and elaborated upon in \u00a7 19 which states in greater detail the methods for assessing real estate. Section 29 provides for notice as to assessments and \u00a7 29A sets forth the date of finality. The tax levy for each year is to be made as of the date of finality \u201cor semiannual date of finality provided for in \u00a7 2 (20) of [Art. 81].\u201d Section 31 (b). This levy is to be before the beginning of the tax year. Section 32. In <em>Baltimore C. &amp; A. Ry. v. Wicomico County, </em>93 Md. 113, 48 A. 853 (1901), the Court held invalid an attempt to levy retroactively for each of three prior years on the ground the county had been given only annual taxing power. Provision is made in \u00a7 34, however, for taxation of \u201cescaped\u201d property. Judge Eldridge said for the Court in <em>Grosvenor v. Supervisor of Assess., </em>271 Md. 232, 315 A.2d 758 (1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-4\">Where an assessment has actually been made and taxes paid on property, such property has not \u201cescaped\u201d assessment and taxation. It simply is not escaped or omitted property under the language of typical \u201cescaped property\u201d statutes. The language of these statutes reveals that they were not intended to authorize a retroactive <em>increase </em>in the assessment and taxation for prior years because of an asserted mistake in valuation, or some other alleged mistake. On the other hand, where property has not been assessed and taxed at all for the years in question, the courts have regularly held that escaped property statutes apply, regardless of whether the property was known or not. <em>[Id. </em>at 241 (emphasis in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Sections 38 and 39 provide for review by supervisors of assessment of the respective counties \u201ceffective for the succeeding levy\u201d for the purpose of correcting any errors in value or otherwise that may have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Art. 81, \u00a7 233 establishes the method for appointment of supervisors of assessment in each county. Section 234 says that they shall \u201chave general supervision over the assessment of all property in the county... for which they are appointed. They shall use all due diligence in listing escaped and new property and shall cooperate with appropriate county ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>officials or other assessing authorities in obtaining fair and equitable assessments, and have power to appeal to the Maryland Tax Court from any assessments or rulings which the supervisors consider improper when made by the property tax assessment appeal board in the counties ....\u201d It further states, \u201cThey shall visit each district of the county ... for which they are appointed at frequent intervals, obtaining all necessary data and information as to the valuation and existence of property subject to taxation, keep posted on sales in the county, with conditions attending these sales, and report the sales and the consideration involved to the State Department of Assessments and Taxation.\u201d Then \u00a7 234A goes on to provide that if any assessment is adjusted by a property tax assessment appeal board, the Maryland Tax Court, or any court, then \u201cthe assessor, in making the assessment for the succeeding taxable year, shall give due consideration to the reasons for the valuation determined by the adjusted assessment.\u201d The State Department of Assessments and Taxation is required by \u00a7 244 from time to time to \u201cformulate a uniform plan for the assessment of property, which shall be followed strictly by the property tax assessment appeal boards and by all assessors, for all subsequent reassessments and reviewals of assessments authorized by th[at] article.\u201d All supervisors are State employees. Section 246B (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">Provision is made in \u00a7\u00a7 255 and 256 for hearings before the supervisor of assessments and the Maryland Tax Court of those who feel aggrieved by any assessment. This specifically includes a county. <em>County Exec. v. Supervisor, </em>275 Md. 392, 340 A.2d 246 (1975), and <em>County Council v. Supervisor, </em>274 Md. 116, 332 A.2d 897 (1975). Thus, Montgomery County is not without remedies in any situation in which it believes the supervisor of assessments has undervalued any given property for tax purposes. We add that Montgomery County has not hesitated in the past to pursue such a remedy even as far as this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">This attempt by Montgomery County to reassess and tax real property after the date of finality is in direct conflict with the provision of Art. 81 relative to the date of finality and the process to be followed where an erroneous assessment is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>made. Despite the wording of the statute, its effect is to move forward the date of finality as to sales made after that date. On the basis of an actual sale subsequent to the date of finality the County seeks to second guess the State\u2019s expert appraisers in the office of the Montgomery County Supervisor of Assessments and thus to make a retroactive reassessment. As a matter of fact, a sale during the year at a price in excess of the value placed on the property at the time of assessment does not necessarily indicate erroneous valuation. First of all, we have commented on several occasions that valuation of land is not an exact science and that experts will often differ as to their opinion of fair market value. See, <em>e.g., Supervisor v. Southgate Harbor, </em>279 Md. 586, 592, 369 A.2d 1053 (1977); <em>Fairchild Hiller v. Supervisor, </em>267 Md. 519, 521, 298 A.2d 148 (1973); and <em>Weil v. Supervisor of Assess., </em>266 Md. 238, 254, 292 A.2d 68 (1972). Secondly, although assessments are as of the date of finality, the valuation upon which the assessment is based is necessarily made some time in advance of that date. A number of factors could occur even between the date of finality and the date of ultimate sale which would alter property values. An example of a reverse change in such values is the current report in the public press that real estate values have dropped substanti\u00e1lly in recent months as a result of high mortgage interest rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Because the scheme of taxation here is in direct conflict with Art. 81, the County Council was without power to enact it. There is yet another reason why the County was without power to enact this tax. That is that a county may not enter into a field which the State has occupied and preempted as here. <em>McCarthy v. Bd. of Education of A.A. Co., </em>280 Md. 634, 374 A.2d 1135 (1977), and <em>County Council v. Montgomery Ass\u2019n, </em>274 Md. 52, 333 A.2d 596 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed; appellee to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b126-6\">. The act states that the tax \u201cshall not apply to transfers of land assessed as agricultural land, under Section 52-21 (d) of the Montgomery County Code 1972, as amended; nor to transfers of land classified as rezoned if said transfers are taxed under Section 52-21 (e) of the Montgomery County Code 1972, as amended____\u201d Sections 52-21 (d) and 52-21 (e) of the Montgomery County Code impose a transfer tax on land previously zoned as agricultural and land which has been rezoned to a more intensive use at the instance of the transferor or transferee. That transfer tax was specifically authorized by Chapter 633 of the Acts of 1968. Its application-was before the Court in Rapley v. Montgomery County, 261 Md. 98, 274 A.2d 124 (1971), although in the posture of the case we were unable to reach the issue sought to be raised by the appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b126-9\">. Since July 1,1973, all supervisors of assessments have been employees of the State of Maryland. Code (1957, 1975 Repl. Vol.) Art. 81, \u00a7 246B (a). We are not to be understood here as in any way expressing an opinion as to whether the County Council of Montgomery County may validly make the payment of a tax a prerequisite to transfer on the assessment records by a State employee.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
