The subcontractor, on the 85th day after doing the work or furnishing the materials, mailed the notice to the owner in New Jersey by certified mail, return receipt requested. The notice was in fact received, but on the 92nd day. We hold that the notice here is effective under the mechanics\u2019 lien law, Maryland Code (1974, 1979 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 9-104 of the Real Property Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Appellant, Norman Riley, of Hazlet, New Jersey (\"Owner\u201d), was having a house built in Kent County by Brick Homes, Inc., as contractor. Appellee, Robert Abrams (\"Subcontractor\u201d), furnished and hung dry wall at Owner\u2019s house beginning June 15, 1978 and concluding June 28, 1978. On September 21, 1978 Subcontractor mailed to Owner a notice of intention to claim a mechanics\u2019 lien in the amount of $1,130.32. The notice was sent by certified mail. It was received on September 28,1978 as evidence by the return receipt. The petition to establish a mechanics\u2019 lien was filed December 8, 1978. Counsel narrowed the issues before the Circuit Court exclusively to whether the notice complied with Real Property Article, \u00a7 9-104. The trial court determined that the notice was effective and on July 19, 1979 entered a final order establishing the mechanics\u2019 lien.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Owner appealed and we granted certiorari prior to decision by the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">This case arises under the mechanics\u2019 lien law <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> enacted by Chapter 349 of the Acts of 1976 in response to <em>Barry </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number><em>Properties, Inc. v. Fick Brothers Roofing Co., </em>277 Md. 15, 353 A.2d 222 (1976). The statute provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">\u00a7 9-104. Notice to owner by subcontractor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">(a) <em>Notice required to entitle subcontractor to lien. </em>\u2014 A subcontractor is not entitled to a lien under this subtitle unless, within 90 days after doing the work or furnishing the materials, he gives written notice of his intention to claim a lien substantially in the form specified in subsection (b) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">(c) <em>Notice by mail or personal delivery. </em>\u2014 The notice is effective if given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or personally delivered to the owner by the claimant or his agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-9\">(i) <em>Payments by owner to contractor after notice. </em>\u2014 On receipt of notice given under this section, the owner maywithhold, from sums due the contractor, the amount the owner ascertains to be due the subcontractor giving the notice. If the subcontractor giving notice establishes a lien in accordance with this subtitle, the contractor shall receive only the difference between the amount due him and that due the subcontractor giving the notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">Section 9-105 (a)(1) addresses the petition to establish a lien, which</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">[S]hall set forth at least the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-12\">(v). If the petitioner is a subcontractor, facts showing that the notice required under \u00a7 9-104 of this subtitle was properly mailed or served upon the owner, or, if so authorized, posted on the building.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-13\">Here Owner points to the provision of \u00a7 9-104 (a) that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>there is no lien entitlement unless the subcontractor \"gives written notice\u201d which, Owner argues, requires receipt within the 90 day period. Owner relies on decisions of this Court arising under the mechanics\u2019 lien law before registered mail notice was specifically authorized. For example, <em>Jakenjo, Inc. v. Blizzard, </em>221 Md. 46, 155 A.2d 661 (1959) arose under Code (1957), Art. 63, \u00a7 11. There a registered mail notice receipted for within the 90 day period by the secretary of the resident agent of the corporate owner was held to be effective. We said that the \"statute only requires that the claimant 'give notice in writing\u2019, and it does not specify the mode or manner, so long as it reaches the owner or his duly authorized agent.\u201d 221 Md. at 50, 155 A.2d at 663. In <em>Bukowitz v. Maryland Lumber Co., </em>210 Md. 148, 122 A.2d 486 (1956), which arose under Code (1951), Art. 63, \u00a7 11, we held there was no proof of receipt of the notice by one of the owners and that \"[t]here is nothing in the statute that authorizes service by registered mail which does not actually reach the intended recipient.\u201d 210 Md. at 154, 122 A.2d at 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Subcontractor in the instant matter looks to \u00a7 9-104 (c), which authorizes registered mail notice, and refers to <em>Landover Assoc. v. Fabricated Steel Products, Inc., </em>35 Md. App. 673, 371 A.2d 1140, <em>cert. denied, </em>281 Md. 740 (1977) in which a \" 'legal presumption\u2019 \u201dof receipt from proof of proper mailing was applied to sustain admissibility of a return receipt bearing an illegible signature.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 681, 371 A.2d at 1145. Subcontractor reads <em>Landover Assoc, </em>as support for the proposition that mailing alone is consistent with the requirements of the mechanics\u2019 lien law.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Although we conclude that the notice by Subcontractor in this case does comply, it is for reasons which need not take us as far as Subcontractor\u2019s argument reaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">This Court has held, in one case arising under the Little <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Miller Act and in another decision dealing with claims against local governments, that the registered mail notice authorized by the statutes there applicable was effectively given if mailed within the prescribed time and received beyond it.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The Little Miller Act was involved in <em>Montgomery County ex rel. Carrier Corp. v. Glassman Constr. Co., </em>245 Md. 192, 225 A.2d 448 (1967). It provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">[A]ny person having direct contractual relationship with a subcontractor of the contractor... shall have a right of action upon the payment bond upon giving written notice to the contractor within ninety (90) days from the date on which such person did, or performed the last of the labor or furnished or supplied the last of the material for which such claim is made____Such notice shall be served by mailing the same by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, in an envelope addressed to the contractor at any place he maintains an office or conducts his business, or his residence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">A sub-subcontractor on a public school project mailed, by certified mail, a notice to the contractor on Friday or Saturday, the 89th or 90th day. The notice was received the following Monday. The trial court held that notice was too late. Judgment of dismissal was reversed. In an opinion by Judge Oppenheimer we reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-10\">The statute provides that a claimant shall have a right of action upon the bond \"upon giving written notice to the contractor within ninety (90) days from the date\u201d the last of the labor was performed or the last of the material furnished or supplied. It does not state that the contractor must receive the notice within the 90 days. The notice \"shall be served\u201d by mailing it by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-11\">We regard it as significant in the question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>statutory construction that the manner in which the notice is to be mailed is carefully set forth. Not only must postage be prepaid, but ordinary mail is not sufficient; the notice must be sent by registered or certified mail. The Legislature has eliminated claims of alleged oral notice as fulfilling the 90 day requirement and has provided, in effect, that receipt of the written notice by the contractor is essential to prove the mailing. These provisions do not, of themselves, answer the question of the legislative intent, but they may properly be taken as some evidence of an intent that, with the protection they give the contractor against unsupported claims of mailing, the mailing of the notice tolls the statutory period. [245 Md. at 201-02, 225 A.2d at 454.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">It was noted that two United States District Court decisions <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> under the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 270b (a), had held that its similar notice requirement is satisfied by a letter mailed on or before the 90th day, although not received by the contractor until after that day and that the same result was reached under a similar provision of the New Jersey mechanics\u2019 lien law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">In <em>Glassman, </em>we recognized that one of the parties involved must carry some risk of uncertainty and inconvenience, and tipped the scale in favor of the claimant. Thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-9\">It is true, as the appellees argue, that to hold the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>statute means that the claimant is protected if he mails notice, in the manner prescribed, within the 90 day period, means that the contractor, if he does not receive the notice within that period, will be placed in the position, for some period of time, of not knowing whether he may pay his subcontractor after the expiration of the period without fear of being bound by demands by sub-subcontractors, mailed earlier but arriving later. It is also true, however, that to hold the claimant\u2019s notice, to be effective, must be received by the general contractor within the 90 day period would mean that, in effect, the 90 day period so far as the claimant is concerned is whittled down, for he would have to mail his notice in ample time to ensure that the contractor, wherever he may be, will receive the letter before the 90 days has expired. Such a holding, in our judgment, would not be in accord with the liberal construction for the benefit of claimants which the statute envisages. [245 Md. at 204, 225 A.2d at 455.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The problem of a notice mailed within the statutory period but received beyond that period was again before this Court in <em>Grubbs v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>267 Md. 318, 297 A.2d 754 (1972). The statute<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> required notice to municipal corporations and certain counties in unliquidated claims for personal injury or property damage and provided that the notice \"shall be presented either in person or by registered mail.\u201d Notice was sent by registered mail on the last day of the statutory period and received the next day. We there found inapposite decisions<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> based upon statutes in Connecticut and Massachusetts, which required the giving of notice without prescribing the mode, and we regarded as the critical distinction \"the language contained in the Maryland statute, allowing for the registered mailing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>notice <em>...Id. </em>at 322, 297 A.2d at 756. It was noted that while a \"notice requirement generally imports receipt, a different construction may result where the statute provides for notice by registered mail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 323, 297 A.2d at 757. In reliance on <em>United States ex rel. Crowe v. Continental Cas. Co., supra, </em>and <em>Montgomery County ex rel. Carrier Corp. v. Glassman Constr. Co., supra, </em>a judgment entered on demurrer based on lack of timeliness was reversed. With respect to the alternative methods of notice specified for claims against local governments, which are methods also provided as alternatives in \u00a7 9-104(c) of the mechanics\u2019 lien law, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\">We conclude that when the Legislature provided that written notice of a claim under \u00a7 18 \"shall be presented <em>either </em>in person <em>or </em>by registered mail\u201d (emphasis added), it settled upon two alternative methods of giving notice: personal delivery of the written notice on or before the one-hundred-eightieth day or the mailing of written notice by registered mail on or before the one-hundred-eightieth day without regard, in the latter situation, to whether receipt occurs before or after the expiration of one hundred eighty days following the injury. Since the latter method of \"notice\u201d was followed here in compliance with \u00a7 18, the demurrer should have been overruled. [267 Md. at 325, 297 A.2d at 758.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">At the session of the General Assembly next following the decision in <em>Grubbs, </em>the mechanics\u2019 lien law was amended, as italicized, to read that the subcontractor \"shall give notice in writing, <em>which may include registered mail, </em>to such owner ....\u201d Ch. 305, Acts of 1972; Code (1957, 1973 Repl. Vol., 1973 Supp.), Art. 21, \u00a7 9-103 (a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Since the General Assembly is presumed to be acquainted with the prior decisions of this Court and to have acted accordingly, <em>Supervisor of Assessments of Anne Arundel County v. Southgate Harbor, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>279 Md. 586, 591-92, 369 A.2d 1053, 1056 (1977), the inclusion in the mechanics\u2019 lien law of registered mail as an expressly authorized manner of giving notice is strongly indicative of a legislative intent that a notice sent by registered mail within the statutory period complies even though receipt occurs beyond the statutory period.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">This indication is reinforced by events at the 1974 legislative session. Senate Bill 200 was the Code Revision Commission proposed Real Property Article. As introduced \u00a7 9-103 (a), the mechanics\u2019 lien general notice section, did not contain the language added by the 1973 amendment, <em>i.e., </em>\"which may include registered mail.\u201d The Revisor\u2019s Note to \u00a7 9-103 in the First Reader copy did not specifically refer to this change but stated that the \"only other changes are in style.\u201d Ch. 12 at 358-59, Acts of 1974. If registered mail notice is simply one form of notice in writing, its express inclusion could be viewed as unnecessary verbiage and its elimination as simply a change in style. However, the quoted language was inserted in the Bill in the course of passage. Ch. 12, \u00a7 9-103 (a), Acts of 1974. The insistence by the General Assembly on express reference to registered mail notice is entirely consistent with a legislative recognition that specific inclusion of that mode of giving notice effected legal results of the type recognized in <em>Grubbs, supra </em>and in <em>Glassman, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">In the substantial revision of the mechanics\u2019 lien law following <em>Barry Properties, supra, </em>effected by Chapter 349 of the Acts of 1976, the giving of written notice continues to be required by \u00a7 9-104 (a) of the Real Property Article. The language, \"which may include registered mail,\u201d was modified to that of \u00a7 9-104 (c), under which the \"notice is effective if given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested ....\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The 1976 Act also renumbered the Little Miller Act from \u00a7 9-112 to \u00a7 9-113 of the Real Property Article. Subsection 9-113(c) continues to require \"giving written notice\u201d which \"shall be served by mailing the same by registered ... mail, postage prepaid ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>The common object of the mechanics\u2019 lien law and of the Little Miller Act is the protection of those who furnish labor and materials in construction. <em>Peerless Insurance Co. v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs For Prince George\u2019s Co. ex rel. Ben Dyer Asso., </em>248 Md. 439, 442, 237 A.2d 15, 17 (1968); <em>Montgomery County ex rel. Carrier Corp. v. Glassman Constr. Co., supra, </em>245 Md. at 201, 255 A.2d at 448. Chapter 349 embraced both statutes. This Court had previously interpreted the registered mail notice provisions of the Little Miller Act to be satisfied by a notice mailed within the time period, which was received beyond that period. We believe the General Assembly intended that the registered mail provisions of the mechanics\u2019 lien law receive the same construction. We hold that a registered mail notice under \u00a7 9-104, sent within 90 days and received thereafter, is effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Since the notice from Subcontractor in this case was received by Owner, we do not reach the interpretation of Real Property Article, \u00a7 9-104 if it were found as a fact that the subcontractor\u2019s notice was mailed within the statutory period but was <em>not </em>received.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed; appellant to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b371-7\">. The final order also provided that the property be sold unless the mechanics\u2019 lien in the amount of $1,130.32, together with interest and costs, be paid on or before the 20th day of August, 1979. Subcontractor\u2019s Petition to Establish Lien contained a prayer for that relief. See Rule BG74.a.
