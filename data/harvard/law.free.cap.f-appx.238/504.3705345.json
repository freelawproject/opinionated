On appeal, Hurtado argues that his sentence was unreasonable, within the meaning of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">When reviewing a sentence imposed by the district court, we first ensure that the district court correctly calculated the Sentencing Guidelines range. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). We then review the sentence for reasonableness in light of the properly calculated range and the 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Martin, </em>455 F.3d 1227, 1237 (11th Cir.2006). Included among the \u00a7 3553(a) factors are (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (3) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (4) the need for deterrence; (5) the need to protect the public; (6) the Sentencing Guidelines range; and (7) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We review only the final sentence for reasonableness, rather than each individual decision made during the sentencing process. <em>Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1245. Reasonableness review is \u201cdeferential\u201d and \u201cthe party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The facts relevant to our reasonableness review are these. On December 1, 2005, Hurtado and three co-defendants were indicted for conspiring to possess a listed chemical with the intent to manufacture a controlled substance, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(c). Hurtado pled guilty and proceeded to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), sometime in November 2005, Hurtado, co-defendants Araeeli Payan-Morales and Fortino Salto-Salgado, and a confidential informant (\u201cCl\u201d) met in Florida and discussed the purchase of ephedrine, which is a methamphetamine precursor. At a subsequent meeting, Sal-to-Salgado introduced co-defendant Nebo Oriosegy to the Cl as his partner in the ephedrine venture and stated that they had $200,000 to pay for the ephedrine. Salto-Salgado had previously negotiated the purchase price of $50,000 per 25-kilo-gram container. About a week later, Sal-to-Salgado, Payan-Morales, and Hurtado met the Cl again and Salto-Salgado indicated that they had almost secured all of the funds necessary for the purchase. Three days later, on November 15, 2005, the Cl met with Salto-Salgado, PayanMorales, Oriosegy, and appellant Hurtado to complete the sale. Salto-Salgado told the Cl that the vehicle in which Oriosegy and Payan-Morales had traveled to the meeting contained $100,000 in cash. The vehicle subsequently was driven to a secure location, where $100,000 in cash was found under the front seat. As instructed by Salto-Salgado, at the secure location, two 25-kilogram canisters, which in actuality contained \u201csham\u201d ephedrine, were placed in the vehicle\u2019s trunk. All four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>defendants then left the secure location, with Oriosegy and Payan-Morales in the vehicle transporting the canisters and Sal-to-Salgado and Hurtado following in a different vehicle. As the defendants traveled toward Oriosegy\u2019s residence, they were stopped and arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recommended a base offense level of 38, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.ll(a), (d), because Hurtado\u2019s offense involved more than three kilograms of ephedrine, and a 3-level downward adjustment, under \u00a7\u00a7 3El.l(a), (b), because Hurtado accepted responsibility. With an adjusted offense level of 35 and a criminal history category IV, Hurtado faced an advisory Guidelines range of 235 to 293 months\u2019 imprisonment. Because the statutory maximum for Hurtado\u2019s offense was 240 months\u2019 imprisonment, his sentencing range was 235 to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Over Hurtado\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the PSI and found the Guidelines range to be 235 to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court then provided Hurtado with the opportunity to present mitigating evidence or argument. In response, defense counsel asked the court to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and to impose a 132-month sentence. The government contended that a sentence at the low end of the applicable Guidelines range was appropriate. The district court also considered Hurtado\u2019s statement apologizing for his actions. The court then indicated that it had considered the advisory guidelines and all of the \u00a7 3553 factors and sentenced Hurtado to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release, noting that the sentence imposed was \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary to comply -with the statutory purposes of sentencing,\u201d and stating that Hurtado was a source of poison \u201c[a]nd providing that for people in this country is destroying our country.\u201d The court indicated that Hurtado would be eventually deported and ordered him to forfeit all applicable assets and property, including $100,000 in U.S. currency. It also recommended that Hurtado receive secondary education in English and Spanish, be placed in a 500-hour substance-abuse counseling program, and receive vocational training in tailoring or auto body work. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">On appeal, Hurtado argues the district court inadequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, in light of the following mitigating circumstances: (1) Hurtado served only as an interpreter for co-conspirator Salto Salgado; (2) Hurtado had no role in the decisionmaking or negotiations for the ephedrine sales; (3) Hurtado was unaware of the amount of ephedrine or money involved; and (4) Hurtado neither handled any ephedrine nor was in the vehicle transporting the ephedrine or money. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">From our review of the record, with particular attention to the sentencing transcript, it is clear that the district court considered the Guidelines range, the calculation of which Hurtado does not challenge in this appeal, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, prior to imposing a within-range sentence. At the sentencing hearing, the district court rejected Hurtado\u2019s mitigating arguments that any role he played in the offense was minor and that a sentence of 132 months was appropriate, instead finding that he was a source of the poison that is destroying this country. Moreover, the court recommended that Hurtado receive secondary education in English and Spanish, be placed in a 500-hour substance abuse counseling program, and receive vocational training in tailoring or auto body work. On this record, Hurtado has not met his burden to establish that his sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>tence was unreasonable or greater than necessary to achieve the purposes of sentencing under \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b525-6\">. The government says that the defendant\u2019s given name is Orlando Gomez Soberanis. The parties refer to the defendant as Antonio Hurtado, and that is the name under which this defendant was indicted. In its brief, the government states that it has not yet amended the indictment to reflect Hurtado's given name. The judgment refers to the defendant as \"Antonio Hurtado, True Name: Orlando Gomez Soberanis.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
