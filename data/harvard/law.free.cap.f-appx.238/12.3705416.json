In his petition, Trejo argued that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) erred in not giving him credit on his federal sentence for time spent in state custody and also improperly determined that his federal sentence should run consecutively to his state sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-23\">In filing the IFP motion, Trejo is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5). When the district court certifies that an appeal is not taken in good faith, it is required under Rule 24(a) to \u201cset forth in writing the reasons for its certification.\u201d <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; Rule 24(a)(3). This court\u2019s inquiry into an appellant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore nonfrivolous).\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-24\">The district court failed to comply with <em>Baugh </em>since it neither provided reasons for certifying that Trejo\u2019s appeal was not taken in good faith, nor incorporated its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>decision on the merits of Trejo\u2019s petition. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; Rule 24(a)(3). Nevertheless, this court may dismiss the case sua sponte pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 42.2 if it is apparent that the appeal lacks merit. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Trejo is not entitled to credit on his federal sentence for the time he was in federal custody pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus prosequendum. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>753 F.2d 455, 456 (5th Cir.1985). Moreover, Trejo is not entitled to credit on his federal sentence because the time at issue was credited toward his state sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b). Additionally, the district court did not err by concluding that the federal sentence was to run consecutively to the state sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a); <em>Free v. Miles, </em>333 F.3d 550, 553 (5th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>920 F.2d 1212, 1217 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Trejo has failed to identify a nonfrivolous issue for appeal, and he has not shown that the district court erred in certifying that an appeal would not be taken in good faith. Accordingly, Trejo\u2019s motion to proceed IFP is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Trejo is warned that the submission of further frivolous pleadings, to this court or any other court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction, may subject him to sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b32-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
