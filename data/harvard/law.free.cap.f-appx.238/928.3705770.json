Veal seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. Our review of the docket sheet reveals that the district court since has filed its order adopting the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge, and granting in part Veal\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. Accordingly, because the district court has acted in Veal\u2019s case, we deny the mandamus petition as moot. We grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-14\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
