Echevarria raises three issues on appeal, which we address in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">Prior to trial, Echevarria moved to suppress evidence seized from his home and statements he made at the time of his arrest, explaining that Detective Philippe, the arresting officer, followed him into his trailer and conducted a warrantless search after observing him conduct a drug transaction. Echevarria contends the warrant-less search of his home was not justified because: (1) the police created the exigent circumstances used to justify the search; and (2) there was no evidence to support the belief by police officers that he would escape while a search warrant was obtained or that evidence was in danger of being destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">Warrantless searches and seizures inside a residence are presumptively unreasonable. <em>United States v. McGough, </em>412 F.3d 1232, 1237 (11th Cir.2005). The U.S. Supreme Court \u201chas crafted a few carefully drawn exceptions to the warrant requirement to cover situations where the public interest requirefs] some flexibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Holloway, </em>290 F.3d 1331, 1334 (11th Cir.2002) (quotations omitted). \u201cOne such exception is that the police may enter a private premises and conduct a search if \u2018exigent circumstances\u2019 mandate immediate action.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">The exigent circumstances doctrine encompasses situations where resort to a magistrate for a search warrant is not feasible or advisable, including, <em>inter alia: </em>(1) danger of flight or escape; (2) possibility of loss or destruction of evidence; and (3) hot pursuit of a fleeing suspect. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he exigent circumstance doctrine is particularly compelling in narcotics cases, because contraband ... can be easily and quickly destroyed while a search is progressing.\u201d <em>United States v. Young, </em>909 F.2d 442, 446 (11th Cir.1990). However, \u201cexigent circumstances will not justify warrantless entry if the exigency was created by those conducting the search.\u201d <em>United States v. McGregor, </em>31 F.3d 1067, 1069 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-14\">Construing the facts in a light most favorable to the Government, Philippe observed Echevarria conduct a drug transaction outside of the trailer, providing probable cause for an arrest, and he entered Echevarria\u2019s trailer while in hot pursuit of a fleeing suspect. <em>See United States v. Bervaldi </em>226 F.3d 1256, 1262 (11th Cir.2000) (stating all facts are construed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party in the district court). Furthermore, it was not unreasonable to conclude that, by switching the baggy of drugs between his hands while heading towards his trailer, Echevarria was attempting to hide the drugs, thereby suggesting the possible loss or destruction of evidence. Thus, at least two exigent circumstances existed, so that Philippe\u2019s entry and search of the trailer was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-15\">Additionally, Echevarria instigated the hot pursuit justifying Philippe\u2019s warrant-less entry, rather than Philippe and Detective Dorcely having created the exigent circumstances, because he first became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>aware of police presence and his impending arrest while he was outside of his trailer, and subsequently decided to walk quickly into his trailer. The fact Echevarria decided to flee into his trailer after having conducted a drug transaction and then observing the police, only made it more likely he would have destroyed the drugs or fled the area, which, in turn, made it more reasonable for Philippe to fear the destruction or removal of the evidence before a warrant could be secured. <em>See United States v. Tobin, </em>923 F.2d 1506, 1511 (11th Cir.1991). Accordingly, Echevarria\u2019s argument the police created the exigent circumstances is meritless.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude Philippe\u2019s entry into Echevarria\u2019s trailer to arrest him was valid, and the drugs and gun that were found were admissible. <em>See United States v. Zapata, </em>180 F.3d 1237, 1240 (11th Cir.1999) (stating, in reviewing a motion to suppress, that factual findings should be reviewed for clear error and the application of the law to the facts should be reviewed de novo.).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Furthermore, the conclusion that Philippe\u2019s entry was valid also means the incriminating statements made while in the patrol car were not \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d <em>See United States v. Perkins, </em>348 F.3d 965, 969 (11th Cir.2003). Thus, Echevarria\u2019s incriminating statements were also admissible, and the district court did not err in denying the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Echevarria next contends that, during the Government\u2019s case-in-chief, the district court improperly allowed Philippe to testify about whether, from his experience, the drugs seized from Echevarria were for distribution. He asserts by allowing this testimony, the court either improperly allowed Philippe to: (1) testify as an expert witness without the Government having informed him of such; or (2) offer a lay opinion based on specialized knowledge. Echevarria further argues this error was harmful because it was the only evidence before the jury that the drugs were for distribution, rather than for his own use.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">As an initial matter, any objection to Philippe\u2019s opinion was waived because although Echevarria objected to the foundation not being laid for Philippe as an expert on this matter, when the Government laid a foundation for the opinion, Echevarria never objected to the actual opinion. Thus, Echevarria\u2019s argument is reviewed for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Hansen, </em>262 F.3d 1217, 1233-34 (11th Cir.2001) (stating that absent an objection, we review the challenged evidence for plain error). Furthermore, it is unclear whether the district court admitted Philippe\u2019s opinion as an expert or lay opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">Opinion evidence offered by a lay witness is admissible when the opinion is \u201c(a) rationally based on the perception of the witness, (b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness\u2019 testimony or the determination of a fact in issue, and (c) not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 701. If the district court admitted Philippe\u2019s testimony as lay opinion, there was no error because his opinion was based on: (1) his personal observation of the number of baggies of drugs that Echevarria had at the time of his arrest; and (2) his past experience in making drug arrests, which demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>strated that drug users usually had only two to three baggies, whereas dealers usually had many more. <em>See Tampa Bay Shipbldg. &amp; Repair Co. v. Cedar Shipping Co., </em>320 F.3d 1213, 1223 (11th Cir.2003) (explaining that officers can testify as lay witnesses \u201cbased upon their particularized knowledge garnered from years of experience within the field\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">\u201c[A] witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion ... if (1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of rehable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 702. The government is required to give a defendant a \u201cwritten summary of any testimony that the government intends to use under Rule[ ] 702 ... during its case-in-chief at trial.\u201d Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Even if the district court admitted Philippe\u2019s testimony as expert opinion, without the Government having informed Echevarria of the basis of that opinion prior to trial, that error did not cause Echevarria actual prejudice. <em>See United States v. Chastain, </em>198 F.3d 1338, 1348 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201cViolations of Rule 16 will result in a reversal of conviction only if such a violation prejudices a defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d). Echevarria had the opportunity to cross-examine Philippe extensively regarding the basis of his opinion. Additionally, Echevarria provided no argument that he would have proffered the testimony of a rebuttal witness to establish the drugs were not packaged for distribution. Therefore, even if the district court erred by admitting Philippe\u2019s opinion as an expert opinion, the violation did not actually affect Echevarria.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Finally, Echevarria\u2019s argument Philippe\u2019s opinion should have been excluded because it was the only evidence proving the drugs were for distribution also is without merit. First, lay opinions are permitted even if they involve an ultimate issue in a case. Fed. R. Evid. 704(a). Secondly, expert witnesses are not prohibited from providing any opinions regarding the ultimate issue in a case, but, rather, opinions regarding \u201cwhether the defendant did or did not have the mental state or condition constituting an element of the crime charged.\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 704(b). Philippe\u2019s testimony was based on his personal observations and previous experience in making drug arrests, and the opinion did not relate to whether Echevarria had the mental state to distribute drugs, but whether they were packaged for distribution. Furthermore, Philippe\u2019s testimony was not the only evidence supporting Echevarria\u2019s conviction for distribution, as a juror reasonably could have inferred the drugs were for distribution based on the facts that: (1) a gun and cash were found with the drugs; (2) Philippe witnessed Echevarria distribute drugs to Hampton; and (3) Perez testified 66 baggies of drugs were found. Accordingly, the admission of Philippe\u2019s opinion was not plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">Echevarria\u2019s final argument is that his sentence is unreasonable. After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review sentences under the advisory Guidelines regime for unreasonableness. Following <em>Booker, </em>the district court first must correctly calculate the defendant\u2019s Guidelines range, then, using the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, the court can impose a more severe or more lenient sentence, as long as it is reasonable. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1179 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">The district court correctly calculated Echevarria\u2019s Guidelines range. The district court also took into account \u00a7 3553(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>factors, including: (1) Echevarria\u2019s history of distributing drugs; (2) the seriousness of the offense; (3) the need to promote respect for the law; (4) the need to provide just punishment; and (5) Echevarria\u2019s need of medical treatment, before arriving at a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, but we ordinarily expects such a sentence to be reasonable). We conclude Echevarria\u2019s 275-month sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The district court did not err in denying Echevarria\u2019s motion to suppress and did not plainly err in allowing Philippe to testify regarding whether the drugs seized from Echevarria were for distribution. Additionally, Echevarria\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b446-7\">. Echevarria's relies on <em>United States v. Tovar-Rico, </em>61 F.3d 1529 (11th Cir.1995) and <em>United States v. Santa, </em>236 F.3d 662 (11th Cir.2000) to argue Philippe and Dorcely created the exigent circumstances resulting in the warrantless entry of the trailer. This case is distinguishable from <em>Tovar-Rico </em>and <em>Santa </em>because Echevarria was outside of his trailer when the police made their presence known. In <em>Tovar-Rico </em>and <em>Santa, </em>however, the defendants were inside their apartments and completely unaware of police presence when the police entered their apartments. <em>Tovar-Rico, </em>61 F.3d at 1534; <em>Santa, </em>236 F.3d at 666.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
