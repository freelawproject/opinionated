Counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning whether the district court fully complied with the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. Although informed of his right to file a supplemental pro se brief, Solares has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-11\">Because Solares did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, his challenge to the adequacy of the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002) (holding that \u201cplain error analysis is the proper standard for review of forfeited error in the Rule 11 context\u201d). Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the district court fully complied with the mandate of Rule 11 in accepting Solares\u2019 guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-12\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
