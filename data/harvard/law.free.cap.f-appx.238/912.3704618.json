Carillo-Pineda now appeals. His attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising one claim but stating that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. Carillo-Pineda was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but did not file such a brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-12\">Carillo-Pineda\u2019s guilty plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered. Further, the record discloses compliance with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. There was a factual basis for the plea, and Carillo-Pineda readily admitted his guilt. We therefore affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-16\">Carillo-Pineda\u2019s probation officer assigned a base offense level of 8, <em>see U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2L1.1 (2003). Sixteen levels were added because Carillo-Pineda was deported after a conviction of a crime of violence. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2L1.2 (b)(1)(A)(ii). Three levels were subtracted for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3E1.1. His total offense level was 21, his criminal history category was II, and his advisory guideline range was 41-51 months. The district court sentenced him to forty-one months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-17\">Carillo-Pineda contends for the first time on appeal that his prior conviction in Texas for retaliation does not constitute a crime of violence as contemplated by USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Because he did not raise this claim below, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). To establish plain error, Carillo-Pineda must show that an error occurred, that it was plain, and that it affected his substantial rights. If Carillo-Pineda establishes plain error, we may recognize it or not, in our discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-18\">To determine if a crime is a crime of violence, a court generally looks only to the fact of the conviction and the statutory definition of the offense. <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). In cases where a predicate felony might be committed with or without the use, attempted use, or threatened use of force, a court must look to various approved sources to determine if the prior offense qualifies for an enhancement. <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 20, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b934-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>In Texas, retaliation does not necessarily involve the use of force against the person,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the district court therefore had to look beyond the fact of conviction and the relevant statute to decide if the enhancement was warranted. The district court applied the enhancement based on the description of the offense in the presentence report. That description appears to have been taken from a police report, a non-approved <em>Shepard </em>source. We decline to recognize this error, however, because Carillo-Pineda \u201ccannot show prejudice from a finding of fact, made in contravention of the Sixth Amendment, ... [that] would nevertheless have been found by the court in the absence of the error.\u201d <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>446 F.3d 522, 531 (4th Cir.2006). Had the district court relied on the indictment \u2014 an approved <em>Shepard </em>source \u2014 it would have found that the retaliation conviction constituted a crime of violence justifying the enhancement under USSG \u00a7 2L1.2 (b)(l)(A)(ii).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm. This court requires counsel to inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy of the motion was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately set forth in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b933-13\">.
