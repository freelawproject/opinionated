We dismiss the appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss and affirm for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-8\">1. The only proper defendant in a suit under the Federal Tort Claims Act is the United States. <em>Atorie Air, Inc., v. F.A.A. of U.S. Dept. of Transp., </em>942 F.2d 954, 957 (5th Cir.1991). Toledo did not bring suit against the United States. Thus, the district court properly dismissed the FTCA claims against the Bureau of Prisons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-9\">2. Toledo failed to state a <em>Bivens </em>claim against the defendants. To state a <em>Bivens </em>claim under the Eighth Amendment, Toledo must, at minimum, allege deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of his serious harm. <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 1977, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994); <em>Wilson v. Seiter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 297, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 2323, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991). There is no doctrine of respondeat superior in <em>Bivens </em>actions. <em>Cronn v. Buffington, </em>150 F.3d 538, 544 (5th Cir.1998). Thus, in order to be held liable, supervisory federal officials, such as those named in this suit, must be either be involved personally in the alleged deprivation, or must have implemented a policy \u201cso deficient that the policy itself acts as a deprivation of constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-14\">Toledo alleged only that the defendants \u201cknew or should have known\u201d of a substantial risk to Toledo\u2019s life based on the fact that Toledo\u2019s father was a police superintendent of the Puerto Rico Police Department; and that defendants \u201cknew or should have known\u201d that two prisoners wanted to injure or kill Toledo because it was \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d at the prison \u201cfrom early in the morning of the incident.\u201d Toledo alleges neither that the supervisory officials were personally involved in the incident, nor that they implemented a constitutionally deficient policy. At most, the alleged facts suggest a lack of due care, which \u201csimply does not approach the sort of abusive government conduct that the Due Process Clause was designed to prevent.\u201d <em>Davidson v. Cannon, </em>474 U.S. 344, 347-48, 106 S.Ct. 668, 670, 88 L.Ed.2d 677 (1986) (holding that the negligent failure of prison officials to protect a prisoner from another inmate did not amount to an Eighth Amendment violation).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-15\">3. Toledo never properly moved for leave to amend his complaint. <em>See </em>Local Rule 15.1. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to grant leave to amend.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-16\">The appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b31-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
