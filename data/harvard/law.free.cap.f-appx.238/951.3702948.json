We dismiss as frivolous No. 07-6191 and affirm No. 07-6240.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-23\">In No. 07-6191, the district court properly found there were no fees for which Mendez could seek reimbursement. In addition, despite Mendez\u2019s repeated efforts to have the venue moved to the Virgin Islands, the district court properly found venue was proper. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4247(h) (2000). Accordingly, we dismiss as frivolous the appeal from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-24\">In No. 07-6240, Mendez appeals the district court order finding that he continues to meet the criteria for commitment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4246 (2000). A district court\u2019s denial of unconditional release under \u00a7 4246 is a factual determination which will not be overturned unless it is clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Cox, </em>964 F.2d 1431, 1433 (4th Cir.1992) (stating general review standard for factual findings under \u00a7 4246). In order to commit Mendez under \u00a7 4246, the court must find both: (1) that he is suffering from a mental disease or defect, and (2) that as a result of his mental disease, his release would create a substantial risk of harm to another or the property of another. There is no doubt that the evidence before the court supported the district court\u2019s findings. Even Mendez\u2019s independent clinical and forensic psychologist agreed with the risk assessment prepared by the medical professionals at FMC Rochester. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-25\">We dismiss as frivolous the appeal in No. 07-6191 and affirm the order appealed in No. 07-6240. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>\n<em>No. 07-6191 DISMISSED; No. 07-6210 AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
