McCaskill\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting, in his opinion, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but raising the issues of whether the district court complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in taking McCaskill\u2019s guilty plea and whether his sentence is reasonable. The Government has not filed an answering brief. MeCaskill was advised of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Appellate counsel first questions whether the district court complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting McCaskill\u2019s guilty plea, but he alleges no error by the district court and concludes the court fully complied with the rule. Since McCaskill did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, we review any challenge to the adequacy of the Rule 11 hearing for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002). We have reviewed the record and find no plain error in the district court\u2019s acceptance of McCaskill\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">Appellate counsel next questions whether McCaskill\u2019s sentence is reasonable, but he alleges no error by the district court and concludes the sentence is \u201cclearly reasonable.\u201d We will affirm a sentence imposed by the district court as long as it is within the statutorily prescribed range and reasonable. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005). A sentence may be unreasonable for both substantive and procedural reasons. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 434 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). An error of law or fact can render a sentence unreasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">In sentencing a defendant, the district court must: (1) properly calculate the guideline range; (2) determine whether a sentence within that range serves the factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000); (3) implement mandatory statutory limitations; and (4) explain its reasons for selecting the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 455-56. In considering whether the sentence is unreasonable, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Hampton, </em>441 F.3d 284, 287 (4th Cir.2006). Issues that are not raised in the district court are reviewed for plain error. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">We have reviewed the record and conclude McCaskill\u2019s sentence is reasonable. McCaskill admitted he had at least one prior conviction for a felony drug offense, subjecting him to the mandatory minimum sentence of twenty years in prison on the conspiracy count pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2000). The Government filed an information under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1) (2000) stating the prior convictions to be relied upon, and in accordance with the parties\u2019 plea agreement, only relied on one of them at sentencing. McCaskill affirmed the conviction and understood he could not later attack his sentence by challenging the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-14\">By virtue of his guilty plea, McCaskill was subject to a mandatory .consecutive sixty-month term on the firearm possession count pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (2000); <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2K2.4 (b) (2004). Because his initial guideline range on the conspiracy count was lower than the mandatory statutory minimum, the court determined his guideline sentence became 240 months and his aggregate guideline sentence was 300 months. The parties agreed with the court\u2019s calculations. The district court implemented mandatory statutory limitations and properly determined McCaskill\u2019s guideline sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-15\">In accordance with the plea agreement, the Government moved for a downward departure based on substantial assistance, representing that McCaskill\u2019s early cooperation was extensive and valuable. Based on the Government\u2019s representations, the district court found McCaskill\u2019s cooperation to be substantial and granted a four-level downward departure pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) (2000); USSG \u00a7 5K1.1. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>After the departure, the district court found MeCaskill\u2019s aggregate guideline range was 168 to 210 months, and the parties stated they had no objection. As to where he should be sentenced, McCaskill argued he was a young man with a relatively minor criminal history, notwithstanding his two prior felony drug offenses, and he had done everything he could to cooperate with authorities. The district court sentenced him to a 120-month prison sentence on the conspiracy count and a consecutive sixty-month term on the firearm count. In sentencing him, the district court noted it had considered the advisory guidelines and the factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). The court explained its reasons for selecting the sentence, including McCaskill\u2019s cooperation and his prior criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
