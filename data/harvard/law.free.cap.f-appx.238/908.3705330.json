He was granted leave to proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. Roy filed his lawsuit against numerous defendants, including God, the United States of America, United States President George Bush, Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court John G. Roberts, the Prime Minister of India, agencies and officials of the State of New York, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and <em>The New York Times. </em>Roy\u2019s complaint consists of what appear to be excerpts of his previous lawsuits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Among other things, the complaint contains references to discrimination, deprivation of government benefits, corruption, the loss of the power of God to the rulers of society, actions taken by President Bush, Roy\u2019s exception to Chief Justice Roberts being named to the United States Supreme Court, and the government of India\u2019s violation of civil rights concerning pension benefits. Roy sought \u201cup to one-half billion dollars\u201d in United States currency in damages. The District Court dismissed the complaint as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). Roy appeals<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>has been granted leave to appeal <em>informa pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">The federal <em>in forma pauperis </em>statute permits an indigent litigant to appeal without paying the administrative costs of proceeding with the appeal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. The statute protects against abuses of this privilege by allowing the appeals court to dismiss the appeal if it is frivolous. <em>Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 27, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992). An action is frivolous if it \u201clacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.\u201d <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). We may dismiss the appeal where the factual allegations are delusional, irrational, or wholly incredible. <em>Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. at 33, 112 S.Ct. 1728. Upon review of the record, we agree with the District Court\u2019s assessment of the complaint and conclude that the appeal is \u201cclearly baseless\u201d under the <em>Neitzke </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">We will dismiss the appeal as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b928-13\">.

The District Court dismissed the complaint by memorandum order entered April 13, 2007, as later amended by its revised memorandum order entered April 24, 2007, 2007 WL 1109296. Roy filed a notice of appeal and an amended notice of appeal concerning these orders. The two appeals have been consolidated for all purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
