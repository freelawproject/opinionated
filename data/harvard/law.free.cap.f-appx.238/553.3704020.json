Ametaj also contends that the IJ erred in its finding that he did not suffer past persecution. We note that the BIA only denied Ametaj\u2019s claim based on an adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">We review the BIA\u2019s factual determination that an alien is ineligible for asylum for substantial evidence. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Under this highly deferential standard, we must affirm \u201cunless a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). We review credibility determinations under the same standard, and may not substitute our judgment for that of the BIA. <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">It is well settled that an adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the BIA\u2019s decision to deny an application for asylum, particularly where there is no other evidence of persecution. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005); <em>see also D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 819. Even if the BIA makes an adverse credibility determination, the BIA still must \u201cconsider the other evidence produced by an asylum applicant.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Here the BIA made a clean adverse credibility determination, and substantial evidence supports its findings. <em>Cf. Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). Ametaj had several inconsistences between his testimony and asylum application. Ametaj testified about several instances of violence against him in Alba-nia. However, he was inconsistent as to the dates in which at least one of the alleged attacks occurred. Furthermore, he testified inconsistently with his application about who perpetrated the various attacks and how many people participated. For example, he asserted on his application that four civilians captured him in a van, but testified that the men were police officers in civilian clothes. He also stated on his application that he was arrested by one officer at his home, but testified that three officers arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">The BIA also properly considered the other evidence in the record and found that it did not corroborate Ametaj\u2019s claims. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. Therefore, the BIA did not err in denying Ametaj\u2019s claim. We do not review Ametaj\u2019s claim that the IJ erred in its past persecution analysis because the BIA denied his claim based on an adverse credibility finding and only the BIA\u2019s decision is under review. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. Accordingly, we deny Ametaj\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-12\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-7\">. Ametaj also sought relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\"CAT\u201d), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). Because he does not contest the BIA\u2019s denial of this claim, he has abandoned this claim. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
