He now appeals his sentences, contending that his sentences are unreasonable because the district court, in determining his sentence range under the Guidelines, erred in refusing to adjust the offense level downward under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b) for his having been a minor participant in the criminal activity. We find no error and accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">The facts underlying appellant\u2019s offenses are these. On September 10, 2006, a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter spotted a \u201cgo-fast\u201d boat in the Caribbean Sea. As it approached, those aboard the boat began to jettison bales of cocaine \u2014 even as the helicopter fired warning shots. Further shots disabled the boat, and a Coast Guard cutter approached. A boarding party boarded the boat, arrested appellant and five other men, and recovered thirty-seven bales of cocaine weighing approximately 840 kilograms. Appellant and the others each gave a post-arrest statement. Appellant stated that he had been recruited by Don Pedro, a Colombian, to pilot the go-fast boat to Haiti.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">At sentencing, appellant acknowledged that he had been recruited to pilot the go-fast boat and was to have been paid between 20 million and 40 million pesos for doing so. Aside from being the boat\u2019s captain, he said that his duties were the same as those of the other crewmen. He asked the corut to reduce the offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b), but, as noted above, the court refused to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">In his brief to us, appellant contends that the court should have granted the \u00a7 3B1.2(b) reduction because he was less culpable than unindicted co-conspirators\u2014 that is, his role was minor when compared to the roles played by those involved in the entire drug trafficking network. He was not an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of the criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">A defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal\u201d is entitled to a two-level reduction for his minor role. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b), comment, (n.5). The defendant bears the burden of proving that he played a minor role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 939 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">A district court applies a two-prong test in making a mitigating role determination. <em>Id. </em>at 940-45. The first prong \u201cmeasurefs] the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 940. \u201cWhere the relevant conduct attributed to a defendant is identical to [his] actual conduct, [he] cannot prove that [he] is entitled to a minor role adjustment simply by pointing to some broader criminal scheme in which [he] was a minor participant but for which [he] was not held accountable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941. The first prong of <em>De Varon </em>is often dis-positive of the issue. <em>See id. </em>at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">The second prong involves the comparison of the defendant\u2019s conduct to that of the other participants in the conduct for which the defendant was held accountable. <em>Id. </em>at 944. Even if a defendant can show that his role was less than that of other participants, this \u201cmay not be dispositive of role in the offense, since it is possible that none are minor or minimal participants.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">The record supports the district court's finding that the conduct attributed to appellant was identical to his actual conduct and that he was not substantially less culpable than the other crew members on the go-fast boat. He was only held accountable for the quantity of cocaine found on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>boat; the existence of a larger drug trafficking conspiracy was irrelevant. Further, while appellant asserts that his role was less than that of the person who was actually captaining the go-fast boat at the time the helicopter spotted it, this did not preclude the court from finding that his role was not minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">In sum, the court committed no error in denying the \u00a7 3B1.2(b) downward adjustment. It therefore follows that appellant\u2019s sentences are not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
