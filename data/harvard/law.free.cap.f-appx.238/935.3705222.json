The Government filed a motion to dismiss based upon the waiver of appellate rights to which Bennett agreed as a part of his plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">We conclude that Bennett\u2019s appellate waiver is valid and encompasses all issues raised on appeal except his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We have reviewed that claim and determine that it does not \u201cconclusively appear\u201d on the record that counsel was ineffective. <em>See United States v. James, </em>337 F.3d 387, 391 (4th Cir.2003). Such a claim is more properly raised in a proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). Accordingly, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss with respect to issues covered by the waiver, deny the motion with respect to the ineffective assistance claim, and affirm as to the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. We also deny Bennett\u2019s motion to substitute counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
