Rodriguez-Rodriguez argues that his bottom of the guideline range sentence (imposed July 2006) is unreasonable because he requested a sentence below the guidelines based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>3553 </em>factors and that the district court imposed the sentence without considering the mitigating factor or the nature and circumstances of the offense. The record shows that Rodriguez-Rodriguez\u2019s factual assertion that the district court did not consider the mitigating circumstance presented at sentencing is factually incorrect. Rodriguez-Rodriguez has not shown that the sentence imposed by the district court is unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Rodriguez-Rodriguez challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. Rodriguez-Rodriguez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 </em>U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garzar-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). Rodriguez-Rodriguez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for future review.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b36-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5 the Court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
