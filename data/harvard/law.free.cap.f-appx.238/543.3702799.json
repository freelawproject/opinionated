He attacks his Count Two conviction on the ground that the court constructively amended the indictment when, in charging the jury, it failed to refer to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(i)(B)(iii) and to inform the jury that in order to convict, it had to find that appellant possessed with intent to distribute 500 or more grams of cocaine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant challenges his sentence on Count Two on two grounds: (1) in determining the sentence range under the Guidelines, the court erred in considering the firearms listed in Count Two; and (2) the court erred in considering the 6.4 grams of crack cocaine in arriving at appellant\u2019s sentence (but not in determining the sentence range). We turn first to appellant\u2019s argument that the court impermissibly amended the indictment as to Count Two, an argument he did not present to the district court, which means that we consider it under the plain error doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-14\">Count Two alleged that appellant violated two subsections of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\u2014841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(B)(ii). The latter subsection does not state a crime; rather, its service is merely to provide the penalties for violations of \u00a7 841(a)(1). Therefore, the reference to \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)(ii) was pure surplusage. The court properly charged the jury on the elements of the Count Two offense. Thus, we could hardly find plain error. We accordingly affirm the Count Two conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Appellant contends that since it granted a judgment of acquittal on Count Three, the court could not use the firearms mentioned in that count in enhancing his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). The Government showed by a preponderance of the evidence that the firearms were connected with appellant\u2019s possession of drugs, and appellant failed, in response, to demonstrate that this connection was \u201cclearly improbable.\u201d <em>United States v. Hall, </em>46 F.3d 62, 63 (11th Cir.1995). As the evidence abundantly supports the \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement, we reject this challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Appellant\u2019s second challenge to the Count Two sentence concerns the court\u2019s consideration of the 6.4 grams of crack cocaine involved in Count One in fashioning the sentence. We are unpersuaded. First, as appellant has to concede, the court correctly found the sentence range at 57 to 71 months\u2019 imprisonment. In doing so, the court did not take the crack cocaine into account. The court took the crack cocaine into account, however, after appropriately considering the sentencing objectives of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); it concluded that the prescribed sentence range was inadequate and that a more severe sentence was required to satisfy those objectives. We find nothing in the record that would suggest that the Count Two sentence is unreasonable; hence, we affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b564-9\">. The Government dismissed Count Four after it was severed from the other counts of the indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b564-10\">. In doing so, the court renumbered Count Five as Count Four. For ease of discussion, we refer to the count as Count Five.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b564-15\">. Subsection 841(b)(l)(B)(ii) states, in relevant part: \"In the case of a violation of [subsection 841(a)(1) ] involving ... (ii) 500 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of ... cocaine ... such person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than 5 years and not more than 40 years____\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
