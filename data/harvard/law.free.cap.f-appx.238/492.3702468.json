Harvey, Secretary of the Army, and the United States (collectively the \u201cDefendants\u201d) seeking, among other things, correction of his military records and military disability benefits. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-20\">Rease enlisted in the United States Army in 1975; and during his service, he suffered a cold injury to his feet. Rease was honorably discharged from the Army in 1980 after his enlistment contract expired. In 2003, Rease applied to the Army Board for Correction of Military Records (\u201cABCMR\u201d) to ask that his military record be changed to reflect a medical discharge. The ABCMR determined that Rease\u2019s application was untimely pursuant to 10 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1552(b), which provides that applications for correction of military records must be filed within three years of discovery of an alleged error. The ABCMR also concluded, after conducting a merits review of Rease\u2019s application, that it was not in the interest of justice to excuse Rease\u2019s untimely filing because no evidence showed that Rease should have been medically separated from the Army. Rease requested that the ABCMR reconsider its decision, which the ABCMR denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Dees v. Johnson Controls World Servs., Inc., </em>168 F.3d 417, 421 (11th Cir.1999). Summary judgment must be granted \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">We conclude that the ABCMR\u2019s decision on Rease\u2019s application to correct his military record was not arbitrary or capricious. <em>See Nolen v. Rumsfeld, </em>535 F.2d 888, 889-90 (5th Cir.1976). Even if we assume that we can review the decision that Rease\u2019s application was untimely, we reject Rease\u2019s claim because he applied to correct his military record approximately 23 years after his discharge in 1980, which was when Rease should have discovered the alleged error of not receiving a medical separation. <em>See </em>10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1552(b) (explaining request for correction to military record must be filed within three years of discovery of the error or injustice but an untimely filing may be excused \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d). When he was discharged, Rease was aware of his foot injury and that the Army knew of this injury. After a careful review of the record, we see no reason to disturb the ABCMR\u2019s determination that Rease\u2019s application was untimely and that his untimely filing was not excusable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">We next address Rease\u2019s claim under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (\u201cFOIA\u201d). The'district court concluded that Rease had not exhausted his administrative remedies on his FOIA claim because, even assuming that Defendants refused Rease\u2019s requests for his military records,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rease did not demonstrate that he submitted an administrative appeal about his requests to the appropriate agency officials. <em>See Taylor, </em>30 F.3d at 1367-68 (\u201cThe FOIA clearly requires a party to exhaust all administrative remedies before seeking redress in the federal courts. This exhaustion requirement is a condition precedent to filing suit....\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Even when an agency belatedly responds to a FOIA request, the requester still must exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See id. </em>at 1369 (relying on reasoning of <em>Oglesby v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Army, </em>920 F.2d 57 (D.C.Cir.1990), including that requester who waits past the deadline for an agency\u2019s response must pursue an administrative appeal before raising a FOIA claim in federal court). Rease has not asserted that he pursued an administrative appeal of his FOIA claim; so he has not exhausted his administrative remedies. We affirm the grant of summary judgment to Defendants on Rease\u2019s FOIA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Rease also has not exhausted his administrative remedies on his Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d) claim. \u201cThe [FTCA] provides that an \u2018action shall not be instituted upon a claim against the United States for money damages\u2019 unless the claimant has first exhausted his administrative remedies.\u201d <em>McNeil v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 106, 113 S.Ct. 1980, 1981, 124 L.Ed.2d 21 (1993). Rease asserts that his ABCMR request was sufficient to exhaust his administrative remedies on his FTCA claim; but Rease\u2019s ABCMR request, which did not mention the FTCA or indicate potential damages, put Defendants on no notice of a FTCA claim. <em>See Suarez v. United States, </em>22 F.3d 1064, 1066 (11th Cir.1994) (\u201c[T]he FTCA requires, at a minimum, that a claimant expressly claim a sum certain or provide documentation which will allow the agency to calculate or estimate the damages to the claimant.\u201d); <em>Brown v. United States, </em>838 F.2d 1157, 1160 (11th Cir.1988) (\u201cThe FTCA establishes that as a prerequisite to maintaining a suit against the United States, a plaintiff must present notice of the claim to the appropriate federal agency.\u201d). Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to consider Rease\u2019s FTCA claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Dalrymple v. United States, </em>460 F.3d 1318, 1324 (11th Cir.2006) (the exhaustion requirement in FTCA cases is jurisdictional).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">Rease also contends that the district court erred in dismissing his contract claim under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491, for lack of jurisdiction. Because Rease has not limited his claim for monetary relief to $10,000 or less, the district court properly dismissed his Tucker Act claim. <em>See Begner v. United States, </em>428 F.3d 998, 1002 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cUnder the Tucker Act, the Court of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction for contracts in excess of $10,000.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">We next address Rease\u2019s constitutional claims. Rease\u2019s complaint alleged that Defendants \u201cfailed to live up to their contractual obligations\u201d under the Constitution and also violated due process. We agree with the district court that Rease\u2019s constitutional claims for monetary damages are barred by sovereign immunity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See generally JBP Acquisitions, LP v. United States, </em>224 F.3d 1260, 1263-64 (11th Cir.2000) (discussing how, absent a waiver, sovereign immunity shields the federal government and its agencies from suit). Therefore, we affirm the grant of summary judgment to Defendants on these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>In addition, we agree with the district court that Rease\u2019s remaining claims for relief, which proceed under the APA and arise from alleged errors with his Army discharge \u2014 including that he did not receive pre-separation counseling or a complete transmittal of his medical records and that he did not receive medical separation or military disability benefits \u2014 are barred by the six-year statute of limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 2401(a) provides that \u201c[e]xcept as provided by the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, every civil action commenced against the United States shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action first accrues.\u201d We do not have jurisdiction over suits brought against the United States that are barred by section 2401(a). <em>See Center for Biological Diversity, </em>453 F.3d at 1334 (\u201cUnlike an ordinary statute of limitations, [section] 2401(a) is a jurisdictional condition attached to the government\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity, and as such must be strictly construed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">When Rease was discharged, he knew of the cold injury to his feet.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, Rease was aware that he was not receiving a medical separation from the Army. In completing an assessment of Rease\u2019s \u201cphysical and mental status on release from active service,\u201d the Army informed Rease that his physical condition was \u201csuch that you are considered physically qualified for separation or for reenlistment without re-examination\u201d if Rease re-enlisted within three months of his discharge and had not accrued new diseases or injuries. In addition, Rease\u2019s Army separation order, dated 29 April 1980, explained to Rease that \u2018You are reassigned to U.S. Army separation transfer point as indicated for separation processing. After processing, you are relieved from active duty, not by reason of physical disability____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">Because Rease was aware of his injury and that he was not receiving medical separation or disability benefits, the statute of limitations in this case began to run in 1980, when Rease was discharged from the Army. <em>See Burton v. United States, </em>22 Cl.Ct. 706, 710 (1991) (\u201c[P]laintiff knew or at the very least should have known the full extent of his disability at the time of discharge. At that time, plaintiff had adequate notice of a potential claim to disability pay such that he could have brought suit within 6 years.\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to consider Rease\u2019s remaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>claims that are barred by the statute of limitations in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">In conclusion, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision that we lack jurisdiction to consider Rease\u2019s claims under the FTCA and Tucker Act as well as his claims barred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(a). We also affirm the grant of summary judgment on Rease\u2019s claim that the ABCMR improperly denied his request to modify his military records and on his FOIA and constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-12\">. As an initial matter, we reject Rease's claim that Defendants waived argument in their reply to Rease's response to Defendants' motion for summary judgment. Although Rease does not assert that he raised this concern before the district court, the district court did reject Rease\u2019s challenge to the timeliness of Defendants\u2019 reply. Assuming that we can consider the claim Rease now raises, we see no merit to his assertion that Defendants raised new issues in their reply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b514-6\">. And Rease has not shown that the ABCMR acted arbitrarily or capriciously in returning his request for reconsideration \"without action.\u201d As he argued before the district court, Rease asserts that he submitted much new evidence with his request for reconsideration; but Rease does not identify precisely how this evidence should have affected the ABCMR's earlier denial of his application. And, as the district court explained, Rease did not offer new evidence or arguments that demonstrated he was unfit to perform his military duties when he was discharged from the Army.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b514-10\">. Although Rease attested that he asked for his military records starting in 1980, the record only shows that Rease made one request to the Army in 1992. In response to the 1992 request, Rease received a letter informing him that his records could be obtained from a provided address for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Although it appears that the Army\u2019s response may have been beyond the time limit set out in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6)(A)(i) to comply with such requests, this belated response did not excuse Rease from pursuing \"actual exhaustion\u201d of his administrative remedies. <em>See Taylor v. Appleton, </em>30 F.3d 1365, 1369 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b515-6\">. Rease\u2019s contention that an exception to the FTCA\u2019s statute of limitations applies to him does not affect our analysis that Rease failed to exhaust his administrative remedies on his FTCA claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b515-7\">. Rease\u2019s attempt to argue for a waiver of immunity focuses on the FTCA, Tucker Act, and Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\u201d); but Rease\u2019s claims under those authorities otherwise fail. And Rease appears to assert that his claim based on a constitutional contract theory should be heard by the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b516-5\">. We review the interpretation and application of statutes of limitations <em>de novo. Center for Biological Diversity v. Hamilton, </em>453 F.3d 1331, 1334 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b516-6\">. The record contains Rease's physical profile record, dated 27 November 1978 and which diagnoses Rease with \"cold injury to feet\" and restricts Rease\u2019s cold exposure and continuous wearing of combat boots. And Rease\u2019s May 1980 medical report- \u2014 completed around the time of his discharge and signed by Rease \u2014 stated that Rease was treated for frostbite and had a cold weather profile. Documentation attached to this medical report listed \u201ccold injury to feet\" as Rease\u2019s only \"defect.\u201d Rease asserts that this physical examination was incomplete but does not explain how the exam was deficient.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b516-10\">. We are not convinced of Rease\u2019s argument that the statute of limitations began to run when the ABCMR denied his application to correct his military records in 1993. Although some courts have explained that a cause of action can accrue when the first competent board denies, or refuses to hear, a claim, <em>see, e.g., Friedman v. United States, </em>310 F.2d 381, 159 Ct.Cl. 1 (1962), we agree with the district court that \u2014 in this case \u2014 Rease\u2019s cause of action began to accrue when he was discharged from the Army because it was at that time that Rease knew he had suffered frostbite and was on notice that he would not receive a medical separation. <em>See Burton, </em>22 Cl.Ct. at 710.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b517-16\">. We are also unpersuaded by Rease's claims that, even if his claims were barred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(a), he should receive the benefit of equitable tolling. It does not appear that Rease raised this argument before the district court. But, even assuming without deciding that Rease preserved this claim and that the section 2401(a) statute of limitations could be equitably tolled, Rease has not demonstrated that he exercised due diligence in bringing his claims; so equitable tolling would not be warranted. See <em>Justice v. United States, </em>6 F.3d 1474, 1479 (11th Cir.1993) (\"It bears emphasizing ... that due diligence on the part of the plaintiff, though necessary, is not sufficient to prevail on the issue of equitable tolling. The Supreme Court has made clear that tolling is an extraordinary remedy which should be extended only sparingly.\u201d). And we decline Rease\u2019s request to excuse the untimeliness of his claims by applying the continuing violation doctrine raised in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 or Tide VII cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
