Hunter appeals, contending that his predicate state conviction, cruelty to animals, did not satisfy \u00a7 922(g)(1) as a matter of law. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-12\">Section 922(g)(1) prohibits anyone who has been convicted of a crime punishable by more than a year in prison to possess a firearm. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Hunter asserts that, under North Carolina\u2019s structured sentencing scheme law, his maximum sentence was less than twelve months because no aggravating factors were either admitted or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. However, as Hunter concedes, his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Harp, </em>406 F.3d 242, 246-47 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 297, 163 L.Ed.2d 259 (2005). Thus, because it is undisputed that a sentence of over twelve months could be imposed on a defendant convicted of cruelty to animals in North Carolina, Hunter\u2019s prior conviction was properly considered a predicate felony under \u00a7 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-14\">Accordingly, we affirm Hunter\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
