We will dismiss the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-19\">According to Mauro\u2019s complaint, New Jersey Supreme Court Justices denied him due process and equal protection in connection with his being arrested and placed under a restraining order for violation of a state spousal abuse law. Mauro alleges that the defendants \u201chave denied me due process by insulating Lisa Zittis\u2019 abuse of my freedoms under color of the spousal abuse laws of New Jersey.\u201d Mauro applied to proceed with his suit <em>in forma pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-20\">On March 23, 2006, the District Court issued a memorandum opinion concluding that (1) Mauro failed to show he was entitled to <em>in forma pauperis </em>status, (2) the Justices of the New Jersey Supreme Court were immune from suit, and (3) the <em>Hooker-Feldman </em>doctrine prevented the Court from adjudicating Mauro\u2019s claims. The Court ordered that the complaint \u201cnot be filed\u201d pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. On May 11, 2006, Mauro filed a motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4), asking the Court to vacate its previous orders. The District Court construed Mauro\u2019s filing as both a motion pursuant to Rule 60(b) and an untimely motion for reconsideration under the local rules, and denied the motion on August 1, 2006. Mauro appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-21\">Mauro has filed an application to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal, including an affidavit in support. By Clerk\u2019s order, Mauro\u2019s <em>in forma pauperis </em>motion was conditionally granted; the definitive determination of Mauro\u2019s status is now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-22\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-23\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We first consider Mauro\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>The decision whether to grant leave to proceed on appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>depends solely on whether the applicant is economically eligible; we do not consider whether the action or appeal is frivolous. <em>See Sinwell v. Shapp, </em>536 F.2d 15, 19 (3d Cir.1976). A plaintiff need not \u201cbe absolutely destitute to enjoy the benefit of the statute.\u201d <em>Adkins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>335 U.S. 331, 339, 69 S.Ct. 85, 93 L.Ed. 43 (1948). It is sufficient for the affiant to show that he is \u201cunable to pay the costs of his suit.\u201d <em>Walker v. People Express Airlines, Inc., </em>886 F.2d 598, 601 (3d Cir.1989). According to Mauro\u2019s affidavit, he has averaged a monthly income of approximately $1500 over the year preceding his appeal, and his monthly expenses total approximately $1700. He indicates that he has \u201cbarely enough cash on hand to cover basic bills,\u201d and that, because his expenses exceed his current monthly income, he has been underpaying his \u201cP.T.I. obligation\u201d to the state.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In light of Mauro\u2019s limited monthly income and account of his expenses, we grant his motion for leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">When an appellant proceeds in <em>for-ma pauperis, </em>this Court determines whether the appeal must be dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). Mauro\u2019s notice of appeal, which cites only the District Court\u2019s order denying his Rule 60(b) motion, is timely only with regard to that order. Our review of the District Court\u2019s determination under Rule 60(b)(4) is plenary. <em>See Page v. Schweiker, </em>786 F.2d 150, 152 (3d Cir.1986). A judgment can be voided only (1) if the rendering court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, or (2) if the court acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law. <em>See </em>11 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller <em>&amp; </em>Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2862 (2007). Mauro did not address Rule 60(b)(4)\u2019s requirements in his motion, and there is nothing in the record that would support a conclusion that the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction or acted in a manner that was inconsistent with due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">To the extent that the District Court alternatively considered Mauro\u2019s motion as an untimely motion for reconsideration pursuant to the District of New Jersey\u2019s Local Civil Rule 7.1(g), such a motion should be granted only where facts or controlling legal authority were presented to but overlooked by the District Court. <em>See Arista Records, Inc. v. Flea World, Inc., </em>356 F.Supp.2d 411, 415 (D.N.J.2005). Such motions may not be used to re-litigate old matters or raise arguments that could have been raised prior to judgment. <em>See P. Schoenfeld Asset Mgmt. L.L.C. v. Cendant Corp., </em>161 F.Supp.2d 349, 352 (D.N.J.2001). The District Court concluded that Mauro\u2019s suit is barred by the doctrine of judicial immunity. <em>See Figueroa v. Blackburn, </em>208 F.3d 435, 440 (3d Cir.2000). The District Court also determined that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine precluded it from entertaining Mauro\u2019s challenge to the state courts\u2019 judgments. <em>See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005) (doctrine applies to \u201ccases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>of those judgments.\u201d). Because we uphold the District Court\u2019s ruling on the grounds already noted, we need not address the District Court\u2019s alternative bases for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Accordingly, the District Court properly denied Mauro\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion. His appeal is without legal merit, and we will dismiss it pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b813-7\">. Despite the fact that the opinion concludes that Mauro has made a sufficient showing in this Court to warrant <em>in forma pauperis </em>status, there is no indication that District Court abused its discretion in denying Mauro\u2019s <em>in forma pauperis </em>application. Mauro presented different supporting financial information in the District Court. Mauro indicated that he had no income, yet appeared to claim expenses of $3,500 per month.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
