But we vacate and remand for the limited purpose of correcting a clerical error in his judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-19\">Kafka contends that the district court erred in concluding that he had violated the terms and conditions of his supervised release. We review a district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Copeland, </em>20 F.3d 412, 413 (11th Cir.1994). A district court may \u201crevoke a term of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>supervised release, and require the defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release authorized by statute ... if the court ... finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">In this case, the terms of Kafka\u2019s supervised release included, among other things, that Kafka truthfully answer his probation officer\u2019s questions, provide complete access of his financial information to his probation officer, and not apply for or incur additional debt without first obtaining permission from his probation officer. But the government presented evidence that Kafka had made false statements to his probation officer about the nature of his employment and his earnings. For example, the government produced evidence that Kafka worked as a mortgage broker or a loan originator; but he reported to his probation officer that he performed mostly clerical work for a mortgage company for $7.50 per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Kafka also failed to provide his probation officer with complete information on mortgages taken out on his home; the financial statements submitted by Kafka to his probation officer \u2014 as required by the terms of his supervised release \u2014 did not indicate that he had two mortgages on his home.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Through the testimony of Kafka\u2019s probation officer and other evidence, the government established violations of Kafka\u2019s supervised release, including that he made false statements about his employment, earnings, and assets and failed to provide complete access to his financial information.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">Kafka next argues that the district court erred in imposing consecutive sentences upon revocation of his concurrent terms of supervised release. But he concedes that our decision in <em>United States v. Quinones, </em>136 F.3d 1293 (11th Cir.1998), does not support his argument. We review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation of sentencing provisions. <em>Quinones, </em>136 F.3d at 1294.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">In <em>Quinones, </em>136 F.3d at 1295, we explained that whether a term of imprisonment imposed for a violation of supervised release is served concurrently or consecutively is \u201ca question that [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3584(a) entrusts to the [district] court\u2019s discretion.\u201d On appeal, Kafka contends that his case is distinguishable from <em>Quinones </em>\u2014 which involved underlying charges brought in separate indictments \u2014 because the underlying offenses in Kafka\u2019s case were originally charged in a single indictment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But Kafka provides no reason why this difference indicates that we should not rely on our precedent; and he offers no authority to support his argument. In the light of our decision in <em>Quinones, </em>we are unpersuaded by Kafka\u2019s assertion that the district court erred in sentencing him to consecutive sentences for violations of his supervised release.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>We also reject Kafka\u2019s claim that his consecutive sentences violated due process because he was not notified before sentencing that he could receive consecutive sentences for his supervised release violations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a) specifically provides that multiple terms of imprisonment may run concurrently or consecutively. And nothing in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(a) \u2014 which explains how a district court may include a term of supervised release as part of a defendant\u2019s sentence\u2014 suggests that a district court cannot impose consecutive sentences for violations of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">We turn to Kafka\u2019s contention that his sentence was not reasonable because the district court sentenced him above the Guidelines range of 12 to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment. Kafka was sentenced for violating the terms of his supervised release after the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); so we review his sentence for reasonableness in the light of the factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). Under section 3553(a), a district court should consider, among other things, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for adequate deterrence and protection of the public, policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, provision for the medical and educational needs of the defendant, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">We conclude that Kafka\u2019s sentence was reasonable. The district court did not exceed the statutory maximum for each sentence imposed. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Although Kafka\u2019s total sentence exceeded significantly the advisory sentencing range set out in the Chapter 7 policy statements, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a), the district court was not required to sentence Kafka within that range. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>224 F.3d 1237, 1242 (11th Cir.2000) (explaining that a district court must consider, but is not bound by, the policy statements of Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines in imposing sentence upon revocation of supervised release). Even before <em>Booker, </em>when application of the sentencing ranges provided by the Guidelines was considered to be mandatory, the Chapter 7 policy statements on revocation of supervised release were nonbinding recommendations. <em>See United States v. Hofierka, </em>83 F.3d 357, 361 (11th Cir.1996). Sentencing courts were \u2014 and are \u2014 required to consider these policy statements; but they are not bound to follow them. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Further, the district court explained that it considered the section 3553(a) factors and that a sentence above Kafka\u2019s Guidelines range was appropriate. The district court specifically noted that Kafka\u2019s sentence reflected the seriousness of his offense, promoted respect for the law, and provided just punishment and adequate deterrence. The district court was not required to state on the record that it explicitly considered each of the section 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Noth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>ing in the record convinces us the sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Although we affirm Kafka\u2019s sentence, we note that his judgment contains a clerical error. As the government noted, the written judgment states that Kafka\u2019s sentence is seven years\u2019 imprisonment; but at sentencing, the district court stated that Kafka\u2019s sentence was 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. \u201cWhen a sentence pronounced orally and unambiguously conflicts with the written order of judgment, the oral pronouncement governs.\u201d <em>United States v. Bates, </em>213 F.3d 1336, 1340 (11th Cir.2000). Therefore, although we affirm Kafka\u2019s sentence, we vacate and remand for the limited purpose of correcting the clerical error in the written judgment. <em>See United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 822 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-11\">. The district court determined that Kafka was guilty of these violations: (1) committing conspiracy to defraud the United States; (2) committing mail fraud; (3) committing wire fraud; (4) making many false statements to his probation officer, including false statements about the amount of restitution owed, his employment, and his income; (5) failing to provide truthful monthly reports to his probation officer; (6) failing to answer truthfully all questions raised by his probation officer; (7) incurring debt without the permission of his probation officer; and (8) failing to provide complete access to his financial information. Kafka\u2019s 60-month sentence consists of a sentence of 36 months\u2019 imprisonment and a consecutive sentence of 24 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b615-7\">. On the loan application for these mortgages, Kafka represented that he earned $18,000 per month.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b615-8\">. Although Kafka\u2019s underlying offenses were initially charged in a single indictment, the district court granted Kafka\u2019s motion to sever certain counts of his indictment before trial. After trial, Kafka was sentenced to 48 months\u2019 imprisonment on each of six counts of loan fraud, to be served concurrently, and three years of supervised release on each count, also to run concurrently. On some of the remaining counts, Kafka later was sentenced to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment' \u2014 with all but 9 months of that sentence to run concurrently with his prior sentence \u2014 and to three years of supervised release on each count, which was to run concurrently with the sentence previously imposed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b615-14\">. It appears that other circuits have affirmed the imposition of consecutive sentences in similar circumstances. <em>See, e.g., United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>v. <em>Deutsch, </em>403 F.3d 915, 916-18 (7th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 924-29 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b616-6\">. Although we usually review constitutional errors in sentencing <em>de novo </em>and reverse only for harmful error, <em>see United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005), the government asserts that we should review Kafka\u2019s due process argument only for plain error. We need not decide this issue because, for the reasons discussed, Kafka's claim fails under either standard of review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
