Benitez\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising the issue of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>Benitez\u2019s sentence was reasonable. Benitez was given an opportunity to file a supplemental pro se brief, but has not done so. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">This court reviews the imposition of a sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 260-61, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). After <em>Booker, </em>courts must calculate the appropriate guidelines range, making any appropriate factual findings. <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 370 (4th Cir.2006). The court then should consider the resulting advisory guidelines range in conjunction with the factors under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006), and determine an appropriate sentence. <em>Davenport, </em>445 F.3d at 370. This court will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it is reasonable. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546-47. This court has repeatedly held that a sentence imposed within a properly calculated Guidelines range is presumed reasonable, and the Supreme Court recently upheld this presumption. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">The district court properly calculated the guideline range. Specifically, the district court correctly applied a sixteen-level enhancement because Benitez was previously deported after a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) (2005). A \u201ccrime of violence\u201d explicitly includes robbery. USSG \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 1(B)(iii). On June 29, 1995, Benitez was convicted of robbery, and was subsequently ordered deported on August 7, 1995. Thus, because Benitez\u2019 prior offense was a crime of violence, the district court did not err in applying the sixteen-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-9\">Moreover, the district court treated the Guidelines as advisory, and sentenced Benitez only after considering the Sentencing Guidelines, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and counsel\u2019s arguments. Benitez\u2019s sixty-five month sentence is presumptively reasonable, as it is within the appropriate guideline range, and below the twenty-year statutory maximum. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) (2000). As neither Benitez nor the record suggests any information to rebut the presumption, we find that Benitez\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-10\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
