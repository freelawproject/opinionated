With respect to the order denying Miles\u2019 motion for reconsideration, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Carr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v.

The notice of appeal was filed on May 1, 2007.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because Miles failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">With respect to the district court\u2019s order imposing a prefiling injunction, we have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Miles v. Angelone, </em>Nos. l:00-cv-204, l:06-cv-344 (E.D. Ya. filed Apr. 20, 2007 &amp; entered Apr. 23, 2007). We deny Miles\u2019 motion for appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-10\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b999-9\"> For the purpose of this appeal, we assume that the date appearing on the notice of appeal is the earliest date it could have been properly delivered to prison officials for mailing to the court.
