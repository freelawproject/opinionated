After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">Williams pled guilty to, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cusing and carrying\u201d a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c) and 2. In 1992, Williams\u2019s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal. In 1993, the district court denied Williams\u2019s first 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his sentence. Thereafter, the Supreme Court decided <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995). In <em>Bailey, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that the \u201cuse\u201d prong of \u00a7 924(c), as distinct from the \u201ccarry\u201d prong, required active employment of the firearm \u2014 through such actions as brandishing, displaying, bartering, striking with or firing the firearm \u2014 rather than mere possession. <em>See Bailey, </em>516 U.S. at 148, 116 S.Ct. at 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">After <em>Bailey, </em>Williams filed his \u00a7 2241 petition, arguing that he was innocent of his \u00a7 924(c) conviction because he did not \u201cuse\u201d a firearm as defined in <em>Bailey. </em>The district court dismissed Williams\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion to which the savings clause in \u00a7 2255 did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-13\">Less than ten days following the entry of the district court\u2019s dismissal order, Williams filed the two instant post-judgment motions. The first motion, titled \u201cMotion for Immediate Release Cause Facts of Case Prove Petitioner Actually Innocent,\u201d re-argued that, based on <em>Bailey, </em>Williams had been wrongly convicted of \u201cusing\u201d a firearm. The second motion, titled \u201cMotion for Court and Respondant [sic] To Acknowledge Procedural Facts of this Case That Also Allow Petitioner To Proceed,\u201d argued that Williams had been unable to raise his <em>Bailey </em>claim in his earlier motions for post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-14\">Before the district court could rule upon Williams\u2019s two post-judgment motions, Williams filed a notice of appeal designating only the district court\u2019s order dismissing his \u00a7 2241 petition. The district court then denied Williams\u2019s post-judgment motions, concluding that it had been divested of jurisdiction by Williams\u2019s filing of the notice of appeal. Williams filed a second notice of appeal designating the district court\u2019s order denying his post-judgment motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-15\">This Court affirmed the district court\u2019s order dismissing Williams\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition as a successive \u00a7 2255 petition. Specifically, the Court concluded that Williams was not convicted of \u201cusing\u201d a firearm, but rather had been convicted under the \u201ccarry\u201d prong of \u00a7 924(c), which remained unaffected by <em>Bailey. Williams v. United States, </em>218 Fed.Appx. 832, 835-36 (11th Cir.2007). However, due to the separate notices of appeal, the Court did not ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>dress the propriety of the district court\u2019s denial of Williams\u2019s post-judgment motions for reconsideration. We address that issue now.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">On appeal, Williams primarily argues yet again that, after <em>Bailey, </em>he is actually innocent of \u201cusing\u201d a firearm under \u00a7 924(c). However, this Court already rejected this argument in resolving Williams\u2019s appeal of the dismissal of his \u00a7 2241 petition, and we will not address this issue further. <em>See Williams, </em>218 Fed.Appx. at 835-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">In addition, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Williams\u2019s post-judgment motions. Because Williams\u2019s <em>pro se </em>post-judgment motions were filed within ten days of the district court\u2019s dismissal order and addressed the merits of the district court\u2019s decision, they are properly characterized as motions to alter or amend the judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e). <em>See Finch v. City of Vernon, </em>845 F.2d 256, 258-59 (11th Cir.1988). Furthermore, Williams\u2019s second post-judgment motion asserted essentially the same grounds and was merely a supplement to his first post-judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">We review the denial of a Rule 59 motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Drago v. Jenne, </em>453 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir.2006). The district court denied Williams\u2019s motions because it believed it lacked jurisdiction to rule on them after Williams filed his notice of appeal. A premature notice of appeal does not divest the district court of jurisdiction to rule upon a timely-filed Rule 59(e) motion. <em>See Gibbs v. Maxwell House, Div. of Gen. Foods Corp., </em>701 F.2d 145, 147 (11th Cir.1983) (concluding that \u201cany notice of appeal filed before the district court decides [a] Rule 59 motion is ineffective, [and this Court] lacks jurisdiction until the Rule 59 motion is decided\u201d); Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(B) (providing that a notice of appeal filed before the district court disposes of a tolling motion, such as a Rule 59(e) motion, becomes effective only after entry of the district court\u2019s order disposing of the tolling motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">Nonetheless, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Williams\u2019s Rule 59(e) motions because those motions only re-argued issues raised in Williams\u2019s initial \u00a7 2241 petition and amounted to an impermissible second \u201cbite at the apple.\u201d <em>See Mincey v. Head, </em>206 F.3d 1106, 1137 n. 69 (11th Cir.2000) (explaining that the purpose of a Rule 59(e) motion \u201cis not to serve as a vehicle to relitigate old matters or present the case under a new legal theory ... [or] to give the moving party another \u2018bite at the apple\u2019 by permitting the arguing of issues and procedures that could and should have been raised prior to judgment\u201d (quotation marks omitted)). For this reason, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Williams\u2019s Rule 59(e) motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
