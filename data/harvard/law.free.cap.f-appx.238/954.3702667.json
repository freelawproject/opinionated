We previously granted Robinson a certificate of appealability on this issue. In the same order, we denied a certificate of appealability and dismissed Robinson\u2019s appeal with respect to all other issues. For the reasons that follow, we vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-20\">Robinson asserts on appeal that counsel faded to communicate a plea offer, in which the Government agreed to withdraw its reliance on one prior felony controlled substance conviction. Robinson explicitly raised the failure-to-communicate claim for the first time in response to counsel\u2019s affidavit filed with the Government\u2019s response to his \u00a7 2255 motion and raised it again in his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation. In its appellate brief, the Government notes that neither the magistrate judge nor the district court explicitly addressed Robinson\u2019s claim and requests a remand for the court to address that claim in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-21\">Generally, an evidentiary hearing is required under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 unless it is clear from the pleadings, files, and records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>that a movant is not entitled to relief. <em>United States v. Witherspoon, </em>231 F.3d 923, 925-26 (4th Cir.2000); <em>Raines v. United States, </em>423 F.2d 526, 529 (4th Cir.1970). Whether an evidentiary hearing is necessary is best left to the sound discretion of the district court judge. <em>Raines, </em>423 F.2d at 530. However, when a movant presents a colorable Sixth Amendment claim showing disputed facts involving inconsistencies beyond the record, a hearing is mandated. <em>See United States v. Magini, </em>973 F.2d 261, 264 (4th Cir.1992); <em>Raines, </em>423 F.2d at 530 (\u201cThere will remain ... a category of petitions, usually involving credibility, that will require an evidentiary hearing in open court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Because resolution of Robinson\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim was not addressed explicitly by the district court and turns on a credibility determination, we vacate the district court\u2019s order \u2014 to the extent it implicitly denied that claim \u2014 and remand for further proceedings. <em>Raines, </em>423 F.2d at 530 (\u201cWhen the issue is one of credibility, resolution on the basis of affidavits can rarely be conclusive!).]\u201d). We deny Robinson\u2019s motion to reconsider the denial of a certificate of appealability as to his other claims and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
