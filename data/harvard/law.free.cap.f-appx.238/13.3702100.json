He has also moved to relieve the Federal Public Defender so that he may proceed <em>pro se </em>on appeal, and to permit the filing of additional material that he has prepared on his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">Moore argues that the presumption of reasonableness afforded <em>post-Booker</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>sentences by this court does not comport with the Sixth Amendment. After <em>Booker, </em>sentences are reviewed only for unreasonableness. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518 (5th Cir.2005). \u201c[A] sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). The grant of certiorari in <em>United States v. Rita, </em>177 Fed.Appx. 357 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 551, 166 L.Ed.2d 406 (2006), has no impact on the precedent set by <em>Alonzo. See United States v. Short, </em>181 F.3d 620, 624 (5th Cir.1999); see <em>also Ellis v. Collins, </em>956 F.2d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1992). Consequently, Moore\u2019s constitutional challenge is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">Moore additionally argues that the district court gave insufficient reasons for imposing the sentence. The district court, however, imposed a sentence within the advisory guidelines range. Under such circumstances, we require little explanation of the reasons for the sentence, and we presume that the district court considered all the factors for a fair sentence. <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519. As previously noted, the grant of certiorari in <em>Rita </em>has no impact on our precedent in this regard. <em>See Short, </em>181 F.3d at 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-14\">Moore\u2019s motion to relieve the Federal Public Defender is denied. <em>See United States v. Wagner, </em>158 F.3d 901, 902-03 (5th Cir.1998). Accordingly, his motion to permit the filing of materials he has prepared himself is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-15\">AFFIRMED; MOTION TO RELIEVE FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDER DENIED; MOTION TO FILE ADDITIONAL MATERIAL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b34-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
