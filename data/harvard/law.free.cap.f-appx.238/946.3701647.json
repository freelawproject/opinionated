In our prior decision, we affirmed Ricks\u2019s convictions of two counts of aggravated sexual abuse of a minor in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1152, 2241(c) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2007), but vacated Ricks\u2019s sentence and remanded for resentencing pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>United States v. Ricks, </em>166 Fed.Appx. 37 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-21\">On remand, the district court utilized the same Guidelines <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> calculations that were applied at Ricks\u2019s initial sentencing\u2014 a total offense level of thirty-five, criminal history category I, and a sentencing range of 168 to 210 months. At the resentencing hearing, Ricks continued his objection to the two-level enhancement imposed pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2A3.1(b)(3)(A) based on his role as the victim\u2019s caregiver. The district court overruled Ricks\u2019s objection and sentenced Ricks to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment. Ricks timely appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-22\">On appeal, Ricks asserts that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights in imposing the two-level enhancement because the facts supporting it were neither alleged in the indictment nor found by the jury. Ricks does not chai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>lenge the accuracy of the district court\u2019s factual findings and resultant Guidelines determinations. In our earlier consideration of his sentence, we specifically rejected Ricks\u2019s assertion that the facts supporting this enhancement must be alleged in the indictment. <em>Ricks, </em>166 Fed.Appx. at 39 n.*.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">After <em>Booker, </em>a district court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). However, in imposing a sentence post-<em>Booker, </em>courts still must calculate the applicable Guidelines range after making the appropriate findings of fact and consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the Guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2007). <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). This court will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it \u201cis within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">The district court explicitly treated the Guidelines as advisory, and sentenced Ricks only after considering the Sentencing Guidelines, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and counsel\u2019s arguments. Although the district court did not recite facts to support each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, the court need not \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection\u201d or \u201cexplicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>445 F.3d at 345. Thus, the Sixth Amendment error that occurred at the first sentencing was cured by Ricks\u2019s resentencing under an advisory Guidelines scheme. We also conclude that Ricks\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">We therefore affirm Ricks\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b967-14\"> <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
