His attorney filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Brown\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief raises the issue of whether his plea was knowing and voluntary. Brown filed a supplemental pro se brief raising the issues of whether the Armed Career Criminal Act was applied in error to his sentence and whether counsel was ineffective for allegedly failing to examine Brown\u2019s prior conviction file. The Government has declined to file a responding brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-24\">Brown suggests that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary. Brown never sought to withdraw his guilty plea, and we therefore review his allegations for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525-26 (4th Cir.2002). The district court ensured that Brown fully understood the significance of his guilty plea and that the plea was knowing and voluntary. The district court satisfactorily complied with its Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 obligations, and we therefore reject Brown\u2019s challenge to the integrity of his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-25\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal, including those advanced by Brown in his supplemental pro se brief. We therefore affirm Brown\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>sel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
