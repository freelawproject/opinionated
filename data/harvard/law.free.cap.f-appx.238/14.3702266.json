Although we ordinarily have authority to review only the BIA\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision where, as here, the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision without an opinion. <em>E.g., Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-21\">Melendez-Parada concedes the IJ correctly found his past mistreatment by the MS gang in El Salvador did not rise to the level of persecution. He contends the IJ erred, however, by failing to consider the probability of, and possible motivations for, future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-22\">Melendez-Parada does not meet his burden of showing, or even allege, fear of persecution based on his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, as is required to obtain asylum. <em>See Majd v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 590, 595 (5th Cir.2006). Rather, he seeks relief based on his past encounters with a criminal gang and his fear of future such encounters.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-23\">The record indicates MelendezParada\u2019s fear of persecution is based solely on gang violence in his college town in El Salvador. \u201c[A]n applicant\u2019s fear of perse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>cution cannot be <em>based solely </em>on general violence and civil disorder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 188 (5th Cir.2004)) (alteration in original). Moreover, because the standard of proof required to establish eligibility for withholding of removal is higher than that required for asylum, \u201cfailure to establish eligibility for asylum is dispositive of claims for withholding of removal\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b35-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
