On appeal, Lindsay raises three claims. First, he argues that there was no factual basis to support his guilty plea to possessing a firearm (a Lorcin .380 caliber semiautomatic handgun) that had an obliterated serial number, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(k), because, at the plea colloquy, he denied knowing of the obliteration. Second, Lindsay claims that the district court erred at sentencing by providing an insufficient explanation to support a Guidelines-departure sentence, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. Finally, he challenges the reasonableness of the district court\u2019s imposition of an upward variance from a Guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>range of 168 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment to a 420-month term of imprisonment. After thorough review of the record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The facts relevant to our analysis are these. On February 23, 2006, Lindsay was indicted on four counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm or ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2) (Counts 1^1); two counts of delivering a firearm or ammunition to a juvenile, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(x)(l) and 924(a)(6)(B) (Counts 5 and 6); one count of possessing a firearm that had an obliterated serial number, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(k) and 924(a)(1)(B) (Count 7); and one count of discharging a firearm in a school zone, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(q)(2) and (3) and 924(a)(1)(B) and (a)(4) (Count 8). The charges arose out of Lorcin\u2019s possession of ammunition for various types of guns, including a Remington 9mm, a Winchester .380 caliber, and a Lorcin .380 caliber, and possession of a Lorcin .380 caliber semiautomatic handgun. On the eve of trial, Lindsay pled guilty to the charges against him, without the benefit of a written plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">During the subsequent plea colloquy, the district court first confirmed that Lindsay: understood the plea proceedings; was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol; did not suffer from a mental or emotional illness; understood his constitutional rights associated with a trial by jury and his waiver of those rights; and understood his right to appeal his guilt and his waiver of that right. The court then instructed Lindsay: \u201cIf I accept your plea, you must understand you won\u2019t be able to change your mind later and withdraw the plea. This is the time to make that decision, and it will be binding upon you. Do you understand that?\u201d Lindsay indicated that he understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">The government then made its factual proffer in support of the plea. As part of the proffer on Count 7 of the indictment, which charged that Lindsay possessed \u201ca Lorcin .380 caliber ..., knowing that the manufacturer\u2019s serial number had been removed and obliterated from the firearm,\u201d the government stated: \u201cThat handgun had an obliterated serial number. Each of the numbers on that handgun had been drilled out with a drill bit, ... and the defendant did know the serial number on that firearm has been drilled out prior to his possession.\u201d The government also proffered that its evidence at trial would include: \u201ca number of witnesses that would testify that the firearm was, in fact, the defendant\u2019s Lorcin .380 and that he had left it at Alex Burkholter\u2019s home to come and retrieve it on other occasions. We have other witnesses, Your Honor, that would testify to him being in possession of the firearm on various other instances and those could be provided as 404(b) notice to the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">The government\u2019s proffer prompted the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-11\">[Lindsay\u2019s Attorney]: Judge, [Lindsay] was talking about that he didn\u2019t really know that the obliterated serial number was there, but I explained to him that it could be a real knowledge that he knew or should have known that it was obliterated by close examination. That\u2019s the way I explained it to him. He said he really didn\u2019t \u2014 wasn\u2019t aware of the obliterated serial number at the time, that the gun was retrieved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-12\">The Court: But you do acknowledge that you were in possession of that gun? Lindsay: Yes, sir, I understand that, but I was just confused because, know what I\u2019m saying. She got the people that\u2019s going to come and say they seen the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>gun, but just like them, I bet ain\u2019t nobody going to say they knew that that gun was like that. I couldn\u2019t even really see it. The police when they first took us to jail, they ain\u2019t even noticed it, you know. He brought it to my attention. He was like putting me in the car and we went around the corner \u2014 when he was around the corner, he was like, you know what I\u2019m saying, and he\u2019s like saying upon close look, he was like \u2014 but that\u2019s probably their job to look for that. I wasn\u2019t even-it don\u2019t matter. I\u2019m pleading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\">The Court: Other than that, are all the other facts correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">Lindsay: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">The Court: Did you do what the government says that you did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">Lindsay: Yes, sir. I\u2019m plea[d]ing. I\u2019m cop[p]ing out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">Lindsay then confirmed that he had discussed the Sentencing Guidelines with counsel and understood that neither his attorney nor the court knew what the final sentence would be, but that the Guidelines were only advisory so that the court could impose a sentence above or below the advisory range. Lindsay pled guilty to all eight counts of the indictment. The district court found that Lindsay was \u201calert and intelligent,\u201d understood the nature of the charges against him, and appreciated the consequences of his guilty plea. The court further found that the government\u2019s factual proffer was sufficient to support the plea, and that Lindsay\u2019s plea was \u201cfreely and voluntarily and understandably made.\u201d The court accepted the guilty plea, and Lindsay proceeded to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), the conduct leading to Count 7 of the indictment was the following. On September 9, 2005, law enforcement officers responded to a report of \u201cshots fired\u201d at the Woodham High School in Escambia County, Florida. Jamie Kennedy, who lodged the complaint, reported to the officers that she had seen three young black males run down the street being chased by a slimly built black male, and that she heard one shot fired. As part of the investigation, law enforcement interviewed numerous students at the school and Kinard Franklin, who stated that he and another individual accompanied Lindsay over to Woodham High School on the day of the shooting. Lindsay told Franklin that he was going to take care of someone who had gotten into an argument with \u201cS.S.\u201d (a female juvenile, aged 15). Franklin said he did not know that Lindsay was armed until Lindsay pulled out a gun and started shooting at a group of males. Lindsay then ran after the males shooting at them. Franklin and the other individual who had accompanied Lindsay then got back into the car and left the scene, returning later to pick up Lindsay. \u201cE.T.B.\u201d (another female juvenile) reported to law enforcement that she had overheard Lindsay and \u201cS.S.\u201d discussing the Woodham High School shooting. Lindsay admitted to \u201cE.T.B.\u201d that he had fired a pistol at \u201cD.R.\u201d (a male juvenile) because D.R. had harassed S.S. earlier that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">Two days later, on December 11, 2005, Lindsay was arrested at the home of Alex Burkholter, a male juvenile, aged 16, as he (Lindsay) tried to crawl out of the window of Burkholter\u2019s bedroom. After Lindsay was arrested, Burkholter directed law enforcement officials to a shoebox that contained a gun which had been painted black and had an obliterated serial number. According to the arresting officer who found the gun, a Lorcin .380 caliber semi-automatic pistol, the gun still smelled of fresh paint. The PSI stated: \u201cThe serial number on the firearm had been removed. It was noted there were five individual depressions (appear to be drill marks) on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>both sides of the handgun where a serial number would normally be located. The fact that the gun had recently been painted proves that Lindsay knew about the serial number seeing as he would have had to observe [ ] the drilled out nature of the numbers in order to paint the gun.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">The PSI assigned a base offense level of 20, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A), and recommended the following adjustments: (1) a 2-level increase, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4), because of the involvement of a firearm with an obliterated serial number; (2) a 4-level increase, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), because Lindsay used or possessed a firearm in connection with another felony offense; (3) a 2-level increase, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.4, for using or attempting to use a person less than 18 years old to commit the offense or avoid detection of the offense; and (4) a 2-level increase, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3cl.l, for willfully obstructing or impeding justice. Lindsay\u2019s adjusted offense level was 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Lindsay was also given 25 criminal history points for his prior criminal convictions, which included convictions for (1) battery on a school board member, (2) trespass (three times), (3) reckless driving, (4) driving without a valid driver\u2019s license, (5) resisting arrest without violence (three times), (6) indecent exposure, (7) battery on a detention staff member, (8) giving a false name to a law enforcement officer, (9) possession of a controlled substance (twice), (10) possession of drug paraphernalia, (11) driving with a suspended license, and (12) assault. Lindsay received two additional criminal history points, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(e), because he committed the instant offenses less than two years after he was released from custody. With 27 criminal history points, Lindsay was assigned a criminal history category YI. The advisory Guidelines imprisonment range he faced was 168 to 210 months. The PSI recommended that the district court apply an upward variance from the Guidelines range and sentence Lindsay to 420 months\u2019 imprisonment based on the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">Lindsay filed objections to the PSI, challenging, inter alia, the increase to his offense level for possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number. He asserted that he did not know about the obliteration, and that his \u201cguilty plea to [knowingly possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number] would seem to be questionable as to a factual basis at this juncture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">At the sentencing hearing, Ronald Williams, a special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, testified about the activities reported in the PSI. He described his recovery of the Lorcin .380 pistol Burkholter\u2019s house. When he found the gun, Special Agent Williams noted that the gun had been freshly painted as it had \u201cthe odor of fresh paint.\u201d The government also presented the testimony of Burkholter, who identified the Lorcin pistol and stated that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>had not handled the handgun found in his room, but that Lindsay had come to his house on several occasions and taken the gun, which Lindsay stored at Burkholter\u2019s house for a period of two or three months. Officer James Moretz, of the Escambia County Sheriffs office, also was present at Burkholter\u2019s house when Lindsay was arrested and the Lorcin pistol was found. Officer Moretz testified that upon recovering the firearm when Lindsay was arrested, he immediately noticed that there were drill marks on both sides of the handgun where the serial number would normally be, and that the pistol had been \u201chand-painted, sort of rough.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">After the government\u2019s presentation of evidence, Lindsay renewed his objection to the enhancement to his offense level for the involvement of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. The district court examined the Lorcin .380, which was marked as \u201cExhibit 3,\u201d and overruled Lindsay\u2019s objection, stating: \u201cExhibit 3 demonstrates the most obvious obliteration that I\u2019ve ever witnessed. I don\u2019t think anyone would pick that gun up without knowing that it\u2019s obliterated serial numbers. So that objection is overruled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">After ruling on Lindsay\u2019s other objections to the PSI, and hearing Lindsay\u2019s statement in mitigation of his sentence, the government\u2019s argument in support of an upward variance, and Lindsay\u2019s counsel\u2019s argument in support of a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, the district court adopted the PSI\u2019s recommendations and imposed a 420-month term of imprisonment comprised of: 120 months\u2019 imprisonment each for Counts 1 to 3, with the terms to run consecutively; 120 months\u2019 imprisonment as to Count 4, to run concurrently with the other counts; 12 months\u2019 imprisonment each for Counts 5 and 6, with the terms to run concurrently and concurrently with the other counts; 60 months\u2019 imprisonment for Count 7, to run concurrently with all other Counts; and 60 months\u2019 imprisonment for Count 8, to run consecutively to Counts 1, 2, and 3. The district judge then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">In making this decision, I have consulted the advisory sentencing guidelines and calculated the applicable advisory range of 168 to 210 months. I then made an effort to determine if pursuant to the guideline policy statements that any sentence outside of the advisory range were clearly appropriate. In this case, I do find that the guidelines provide limited grounds for an upward departure, which includes multiple acts of obstructive conduct under [U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0], factors not adequately taken into account by the guidelines, second, the use of more than one minor in this criminal conduct, which is pursuant to [U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.4], and the inadequacy of your criminal history category pursuant to [U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-9\">However, even with a guided departure under the guidelines, but based upon the above factors, I find this sentence would still not be sufficient in your case. And I then considered all of the factors in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">The district court then discussed and applied to the facts of the case the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and stated that Lindsay\u2019s extensive history of criminal acts, which gave him more than <em>twice </em>as many points as were necessary to be placed in criminal history category VI, indicated that he would continue to be involved in violent acts in the future. The court highlighted that such a criminal history was particularly noteworthy because Lindsay was only 24 years old, and that the criminal history and obstructive conduct demonstrated that Lindsay had little respect for the law. The court found that there was no unwarranted sentencing disparity resulting from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>the term imposed here because \u201cany defendant appearing before this court with the type of criminal record and type of offenses and convictions that you have would be facing a similar sentence based upon the multiple aggravating factors I\u2019ve just discussed.\u201d Finally, the court noted that it considered the advisory Guidelines range and found that it was not \u201cby any means ... sufficient in [this] case.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">First, Lindsay contends that the district court erred by accepting his guilty plea because there was an insufficient factual basis for the plea to be knowing and voluntary, in violation of Rule 11(b)(3) and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Lindsay asserts that at the plea colloquy, he denied that he knew the Lorcin .380 caliber handgun was obliterated and the government failed to establish a sufficient factual basis as to the scienter element for the \u00a7 922(k) crime with which he was charged. Thus, he says, his guilty plea to that crime was not knowing and voluntary, as required by Rule 11 and due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The applicable standards of review are well-settled. Generally, the district court\u2019s \u201cfactual finding that the requirements of [Fed.R.Crim.P.] 11 were satisfied when it accepted the defendants\u2019 pleas is subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>907 F.2d 1096, 1099 (11th Cir.1990). Lindsay, however, did not raise his due process or Rule 11 arguments in the district court, either by objecting or by moving to withdraw his guilty plea. Constitutional objections and alleged violations of Rule 11 that were not raised before the district court are reviewed only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1018-19 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). To establish plain error, a defendant must show (1) error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects substantial rights, and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, 545 </em>U.S. 1127, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">The Supreme Court has held that \u201ca defendant who seeks reversal of his conviction after a guilty plea, on the ground that the district court committed plain error under Rule 11, must show a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004). \u201cA defendant must thus satisfy the judgment of the reviewing court, informed by the entire record, that the probability of a different result is sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This requirement mirrors the third prong of the plain error test, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>\u201crequires that an error have affected substantial rights, which almost always requires that the error must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1299. In reviewing the entire record to gauge the effect of an error on a defendant\u2019s substantial rights, the Supreme Court recognized the obvious: when the record made for a guilty plea and sentencing reveals strong evidence and no apparent defenses, \u201cone can fairly ask a defendant seeking to withdraw his plea what he might ever have thought he could gain by going to trial.\u201d <em>Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. at 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">To satisfy the requirements of due process, a guilty plea must be entered into knowingly and voluntarily. <em>Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d at 1019. To determine that a guilty plea is knowing and voluntary, the district court must address the three core concerns of Rule 11 at the plea colloquy, which are that the \u201cdefendant (1) enters his guilty plea free from coercion, (2) understands the nature of the charges, and (3) understands the consequences of his plea.\u201d <em>Id.; see United States v. Frye, </em>402 F.3d 1123, 1127 (11th Cir.2005); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(G) (requiring the district court to determine that the defendant understands \u201cthe nature of each charge to which the defendant is pleading\u201d). In this appeal, Lindsay argues the district court did not comply with the second core concern of Rule 11 because the court did not apprise him of, and the government did not establish a factual basis to support a finding on, one of the elements of the \u00a7 922(k) offense to which he pled.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The Supreme Court has held that a guilty plea is not voluntary if the defendant has such an incomplete understanding of the charge that his plea cannot stand as an intelligent admission of guilt. <em>Marshall v. Lonberger, </em>459 U.S. 422, 431, 103 S.Ct. 843, 74 L.Ed.2d 646 (1983). We review each case individually to ensure that the defendant understood the nature of the charges because the Rule 11 inquiry will necessarily vary from case to case. <em>United States v. James, </em>210 F.3d 1342, 1344 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cIn considering whether a Rule 11 error occurred or prejudiced a defendant, we may consider the whole record, not just the plea colloquy.\u201d <em>Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d at 1020 n. 4; <em>see also United States v. Monroe, </em>353 F.3d 1346, 1350 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201c[I]n the Rule 11 context, the reviewing court may consult the whole record when considering the effect of any error on substantial rights.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">After reviewing the record from the plea hearing as a whole, we will affirm the district court, \u201cif the record provides a basis for the court\u2019s finding that the defendant understood what he was admitting and that what he was admitting constituted the crime charged.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>907 F.2d at 1099. The Supreme Court has stated that in determining whether there is a factual basis for a plea under Rule 11, \u201c[t]he judge must determine that the conduct which the defendant admits constitutes the offense charged in the indictment or information or an offense included therein to which the defendant has pleaded guilty.\u201d <em>McCarthy v. United States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 467, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969). The standard for evaluating challenges to the factual basis for a guilty plea is whether the district court was presented with evidence from which it could <em>reasonably </em>find that the defendant was guilty. <em>United States v. Owen, </em>858 F.2d 1514, 1517 (11th Cir.1988) (per curiam). In advising a defendant of the nature of the charges against him, there is no requirement in Rule 11(c) \u201cthat a district court must list each element of the offense <em>seriatim.\u201d United States v. Wiggins, </em>131 F.3d 1440, 1442-42 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Lindsay asserts that the district court failed to inform him that the government would have to prove that he knew of the obliteration to the Lorcin handgun, and that this omission constituted a violation of the second core concern of Rule 11. On this record, we discern no error that was plain and that affected Lindsay\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(k), it is illegal to knowingly possess any firearm that has had the serial number obliterated. In addition, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(1)(B) states that anyone who \u201cknowingly violates [\u00a7 922(k)]\u201d is subject to imprisonment. While we have not directly addressed the issue, other circuits have consistently held that the defendant must know of the obliteration to be convicted under \u00a7 922(k). <em>See United States v. Thornton, </em>463 F.3d 693, 699 (7th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Sullivan, </em>455 F.3d 248, 261 (4th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Haywood, </em>363 F.3d 200, 206 (3d Cir.2004) (citing cases from the 1st, 2d, 5th, and D.C. Circuits). For purposes of evaluating the district court\u2019s compliance with Rule 11 as to the \u00a7 922(k) charge in this case, we will assume that knowledge of the obliteration is an element of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">At the plea colloquy, the government proffered that it would present the testimony of \u201ca number of witnesses\u201d concerning Lindsay\u2019s possession of the firearm on numerous occasions, as well as his conduct in storing it and retrieving it from Alex Burkholter\u2019s house on other occasions. Moreover, based on Lindsay\u2019s sentencing objection to the enhancement of his offense level for use of an obliterated weapon, the record contains the testimony of many of the government\u2019s witnesses, including Alex Burkholter, who described Lindsay\u2019s possession of the Lorcin .380 handgun. Again, in reviewing an alleged Rule 11 error, \u201cwe may consider the whole record, not just the plea colloquy.\u201d <em>Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d at 1020 n. 4; <em>Monroe, </em>353 F.3d at 1350.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">At the plea colloquy, Lindsay\u2019s counsel stated that Lindsay had indicated he \u201cdidn\u2019t really know that the obliterated serial number was there.\u201d Counsel said that he had informed Lindsay that it could be \u201creal knowledge that he knew\u201d or \u201che should have known\u201d of the obliteration. In response, the district court confirmed with Lindsay that he admitted to possession of the weapon, which the district court later described, at the sentencing hearing, as having \u201cthe most obvious obliteration that I\u2019ve ever witnesses.\u201d Moreover, at the sentencing hearing, the government presented the testimony of Special Agent Williams and Officer Moretz, both of whom described the fresh coat of paint that they discerned on the firearm when it was retrieved from Alex Burkholter\u2019s bedroom, where Lindsay was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">The Fourth Circuit is one of our sister courts to have addressed the elements of a \u00a7 922(k) offense. In discussing the knowledge requirement, the court said: \u201cThe defendant must know of the alteration. Knowledge of defacement of the serial number may be inferred where the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>dant has possessed the gun under conditions under which an ordinary man would have inspected the pistol and discovered the absence of a serial number.\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>455 F.3d at 261 (citing <em>United States v. Haywood, </em>363 F.3d 200, 206 (3d Cir.2004), and <em>United States v. Moore, </em>54 F.3d 92, 101 (2d Cir.1995)). Although <em>Sullivan </em>involved a defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support a jury verdict, and thus the appeal presented a different procedural context and involved different standards of review, the Fourth Circuit\u2019s holding that the jury reasonably could have inferred knowledge of the obliteration, where the defendant regularly carried and possessed the obliterated weapon, is instructive here. <em>See also United States v. Thornton, </em>463 F.3d 693, 699 (7th Cir.2006) (holding that circumstantial evidence of defendant\u2019s control over a firearm with an obliterated serial number could support the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant knew the serial number had been obliterated, \u201cgiven that one need only look at the gun to attain that knowledge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">From our review of the entire record, including the plea colloquy, the PSI, and the sentencing transcript, we cannot say that Lindsay has satisfied his burden on the first prong of the plain-error test \u2014 to establish error relating to the factual basis for his plea. On the record before us, we are satisfied that, like the factfinder in <em>Sullivan </em>(and Thornton), the district court was presented with evidence from which it could <em>reasonably </em>find that the defendant was guilty. <em>See Owen, </em>858 F.2d at 1517 (standard for evaluating challenges to the factual basis for a guilty plea is whether the district court was presented with evidence from which it could <em>reasonably </em>find that the defendant was guilty). Accordingly, we discern no error, plain or otherwise, based on Rule 11 or due process.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">Next, Lindsay argues the district court erred by imposing an upward departure, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, based on the inadequacy of his criminal history. The government responds that the district court applied a variance, rather than an upward departure, because the court rested its determination on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and not \u00a7 4A1.3 of the Guidelines. In determining whether a decision to sentence a defendant above the Guidelines range is a variance or a departure, we have considered two factors: (1) whether the sentencing court cited to a specific departure provision in the guidelines, and (2) whether the district court noted the inadequacy of the guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Eldick, </em>443 F.3d 783, 788 &amp; n. 2 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 251, 166 L.Ed.2d 196 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-12\">After <em>Eldick, </em>we have expanded on the distinction between an upward departure and a variance. See <em>United States v. Irizarry, </em>458 F.3d 1208 (11th Cir.2006), <em>pet. for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Oct. 26, 2006) (No. 06-7517). In <em>Irizarry, </em>the district court im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>posed a statutory maximum sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment after it had calculated a Guidelines range of 41 to 51 months. <em>Id. </em>at 1210. We determined that the higher-than-Guidelines sentence was a variance, not an upward departure, noting the following: (1) the district court considered the adequacy of its correctly-calculated advisory guidelines range \u201cin light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the evidence presented at the sentencing hearing,\u201d and (2) it was clear that the district court was exercising \u201cits <em>post-Booker </em>discretion to impose a reasonable sentence outside the sentencing guidelines range,\u201d because the district court had concluded that a sentence within the range was inadequate to address one of the specific \u00a7 3553(a) factors, to protect the public. <em>Id. </em>at 1211-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Here, just like in <em>Eldick </em>and <em>Irizarry, </em>the district court\u2019s decision to impose a higher-than-Guidelines sentence was based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as stated by the court during the sentencing hearing and recommended by the PSI, which the district court adopted. The district court stated that the advisory Guidelines range was 168 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment and noted, on numerous occasions, the inadequacy of the range, in light of Lindsay\u2019s recidivism, the need for deterrence and protection of the public, the violent nature of the firearms offenses, and the involvement of numerous juveniles in the commission of the offenses. In short, because the district court did not reference a Guideline as support for the higher sentence, but repeatedly discussed facts pertaining to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we readily conclude that the sentence was a variance, and not an upward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Finally, Lindsay contends that his sentence was not reasonable within the meaning of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). After <em>Booker, </em>we review the defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir.2005). The Supreme Court recently elaborated on reasonableness review, noting that \u201cappellate \u2018reasonableness\u2019 review merely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both that record and the factors in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). A district court is not required to state \u201cthat it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Moreover, we have stated that \u201cthere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose ...\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-12\">Lindsay\u2019s total sentence of twice the maximum applicable guidelines range without any departures is clearly severe, but on this record we cannot conclude it was unreasonable, or an abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion under <em>Booker. </em>Rather, the district court gave a detailed discussion of its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when it sentenced Lindsay. The court considered, <em>inter alia, </em>the severity of Lindsay\u2019s crime, the victims and the number of innocent people put at risk by his crimes, his past criminal conduct, and the obstructive conduct Lindsay engaged in after he was arrested.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>district court specifically noted that it could have relief on some of these facts to depart above the otherwise applicable guidelines range but, instead, chose to exercise its discretion to impose a upward <em>variance </em>based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors because the court did not believe that a Guideline <em>departure </em>sentence would provide sufficient punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">So long as the resulting sentence reflects consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and is reasonable, it is within the district court\u2019s discretion to impose the sentence. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Moreover, in light of the extreme nature of Lindsay\u2019s current crimes, his extensive criminal history, and his numerous attempts to obstruct justice while he was incarcerated, the total sentence imposed by the district court was not outside of the \u201crange of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, we find that Lindsay has failed to establish that his total sentence is unreasonable under <em>Booker. </em>The Sentencing Guidelines advisory range was calculated correctly, and the district court expressly considered that range and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in imposing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-8\">. The PSI also indicated that Lindsay engaged in the following conduct. On August 29, 2005, Lindsay came uninvited to a birthday party and pointed a gun between S.M.\u2019s (a female juvenile, aged 16) eyes at a very close distance. On September 1, 2005, after Lindsay had an oral dispute with Sasha Calbert, with whom he shares a child, and her brother, Quantas Culbert, Lindsay fired shots at Quantas as he drove by Lindsay. On September 16, 2005, Edwin Gibbons was having a birthday party for his daughter. Gibbons heard squealing tires in front of his house and went outside and asked Lindsay, who had not been invited to the party, to leave. Lindsay then pulled a handgun from his pants, \u201ccircled the action,\u201d and pointed it towards Gibbons, saying, \"I'll do as I want to. I'm 23 years old, and I'll cap you.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b608-7\">. The government suggests that Lindsay waived his ability to bring this appeal by entering an unconditional guilty plea. We disagree. In the instant appeal, Lindsay asserts that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary because he was not informed of the elements of one of the crimes to which he pled. While it is true that an unconditional guilty plea constitutes a waiver of all non-jurisdictional arguments, it is well-settled that for a plea to effect such a waiver, the plea itself must be <em>knowing </em>and <em>voluntary. See Wilson v. United States, </em>962 F.2d 996, 997 (11th Cir. 1992) (\"A defendant who enters a plea of guilty waives all non-jurisdictional challenges to the constitutionality of the conviction, and only an attack on the voluntary and knowing nature of the plea can be sustained.\u201d); <em>United States v. Fairchild, </em>803 F.2d 1121, 1124 (11th Cir.1986) (holding that a knowing and voluntary guilty plea waives all non-jurisdictional defects in the proceedings against a defendant); <em>United States v. Yunis, </em>723 F.2d 795, 796 (11th Cir.1984) (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b610-6\">. In explaining which parts of the record may be included in a court\u2019s review of a Rule 11 violation, the Supreme Court, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002), stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">The Advisory Committee intended the effect of error to be assessed on an existing record, no question, but it did not mean to limit that record strictly to the plea proceedings: the enquiry \" 'must be resolved solely on the basis of the Rule 11 transcript\u2019 <em>and the other portions (e.g., sentencing hearing) of the limited record </em>made in such cases.\u201d Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes 1569 (quoting <em>United States v. Coronado, </em>554 F.2d 166, 170, n. 5 (5[th Cir.] 1977)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">535 U.S. at 74, 122 S.Ct. 1043 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b611-6\">. Moreover, even if we were to find error that was plain, Lindsay\u2019s appeal would fail on the third prong of the test for plain error. He has not contended, much less offered evidence showing, that, but for the court's failure to instruct him explicitly on the knowledge element of a \u00a7 922(k) offense, he would not have pled guilty. <em>See Dominguez Benitez, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2340. The evidence against Lindsay was strong, and it is unclear what benefit he could possibly have received by withdrawing his plea and proceeding to trial. \"When the record made for a guilty plea and sentencing reveals [strong evidence of guilt] ... one can fairly ask a defendant seeking to withdraw his plea what he might ever have thought he could gain by going to trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b612-7\">. According to the PSI, while he was in local custody at the Escambia County Jail and prior to his federal indictment, Lindsay made several phone calls to potential witnesses about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>their testimony at his trial. These jail-house phone calls were recorded by the authorities. Lindsay told one witness: \"don\u2019t talk to the feds, don\u2019t flip on <em>me </em>when I go to trial.\u201d In other phone calls, he discussed bribing potential witnesses, including Quantas Culbert, at whom Lindsay fired shots on September 1, 2005, and Edwin Gibbons, at whom Lindsay brandished a gun on September 15, 2005 and stated, \"I\u2019ll do as I want to. I\u2019m 23 years old, and I\u2019ll cap you.\u201d In yet another conversation, Lindsay said he needed \"to have somebody \u2018F\u2019 Alex [Burkholter] up.\u201d Most of the witnesses involved were juveniles, and Lindsay's phone privileges eventually were revoked, after the witnesses\u2019 parents contacted authorities with their concerns for their children's safety. Even after his phone privileges were cancelled, Lindsay continued to contact the potential witnesses, either by having other inmates place \"three-way\u201d phone calls or by using a contraband cell phone in his cell to text-message and call witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
