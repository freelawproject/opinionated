Rodriguez was sentenced to 300 months imprisonment. The trial court denied Rodriguez\u2019 subsequent motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-19\">In July 2006, Rodriguez filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. Rodriguez claimed that pursuant to the recent statutory interpretation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) in <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>420 F.3d 111 (2nd Cir.2005), he was improperly convicted and actually innocent of the \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) offense. The District Court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction. The District Court also denied Rodriguez\u2019 motion to alter or amend its judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-20\">As an initial matter, we are not bound by the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Gonzalez </em>and therefore decline to determine whether, as Rodriguez argues, it is retroactively applicable on collateral review or otherwise rendered the sentencing court without jurisdiction. Furthermore, we agree with the District Court\u2019s thorough analysis set forth in its memorandum opinions dated September 28, 2006 and November 26, 2006. In short, Rodriguez\u2019 reliance on <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245 (3d Cir.1997) is misplaced. In <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117 (3d Cir.2002) we recognized the narrowness of our holding in <em>Dorsainvil. </em>307 F.3d at 120. We held that an intervening change in'law affecting sentencing did not render the petitioner\u2019s offense of conviction, conspiracy to import heroin, noncriminal. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, we concluded that \u00a7 2255 was not \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to raise the claim, and thus the District Court lacked jurisdiction to consider the \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See id. </em>at 121. Similarly, Rodriguez\u2019 claim does not render his offense of conviction noncriminal, and thereby does not fall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>within the \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d safety valve of \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Because \u00a7 2241 petitions are to be filed in the district of confinement, we find no error in the District Court\u2019s failure to transfer the matter to the Second Circuit. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Accordingly, as there is no substantial question presented by this appeal, we will summarily affirm. Third Circuit LAR 27.4; Third Circuit I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b788-17\">. As a federal prisoner, Rodriguez is not required to obtain a certificate of appealability to appeal the denial of his \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>United States v. Cepero, </em>224 F.3d 256, 264-65 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
