He appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-28\">Patton claims that the district court erred by dismissing his claims, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>called into question the validity of his conviction and sentence, as barred under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). He argues, based on concurring and dissenting opinions in <em>Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998), that he should have been allowed to raise his claims in a \u00a7 1983 action because he is no longer in custody and has no habeas remedy available to challenge the validity of his convictions or sentences. We have rejected that argument previously. <em>Randell v. Johnson, </em>227 F.3d 300, 301 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Next, Patton challenges the dismissal of his claims with prejudice to the extent they were barred by judicial, prosecutorial, and qualified immunity. He contends that the defendants were not entitled to immunity because they engaged in a private conspiracy against him. Patton\u2019s conelu-sional allegations are insufficient to pierce any applicable immunity. <em>See Arsenaux v. Roberts, </em>726 F.2d 1022, 1024 (5th Cir.1982); <em>see also Holloway v. Walker, </em>765 F.2d 517, 522 (5th Cir.1985) (holding that allegations of conspiracy will not void immunity for judicial acts).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Finally, Patton contends that the district court erred in denying him leave to amend his complaint, but he failed to identify any new facts that would have affected the disposition of his claims. Amendment is not required if it would be futile. <em>Whitley v. Hanna, </em>726 F.3d 631, 648 (5th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 1935, 188 L.Ed.2d 960 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b276-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
