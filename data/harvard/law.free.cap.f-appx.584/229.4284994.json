The Government moved for summary judgment. After considering McKinney\u2019s negligence claim under North Carolina law as required, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1), the district court granted the Government\u2019s motion and dismissed McKinney\u2019s action with prejudice. McKinney now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-23\">Summary judgment is proper if the movant shows that \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Nickell v. Beau View of Biloxi, L.L.C., </em>636 F.3d 752, 754 (5th Cir.2011). To recover on a negligence claim under North Carolina law, the plaintiff \u201cmust offer evidence of the essential elements of negligence: duty, breach of duty, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>proximate cause, and damages.\u201d <em>Camalier v. Jeffries, </em>340 N.C. 699, 460 S.E.2d 133, 136 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">The district court assumed that BOP officials had a duty to assist McKinney in disembarking from the airplane, that the duty was breached, and that McKinney fell down the steps as a result of that breach of duty. The Government presented evidence showing the following. McKinney sustained an elbow abrasion and complained of lower back pain, but x-rays showed only degenerative changes in McKinney\u2019s elbow and back. The medical staff at FMC Butner did not observe any manifestation of any injury to McKinney\u2019s back. The day after his fall, a medical examination revealed that McKinney had a normal gait with no limp and that he had a full range of motion in his back, arms, and legs. Eight days after the fall, a doctor examining McKinney for an unrelated condition noted that he had no apparent leg problems or injuries. Although McKinney was issued a walker while at FMC Butner, it was not issued until almost three weeks after the fall. Additionally, a physical therapist who met with McKinney more than five weeks after the fall observed that McKinney could walk without difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The competent summary judgment evidence presented by the Government showed a complete absence of proof of an actionable physical injury to McKinney, an essential element of his negligence claim. <em>See Martin v. John W. Stone Oil Dist., </em>819 F.2d 547, 549 (5th Cir.1987). McKinney did not respond to the Government\u2019s motion and thus failed to meet his burden of pointing to some specific evidence to support his claim. <em>See Duffie v. United States, </em>600 F.3d 362, 371 (5th Cir.2010). Nothing in the record before us indicates that the district court erred in concluding that summary judgment was appropriate in this case. <em>See Melton v. Teachers Ins. &amp; Annuity Ass\u2019n of Am,., </em>114 F.3d 557, 559 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">McKinney argues for the first time in his reply brief that the district court erred in denying his request for the appointment of counsel. We do not consider this argument as it was not raised in McKinney\u2019s opening brief. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>426 F.3d 301, 304 n. 2 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b263-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
