Now, he appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition and argues that application of the four-part test given in <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972), shows that his speedy trial rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-18\">In reviewing the denial of \u00a7 2254 relief, this court reviews issues of law de novo and findings of fact for clear error. <em>Ortiz v. Quarterman, </em>504 F.3d 492, 496 (5th Cir.2007). Additionally, the state court\u2019s rejection of claims on the merits is afforded deference pursuant to \u00a7 2254(d). <em>See Miller v. Thaler, </em>714 F.3d 897, 902 n. 3 (5th Cir.2013). Under \u00a7 2254(d), habeas relief may not be granted with respect to a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(1), or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(2); <em>see Harrington v. Richter, </em>562 U.S. 86, 131 S.Ct. 770, 787, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-24\">Under <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972), this court considers four factors when assessing a defendant\u2019s claim that he was deprived of his constitutional right to a speedy trial: \u201cLength of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant.\u201d Prejudice is considered while bearing in mind the factors meant to be protected by a speedy trial: \u201c(i) to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration; (ii) to minimize anxiety and concern of the accused; and (iii) to limit the possibility that the defense will be impaired.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 532, 92 S.Ct. 2182.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-25\">The <em>Barker </em>analysis \u201ceschews rigid rules and mechanical factor-counting in favor of a difficult and sensitive balancing process.\u201d <em>Amos v. Thornton, </em>646 F.3d 199, 205 (5th Cir.2011). Consequently, \u00a7 2254(d) mandates that this court \u201cgive the widest of latitude to a state court\u2019s conduct of its speedy-trial analysis.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number><em>Amos, </em>646 F.3d at 205. Thus, so long as \u201cthere is any objectively reasonable basis on which the state court could have denied relief, AEDPA demands that [this court] respect its decision to do so.\u201d <em>Amos, </em>646 F.3d at 205. Our review of the record and application of the <em>Barker </em>analysis shows an objectively reasonable basis for the state court\u2019s rejection of this claim. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED, and Davis\u2019s request for appointed counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b241-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
