Dominguez-Espinoza challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that his sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He contends that the illegal reentry Guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is not empirically based and is therefore not subject to the presumption of reasonableness normally due to within-guideline sentences. He concedes that this argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366 (5th Cir.2009). He raises the argument to preserve it for possible review by the Supreme Court. He further argues that the guidelines double-counted his criminal record, produced a range overstating the seriousness of the offense, and failed to account for his benign motive for reentering the country, his family circumstances, and his cultural assimilation.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">We review sentences for substantive reasonableness, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A within-guidelines sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). \u201cThe presumption is rebutted only upon a showing that the sentence does not account for a factor that should receive significant weight, it gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or it represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">As he so concedes, Dominguez-Espinoza\u2019s argument that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply to his sentence because \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks empirical support has been rejected by this court. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 366-67 &amp; n. 7. In addition, Dominguez-Espinoza\u2019s arguments that the double-counting of a prior conviction makes his sentence unreasonable and that the guidelines overstate the seriousness of illegal reentry because it is, \u201cat bottom, an international trespass\u201d have also been previously rejected. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). Finally, Dominguez-Espinoza\u2019s argument concerning his benign motive for reentry fails to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The district court heard Dominguez-Espinoza\u2019s arguments concerning his reasons for reentering the United States before imposing a sentence within the advisory guidelines range. The district court considered Dominguez-Espinoza\u2019s personal history and characteristics and the other statutory sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a) prior to imposing the sentence. Dominguez-Espinoza\u2019s disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-guidelines sentence. <em>See Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Dominguez-Espinoza has not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion by sentencing him to a within-guidelines sentence of 46 months. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b239-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
