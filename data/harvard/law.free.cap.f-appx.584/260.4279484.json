He argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because he was entitled to a downward departure based on cultural assimilation. He also argues that he was entitled to a downward departure, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.3, based on \u201cthe immense psychological and mental hardship he has suffered in prison.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-20\">To the extent that Hernandez-Lopez is challenging the district court\u2019s refusal to downwardly depart from the recommended guidelines range, we do not have jurisdiction to review that decision. <em>See United States v. Barrera-Saucedo, </em>385 F.3d 533, 535 (5th Cir.2004). To the extent that he is challenging the denial of his request for downward variance, the record reflects that the district court considered Hernandez-Lopez\u2019s arguments for a below-guidelines sentence, including his cultural assimilation argument. The district court, however, determined that \u201cout of an abundance of mercy\u201d it would sentence Hernandez-Lopez to 41 months, despite the record \u201cjustify[ing] something more than just the guidelines.\u201d Hernandez-Lopez has failed to show that the district court failed to give proper weight to his arguments or any particular \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008). Hernandez-Lopez has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that is accorded his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (2008). Thus, he has failed to show that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b294-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
