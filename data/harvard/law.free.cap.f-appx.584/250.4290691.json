He asserts the district court erred by using unreliable information to determine the drug quantity used to calculate his base-offense level, and by increasing his offense level for his role as an organizer or leader.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the advisory Guidelines-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). A factual finding is not clearly erroneous so long as it is plausible in the light of the record as a whole. <em>E.g., United States v. Njoku, </em>737 F.3d 55, 77 (5th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 2319, 189 L.Ed.2d 196 (2014) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">Our analysis is limited to the quantity of drugs transported from Dallas, Texas, to Austin, Texas, because this is the drug quantity the district court assessed in determining Aeman\u2019s base-offense level. The district court also relied on the co-conspirators\u2019 statements, reported through an investigating officer\u2019s testimony at the sentencing hearing, to find this drug quantity. An investigation revealed Aleman and his co-conspirators distributed drugs. The co-conspirators, according to the officer, corroborated each other\u2019s statements by reporting the same location of the supply of drugs, amount of drugs transported per trip, and method of concealment. Ale-man\u2019s uncontradicted, post-arrest statement further corroborated their statements regarding the location of Aleman\u2019s supply of drugs. Given this indicia of reliability, particularly the consistency and specificity of the co-conspirators\u2019 statements, and the absence of any rebuttal evidence, the district court\u2019s drug-quantity finding was plausible in the light of the record as a whole and, therefore, not clearly erroneous. <em>E.g., Njoku, </em>737 F.3d at 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-13\">The district court\u2019s finding that Aleman was an organizer or leader pursuant to Guideline \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) was also plausible in the light of the record as a whole and, therefore, not clearly erroneous. <em>See id.; see also United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 245-46 (5th Cir.2005). Aleman managed the supply of drugs from his source in Dallas, coordinated the delivery of drugs to Austin; and supplied drugs to his co-conspirators for distribution. Evidence that co-conspirators sold drugs on Aleman\u2019s behalf, and that Aleman paid them to transport drugs and drug proceeds, substantiates the conclusion that Aleman exercised control and authority over his co-conspirators. Additionally, evidence demonstrates Aeman received a larger share of the proceeds because his co-conspirators sold drugs Aleman supplied on a consignment basis, and they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>returned most of the proceeds to him. Aleman also exercised decisionmaking authority by refusing to work with certain people.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b285-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
