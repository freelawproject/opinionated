She argues that her sentence, which exceeds the range set forth in the nonbinding policy statements set forth in Chapter Seven of the Sentencing Guidelines but is within the statutory maximum, is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to articulate its reasons for imposing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-22\">Revocation sentences generally are reviewed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)\u2019s \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.2011). As Ontiveros concedes, however, because she raised no objection in the district court, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009). Under the plain error standard, Ontiveros must show a clear or obvious error that affected her substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). This court has discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>The district court held an evidentiary hearing and heard the details of Ontive-ros\u2019s driving while intoxicated arrest, considered the nature of her supervised release conditions and violations, listened to counsel\u2019s explanation of why Ontiveros was contesting the revocation motion, heard Ontiveros\u2019s allocution, and considered her advisory policy statement range. The district court articulated two reasons for choosing a sentence above the advisory range \u2014 to provide deterrence and to protect the public. The court\u2019s reasons reflect its concern that an individual who drives while drinking 12 beers, while on supervised release from a prior conviction under conditions prohibiting such behavior, needs a sentence sufficient to deter and to protect the public. Because Ontive-ros made no argument concerning the appropriate sentence, the court had little left to explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The record reflects that the court considered the nature and circumstances of Ontiveros\u2019s supervised release violations and implicitly considered her history and characteristics in imposing sentence upon revocation. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1); <em>Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 262-65 (recognizing that implicit consideration of the \u00a7 3553 factors is sufficient to satisfy \u00a7 3553(e)\u2019s requirement that the district court provide reasons for an above guidelines sentence). Although the district court\u2019s statement in imposing sentence was brief, the district court\u2019s explanation, in the context of the revocation hearing, was sufficient, and, thus, Ontiveros has not shown clear or obvious error.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Even if the court had committed a clear or obvious error in failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence, Ontiveros has not shown that her substantial rights were affected or that any error seriously affected the public reputation of the proceedings. <em>See Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 262-65. Contrary to Ontiveros\u2019s suggestion that the court\u2019s error deprives this court of \u201cmeaningful appellate review,\u201d our review of the record of the sentencing proceedings in this case allows us to conduct a meaningful appellate review. <em>See Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 264. Nothing in the record suggests that a more thorough explanation would have resulted in a shorter sentence, and there is no suggestion in the record that the district court considered any improper factor or would impose a different sentence on remand. <em>See Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 264-65. Ontiveros has not demonstrated plain error with respect to her challenge to the district court\u2019s explanation of the sentence imposed upon revocation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">Ontiveros also argues, to preserve the issue for further review, that <em>Whitelaw </em>was wrongly decided and that we should adopt the reasoning of other circuits, discussed and rejected in <em>Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 263, which have held that the failure to explain a sentence affects substantial rights within the meaning of the plain error standard of review. One panel of this court may not overrule the decision of another absent an en banc or superseding Supreme Court decision. <em>See United States v. Lipscomb, </em>299 F.3d 303, 313 n. 34 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">Ontiveros also argues that the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate violations of her supervised release committed prior to the Northern District\u2019s acceptance of jurisdiction over her supervised release imposed in 2013 in the Western District of Texas. Conceding that her arguments are foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>379 F.3d 270 (5th Cir.2004), she contends that <em>Fernandez </em>was incorrectly decided, and she raises the issue to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>As Ontiveros concedes, whatever their merit, her arguments challenging the transfer of jurisdiction from the Western District to the Northern District are foreclosed by <em>Fernandez. See Fernandez, </em>379 F.3d at 272-77. Again, we may not overrule the decision of another panel of this court absent an en banc or superseding Supreme Court decision. <em>See Lipscomb, </em>299 F.3d at 313 n. 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b270-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
