He argues that his sentence, which is within the applicable guidelines range, is unreasonable. Guillen contends that his sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) because the district court applied undue weight to, and effectively double counted, his prior conviction for two counts of attempted murder and did not account for his motive for reentering the United States (i.e., to escape violence in El Salvador). He also asserts that the presumption of reasonableness does not apply to his sentence because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not supported by empirical data. We review the sentence for reasonableness, under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-22\">The record reflects that the district court\u2019s sentencing decision was based on an individualized assessment of the facts in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See id. </em>at 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586. The district court\u2019s determination of the appropriate sentence is entitled to deference, and we may not reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or reverse a sentence because we might reasonably conclude that a different sentence is proper. <em>Id. </em>at 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586. Guillen\u2019s arguments regarding the double counting of his prior conviction and his motive for reentering the United States are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that applies to his sentence. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). As Guillen concedes, we have rejected his argument that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply because \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b274-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
