We look first to whether the district court committed any significant procedural errors, and, if the sentence is procedurally sound, we consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-24\">Vasquez argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to explain adequately why it sentenced him above the guidelines range of imprisonment. Because Vasquez did not object to the procedural reasonableness of his sentence on this basis, plain error review applies. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>record reflects that the district court\u2019s oral and written pronouncements adequately explained its reasons for its sentence above the guidelines range. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Rajwani, </em>476 F.3d 243, 251 (5th Cir.2007). Vasquez has thus failed to show' any error, much less plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Next, Vasquez argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court overvalued the significance of his prior removals, undervalued the mitigating significance of the reason why he returned illegally, and overvalued his criminal history. The district court gave individualized, case-specific reasons for Vasquez\u2019s sentence, referencing \u00a7 3553(a) and noting Vasquez\u2019s criminal history, his recidivism, and the need to protect the public. Given that Vasquez entered the country illegally multiple times, then committed drug and alcohol offenses and assault, the district court\u2019s decision to vary from the advisory guidelines range was based on permissible factors that advanced the objectives set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. McElwee, </em>646 F.3d 328, 337-38 (5th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349-50 (5th Cir.2008); \u00a7 3553(a)(1) and (2). Vasquez essentially asks us to reweigh the sentencing factors, which we decline to do. <em>See McElwee, </em>646 F.3d at 343-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b229-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
