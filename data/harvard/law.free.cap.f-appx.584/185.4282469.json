He was sentenced to 165 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. He contends that the district court violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(i)(3)(B) and denied him due process by failing to rule on his objection to the drug quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-22\">Because Watkins did not raise these claims of error in the district court, review is for plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>453 F.3d 302, 305 (5th Cir.2006). The district court implicitly determined that a ruling on the drug quantity was unnecessary because it would not affect sentencing. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(B). Contrary to Watkins\u2019s argument, his unadjusted offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b), the career offender Guideline, was 32 because the offense statutory maximum was \u201c20 years or more, but less than 25 years.\u201d \u00a7 4B1.1(b)(3); <em>see </em>\u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). Thus, Watkins had the same total offense level and guidelines range under \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) as calculated in the presentence report under \u00a7 2D 1.1, the drug trafficking Guideline. Accordingly, the district court complied with Rule 32(i)(3)(B) and did not deprive Watkins of an opportunity to be heard on a material issue or fail to make relevant findings of fact. Further, Watkins cannot show that his substantial rights were affected. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. Even if the district court had ruled in his favor on the drug quantity, thus lowering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>his base offense level under \u00a7 2D 1.1, Watkins still would have faced the same guidelines range since the higher offense level under \u00a7 4B1.1 would have applied. <em>See </em>\u00a7 4Bl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b219-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
