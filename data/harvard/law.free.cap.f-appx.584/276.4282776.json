Acosta contends that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because of. his youth, his father\u2019s bad example, and the recently effective Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered offense levels for many drug offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Because Acosta did not object to the reasonableness of his sentence in the district court, his challenge on appeal is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). To succeed on plain error review, an appellant must show (1) a forfeited error (2) that is clear or obvious and (3) that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes that showing, this court may exercise its discretion \u201cto remedy the error ... if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks, bracketing, and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">\u201c[A] sentence within a properly calculated guideline sentencing range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). \u201cThe presumption is rebutted only upon a showing that the sentence does not account for a factor that should receive significant weight, it gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or it represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">The district court- noted Acosta\u2019s age, then determined that his criminal history rendered him a danger to society as a potential recidivist and concluded that a within-range sentence would address the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. Protection of the public and specific deterrence are among the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B), (C). Age and lack of guidance as a youth are factors that may be considered under \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 363 <em>&amp; </em>n. 4 (5th Cir.2009). However, an adult defendant\u2019s age, without more, does not render a within-range sentence substantively unreasonable, at least not to the extent that such a sentence is reversible under the plain error standard. <em>See United States v. Powell, </em>732 F.3d 361, 382 (5th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 1326, 188 L.Ed.2d 338 (2014). Moreover, the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is entitled to deference, and Acosta\u2019s mere disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of those factors does not establish that the sentence was substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-14\">Finally, the district court correctly used the Guidelines in effect at the time of Acosta\u2019s sentencing on May 2, 2014. <em>See United States v. Martin, </em>596 F.3d 284, 286 (5th Cir.2010). Amendment 782 becomes retroactively applicable effective November 1, 2015. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., App. C, Amend. 788. Acosta may seek a reduction in his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), to become effective on November 15, 2015, but he cannot obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>relief on direct appeal. <em>See Martin, </em>596 F.3d at 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b311-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
