Hood\u2019s allegations in the instant 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint involve claims arising from the time period of February 2010 until August 2010, while he was incarcerated at the Montgomery County Jail (MCJ). The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Appellees and dismissed Hood\u2019s complaint. Hood appeals, arguing that the Appellees violated his Eighth Amendment rights by acting with deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs and that the Appellees are not entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-21\">To meet the \u201cextremely high standard\u201d of deliberate indifference, Hood must establish that prison officials \u201crefused to treat him, ignored his complaints, intentionally treated him incorrectly, or engaged in any similar conduct that would clearly evince a wanton disregard for any serious medical needs.\u201d <em>Domino v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Crim. Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The official must \u201cknow[] of and disregard[] an excessive risk to inmate health or safety\u201d and \u201cbe aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists.\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). The official must also draw that inference. <em>Id. </em>\u201cUnsuccessful medical treatment, acts of negligence, or medical malpractice do not constitute deliberate indifference, nor does a prisoner\u2019s disagreement with his medical treatment, absent exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Gobert v. Caldwell, </em>463 F.3d 339, 346 (5th Cir.2006). A prisoner who alleges that he should have received further treatment also does not raise a claim of deliberate indifference. <em>Domino, </em>239 F.3d at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Hood\u2019s arguments on appeal amount to conclusional allegations and unsubstantiated assertions that are not supported by the record, which are insufficient to refute a summary judgment motion. <em>See Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc). At best, his arguments amount to disagreement with the medical treatment that he received while at MCJ, which included prescribed medications for the treatment of high blood pressure, constipation, depression and anxiety, and seizures. Hood\u2019s disagreement with the medical treatment that he received does not amount to deliberate indifference. <em>See Gobert, </em>463 F.3d at 346. Moreover, the record does not indicate that the Appellees acted subjectively with deliberate indifference to Hood\u2019s health and safety. <em>See Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970. Because Hood has failed to show that the Appellees violated a clearly established constitutional right, the Ap-pellees were entitled to qualified immunity on Hood\u2019s claims. <em>See Lytle v. Bexar County, Tex., </em>560 F.3d 404, 409 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b272-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
