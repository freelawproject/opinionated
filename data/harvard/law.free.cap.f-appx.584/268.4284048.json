SMITH, Circuit Judge.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b302-21\">Eugene J. Lockhart, Jr., pleaded guilty of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1343-44 and 1349. He was sentenced to fifty-four months\u2019 imprisonment and ordered to pay $2,436,079 in restitution. For Lockhart to pay that obligation, the district court entered an order garnishing his pension and disability payments, bank accounts, and insurance policies. Lockhart appeals, <em>pro se, </em>the order on the grounds that it differs from the criminal judgment and violates the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act (\u201cMVRA\u201d) and public policy. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Lockhart claims that the order, which requires immediate payment of a portion of his debt, is improper because it differs from the payment plan in the criminal judgment, which specifies that lower restitution payments begin sixty days after his release from custody. He misreads the judgment, which states that restitution is \u201cpayable immediately\u201d and \u201cpayable during incarceration\u201d and that the \u201cpayment plan shall not affect the ability of the United States to immediately collect payment in full through garnishment....\u201d Furthermore, the plan goes into effect only \u201c[i]f upon commencement of the term of supervised release any part of the restitution remains unpaid.... \u201d Lockhart has not commenced supervised release, so the payment plan cannot be violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Even under Lockhart\u2019s characterization of the judgment, he all but concedes that <em>United States v. Ekong, </em>518 F.3d 285, 286 (5th Cir.2007) (per curiam), forecloses relief if it is binding on this panel. There we affirmed a garnishment order requiring immediate payment despite that the judgment had a payment plan similar to Lock-hart\u2019s. <em>Id. </em>Although speaking in terms of res judicata, collateral estoppel, and waiver, Lockhart makes essentially the same argument as did the plaintiff in Ekong\u2014 claiming that the payment plan limits garnishment. We found that notion to be \u201cwithout merit\u201d under the MVRA, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613(a), which \u201cwas drafted to strengthen the ability of the Government to collect criminal restitution....\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">Lockhart\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Ekong </em>is unavailing. Despite his assertion, that case is published and binding on this panel; <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that the plaintiff was <em>pro se </em>has no effect on its precedential authority. Lock-hart asks us to revisit <em>Ekong, </em>but \u201cone panel of this Court may not overrule another.\u201d <em>Cent. Pines Land Co. v. United States, </em>274 F.3d 881, 893 (5th Cir.2001). As with the judgment in <em>Ekong, </em>nothing in Lockhart\u2019s criminal judgment prevents the government from collecting restitution immediately in amounts greater than the payment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-13\">Lockhart, a former NFL player, also disputes the scope of the order. First, he claims that garnishment of his NFL pension should be limited to 25% of his disposable earnings under \u00a7 3613(a)(3) of the MVRA; the Consumer Credit Protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673; and <em>United States v. DeCay, </em>620 F.3d 534, 543-44 (5th Cir.2010) (holding that pension payments are subject to the CCPA\u2019s 25% garnishment cap on \u201cearnings\u201d). That objection is moot because the district court limited garnishment of his pension to 25%.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Second, Lockhart contends that the 25% garnishment of his NFL supplemental disability payments violates public policy and should be quashed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Given the clear congressional intent to facilitate victim recovery under the MVRA, we decline to create a limitation where Congress has not.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Finally, Lockhart maintains that garnishment should be limited to \u201c25% of [his] wife\u2019s community interest in the community estate.\u201d Read liberally, the brief seems to posit that the CCPA\u2019s 25% garnishment cap on \u201cdisposable earnings\u201d applies to his wife\u2019s one-half interest in her solely managed community property.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Section 1673(a) applies to \u201cdisposable earnings\u201d as defined in \u00a7 1672(a) and (b) to mean \u201ccompensation paid or payable for personal services.... \u201d \u201cThe Supreme Court has cautioned that the terms \u2018earnings\u2019 and \u2018disposable earnings\u2019 under the CCPA are \u2018limited to periodic payments of compensation and (do) not pertain to every asset that is traceable in some way to such compensation.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The only periodic payments in the garnishment order \u2014 the NFL pension and disability payments \u2014 are garnished at 25%. The order garnishes money in bank accounts and insurance policies, but those are not \u201cdisposable earnings\u201d under \u00a7 1673(a) and therefore are not subject to its cap.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">The appealed-from garnishment order is AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b302-5\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
