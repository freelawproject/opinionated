Over his objection, the district court applied a 16-level Sentencing Guideline enhancement, pursuant to Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) (\u201cIf the defendant previously was deported, or unlawfully remained in the United States, after a crime of violence ... increase by 16 levels ... \u201d.). In that regard, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>determined that Rios\u2019 prior Texas conviction of indecency with a child under Texas Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 21.11 (West 2009) (criminalizing, <em>inter alia, </em>engaging in sexual contact with a child younger than 17 years of age) was a crime of violence. Rios was sentenced to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">In contending that the court erred in applying the enhancement, Rios claims: indecency with a child is not a crime of violence because Texas Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 21.11 is broader in scope than the generic meaning of \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d, by including conduct that does not constitute \u201cabuse\u201d within the meaning of \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d. He also contends the court erred in treating the statute as an aggravated felony for purposes of the enhanced-penalty provision in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Finally, Rios claims: because his prior conviction is an element of his illegal reentry offense that he contends must be charged in the indictment, the district court erred in considering it during sentencing. (Because each claim fails, we need not determine whether plain-error review applies or the claims were not adequately briefed here.)</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the advisory Guidelines-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). The district court\u2019s characterization of a prior offense as a crime of violence is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 272 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) requires a 16-level increase in a defendant\u2019s base-offense level if he previously was removed after being convicted of a crime of violence. The Application Notes to the Guideline define a crime of violence, in relevant part, as any specific enumerated offense, including \u201cforcible sex offenses (including where consent to the conduct is not given or is not legally valid, such as where consent to the conduct is involuntary, incompetent, or coerced), statutory rape, [and] sexual abuse of a minor ... U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n. l(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Generally, courts employ a categorical approach when classifying a prior conviction for sentencing-enhancement purposes. <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). Under <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>categorical approach, \u201cthe analysis is grounded in the elements of the statute of conviction rather than a defendant\u2019s specific conduct\u201d. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d 541, 549 (5th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 512, 187 L.Ed.2d 365 (2013). If a statute has disjunctive subsections, this court may apply a modified categorical approach to ascertain under which subsection defendant was convicted. <em>United States v. Miranda-Ortegon, </em>670 F.3d 661, 663 (5th Cir.2012). Under that approach, a court may review \u201cthe statutory definition, charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented\u201d. <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). If the statute of conviction cannot be narrowed, our court considers \u201cwhether the least culpable act constituting a violation of that statute constitutes\u201d a crime of vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>lence for purposes of Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>United States v. Moreno-Florean, </em>542 F.3d 445, 449 (5th Cir.2008) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Utilizing the state-court indictment and criminal judgment, for purposes of the modified categorical approach, we conclude that Rios\u2019 prior conviction was for the offense of indecency with a minor by contact, a violation of Texas Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 21.11(a)(1). Our court has previously held that the offense defined in \u00a7 21.11(a)(1) constitutes sexual abuse of a minor for purposes of Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). <em>United States v. Najera-Najera, </em>519 F.3d 509, 512 (5th Cir.2008). Further, our en banc decision in <em>Rodriguez, </em>which created a new plain-meaning approach for offense categories undefined at common law, did not alter our prior conclusion that a violation of \u00a7 21.11(a)(1) constitutes sexual abuse of a minor for purposes of Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). <em>United States v. Elizondo-Hernandez, </em>755 F.3d 779, 781-82 (5th Cir.2014). In the light of the foregoing, Rios has not established error in the imposition of the crime-of-violence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-15\">Rios\u2019 other contentions are likewise without merit. His claim that \u00a7 21.11(a)(1) does not fit the generic contemporary definition of \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d because it is overly broad has been rejected by our court. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d at 548, 562 n. 28. Additionally, his claim that the court erred in treating his \u00a7 21.11(a)(1) conviction as an aggravated felony for purposes of the inereased-penalty provisions of \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See Elizondo-Hernandez, </em>755 F.3d at 782 (discussing <em>United States v. Velazquez-Overa, </em>100 F.3d 418, 422 (5th Cir.1996)). Finally, his assertion that a prior conviction is an element of an illegal reentry offense that must be charged in the indictment is contrary to <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), reaffirmed by our court in the wake of <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Wallace, </em>759 F.3d 486, 497 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b233-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. - R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
