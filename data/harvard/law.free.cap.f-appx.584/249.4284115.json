He argues that his sentence, which exceeds the range set forth in the nonbinding policy statements found in Chapter Seven of the Sentencing Guidelines but is within the statutory maximum, is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. Griffin specifically alleges that the district court failed to adequately explain the sentence imposed, relied on erroneous facts, applied the wrong criminal history category, and did not consider the Chapter Seven policy statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-25\">Ordinarily, revocation sentences are reviewed under the \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.2011). However, because Griffin did not specifically object to the procedural unreasonableness of his sentence in the district court, we review for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Kirklin, </em>701 F.3d 177, 178-79 (5th Cir.2012). Griffin did object to his sentence as \u201csubstantially unreasonable\u201d in the district court; therefore, we review the substantive reasonableness of his sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Kippers, </em>685 F.3d 491, 499-500 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-26\">Regarding Griffin\u2019s assertion that the district court did not provide an adequate explanation for the sentence imposed, the record reflects that the district court considered the appropriate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors as well as the policy statements found in Chapter Seven of the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 262-65 (5th Cir.2009) (recognizing that implicit consideration of the \u00a7 3553 factors is sufficient to satisfy 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)\u2019s requirement that the district court provide reasons for an above guidelines sentence). Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>the district court\u2019s statement in imposing sentence was brief, in the context of the revocation hearing, the explanation was sufficient; therefore, Griffin has not shown clear or obvious error. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>Kippers, </em>685 F.3d at 498-99. Nor has he demonstrated that any error affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>602 F.3d 643, 647 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Moreover, the record reveals that the district court utilized the proper criminal history category and explicitly considered the Chapter Seven policy statements when determining the sentence to impose. To the extent that the district court might have relied on an erroneous fact when it incorrectly stated that Griffin had violated the terms of his supervised release within one month, rather than within one year, of his release from prison, Griffin has not shown that any error affected his substantial rights by demonstrating that he would have received a lesser sentence but for the error. <em>See id. </em>at 647. During the sentencing and revocation hearing, the district court expressly noted that it had considered the \u00a7 3553 sentencing factors and the Chapter Seven policy statements and specifically expressed concern about Griffin\u2019s extensive criminal history and the fact that this was his third revocation case. Accordingly, nothing in the record suggests that the district court heavily relied on erroneous facts to determine the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Upon revocation of supervised release, a district court may impose any sentence within the statutory maximum term of imprisonment. <em>See United States v. McKinney, </em>520 F.3d 425, 427-28 (5th Cir.2008). Moreover, revocation policy statement sentencing ranges are advisory only, and district courts have \u201cconsiderable discretion\u201d when determining revocation sentences. <em>United States v. Warren, </em>720 F.3d 321, 328-29 (5th Cir.2013). Accordingly, Griffin\u2019s 24-month sentence, which is within the statutory maximum prison term, is substantively reasonable. <em>See id.; Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 265. This is particularly true given Griffin\u2019s extensive and repetitive criminal history. <em>See Kippers, </em>685 F.3d at 500-01. The district court did not abuse its discretion by sentencing Griffin to a sentence within the statutory maximum, and his sentence is not plainly unreasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 500-01; <em>Miller, </em>634 F.3d at 843. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b283-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
