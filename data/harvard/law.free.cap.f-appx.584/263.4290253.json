He claims that the district court erred in determining that his Limestone County, Texas, and Navarro County, \u2022 Texas, convictions for burglary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>triggered application of the enhanced penalties under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Reviewing the district court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 924(e) sentencing enhancement de novo, <em>United States v. Constante, </em>544 F.3d 584, 585 (5th Cir.2008), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Three qualifying convictions are necessary for enhancement under \u00a7 924(e)(1) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4, cmt. (n. 1). The issue here is whether Wallace has three prior convictions for violent felonies. <em>See </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Burglary is one of the enumerated offenses identified in \u00a7 924(e) as a violent felony. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). \u201cBurglary\u201d has been interpreted in \u00a7 924(e) in terms of its modern, generic usage, which the Supreme Court has held must contain, at a minimum, the following elements: \u201c \u2018an unlawful unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure, <em>with intent to commit a crime.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>Constante, </em>544 F.3d at 585 (quoting <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Texas defines burglary as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">(a) A person commits an offense if, without the effective consent of the owner, the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-7\">(1) enters a habitation, or a building (or any portion of a building) not then open to the public, with intent to commit a felony, theft, or an assault; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-8\">(2) remains concealed, with intent to commit a felony, theft, or an assault, in a building or habitation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-9\">(3) enters a building or habitation and commits or attempts to commit a felony, theft, or an assault</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">Tex. Pen.Code ANN. \u00a7 30.02 (Vernon 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">We have previously held that a conviction under \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) qualifies as a generic burglary for purposes of the ACCA. <em>United States v. Silva, </em>957 F.2d 157, 162 (5th Cir.1992). In <em>Constante, </em>however, we held that a \u00a7 30.02(a)(3) conviction was not a generic burglary as defined by <em>Taylor </em>because it did not contain an element of intent to commit a felony, theft, or assault at the moment of entry; thus, it was not a violent felony for \u00a7 924(e) purposes. 544 F.3d at 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">Wallace argues that because the judgments in his burglary cases establish that his convictions were second degree felonies, they are necessarily convictions under \u00a7 30.02(a)(3) because only a \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) conviction is a first degree felony. In <em>United States v. Conde-Castaneda, </em>753 F.3d 172, 176 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 311, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-, 2014 WL 4249011 (U.S. Oct. 6, 2014) (No. 14-6009), we held that the modified categorical approach set forth in <em>Taylor </em>is applicable to determine which of the three alternatives of \u00a7 30.02(a) formed the basis of the defendant\u2019s conviction in assessing whether he qualified for a \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) erime-of-violence enhancement. \u25a0 In <em>Conde-Castaneda, </em>we held that when the indictment charged the defendant with violating both \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) and \u00a7 30.02(a)(3), and the judgment recited only that he had been convicted under \u00a7 30.02(c)(2), resort could be had to the defendant\u2019s \u201cboiler plate\u201d judicial confession. 753 F.3d at 174, 177-78. In that confession, he admitted to every act alleged in the indictment, so we held that the judicial confession was sufficient to establish that his conviction rested on both subsections (a)(1) and (a)(3), as charged in the indictment. <em>Id. </em>at 174, 177-78. Having previously held that a \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) conviction constitutes \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines, we held that the judicial confession established that his crime of violence enhancement had been correctly imposed. <em>Id. </em>at 178-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>In Wallace\u2019s case, his indictment in the Limestone County burglary did not list the statute under which he was charged, but it alleged that he \u201cthen and there, <em>with intent to commit theft, </em>intentionally and knowingly enter[ed] a habitation, without the effective consent of [the owner] thereof[.]\u201d (emphasis added). The judgment made no reference to the statute of conviction but established that Wallace pleaded guilty to the indictment and was convicted' of a second degree felony. In a document entitled \u201cRecitations of Judgment,\u201d however, the court asked Wallace \u201cwhether he was guilty of the offense alleged in said charging instrument and [Wallace] [ ] answered in person that he was guilty.\u201d The court also stated that it was of the opinion that Wallace was \u201cguilty of the offense ... as charged in [the] charging instrument.\u201d Consequently, the modified categorical approach supports a determination that Wallace was convicted under \u00a7 30.02(a)(1), which contains as an element the requisite intent and is therefore an appropriate predicate offense under the ACCA. <em>See Silva, </em>957 F.2d at 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">As for the Navarro County burglary, the indictment charged that Wallace \u201cdid then and there, with the intent to commit theft, intentionally and knowingly enter a habitation, without the effective consent of [the owner].\u201d As in <em>Conde-Castaneda, </em>the judgment stated only that Wallace was convicted under \u00a7 30.02(c)(2). <em>See </em>753 F.3d at 177. Section 30.02(c)(2) simply provides that a burglary conviction is a second degree felony if committed in a habitation. Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 30.02(c)(2). Nevertheless, as in <em>Conde-Castaneda, </em>Wallace judicially confessed that he intentionally and knowingly entered a habitation without consent of the owner \u201cwith the intent to commit theft,\u201d thus meeting all the elements of \u00a7 30.02(a)(1). Consequently, under <em>Conde-Castaneda, </em>this burglary also qualifies as a violent felony and predicate offense for the ACCA. <em>See </em>753 F.3d at 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Wallace insists that <em>Conde-Castaneda </em>does not foreclose his argument that a second degree burglary conviction under \u00a7 30.02(c)(2), which has no intent element, must be treated as a \u00a7 30.02(a)(3) conviction and thus may not serve as a predicate offense under the ACCA. Wallace contends that we have not yet decided whether the absence of an intent requirement in \u00a7 30.02(c)(2) means that the conviction may still be considered a violation of \u00a7 30.02(a)(1). This argument is unpersuasive because, in <em>Conde-Castaneda, </em>the judgment listed the statute of conviction as \u00a7 30.02(c)(2), but we still concluded that \u25a0 the modified categorical approach supported a determination that the defendant was convicted under \u00a7 30.02(a)(1), having confessed to all the elements of that subsection. 753 F.3d at 177-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">In summary, the district court did not err in holding that Wallace\u2019s Limestone County and Navarro County burglary convictions served as predicate offenses for purposes of the ACCA enhancement. As Wallace conceded that his escape conviction rightly served as a predicate offense, a total of three prior violent felony convictions qualified him for the enhancement. <em>See </em>\u00a7 924(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
