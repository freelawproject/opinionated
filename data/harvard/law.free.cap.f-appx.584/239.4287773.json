Ayika was convicted after a jury trial of drug offenses in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. In his Rule 12(b)(3)(B) motion, Ayika argued that the indictment was jurisdictionally defective because he was a licensed pharmacist and that he therefore could not be prosecuted under \u00a7 841. The district court determined that Ayika\u2019s Rule 12(b)(3)(B) motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>was untimely and alternatively that it was precluded from considering his challenge to the indictment because that issue was already rejected by this court on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">We need not address whether Ayika\u2019s Rule 12(b)(3)(B) motion was timely as the district court\u2019s alternative ruling was correct. Although Ayika framed his Rule 12(b)(3)(B) challenge to the indictment as a jurisdictional issue, it is substantively the same as the challenge that he raised to his indictment on direct appeal. Our rejection of that argument on direct appeal constitutes the law of the case. <em>See United States v. Lawrence, </em>179 F.3d 343, 351 (5th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Ayika, </em>542 Fed.Appx. 344 (5th Cir.2013). The district court\u2019s denial of Ayika\u2019s Rule 12(b)(3)(B) motion and his motions for summary disposition are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b273-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
