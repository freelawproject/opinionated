In modifying the Supreme Court\u2019s order, the Second Department has created new and troubling public policy and case law. <em>(Grant Co. v Srogi, </em>52 NY2d 496; <em>City of Rochester v Chiarella, </em>58 NY2d 316, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number><em>cert denied sub nom.

The Second Department\u2019s attempt to apply case law which is factually inapposite is erroneous. <em>(Matter of Andresen v Rice, </em>277 NY 271; <em>Matter of Hellerstein v Assessor of Town of Islip, </em>37 NY2d 1; <em>Foss v City of Rochester, </em>65 NY2d 247; <em>Matter of Bauer v Board of Assessment Review, </em>114 Misc 2d 640, 91 AD2d 1097; <em>Matter of Teuchtler v Board of Assessors of Town of Cape Vincent, </em>94 Misc 2d 167; <em>Hurd v City of Buffalo, </em>41 AD2d 402, 34 NY2d 628; <em>Lemon v Kurtzman, </em>411 US 192.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b539-6\"><em>Loma B.

II. The class system of article 18 of the Real Property Tax Law is constitutional.

IV The water companies\u2019 appeal is untimely. <em>(Ressis v Herman, </em>69 NY2d 1017; <em>Monaghan v Yang, </em>69 NY2d 945.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b540-4\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b540-5\">G.B. Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The primary issue here is whether the Appellate Division abused its discretion when it held that, owing to the County\u2019s financial situation, certain utilities were not entitled to county tax refunds, even though the Court found that they had been improperly assessed a tax. We reverse the order of the Appellate Division and remit for a hearing both on the amount of refund due and on any financial hardship the County would suffer as a result of requiring payment to the utilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Under article 18 of the Real Property Tax Law, Nassau County is a \u201cspecial assessing unit\u201d for real property taxation. The County\u2019s real property is divided into four classes: classes one and two include all residential property, class three includes utility property and class four includes commercial property.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Plaintiff New York Telephone Company (NYNEX)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> owns class three and class four property in Nassau County, which is subject to county, town, village, school district and countywide special district taxes. Some of this property is also located in countywide and noncountywide \u201cspecial districts.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As part of the 1997 tax assessment process, the County imposed special ad valorem levies on noncountywide special districts\u2014including property owned by NYNEX. The County assessed the real property in the noncountywide special districts using the same method as countywide assessments under RPTL article 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">In April 1997, NYNEX commenced an action seeking a declaration that this method of assessing real property in noncountywide special districts violated the RPTL, enjoining the County from assessing noncountywide property in this manner and demanding a tax overpayment refund. After joinder of issue, NYNEX moved for summary judgment on the issue of liability, and the County cross-moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. NYNEX commenced a second action seeking similar relief for the 1998 tax year.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Petitioners New York Water Service Corporation and Long Island Water Corporation (collectively, the Water Companies) owned class three special franchise property in Nassau County in countywide and noncountywide special districts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As in the NYNEX action, the County imposed special ad valorem levies on those properties in the noncountywide special districts. In April 1997, the Water Companies each initiated a CPLR article 78 proceeding to recover tax overpayments due to the County\u2019s alleged unauthorized assessment method. Thereafter, the Water Companies and the County stipulated that the proceedings would also cover the 1998-2000 tax years.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Supreme Court granted the County\u2019s motion to consolidate the various suits, and (1) granted the relief requested by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>plaintiffs and petitioners (collectively the utilities), (2) enjoined the County from assessing real property in noncountywide special districts pursuant to RPTL article 18 and (3) referred the issue of damages to trial. Upon reargument, the court adhered to its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The Appellate Division modified the order of the Supreme Court to the extent of precluding payment of the refunds, and, as modified, affirmed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">\u201cAlthough the tax assessments were invalid, NYNEX and the Water Companies are not entitled to retroactive monetary relief. The record reveals that the payment of tax refunds will have a significant financial impact in many non-Countywide special districts, where taxes have been paid, tax liens matured, budgets adopted, and expenditures made, all in reliance on the ad valorem levies. Under these circumstances, the courts should exercise restraint and not act so as to \u2018cause disorder and confusion in public affairs even though there may be a strict legal right.\u2019 Accordingly, the Supreme Court improvidently exercised its discretion in authorizing tax refunds and directing a trial to determine their amount.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (297 AD2d 663, 666 [2002] [citations omitted].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The Appellate Division denied the utilities\u2019 motions to reargue or for leave to appeal. This Court granted the utilities\u2019 motions for leave to appeal, and we now reverse. We do not reach the propriety of the tax assessment. The County did not appeal that portion of the Appellate Division order.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">The sole question before us is whether the Appellate Division erred in denying tax refunds to the utilities because of the financial impact such refunds would have on the County when the amount of the refunds had not been established, nor proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>submitted demonstrating the impact the refunds would have on the County.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">In some circumstances, notwithstanding that a party prevailed on the merits, this Court has refused to grant the relief requested based on the effect it would have on the municipality. For example, in <em>Foss v City of Rochester </em>(65 NY2d 247, 260 [1985]), plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of section 305 and article 19 of the Real Property Tax Law as well as Local Law No. 6 (1983) of the City of Rochester on the ground that they deprived him of due process and of the equal protection of the law. Although the Court determined that article 19 and Rochester Local Law No. 6 violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions, it refused to require a retroactive refund because of the practical reality that the government had \u201crelied upon the revenues derived from implementing [RPTL article 19] and would suffer an undue burden if it had to refund the taxes collected\u201d (65 NY2d at 260).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Retroactive relief, similarly, was denied in <em>Matter of Hellerstein v Assessor of Town of Islip </em>(37 NY2d 1 [1975]), where the Town\u2019s assessment rolls were held invalid, because the result could bring financial chaos to the Town. In <em>Matter of Andresen v Rice </em>(277 NY 271, 282 [1938]), this Court invalidated a statute that provided for the appointment of State Police officers without a competitive examination but declined to grant the relief requested because it would \u201ccause disorder and confusion in public affairs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Here, Supreme Court declined to hear evidence of hardship. Thus, the amount of refund to which the utilities are entitled\u2014 including any financial impact on the County of requiring payment\u2014must be determined at a hearing, upon submission of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division, insofar as appealed from, should be reversed, with costs, and the cases remitted to Supreme Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Graffeo, Read and R.S. Smith concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Order, insofar as appealed from, reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-8\">.
