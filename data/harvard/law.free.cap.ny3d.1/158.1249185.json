We conclude that the grandfathering provision is not applicable to this PPA and that the appropriate payment rate for the \u201cnew\u201d capacity is NIMO\u2019s actual avoided cost.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">Congress enacted the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) (Pub L 95-617) in order to help foster the development of alternative sources of energy <em>(see Matter of Consolidated Edison Co. v Public Serv. Commn., </em>63 NY2d 424, 431 [1984]). New York Public Service Law \u00a7 66-c was enacted soon thereafter to fulfill the same purposes at the state level (Public Service Law \u00a7 66-c [1]). It provided for a minimum sales price of six cents per kilowatt hour for electricity purchased from qualifying facilities by utilities. The provision requiring the six cent minimum was removed from section 66-c (1) in 1992 and section 66-c (2) was added (L 1992, ch 519, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">Section 66-c (2) is a grandfathering provision allowing certain agreements to continue to function under the six cent minimum rate if the agreement was executed by the parties and filed with the Public Service Commission by June 26, 1992, and the agreement \u201cprovides] for the purchase of electricity at a utility tariff rate referencing a statutory minimum sales price . . . provided, however, that such minimum sales price shall be implemented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>in accordance with the policies and conditions established by the commission\u201d (Public Service Law \u00a7 66-c [2] [a]). The six cent minimum rate was apparently repealed because the rate turned out to be an overestimate of the cost of production of electricity by the qualifying facilities, resulting in the imposition of overpayments on the utilities and their customers. The Governor\u2019s Approval Memorandum in support of the repeal and the grandfathering provision stated \u201c[c]onsumers are thereby relieved of the outdated minimum sales price while reasonable protection is provided to producers who relied on this minimum price provision\u201d (Governor\u2019s Mem approving L 1992, ch 519, 1992 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 2898).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">S&amp;T owns and operates a small hydroelectric generating facility that had an original capacity of three megawatts (MW)\u2014 referred to as \u201cold\u201d capacity. The facility was replaced in 1986, increasing its capacity by an additional 7.5 MW of \u201cnew\u201d capacity, for a total existing output of 10.5 MW. S&amp;T and NIMO entered into a PPA pursuant to Public Service Law \u00a7 66-c (1) (a) in January 1987 whereby NIMO was required to purchase the entire 10.5 MW capacity of electricity generated by S&amp;T.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The PPA was divided into three time periods\u2014the first period ending December 31, 2000, the second December 31, 2008, and the third December 31, 2016. For purposes of this appeal, the only contract provisions at issue are those that relate to the rate that must be paid for the \u201cnew\u201d capacity during the second and third periods.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The PPA states that for the second period, in consideration for a longer contract term, NIMO will pay S&amp;T 90% of its avoided cost and recognizes that the discount may result in payments that are below any applicable minimum rate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The PPA goes on to define avoided cost as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">\u201csuch actual cost of electric production . . . avoided by reason of this agreement, as defined in Service Classification No. 6 of PSC No. 207 Electricity as the same may be from time to time changed, amended and/or supplemented, the tariff duly approved by the commission applicable for payments to qualifying on-site generation suppliers whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>sales of capacity and energy to Niagara are made under the terms of such tariff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">For the third period, NIMO would pay S&amp;T 80% of its avoided cost at \u201cthe rate contained in Service Classification No. 6.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AK76\">NIMO\u2019s tariff, Service Classification No. 6 (SC No. 6), sets forth a formula to be applied for determining the rate to be paid by NIMO to qualifying facilities. The tariff provides \u201c[t]o the extent that a minimum unit rate applied under Section 66-c of the Public Service Law . . . the rate to be paid under this service classification shall be no less than 6.0 cents per kWh.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AHa\">Before the parties executed the PPA, the Commission issued an order directing certain terms <em>(see </em>Pub Serv Commn Case No. 29448, issued Dec. 3, 1986). The Commission determined that mere agreement between the parties to extend the PPA for longer than 15 years was insufficient consideration to allow NIMO to purchase the electricity at a discounted rate <em>(see </em>Pub Serv Commn Case No. 29448, issued Dec. 3, 1986).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Commission also</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">\u201cdirect[ed] Niagara Mohawk to enter into a [301-year contract that provides for payment at the settlement rates for the increase in capacity resulting from the proposed facility through the year 2000 and thereafter through the end of the [30]-year term at full avoided costs. With respect to the 3 MW representing existing capacity, the payment rate will be tariff-based avoided costs, subject to the statutory minimum, throughout the [30]-year term of the contract\u201d (Pub Serv Commn Case No. 29448, issued Dec. 3, 1986).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">S&amp;T commenced this action in May 2001 after the expiration of the first payment period because, as of February 2001, NIMO stopped paying S&amp;T at the six cent minimum rate for the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>capacity\u2014instead paying only NIMO\u2019s avoided costs. S&amp;T sought declarations that the PPA was within the grandfathering provisions of section 66-c, and thus subject to the six cent minimum, and that NIMO could not legally pay S&amp;T at a rate below the six cent minimum. S&amp;T also sought damages for the difference between the rate it was actually paid\u2014NIMO\u2019s avoided costs\u2014and the six cent rate, with interest, and further, to enjoin NIMO from paying it at a rate less than six cents per kilowatt hour. The parties cross-moved for summary judgment pursuant to CPLR 3212.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Supreme Court granted each party\u2019s motion in part, finding the PPA was grandfathered because it was in effect prior to June 26, 1992, the effective date of the amendment, and incorporated the six cent minimum through the SC No. 6 tariff. The court then determined that, for the second and third periods, NIMO must pay its actual avoided costs for the \u201cnew\u201d capacity and the tariff-based avoided costs subject to the six cent minimum for the \u201cold\u201d capacity. The court based its decision, in part, on the language in the Commission\u2019s December 1986 order differentiating between \u201cfull avoided costs\u201d for the \u201cnew\u201d capacity\u2014without mentioning the six cent minimum\u2014 and \u201ctariff-based avoided costs, subject to the statutory minimum\u201d for the \u201cold\u201d capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The Appellate Division affirmed for different reasons. That Court found the PPA was not grandfathered because, while NI-MO\u2019s tariff did refer to the six cent minimum, the reference was not in the context of the definition of avoided cost, and thus the PPA did not explicitly provide that the purchase of electricity would be at the utility tariff rate (299 AD2d 628, 630 [2002]). The former six cent statutory minimum was not applicable to the electric production for the 7.5 MW of \u201cnew\u201d capacity. This Court granted S&amp;T leave to appeal and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">There is no dispute that the PPA at issue was signed by the parties and filed with the Commission prior to June 26, 1992, the effective date of the amendment. This fact alone does not result in automatic entitlement to the six cent minimum. The pertinent question here is whether the PPA \u201cprovid[es] for the purchase of electricity at a utility tariff rate referencing a statutory minimum sales price\u201d (Public Service Law \u00a7 66-c [2] [a] [ii]). The PPA provides that S&amp;T will be paid at NIMO\u2019s \u201cavoided cost,\u201d which is described as the cost of the production of electricity NIMO would have incurred in the absence of the PPA, as defined in SC No. 6. NIMO\u2019s tariff, SC No. 6, clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>references the six cent minimum as part of a section entitled \u201crate to be paid by company.\u201d Although the PPA appears to fit within the grandfathering provision, the inquiry does not end there. The statute further specifies that the six cent minimum will continue to apply \u201cprovided, however, that such minimum sales price shall be implemented in accordance with the policies and conditions established by the commission\u201d (Public Service Law \u00a7 66-c [2] [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The Public Service Commission has not interpreted the \u201cavoided cost\u201d language at issue here since the six cent minimum was repealed and the grandfathering provision was enacted. In fact, the Commission has specifically declined to do so, stating</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">\u201c[w]hile, under PURPA and PSL \u00a7 66-c, we supervise the . . . contract formation process, we have avoided involvement in contract disputes between utilities and [qualifying facilities] over the meaning of contract terms, arising after contract formation. Such contract disputes are better resolved according to commercial law principles, through negotiation, arbitration, or the courts\u201d (Pub Serv Commn Case No. 02-E-0891, <em>Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc.\u2014Tariff Filing to Update its Rates for Buyback Service Under S.C. No. 15, </em>issued Dec. 20, 2002; <em>see also </em>Pub Serv Commn Case No. 01-E-0193, <em>Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation\u2014Tariff Filing to Clarify the Applicability of the 6 [Cent] Rate for Contracts with Independent Power Producers, </em>issued June 6, 2001).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">However, the Commission interpreted this specific PPA and the language at issue in its December 1986 order prior to the January 1987 execution of the agreement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That order, representing the \u201cfinal\u201d agreement between the parties, directed NIMO to pay S&amp;T \u201cfull avoided costs\u201d for its \u201cnew\u201d capacity for the second and third periods of the agreement and to pay \u201ctariff-based avoided costs, subject to the statutory minimum\u201d for the \u201cold\u201d capacity for the entire term of the agreement. As such, the order drew a distinction between avoided costs and the tariff-based avoided costs subject to the six cent minimum. This policy interpretation was established by the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>for this particular agreement. As the agency charged with the administration of the Public Service Law, the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the agreement in this highly technical area of law is entitled to deference <em>(see Matter of New York Tel. Co. v Public Serv. Commn., </em>95 NY2d 40, 48-49 [2000]; <em>see also Matter of Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. v Public Serv. Commn., </em>69 NY2d 365, 369 [1987] [noting that the Public Service Commission \u201chas been granted \u2018the very broadest of powers\u2019 \u201d in its rate-setting authority]). Thus, the \u201cnew\u201d capacity is not entitled to the benefit of the grandfathering clause because, \u201cin accordance with the policies and conditions established by the commission\u201d (Public Service Law \u00a7 66-c [2] [a]), the December 1986 order reveals a policy that S&amp;T would only be entitled to avoided costs for that capacity during the second and third periods of the PPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">We reject S&amp;T\u2019s arguments that full avoided costs include the six cent minimum or that the Commission\u2019s policy was to use the six cent minimum as a base price for the tariffs, in light of the Commission\u2019s December 1986 <em>order\u2014the </em>operative order\u2014 addressing this particular PPA. In addition, any argument that the parties contemplated the six cent minimum at the time of the agreement negates the purpose of the grandfathering clause, which limits application of the six cent minimum to those contracts that expressly provide for it. This PPA never did. The contractual pricing provisions conveyed an intent to base the price for the 7.5 MW of \u201cnew\u201d capacity during the second and third periods on NIMO\u2019s full avoided costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The parties\u2019 remaining contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B. Smith, Rosenblatt and Graffeo concur; Judge Read taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b212-10\">. Avoided cost, also termed \u201cincremental cost of alternative electric energy,\u201d is defined as what the cost would have been to the utility to either produce or purchase from a different source the energy generated by the qualifying facility <em>(Matter of Consolidated Edison Co. v Public Serv. Commn., </em>63 NY2d 424, 431 n 2 [1984], quoting 16 USC \u00a7 82a-3 [d]; 18 CFR 292.101 [b] [6]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b213-7\">. With respect to the 3 MW of \u201cold\u201d capacity, NIMO is required to continue to pay S&amp;T at the Service Classification No. 6 tariff rate, subject to the six cent minimum for the balance of the agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b213-8\">. This 90% discount provision was later eliminated from the PPA by a December 1986 order of the Commission <em>(see </em>Pub Serv Commn Case No. 29448, issued Dec. 3, 1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b214-8\">.

Although the PPA was never amended to reflect the changes directed by the December 1986 order, the parties have apparently abided by the terms of the order as if the PPA had been amended.
