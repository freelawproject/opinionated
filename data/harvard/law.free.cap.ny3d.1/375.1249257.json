She left Antonio alone in a floating foam bath seat in 8 to 10 inches of water. At the time, a friend was visiting and sitting in the living room, adjacent to the bathroom. However, mother did not seek her friend\u2019s assistance in supervising Antonio while she looked for her other children. On her return\u2014by mother\u2019s account, three minutes later\u2014she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>found Antonio submerged in the water and unconscious. Mother called 911, and the child was transported to the hospital. The child died four days later from severe brain damage caused by lack of oxygen due to the drowning.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Thereafter, petitioner Department of Social Services (DSS) filed a petition against mother pursuant to Family Court Act article 10, alleging that she committed acts of \u201cabuse\u201d and \u201csevere abuse\u201d against Antonio and that she derivatively neglected her other children, Alijah and Alonzo. Mother consented to a finding of neglect as to each of the surviving children and moved to dismiss the abuse petition filed on behalf of Antonio\u2014the deceased child. The Law Guardian and DSS opposed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Family Court granted mother\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition as to Antonio, holding that \u201cwhere an abuse petition is filed on behalf of a deceased child, the purpose of filing the petition can no longer be served and therefore such a petition must be dismissed as moot.\u201d Thereafter, a dispositional order was entered adjudicating the surviving children neglected and releasing the children to the custody of their maternal grandmother. The Law Guardian appealed Family Court\u2019s order dismissing the abuse petition as to the deceased child.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The Appellate Division affirmed (302 AD2d 838 [2003]), relying on <em>Matter of Stephanie WW. </em>(213 AD2d 818 [3d Dept 1995]), which held that a neglect petition cannot be brought on behalf of a deceased child because the subject child is no longer in need of the protections of article 10 of the Family Court Act. Finding no distinction between neglect and abuse petitions, in this context, the Appellate Division concluded that a deceased child may not be the subject of an abuse petition. We disagree and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">The Law Guardian and DSS contend that the dismissal of the abuse petition as to Antonio harms the surviving children because they will not have the protection afforded by Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b. Under section 384-b, mother\u2019s rights may be terminated based on \u201crepeated abuse\u201d if she abuses one of the surviving children within five years after Antonio\u2019s death. By contrast, mother argues that Family Court is without jurisdiction to entertain an abuse petition brought on behalf of a deceased child because the purpose of Family Court Act article 10\u2014\u201cto help protect children from injury or mistreatment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>to help safeguard their physical, mental, and emotional well-being\u201d (Family Ct Act \u00a7 1011)\u2014can no longer be served where an abuse petition names a deceased child.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">We reject mother\u2019s reading of the statute as contrary to the language and intent of the Legislature in dealing with the abuse of children. First, section 1012 (e) of the Family Court Act defines an abused child as \u201ca child less than eighteen years of age whose parent . . . (i) inflicts or allows to be inflicted upon such child physical injury by other than accidental means <em>which causes </em>or creates a substantial risk of death\u201d (Family Ct Act \u00a7 1012 [e] [i] [emphasis added]).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The language of the statute plainly contemplates that abuse petitions will be brought on behalf of deceased children as it is satisfied where the person responsible for the subject child either causes the death or creates a substantial risk of death of the child <em>(see </em>Besharov, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 29A, Family Ct Act \u00a7 1012, at 308).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Further, the statute provides that, in addition to making a finding of abuse, a court \u201cmay enter a finding of severe abuse or repeated abuse\u201d as defined in Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b (8) (a) and (b), based on clear and convincing evidence, which shall be admissible in a proceeding to terminate parental rights (Family Ct Act \u00a7 1051 [e]; <em>see also </em>Family Ct Act \u00a7 1012 Q] [defining aggravated circumstances as where a child has been severely or repeatedly abused]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, pursuant to the statutory scheme, a child shall be adjudicated severely abused if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">\u201cthe child has been found to be an abused child as a result of reckless or intentional acts of the parent committed under circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life, which result in serious physical injury to the child as defined in subdivision ten of section 10.00 of the penal law\u201d (Social Ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>vices Law \u00a7 384-b [8] [a] [i]; <em>see also </em>Family Ct Act \u00a7 <em>1051 </em>[ej).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Serious physical injury includes \u201cphysical injury which creates a substantial risk of death, or <em>which causes death </em>or serious and protracted disfigurement\u201d of the child (Penal Law \u00a7 10.00 [10] [emphasis added]). In drafting these sections, the Legislature clearly demonstrated an intent to bring deceased children within the ambit of the Family Court Act in order to protect the health and safety of children whose siblings have died at the hands of a parent or caretaker.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The Legislature\u2019s express incorporation of the Social Services Law definition of \u201crepeatedly abused\u201d into the Family Court Act further reflects its intent to create a child-protective system wherein the adjudication of a deceased child as abused or severely abused becomes paramount in termination of parental rights proceedings as to surviving children <em>{see </em>Family Ct Act \u00a7 <em>1051 </em>[e]). Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b (4) (e) provides that parental rights shall be terminated upon a showing that the parent \u201crepeatedly abused\u201d the subject child. The statute defines a child as \u201c \u2018repeatedly abused\u2019 \u201d where, as pertinent here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">\u201c(i) the child has been found to be an abused child . . . as a result of such parent\u2019s acts . . . and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">\u201c(ii) (A) <em>the child or another child for whose care such parent is or has been legally responsible has been previously found, within the five years immediately preceding the initiation of the proceeding in which such abuse is found, to be an abused child, </em>as defined in . . . the family court act, as a result of such parent\u2019s acts\u201d (Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b [8] [b] [i], [ii] [A] [emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">We thus reject the contention that a deceased child cannot be the subject of an abuse petition. Clearly, siblings of a child killed by abuse are within the class of children the Legislature sought to protect in enacting Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b, enhancing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>the protective purposes of article 10 of the Family Court Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As one commentator has stated, \u201c[i]t is logical and appropriate to assume that acts of abuse or neglect committed against one child in the household jeopardize all children similarly situated\u201d (Sobie, 2003 Supp Practice Commentary, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 29A, Family Ct Act \u00a7 1012, 2004 Pocket Part, at 98).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">As we recently stated in <em>Matter of Marino S. </em>(100 NY2d 361, 375 [2003]), that \u201c[i]t would be unthinkable to interpret the Social Services Law so that a derivative finding [of abuse] can be made when a parent assaults a sibling, but not when the parent rapes a sibling or seriously injures her under circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to her life,\u201d it would similarly be unthinkable to read article 10 of the Family Court Act so that it triggers termination of parental rights proceedings to protect surviving children only where a parent inflicts serious physical injury short of death on another child, but not where abuse is so severe that the child dies. Moreover, if the petition is dismissed, there may be no judicial determination as to the facts and circumstances surrounding the child\u2019s death. While evidence of the event may be relevant in some future proceeding, any subsequent inquiry will be bereft of findings that should be a matter of record rather than left to be reconstructed. The petition alleging that mother committed acts of \u201cabuse\u201d and \u201csevere abuse\u201d against Antonio causing his death should thus be allowed to proceed to ensure the safety and welfare of the surviving children.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, without costs, and mother\u2019s motion to dismiss the abuse petition as to the deceased child denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B. Smith, Rosenblatt, Graffeo and Read concur; Judge R.S. Smith taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b430-8\">. Compare the definition of abuse with that of neglect, which requires that a child\u2019s \u201cphysical, mental or emotional condition\u201d be impaired or be \u201cin imminent danger of becoming impaired\u201d or that a child be abandoned (see Family Ct Act \u00a7 1012 [f] [i], [ii]). We underscore that the issue before us is limited to abuse. We do not consider whether a deceased child can be the subject of a neglect petition (see <em>Matter of Stephanie </em>WW., 213 AD2d 818 [3d Dept 1995]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b430-9\">. As to quantum of proof, see Family Court Act \u00a7 1046 (b) (i) and (ii), providing that a determination that a child is abused must be based on a preponderance of the evidence and, by contrast, a determination of severe or repeated abuse is to be supported by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b431-11\">. Our discussion is not limited to siblings, as presented in this case, but includes half-siblings and children under the care of a person who has abused another child for .whom such person has been \u201clegally responsible\u201d (see Family Ct Act \u00a7 1012 [g] [defining \u201cPerson legally responsible\u201d to include \u201cthe child\u2019s custodian, guardian, (or) any other person responsible for the child\u2019s care at the relevant time\u201d]; see <em>also People v Carroll, </em>93 NY2d 564, 569 [1999]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b432-9\">. Chapter 7 (\u00a7 9) of the Laws of 1999 amended Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b to include the following statement of legislative intent: \u201cThe legislature recognizes that the health and safety of children is of paramount importance\u201d (Social Services Law \u00a7 384-b [1] [a]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
