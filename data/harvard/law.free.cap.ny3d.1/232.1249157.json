Since petitioners were injured in the performance of their respective duties, the court below erred when it held that respondents\u2019 denial of General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c benefits was not arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion or affected by error of law. <em>(Matter of Curley v Dilworth, </em>96 AD2d 903; <em>Matter of Mashnouk v Miles, </em>55 NY2d 80; <em>Matter of Collins v City of Yonkers, </em>207 AD2d 830; <em>Matter of Crawford v Sheriff's Dept., Putnam County, </em>152 AD2d 382, 76 NY2d 704; <em>Glasser v Price, </em>35 AD2d 98; <em>Matter of Laudico v Netzel, </em>254 AD2d 811; <em>Matter of White v County of Cortland, </em>97 NY2d 336; <em>Matter of Clements v Panzarella, </em>297 AD2d 4; <em>Santangelo v State of New York, </em>71 NY2d 393; <em>Cooper v City of New York, </em>81 NY2d 584.)

The legislative history surrounding the enactment of General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c and its amendments clearly warrants the limitation of its benefits to those law enforcement personnel injured or taken ill while performing the dangerous tasks for which they were hired. II. The statutory language of General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c contemplates the granting of benefits only for injuries and illnesses incurred in the performance of the dangerous work which a police officer was hired to perform. <em>(Matter of White v County of Cortland, </em>97 NY2d 336; <em>Matter of DePoalo v County of Schenectady, </em>85 NY2d 527; <em>Matter of Ramsden v Regan, </em>91 AD2d 773; <em>Matter of Martinson v Regan, </em>176 AD2d 1121; <em>Matter of Robinson v New York State &amp; Local Police &amp; Fire Retirement Sys., </em>192 AD2d 951; <em>Matter of Curtis v New York State Comptroller, </em>281 AD2d 780.) III. The standard used to determine eligibility for General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c benefits is neither ambiguous nor subjective. <em>(Jacobellis v Ohio, </em>378 US 184; <em>Matter of Ertner v County of Chenango, </em>280 AD2d 851; <em>Matter of Sutherland v Village of Suffern, </em>289 AD2d 582; <em>Matter of Wynne v Town of Ramapo, </em>286 AD2d 338; <em>Youngs v Village of Penn Yan, </em>291 AD2d 852; <em>Matter of Travison v County of Albany, </em>291 AD2d 705; <em>Matter of Sills v Livingston, </em>294 AD2d 922; <em>Matter of Clements v Panzarella, </em>297 AD2d 4; <em>Matter of Bonkoski v Village of Suffern, </em>296 AD2d 404.) IV This Court\u2019s reference to heightened risk injuries as warranting an award of General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c benefits was correct. <em>(Matter of Balcerak v County of Nassau, </em>94 NY2d 253.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b287-5\"><em>Richard A.

II. The court below cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>rectly ruled that a rational basis existed for respondents\u2019 administrative determinations denying appellants General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c benefits. <em>(Matter of Uniform Firefighters of Cohoes v City of Cohoes, </em>94 NY2d 686; <em>Matter of DePoalo v County of Schenectady, </em>85 NY2d 527; <em>Matter of City of Watertown v State of New York Pub.

It is highly unlikely that this Court intended to change over 40 years of substantive law, in a case involving only a procedural issue, without clearly expressing such intent. <em>(Matter of Balcerak v County of Nassau, </em>94 NY2d 253; <em>Matter of White v County of Cortland, </em>97 NY2d 336; <em>Matter of Mashnouk v Miles, </em>55 NY2d 80; <em>Matter of Theroux v Reilly, 187 </em>Misc 2d 723; <em>Matter of James v County of Yates Sheriff s Dept., </em>300 AD2d 989.)

In <em>Matter of Balcerak v County of Nassau </em>(94 NY2d 253 [1999]), this Court established that in order for police officers to be eligible for General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c benefits, their injuries must have been incurred in the performance of special work related to the nature of heightened risks and duties. <em>(Matter of Balcerak v County of Nassau, </em>94 NY2d 253; <em>Matter of Sutka v Conners, </em>73 NY2d 395; <em>Matter of Clements v Panzarella, </em>297 AD2d 4; <em>Matter of Theroux v Reilly, </em>187 Misc 2d 723, 297 AD2d 384, 99 NY2d 503; <em>Matter of White v County of Cortland, </em>97 NY2d 336; <em>Matter of Gallante v Reilly, </em>303 AD2d 503; <em>Matter of Schafer v Reilly, </em>302 AD2d 394; <em>Matter of James v County of Yates Sheriffs Dept., </em>300 AD2d 989, 100 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>NY2d 504; <em>Matter of Stalter v Scarpato, </em>297 AD2d 382; <em>Matter of Bonkoski v Village of Suffern, </em>296 AD2d 404.) II. The court below properly applied the eligibility standard for General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c benefits set forth by this Court in <em>Matter of Balcerak v County of Nassau </em>(94 NY2d 253 [1999]) to correctly hold that the administrative determination denying petitioner General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c benefits was not arbitrary or capricious. <em>(Matter of White v County of Cortland, </em>97 NY2d 336.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b289-5\"><em>Trevett, Lenweaver &amp; Salzer, P.C., </em>Rochester <em>{Katherine Pic-cola </em>and <em>Lawrence J.

Deputy James is entitled to General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c benefits because he was injured while in the performance of special work related to the nature of heightened risks and duties unique to the criminal justice process. <em>(Matter of Dobbertin v Town of Chester, </em>292 AD2d 382, 98 NY2d 605; <em>Brady v City of New Rochelle, </em>296 AD2d 365; <em>Matter of Balcerak v County of Nassau, </em>94 NY2d 253; <em>Matter of Ertner v County of Chenango, </em>280 AD2d 851; <em>Matter of Dembowski v Hanna, </em>245 AD2d 1039, 91 NY2d 813; <em>Matter of Geremski v Department of Fire of City of Syracuse, </em>72 Misc 2d 166, 42 AD2d 1050, 33 NY2d 521; <em>Matter of Theroux v Reilly, </em>297 AD2d 384; <em>Matter of Wagman v Kapcia, </em>300 AD2d 406; <em>Matter of Clements v Panzarella, </em>297 AD2d 4; <em>Matter of Bonkoski v Village of Suffern, </em>296 AD2d 404.) II. General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c benefits are not contingent upon the alleged heightened risks and duties standard. <em>(Matter of Theroux v Reilly, </em>297 AD2d 384, 99 NY2d 503; <em>McCluskey v Cromwell, </em>11 NY 593; <em>Matter of Erie County Agric.

The \u201cheightened risks and duties\u201d standard of <em>Matter of Balcerak v County of Nassau </em>(94 NY2d 253 [1999]) is consistent with both the letter and spirit of General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c. <em>(Matter of DePoalo v County of Schenectady, </em>85 NY2d 527; <em>Matter of Clements v Panzarella, </em>297 AD2d 4; <em>Matter of White v County of Cortland, </em>97 NY2d 336; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number><em>Matter of Laudico v Netzel, </em>254 AD2d 811.)

Lower courts have improperly interpreted the dicta in <em>Matter of Balcerak v County of Nassau </em>(94 NY2d 253 [1999]) as creating a new higher standard for the administration of General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c benefits. <em>(Matter of Bonkoski v Village of Suffern, </em>296 AD2d 404; <em>Matter of Travison v County of Albany, </em>291 AD2d 705; <em>Matter of Sills v Livingston, </em>294 AD2d 922; <em>Youngs v Village of Penn Yan, </em>291 AD2d 852; <em>Matter of Stalter v Scarpato, </em>297 AD2d 382; <em>Matter of Clements v Panzarella, </em>297 AD2d 4; <em>Matter of Sutherland v Village of Suffern, </em>289 AD2d 582; <em>Matter of Ertner v County of Chenango, </em>280 AD2d 851; <em>Bright Homes v Wright, </em>8 NY2d 157; <em>Matter of Metropolitan Life Ins.

III. <em>Matter of Balcerak v County of Nassau </em>(94 NY2d 253 [1999]) should be rectified in light of <em>Matter of White v County of Cortland </em>(97 NY2d 336 [2002]). <em>(Fasanaro v County of Rockland, </em>166 Misc 2d 152, 237 AD2d 436, 90 NY2d 913; <em>Matter of Meyers v Loughren, </em>228 AD2d 927; <em>Glens Falls Portland Cement Co. v Van Wirt Constr.

IV Decisions prior to <em>Matter of Balcerak v County of Nassau </em>(94 NY2d 253 [1999]) established a bright-line test for granting benefits under the statute. <em>(Fasanaro v County of Rockland, </em>166 Misc 2d 152.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b291-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b291-6\">Read, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">At issue in this appeal is whether eligibility for benefits under General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c is contingent upon the municipal employee\u2019s demonstrating an injury sustained in the performance of special work related to the heightened risks and duties inherent in law enforcement. We conclude that section 207-c does not require such a \u201cheightened risk\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">Originally enacted in 1961, General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c provides for the payment of the full amount of regular salary or wages to a police officer or other covered municipal employee who is injured \u201cin the performance of his duties\u201d or is taken ill \u201cas a result of the performance of his duties\u201d (\u00a7 207-c [1]). These payments continue until the disability has ceased, or the disabled employee is granted a disability retirement. The payments stop if the employee either performs, or refuses to perform, light-duty work. The municipality is also liable for all medical treatment and hospital care necessitated by the injury or illness. Payments for these medical expenses continue after the employee\u2019s retirement, and are bestowed in addition to any retirement allowance or pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">When interpreting a statute, we turn first to the text as the best evidence of the Legislature\u2019s intent. \u201cAs a general rule, unambiguous language of a statute is alone determinative\u201d <em>(Riley v County of Broome, </em>95 NY2d 455, 463 [2000] [citation omitted]). Here, the text does not suggest any legislative intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>create a \u201cheightened risk\u201d standard. Section 207-c affords eligibility to those covered municipal employees who are \u201cinjured in the performance of [their] duties,\u201d not to those who are \u201cinjured in the performance of duties entailing the heightened risk of law enforcement,\u201d or words to similar effect. If the Legislature had intended to restrict section 207-c eligibility to employees injured when performing specialized tasks, it easily could have and surely would have written the statute to say so. We may not create a limitation that the Legislature did not enact. Further, a statute\u2019s plain meaning must be discerned \u201cwithout resort to forced or unnatural interpretations\u201d <em>(Castro v United Container Mach. Group, </em>96 NY2d 398, 401 [2001], citing McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 232). Reading section 207-c in an unforced and natural manner, we conclude that the word \u201cduties\u201d encompasses the full range of a covered municipal employee\u2019s job duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Our interpretation is consistent not only with the statute\u2019s words, but also with legislative history. While repeatedly amending section 207-c to extend its benefits to additional classes of municipal employees,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Legislature routinely referred to the important, often dangerous and stressful, work these employees perform day in and day out.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Legislature thus pointed to \u201cheightened risk\u201d as the rationale for selecting additional classes of municipal employees for inclusion within section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>207-c, not as the standard for determining eligibility for section 207-c benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Finally, the Legislature enacted section 207-c to create parity between police officers and firefighters, who had been eligible for the same benefits since 1938 under General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-a and its predecessor <em>(see </em>L 1961, ch 920; L 1938, ch 562, \u00a7 1). While section 207-a served as the template for section 207-c, Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller approved the bill enacting section 207-c at a price of the Legislature\u2019s fixing the \u201csubstantial problems\u201d that had arisen in section 207-a\u2019s administration <em>(see </em>Governor\u2019s Mem approving L 1961, ch 920, 1961 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 2141). Notably, these \u201csubstantial problems\u201d did not include the standard for determining eligibility. Thus, sections 207-a and 207-c share the identical operative phrase regarding eligibility\u2014\u201cin the performance of his duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">There is every indication that municipalities have always awarded section 207-a benefits to firefighters without reference to whether the specific injury-causing activity was one entailing the \u201cheightened risk\u201d of firefighting <em>(see e.g. Matter of Robida v Mirrington, </em>1 Misc 2d 968 [Sup Ct 1956] [firefighter injured while performing duties as master mechanic of the department]; <em>Matter of Adam v Farbo, </em>16 Misc 2d 614 [Sup Ct 1959] [firefighter injured when he slipped during demonstration of new fire fighting technique]; <em>Matter of Kirley v Department of Fire, City of Oneida, </em>138 AD2d 842 [3d Dept 1988] [firefighter injured when cleaning a firetruck]). Until very recently, municipalities seem to have likewise routinely awarded section 207-c benefits without regard to any \u201cheightened risk\u201d posed by the task that the employee was carrying out when injured <em>(see e.g. O'Dette v Parton, </em>190 AD2d 1074, 1074 [4th Dept 1993] [deputy sheriff \u201cwas injured while on routine patrol in a sheriffs patrol vehicle\u201d]); or the courts have thwarted municipalities seeking to impose this kind of limitation, regarding it as \u201c \u2018out of harmony with the statute\u2019 \u201d <em>(Matter of Laudico v Netzel, </em>254 AD2d 811, 812 [4th Dept 1998] [citation omitted] [Court rejected municipality\u2019s rule to limit section 207-c eligibility to injuries occurring \u201cas a direct result of contact with an inmate\u201d]). What dramatically altered this picture was our decision in <em>Matter of Balcerak v County of Nassau </em>(94 NY2d 253 [1999]), to which we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">In <em>Balcerak, </em>a Nassau County corrections officer applied for workers\u2019 compensation and section 207-c benefits following his injury while driving home from a special assignment. The officer received workers\u2019 compensation benefits, but the County denied him section 207-c benefits. The officer commenced an article 78 proceeding, arguing that he was entitled to section 207-c benefits because the County was bound, under collateral estoppel principles, by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board\u2019s finding that he had been injured while on duty. We rejected his argument, noting that these two statutory benefit schemes \u201cfollow paths of differential interpretation and application\u201d <em>(Balcerak, </em>94 NY2d at 258). In fact, the Legislature chose different eligibility standards\u2014\u201carising out of and in the course of employment\u201d for workers\u2019 compensation benefits; \u201cin the performance of his duties\u201d for section 207-c benefits <em>(id. </em>at 258-259).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">We compared the legislative rationale for enacting the two different benefit regimes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">\u201cGeneral Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c benefits were meant to fulfill a narrow and important purpose. The goal is to compensate specified municipal employees for injuries incurred in the performance of special work related to the nature of heightened risks and duties. These functions are keyed to \u2018the criminal justice process, including investigations, presentencing, criminal supervision, treatment and other preventative corrective services\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at 259, quoting Senate Mem in Support of L 1997, ch 675, 1997 NY Legis Ann, at 458 [adding Nassau County probation officers to section 207-c]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">By contrast, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u201cis the State\u2019s most general and comprehensive social program, enacted to provide all injured employees with some scheduled compensation and medical expenses, regardless of fault for ordinary and unqualified employment duties\u201d <em>(id. </em>[citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">We concluded that an officer might qualify for workers\u2019 compensation, but not for section 207-c benefits, offering this illustration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-12\">\u201c[A] police officer may be entitled to Workers\u2019 Compensation benefits as a result of an injury during a Police Department team basketball practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>because the nature of the activities may allow the injury to be considered as \u2018arising out of and in the course\u2019 of the employment. That kind of injury however, is not the heightened risk type intended to be deemed automatically as arising during the \u2018performance\u2019 of duties related to \u2018the criminal justice process\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at 260 [quoted citation omitted]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Knitting together this illustration and our discussion of the Legislature\u2019s stated rationale for selecting the classes of municipal employees covered by section 207-c, the Appellate Divisions in the cases before us read <em>Balcerak </em>to create a \u201cheightened risk\u201d standard. Under this standard, benefit eligibility turns on the nature of the specific task being performed by the employee at the time of injury; the employee is eligible for section 207-c benefits only if performing a task that entails a \u201cheightened risk\u201d peculiar to law enforcement work. The only question before us in <em>Balcerak, </em>however, was \u201cwhether a determination by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board that an injury is work-related should, by operation of collateral estoppel, automatically entitle an injured employee to General Municipal Law \u00a7 207-c benefits\u201d <em>(Balcerak, </em>94 NY2d at 256). We did not set out to interpret the phrase \u201cin the performance of his duties.\u201d Indeed, we remitted the case to the Appellate Division to address whether the officer was injured in the performance of his duties without specifying any standard for making this determination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Moreover, in <em>Matter of White v County of Cortland </em>(97 NY2d 336 [2002]) we rejected a \u201cheightened standard of proof\u2019 to establish eligibility for section 207-c benefits <em>(id. </em>at 339). There, we stated that \u201c[s]ection 207-c provides benefits to officers who are disabled \u2018in the performance of or \u2018as a result of their job duties and does not require that they additionally demonstrate that their disability is related in a substantial degree to their job duties\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Consistent with <em>White, </em>we hold that in order to be eligible for section 207-c benefits, a covered municipal em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>ployee need only prove a \u201cdirect causal relationship between job duties and the resulting illness or injury\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 340 [citations omitted]). The word \u201cduties\u201d in section 207-c encompasses the full range of a covered employee\u2019s job duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">In each of these three article 78 proceedings, the Appellate Division upheld the municipality\u2019s denial of section 207-c benefits to municipal employees based on erroneous application of a \u201cheightened risk\u201d standard to determine eligibility. Although we acknowledge that there are competing financial and policy considerations on both sides of this issue, \u201clegislative intent is the great and controlling principle\u201d <em>(Council of City of N.Y. v Giuliani, </em>93 NY2d 60, 69 [1999]). The Legislature expressed its intent in the language of section 207-c, which manifestly does not restrict eligibility for its benefits in the manner advocated by the municipal respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Accordingly, in <em>Theroux, </em>the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the order of Supreme Court reinstated; in <em>Wagman, </em>the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the case remitted to Supreme Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion; and in <em>James, </em>the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the judgment of Supreme Court reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B. Smith, Ciparick, Rosenblatt and Graffeo concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">In <em>Matter of Theroux v Reilly. </em>Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">In <em>Matter of Wagman v Kapica: </em>Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">In <em>Matter of James v County of Yates Sheriff\u2019s Dept.: </em>Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-6\">. In 1980, the Legislature amended section 207-c to add sheriffs, under-sheriffs and sheriffs department corrections officers to the list of covered employees. In 1985, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1996 (twice) and 1997, the Legislature extended section 207-c to additional classes of municipal employees; specifically, detective-investigators in the district attorney\u2019s office (L 1985, ch 696), Erie County corrections officers (L 1990, ch 885), Long Island Rail Road police officers (L 1991, ch 628), certain investigators in the office of a county\u2019s district attorney (L 1993, ch 565), Nassau County advanced ambulance medical technicians (L 1996, ch 476), certain Nassau County fire inspectors and fire marshals (L 1996, ch 621) and Nassau County probation officers (L 1997, ch 675).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b292-7\">. For example, advanced ambulance medical technicians \u201care assigned to many of the same hazardous situations and potentially life-threatening duties\u201d as police officers, and often respond to \u2018 \u2018life-threatening police assignments such as riots, hostage or barricade situations\u201d (Senate Mem in Support of L 1996, ch 476, 1996 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 2418). Similarly, Nassau County probation officers \u201cfind themselves performing many of the functions performed by their counterparts in the police and corrections services,\u201d and \u201care exposed on a daily basis to the risks and dangers involved in managing an increasingly violent criminal population. In addition, they are regularly exposed to significant amounts of stress and aggravation, not to mention a high possibility of bodily injury that may result from the performance of their duties\u201d (Senate Mem in Support of L 1997, ch 675, 1997 McKinney\u2019s Session Laws of NY, at 2648).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b295-7\">. Interestingly, on remand the Appellate Division held that Supreme Court had erred in concluding that the County did not have a rational basis for its decision because \u201c[t]he [officer] had been relieved of his post, had left the hospital property [where he had been stationed], and was en route home in his own car when he was injured. Thus, the [County\u2019s] determination that the [officer] was not injured in the performance of his duties was a rational one\u201d <em>(Matter of Balcerak v County of Nassau, </em>274 AD2d 580, 581 [2d Dept 2000]). In other words, the officer was off duty and so was necessarily no longer performing his job duties when he was injured. There was no discussion of \u201cheightened risk.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
