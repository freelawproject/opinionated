We conclude, as did the trial court, that the County Attorney\u2019s decision was not arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The action for which petitioner seeks a taxpayer-paid defense grew out of a long feud between petitioner and his neighbor, Co<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>rey Kay, over Kay\u2019s use of his property. Brought in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York under 42 USC \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985 and 1986, Kay\u2019s complaint,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> served in March 2000, was lodged against the County of Suffolk, and against petitioner and a fellow Suffolk County police officer, personally and in their official capacity. According to the complaint, in July 1996 Kay purchased property next door to petitioner in Mt. Sinai, New York, and leased two cottages on the premises for year-round occupancy to recipients of social services\u2014to which petitioner objected. Kay charged that petitioner, who himself had attempted to purchase the property for similar purposes, persistently complained to town authorities and to the District Attorney that documents relating to year-round use of the cottages were forged or illegal, resulting in the arrest of Joan Van Middelem, the realtor on Kay\u2019s purchase of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">After the realtor\u2019s acquittal, and again at petitioner\u2019s behest\u2014 the complaint continues\u2014a warrant was issued for Kay\u2019s arrest on similar charges; those charges also were dismissed. Kay alleged that the arrests were based on false statements provided by petitioner, and that as a police officer petitioner used his position and contacts to harass, annoy and alarm Kay and to \u201ccause a reign of terror upon\u201d him, including proceedings instituted before town boards and Supreme Court over use of his property. Kay asserted that petitioner\u2019s actions constituted a deprivation of constitutional rights, malicious prosecution and false arrest, and other wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Kay\u2019s lawsuit actually followed by months a similar action filed in the same court by the realtor <em>(see Joan Van Middelem v County of Suffolk, </em>Civil Action No. 99-2707). Shortly after the <em>Van Middelem </em>action was instituted, petitioner requested a taxpayer-paid defense under Suffolk County Code \u00a7 35-3 (A). After investigation by his Defense Evaluation Committee, the County Attorney concluded that petitioner had not acted in his capacity as a police officer in the alleged wrongdoing and denied his request for a defense. As the Committee reported:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">\u201c[T]he facts as presently known to the committee show that [petitioner] did not act in his capacity as a police officer in pursuing this matter. Rather, he acted as a concerned homeowner, and utilized re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>sources, including FOIL, available to any private citizen, in bringing this matter to the attention of responsible authorities. Stated differently, [petitioner] did not act in the scope of his duties or authority as a police officer. He sought to protect his private interests as a homeowner in engaging in the course of conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The Committee noted its reliance on a Police Department Internal Affairs report which explained that, through his own FOIL requests, petitioner learned that there had been no zoning change for the cottages from summer to year-round occupancy, and that the Town\u2019s certificate of zoning compliance had been based on affidavits (allegedly false) secured by the broker from two elderly neighbors. Petitioner\u2019s persistence included commencing administrative proceedings and litigation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to the Internal Affairs report, petitioner took the information he had learned to his codefendant fellow officer. Based in part on petitioner\u2019s deposition, which did not indicate in any way that he was acting in an official capacity, that officer swore out a criminal complaint against the broker; those charges were dismissed on the death of one of the affiants. Other Internal Affairs documents, which are part of the record before us, include a variety of Kay and Van Middelem reports about petitioner to the Police Department reflecting escalating acrimony between the parties, such as petitioner\u2019s alleged obscene gestures, inappropriate traffic stop and operation of an unlicensed business.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Petitioner did not pursue the County Attorney\u2019s denial of his request for a legal defense in the <em>Van Middelem </em>action.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">After Kay commenced his federal court action, petitioner asked that the County provide for his defense in that case because the Kay complaint alleges that he was acting as a police officer, and because Department directives required all off-duty officers to report suspected or observed unlawful activities to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>on-duty police personnel. Again the County Attorney denied petitioner\u2019s request for a County-funded defense, finding that petitioner was not acting within the scope of employment in connection with the incidents that formed the basis of Kay\u2019s complaint. Again the County Attorney relied on a Defense Evaluation Committee report, which rested in part on its earlier findings and concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">\u201c[notwithstanding the boilerplate allegations in the complaint, the operative facts, as distinguished from the legal conclusions asserted in the complaint do not establish that [petitioner] was acting within the scope of his employment. For example, the complaint recites [petitioner\u2019s] private litigation, which was clearly not brought by him in his official capacity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Petitioner then instituted this article 78 proceeding arguing that a plain reading of Suffolk County Code \u00a7 35-3 (A) obligates the County to provide him with a defense. Supreme Court agreed with the County\u2019s determination that the acts attributed to petitioner were not committed while he was acting in furtherance of his public employment. The Appellate Division, however, reversed and found that the \u201cclear and unambiguous language\u201d contained in the legislation obligated the County to afford petitioner a defense because \u201c[s]ome of the acts asserted in the complaint in the underlying federal civil rights action were alleged by the plaintiff to have been performed by the petitioner in his capacity as an employee of the County of Suffolk\u201d (298 AD2d 589, 590 [2d Dept 2002]). We now reverse and reinstate Supreme Court\u2019s dismissal of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Suffolk County Code \u00a7 35-3 (A) was enacted in 1981 to provide for the defense of County employees who may be charged in civil actions with violating the law \u201cin the performance of their duties\u201d (Suffolk County Code \u00a7 35-1). The Legislature viewed the provision as a way to encourage qualified applicants to accept employment with the County, without burdening them with legal expenses incurred in defense of allegations of misconduct \u201cin office\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">As the Appellate Division noted, the Code provides for a defense, in clear and unambiguous language, for acts alleged in the complaint to have occurred while the employee was acting within the scope of his public employment, or actions brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>to enforce any provisions of 42 USC \u00a7\u00a7 1981-1988. But that is not the end of the matter, or the section. The Code goes on to provide, in equally clear and unambiguous language, that the County Attorney is to determine \u201cin the first instance\u201d whether an employee was acting within the scope of employment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">While the two provisions of section 35-3 (A) are seemingly at odds with each other, in fact they are fully reconcilable. Clearly, the Suffolk County Legislature by this provision did not commit public funds to an employee\u2019s defense based solely on the words chosen by a plaintiff in framing a complaint. Allowing a plaintiff to dictate whether Suffolk County must provide an employee with a defense would indeed be an unintended result of section 35-3 (A) <em>(see Bestafka v County of Suffolk, </em>121 AD2d 670, 671 [2d Dept 1986], <em>Iv denied </em>68 NY2d 610 [1986]). The reconciling principle between the provision for a public defense protecting employees, and the provision for review by the County Attorney, is that the action of the County Attorney must not be arbitrary or capricious, or it will be set aside <em>(see Matter of Williams v City of New York, </em>64 NY2d 800, 802 [1985]).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Here, the factual record supports the County Attorney\u2019s determination that petitioner\u2019s alleged acts of wrongdoing against Kay were the consequence of his private interest as a property owner, not his public responsibility as a police officer.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That he was acting to protect and advance his private self-interest is demonstrated, for example, by his individual FOIL requests, by his statements submitted as a long-time community member, not as a police officer, in support of criminal charges against Kay, and by the proceedings in his name challenging Kay\u2019s use of the property. Plainly, the County Attorney\u2019s determination denying him a defense was neither arbitrary nor capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Finally, we do not reach petitioner\u2019s alternative argument that Suffolk County Code \u00a7 35-3 (A) is preempted by General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Municipal Law \u00a7 50-m. Preemption was not raised in the petition, or before Supreme Court. Petitioner raised preemption for the first time in his motion for \u201creargument and/or renewal,\u201d which Supreme Court denied. Neither court below having addressed preemption, we will not be the first to do so <em>(see Bingham v New York City Tr. Auth., </em>99 NY2d 355, 359-360 [2003]).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the judgment of Supreme Court, dismissing the petition, reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Judges G.B. Smith, Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Graffeo and Read concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-8\">. Winfield Properties, Ltd., is also a named plaintiff. Kay is its sole shareholder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b222-8\">. <em>(See e.g. Matter of Gary Salino v Town of Brookhaven Bd. of Zoning Appeals et al., </em>Sup Ct, Suffolk County, June 10, 1999, Seidell, J., Index No. 24221/98 [remitting the matter to the Town\u2019s Zoning Board of Appeals for further hearing and findings of fact to determine the nonconforming status of the property].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b222-9\">. Though these complaints were for the most part ultimately found unsubstantiated, petitioner was relocated because of ongoing disputes with civilians in his patrol area. The Internal Affairs documents also show that petitioner and the arresting officer were exonerated by the Department for the arrests of Kay and Van Middelem, which were found to have been supported by probable cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b224-8\">. Similar \u201cfirst instance\u201d clauses are found elsewhere <em>(see e.g. </em>General Municipal Law \u00a7 50-k [2] [as determined by Corporation Counsel]; Code of City of Buffalo \u00a7 35-28 [same]; Code of City of Albany \u00a7 38-7 [A] [same]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b224-9\">. So long as the County Attorney\u2019s determination has a factual basis, it will be sustained. As counsel recognized at oral argument, however, should the factfinder in the federal action ultimately determine that petitioner was indeed acting within the scope of his public employment, as Kay alleges, an issue regarding petitioner\u2019s right to indemnification might arise (see <em>Jeffreys v Griffin, </em>1 NY3d 34 [2003] [collateral estoppel is a flexible doctrine]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b224-10\">. According to petitioner\u2019s Memorandum of Law submitted in Supreme Court, his fellow officer was advised that Suffolk County would provide for his defense in the federal litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
