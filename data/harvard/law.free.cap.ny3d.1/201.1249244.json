We conclude that the claims do not comply because they fail to allege the times when and the place where the claims arose, any items of damage or the total sum claimed. We further conclude that the State must follow the steps in CPLR 3022 in order to preserve any objection that a claim or notice of intention does not comply with the verification requirement in section 11 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">Claimants are public employees working in executive branch agencies in civil service titles allocated salary grade 23 or higher. They are all included within the Professional, Scientific and Technical Services Unit (PS&amp;T), which is represented by the Public Employees Federation (PEF) for purposes of collective bargaining with the State of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">On July 21, 1994, the <em>Lepkowski </em>claimants and other PS&amp;T employees sued the State in federal court, seeking unpaid overtime pay, liquid\u00e1ted damages and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, to all of which they claimed entitlement under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). In February 1996, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>plaintiff employees moved for partial summary judgment on liability and the State cross-moved for summary judgment to dismiss. The State contended, among other things, that the Eleventh Amendment guarantee of state sovereign immunity deprived the federal courts of subject matter jurisdiction. The United States District Court for the Northern District of New York rejected the argument, and held that the State was liable for overtime compensation to certain of these employees on account of <em>\u201ca </em>minor aspect of one of [the State\u2019s] policies\u201d <em>(Close v State of New York, </em>1996 WL 67979, *11, 1996 US Dist LEXIS 1748, *34 [ND NY, Feb. 13, 1996]).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">While the case was pending in District Court, however, the United States Supreme Court handed down <em>Seminole Tribe of Fla. v Florida </em>(517 US 44 [1996]), which significantly altered prior understandings of Congress\u2019 authority to abrogate the states\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity. In light of <em>Seminole, </em>the State succeeded when it again sought dismissal on Eleventh Amendment grounds (1996 WL 481550, 1996 US Dist LEXIS 12330 [ND NY, Aug. 19, 1996]), and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed (125 F3d 31 [1997]).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">On January 22, 1998, roughly five months after the Second Circuit\u2019s decision, the <em>Lepkowski </em>claim was filed in the Court of Claims. The claim, which mimics the dismissed federal FLSA complaint, alleges that the employees worked over 40 hours in unspecified work weeks from July 1992 to the present; it does not identify where the claims arose, itemize damages or indicate the total sum sought. One individual claimant verified the claim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>to which is attached a list of 377 claimants with their home addresses.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">On February 19, 1997, claimants in <em>Abelson </em>served the Attorney General with a notice of intention to file an FLSA claim in the Court of Claims on behalf of 390 PS&amp;T employees. The <em>Abelson </em>claim, filed on January 21, 1998, alleges that claimants worked more than 40 hours in unspecified work weeks since April 1994, and does not identify where the claims arose, itemize damages or indicate the total sum sought. One individual claimant verified <em>Abelson </em>on behalf of all claimants, who fisted their home addresses and identified the state agencies for which they worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">By order filed on January 28, 1999, the Court of Claims consolidated <em>Abelson </em>into <em>Lepkowski, </em>finding that consolidation would allow for more efficient discovery since 148 of the claimants were included in both cases. In June 2001, the State moved to dismiss on various grounds, including failure to comply with both the substantive pleading and the verification requirements of Court of Claims Act \u00a7 11 (b). This provision prescribes in relevant part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">\u201c[t]he claim <em>shall state </em>the time when and place where such claim arose, the nature of same, and the items of damage or injuries claimed to have been sustained and the total sum claimed . . . The claim and notice of intention to file a claim shall be verified in the same manner as a complaint in an action in the supreme court\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">In a decision and order filed on September 14, 2001, the Court of Claims denied the State\u2019s motion to dismiss on section 11 (b) grounds, concluding that both claims were sufficiently detailed to fulfill section 11 (b)\u2019s substantive pleading requirements, and were properly verified within the meaning of CPLR 3020 (d) because the verifiers had knowledge of the facts and were united in interest with the other claimants. On the State\u2019s cross appeal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Appellate Division, with two Justices dissenting, reversed and granted the State\u2019s motion to dismiss (302 AD2d 765 [3d Dept 2003]).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>In the Appellate Division\u2019s view, \u201c[w]hile the claims . . . satisfactorily state the nature of the relief sought by claimants, they completely fail to provide the times when and the place where such claims arose, any items of damage or the total sum claimed\u201d as required by section 11 (b) (302 AD2d at 766). These omissions were not remedied by any access that the State might have to this information from its own records because \u201cthe sufficiency of a claim rests solely upon the assertions contained therein, and [the State] is not required to go beyond the claim in order to investigate\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Further, the record before the Court \u201cbelie[d] a claim that claimants\u2019 work hours were a matter of public record readily ascertainable by [the State]\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 766-767). Finally, the Appellate Division concluded that while the claimants might be united in interest, \u201cthere is no evidence that the two claimants who verified the claims are acquainted with the factual premises for the remaining . . . claimants\u2019 entitlement to overtime compensation\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 767).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">In the opinion of the two dissenting Justices, however, claimants complied with the substantive pleading requirements of section 11 (b) by alleging the \u201cproverbial where, when and how\u201d of their claims in enough \"detail for the State to \u201cconduct a meaningful investigation regarding its potential liability\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 768); and the State waived any objection to defective verification by virtue of its failure to take timely action under CPLR 3022 <em>(id. </em>at 769). Claimants now appeal to us as of right (CPLR 5601 [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The State\u2019s waiver of immunity from suits for money damages is not absolute, but rather is contingent upon a claimant\u2019s compliance with specific conditions placed on the waiver by the Legislature <em>(see </em>Court of Claims Act \u00a7 8 [specifying that the State waives its immunity from liability and action \u201cprovided the claimant complies with the limitations\u201d of article II of the Court of Claims Act, which includes section 11]; <em>see also Alston v State of New York, </em>97 NY2d at 163). Further, \u201c[b]ecause suits against the State are allowed only by the State\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity and in derogation of the common law, statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>tory requirements conditioning suit must be strictly construed\u201d <em>(Lichtenstein v State of New York, </em>93 NY2d 911, 913 [1999], quoting <em>Dreger v New York State Thruway Auth., </em>81 NY2d 721, 724 [1992]). As relevant here, section 11 (b) places five specific substantive conditions upon the State\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity by requiring the claim to specify (1) \u201cthe nature of [the claim]\u201d; (2) \u201cthe time when\u201d it arose; (3) the \u201cplace where\u201d it arose; (4) \u201cthe items of damage or injuries claimed to have been sustained\u201d; and (5) \u201cthe total sum claimed.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Claimants fulfilled section 11 (b)\u2019s requirement to specify \u201cthe nature of [the claim].\u201d They asserted that each named claimant was a past or present state employee; was in the PS&amp;T bargaining unit; was assigned to a civil service title allocated grade 23 or higher; had worked overtime; was required to be paid overtime compensation pursuant to the FLSA; and was not paid this overtime compensation. They did not, however, adequately allege the remaining elements required by section 11 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">As for \u201cthe time when\u201d the claims accrued, the <em>Lepkowski </em>claimants specified July 1992 and continuing to the present, and the <em>Abelson </em>claimants specified April 1994 and continuing to the present.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> All that the State may guess from these allegations is that some or all of the 377 <em>Lepkowski </em>and 390 <em>Abelson </em>claimants worked some number of hours in excess of 40 in some or all of the work weeks over many months and years. This is insufficiently definite \u201cto enable the State ... to investigate the claim[s] promptly and to ascertain its liability under the circumstances,\u201d which is the guiding principle informing section 11 (b) <em>(Heisler v State of New York, </em>78 AD2d 767, 767 [4th Dept 1980]).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Claimants assert in their brief that the \u201cplace where\u201d their claims arose is their various work locations. These are not specified. <em>Lepkowski </em>includes the claimants\u2019 names and home ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>dresses, but does not identify the state agency or department for which each claimant worked or in any other way particularize where any claim arose. In addition to names and home addresses, <em>Abelson </em>identifies the agency or department for which each claimant worked, but not a primary work location. For those claimants employed in agencies or departments that maintain offices in multiple locations, <em>Abelson </em>reveals little more than that their claims arose somewhere within the state\u2019s borders.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">As for \u201cthe items of damage or injuries\u201d and the \u201ctotal sum\u201d sought, the claims are similarly silent. Claimants allege only that they \u201cseek recovery of all unpaid overtime compensation for all hours worked over 40 hours in a work week and not compensated at one and one-half times the regular rate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Claimants contend that the State can easily ascertain from its personnel records exactly when and where each claim arose and how much their claims are worth; however, this is not the State\u2019s burden. The Court of Claims Act does not require the State to ferret out or assemble information that section 11 (b) obligates the claimant to allege <em>(Cobin v State of New York, </em>234 AD2d 498, 499 [2d Dept 1996]). Moreover, we agree with the Appellate Division that, as a matter of fact, the record does not establish that the State possesses detailed time records for claimants for the time periods covered by this litigation. State employees holding positions allocated salary grade 23 or higher were not required to record actual hours worked on their time sheets until the 1999-2003 collective bargaining agreement between the State and PEF took effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">As noted earlier, claimants first pressed their FLSA claims in federal court; however, the substantive pleading requirements in the Court of Claims differ substantially from the rules for pleading a complaint in federal court <em>(see </em>Fed Rules Civ Pro rule 8 [a] [\u201cA pleading which sets forth a claim for relief . . . shall contain (1) a short and plain statement of (jurisdictional grounds), (2) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, and (3) a demand for judgment for the relief the pleader seeks\u201d]). Here, claimants have recycled their federal complaint into a claim without refashioning its elements to conform with section 11 (b)\u2019s substantive pleading requirements, which condition the State\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity. These claims were required, at the very least, to specify the state agency or department for which each claimant worked; the primary work location for each claimant; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>those work weeks in which each claimant worked overtime; the actual number of hours of overtime worked by each claimant during these work weeks; and the total sum of damages sought by each claimant as unpaid overtime as of the date of filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Since these claims are jurisdictionally defective for nonconformity with section 11 (b)\u2019s substantive pleading requirements, we need not reach the questions raised by the parties regarding verification. In light of the proliferating Court of Claims cases on the subject of section 11 (b)\u2019s verification requirement, however, we consider it advisable to dispel the gathering confusion about whether or under what circumstances CPLR 3022 bears on the matter.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Pursuant to CPLR 3022, \u201cwhen a pleading is required to be verified, the recipient of an unverified or defectively verified pleading may treat it as a nullity provided that the recipient \u2018with due diligence\u2019 returns the [pleading] with notification of the reason(s) for deeming the verification defective\u201d <em>(Matter of Miller v Board of Assessors, </em>91 NY2d 82, 86 [1997]). We have never specified a uniform time period by which to measure due diligence <em>(id. </em>n 3). A defendant who does not notify the adverse party\u2019s attorney with due diligence waives any objection to an absent or defective verification.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Section 11 (b) requires the claim and notice of intention to be verified <em>\u201cin the same manner </em>as a complaint in an action in the [S]upreme [C]ourt\u201d (emphasis added). \u201cManner\u201d is commonly understood to mean \u201c[t]he way in which something is done or takes place; method of action; mode of procedure\u201d (9 Oxford English Dictionary 324 [2d ed 1989]). Because the Legislature has mandated that verification \u201ctake[ ] place\u201d in the Court of Claims following the same \u201cmethod of action\u201d or \u201cmode of procedure\u201d employed for an action in Supreme Court, there is no basis for treating an unverified or defectively verified claim or notice of intention any differently than an unverified or defectively verified complaint is treated under the CPLR in Supreme Court. Section 11 (b) therefore embraces CPLR 3022\u2019s remedy for lapses in verification.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B. Smith, Ciparick, Rosenblatt and Gbaffeo concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b256-7\">. Pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement between the State and PEF as well as the Rules of the Comptroller, employees holding positions allocated salary grade 23 or higher were not paid overtime compensation for horns worked over 40 in a given work week. Although these employees were considered salaried and therefore ineligible for overtime compensation, their pay was nonetheless potentially subject to deductions for minor disciplinary infractions, court appearances as a party to an action, military service and absences less than one day. The employees argued that as a result, the State violated the FLSA\u2019s salary basis test for determining whether an employee qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative or professional employee exempt from the FLSA\u2019s overtime provisions; and was required to compensate them for overtime hours worked. The District Court Judge held that the partial-day docking, court appearance and military service provisions of the salary basis test were invalid in the public sector, but that the disciplinary penalties provision applied. He accordingly determined that the State\u2019s policy to dock these employees\u2019 pay for minor disciplinary infractions removed them from the FLSA overtime exemption unless they were lawyers, physicians or certain computer operators.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b257-8\">. The Court of Claims granted the State\u2019s motion to the extent of dismissing those portions of the <em>Lepkowski </em>and <em>Abelson </em>claims which sought declaratory and CPLR article 78 relief; and dismissing as untimely those <em>Lepkowski </em>claims accruing more than six months before the claim\u2019s filing, and those <em>Abelson </em>claims accruing more than six months before service of the notice of intention. Claimants appealed so much of the court\u2019s decision and order as applied the six-month statute of limitations in Court of Claims Act \u00a7 10 (4). They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>withdrew this appeal following our decision in <em>Alston v State of New York </em>(97 NY2d 159 [2001] [holding that under the terms of the waiver of sovereign immunity in Court of Claims Act \u00a7 8, the State retained its immunity as to claims not complying with the time limitations in Court of Claims Act \u00a7 10 (4), upon which the waiver was conditioned]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b259-8\">. By contrast, while CPLR 3017 (a) requires a complaint to contain a demand for the relief sought, CPLR 3017 (c) for many years has provided that the complaint in a medical or dental malpractice suit or in an action against a municipality shall <em>not </em>state the amount of money damages sought. Just recently, the Legislature amended section 3017 (c), which now prohibits the complaint in a personal injury or wrongful death action from setting forth the amount of money damages sought (see L 2003, ch 694, \u00a7 1, eff Nov. 27, 2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b259-9\">.

The Court of Claims\u2019 on-line database of decisions includes at least another half-dozen recent opinions exploring various implications of treating section 11 (b)\u2019s verification requirement as a nonwaivable jurisdictional prerequisite of the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction <em>(see </em>&lt;www.nyscourtofclaims.state.ny.us&gt;).
