Alonzo is ..yet alive and on notice appears in opposition to these proceedings. Whether he has children does not appear. The_trustee appointed by the probate court of the Elizabeth Davis trust\u201destate haspaid over to the petitioners all of the trust funds in his hands and settled his final account with that court. The trustee, E. C. Abell, of the Lucy Abbott trust estate, though knowing of the death of said Lucy and of the terms of the. will, has not settled or turned over his said trust estate to the petitioners nor communicated with them regarding it, but instead thereof after an investigation made at their request, turned over to Alonzo the whole of said trust estate, without any notice to the petitioners, whereby they might appear before the probate court and be heard in the premises, before distribution by the trustee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-5\">The petition further sets forth the claim of the petitioners as to the proper construction of the will in this respect, the rights and interests of the petitioners thereunder, as they claim them: that they are entitled either to the whole of said trust estate to the exclusion of Alonzo, or that with Alonzo they are entitled to an equal share of it; praying \u201cthat the said E. C. Abell and the said Alonzo Fay may be cited before said court to show cause if any they have why the said court should not decree the reversion and remainder in fee of the property of which said Lucy Abott had the life use, or such part thereof as your petitioners are entitled to under and by virtue of the last will and testament of the said Theodore Cary, to your petitioners, and to show cause if any they have why the said court should not decree and order them to pay over to your petitioners either the whole or a one-half part of the money and other property of which the said Lucy Abbott had the life use and which is now or has been formerly in their possession, care, and keeping\u201d; and that on notice to all parties interested, \u201cthe court do make its decree that the whole or a one-half part of the property of which Lucy Abbott had the life use <em>* * </em>* is the property ab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>solutely of your petitioners, and that the said court shall further decree that the said R. C. Abell and the said Alonzo Fay shall pay or turn over to your petitioners, or their duly authorized attorney, said property.\u201d On notice to all parties interested, a hearing was had before the probate court, all parties being present or represented by counsel, \u201cand thereupon the court having listened to a statement of facts regarding which there was no dispute and to the arguments of the counsel dismissed the said petition.\u201d An appeal was taken by the petitioners from this decree to the county court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-5\">The case being entered in the latter court, the defendant, Alonzo Fay, moved that the petition and appeal be dismissed for want of jurisdiction, which motion was overruled and exception by Alonzo. The defendant Abell moved that the petition and appeal be dismissed (1) because the county court had no appellate jurisdiction of said cause; (2) because it appears from the papers that there was no judgment, order or decree of the probate court, in which the petitioners are interested, have a right to complain, or from which they have a right to appeal. The motion was dismissed <em>pro forma </em>to which Abell excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b134-6\"><em>Butler &lt;&amp; Moloney </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b134-7\">The petition should have been dismissed. It runs against both Abell and Fay one of the legatees and asks that the title to the trust property be determined and property turned over before any final settlement is had. <em>Leach </em>v. <em>Leach, Exr. </em>50 Yt. 618; <em>Adams et al. </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>21 Yt. 162'; <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Kim-ball, </em>19 Yt. 579.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b134-8\">Alonzo is the survivor of the three and entitled to the fund. The will uses both the singular and the plural, survivor or survivors, showing that when only one survived he should take the whole of the portion of which the predeceased died possessed. The Lucy Abbott fund would therefore on the face of the petition go to and vest in Alonzo Fay who is the survivor and the only party in interest. <em>Woodward, </em>v. <em>Spear, </em>10 Yt. 420; <em>Hemenway </em>v. <em>Corey, </em>16 Yt. 225; In re <em>Clark\u2019s Estate, </em>79 Yt. 63,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b134-9\">The word \u201csurvivor\u201d will not be construed \u201cothers\u201d unless there is something in the context to indicate that such construction is necessary to effectuate the intention of the testator, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>the word \u201csurvivor\u201d is not construed \u201cothers\u201d unless absolutely necessary.

If this were not so, and those who die without issue die last, there would be no mode of giving effect to the gift over. 2 Redfield on Wills, 377; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Osborne, </em>6 H. L.

The grounds of the motion will be considered in their inverse order.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">It appears from the will that Alonzo, Elizabeth, and Lucy were brother and sisters, children of the testator\u2019s sister <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Asenath. By the second paragraph of the will Alonzo is given .a life estate in' certain property, remainder over,, to his children, if he have any,, in fee.^ By the third paragraph, the use of the rest of the property which the testator should have at his decease was given to be equally divided between Lucy and Elizabeth, \u201cduring their natural lives and the remainder and reversion in fee to their children as in the case of said Alonzo.\u201d It is argued that the testator created but two parts of his estate, giving his nephew a life estate in one with gift over to his children, if any, and that a life use of the other was given to the two nieces with gift over to their children; that the words \u201ctheir children\u201d mean the children of the two, or of either if the other should die without issue. But we do not think such a construction gives force to the words \u201cas in the ease of Alonzo.\u201d In his case the property in which he took a life estate was given over to <em>his </em>children, if any he have, in fee. Ajjift over in fee of the rest of the property in the same manner to the children of the two nieces, gives to the children of each, if any she have,, the property of which their mother had a life use; and thus the bequest, in the language of the will,igives \u201cthe remainder and reversion in fee to their children as in the case of Alonzo. \u2019 \u2019 This construction is aided by the clause which follows, creating cross remainders, \u201cand in case of the death of either of the said Alonzo, Lucy or Elizabeth then the share or shares of such deceased shall belong to the survivor or survivors of the other. \u2019 \u2019 This clause considered in connection with the provisions creating life estates with remainders over to the children of the respective life tenants, must be understood to mean the same as though the words \u201cwithout having children\u201d had been inserted immediately after the word \u201cElizabeth\u201d; and thereby on the death of either of the nieces without having children, the same as on the death of the nephew, without having children, her share is given over \u2014 a provision inconsistent with the view that by the will only one division of the testator\u2019s property is made and that one part thereof as a whole is taken by the nieces with gift over to, their children as a class.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">A more difficult question arises concerning the meaning of the words \u201csurvivor or survivors of the other.\u201d The will shows that the objects .of the testator\u2019s bounty were not only his nephew and nieces, but their children also. The cross remainders show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>that the testator had in mind not that one of the takers for life would die while the others were yet living, but that one might die without issue; and his purpose was to make a bequest which would dispose of his estate in ease such a contingency happened. A construction of \u201csurvivor and survivors\u201d according to their natural and literal import, as urged hy the petitionees, would give to Alonzo absolutely the jmtire share the life pse of which was had \"by Luey\u201cwEo died without issue, to the exclusion of the ^ children of their predeceased sister Elizabeth; and if Alonzo, the last of the life tenants, die without issue, there is no provision by which the share in which he has but a life tenancy goes over, \u2014it would be undisposed of, notwithstanding, the children of Elizabeth were yet alive. Clearly the testator did not contemplate such a result, for in this respect the will makes no distinction between the share of the life tenant who dies last and that .of either of the others, \u2014 it passes over in the same manner if the taker for life die without issue. As was said in the case of <em>Slade </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>decided this term, it may fairly be presumed that the testator did not intend partial intestacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Prom the context of the whole will we think the intention of the testator was to include in \u201csurvivor and survivors of the other\u201d the children of any who predeceased the one dying without issue; but this intention can be carried into effect only by giving \u201cthose words the meaning of \u201cother and others.\u201d True it is sometimes said that the more modern decisions lean toward the ordinary and natural meaning of the word \u201csurvivor,\u201d yet there is no diversity of authority that where the intention of the testator, gathered from the will itself, is plain that he meant to use it in the sense of \u201cother,\u201d such a construction will be given. 2 Redfield on Wills, 376-378; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Osborne, </em>6 H. L. Cas. 375; <em>Hawkins v.Hamerton, </em>16 Sim. 410; <em>Peacock </em>v. <em>Stock-ford, </em>7 De G. M. &amp; G. 129; In re Arnold\u2019s Trusts, L. R. 10 Eq. 251; In re Palmer\u2019s Settlement, L. R. 19 Eq. 320; <em>Wake </em>v. <em>Varah, </em>L. R. 2 Ch. 348; <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Bloodgood\u2019s Exrs., </em>3 Sand-ford\u2019s Ch. 321. It follows that on the allegations of the petition the_petitioners have a right to participate in the remainder and reversion, of the property of which Lucy Abbott had the life, use.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">In view of the above holding the questions whether the probate court had jurisdiction, and if- it had whether its decree dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>missing the petition was final in nature, must be considered. The matters here involved arise in the settlement of the testator\u2019s estate in due course of procedure. The petition shows that a trustee of the estate of which Lucy Abbott had the life use has been appointed by the probate court from time to time, and that the last trustee thus appointed was the petitionee Abell. The appointment of such a trustee was' within the power of that court, as is also the enforcement of the trust. V. S. 2613; <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Blanchard, </em>72 Vt. 85, 47 Atl. 98. At the expiration of the life interest the trust fund was held by the trustee exclusively for the benefit of those who are entitled to the remainder over; and it was then the duty of the trustee on notice to all persons interested to render a full and final account of his trust to the probate court, and on settlement thereof to turn over the trust fund to the remaindermen as the court might order. The trustee failing this, the petitioners by their petition brought for that purpose seek to force such an accounting and distribution. The prayer of the petition to the extent that it asks relief from Alonzo is too broad. The probate court has not the power to settle controversies that arise when one has unlawfully received trust funds from the trustee, and such person cannot be cited before it to answer therefor. <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>67 Vt. 494, 32 Atl. 470. It settles the accounts of the officials appointed by it.; and any alleged diversion of a trust estate from its proper channel by the trustee, is a matter involved in his accounting. No claim is made but that the petition is sufficient to bring the trustee before the court to terminate his trust and make distribution under the direction and decree of the court; and Alonzo was entitled to notice of the proceedings for such a purpose with an opportunity to be heard. As far as the prayer is too broad, it is mere surplusage and does no harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The record shows that a hearing was had on the petition before the probate court, the trustee, Alonzo, and the petitioners respectively being present by their attorneys, \u2018 \u2018 and. that thereupon the court having listened to a statement of facts regarding which there was no dispute and to arguments of counsel dismissed said petition.\u201d From this decree an appeal was taken by the petitioners. It is argued by the petitionees that the decree was interlocutory from which uq appeal will lie. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>But we think it fairly inferable from the record that the petition was dismissed on its merits, in other words,- on the ground that the petitioners had no interest in the funds in question, and therefore not entitled to the relief sought; and it at once finished the proceedings. The decree was final as to the petitioners and one from which they could appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\">It may not be amiss to call attention to the fact that in the matter of Hodge\u2019s Estate, 63 Vt. 661, 22 Atl. 725, an appeal was allowed from a decree of the probate court dismissing the petition of the administrator of the life tenant for an accounting by the executor of the estate, and that the appeal was sustained in this^Court, although it does not appear that the nature of the decree, whether final or interlocutory, was brought in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed and cause remanded to the county court tobe proceeded with.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
