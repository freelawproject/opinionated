'Pleas, the general issue and two special pleas in bar. Heard on special demurrer to the first special plea, at the June Term, 1907, Caledonia County, <em>Miles, </em>J., presiding. Demurrer overruled, and plea adjudged sufficient. The defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-7\">The plea in question relied upon a written contract made at Sioux Falls in the State of South Dakota on September 24, 1906, between the plaintiff and his wife, in.which plaintiff, for the consideration therein expressed, acknowledged full satisfaction \u201cof any and all differences in law or equity existing between him\u201d and his wife and the defendant; and wherein the plaintiff agreed that \u201cthis contract is made with the express understanding that no steps shall be taken in law or in equity in any form against \u2019 \u2019 his wife or the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-8\">The second cause of demurrer assigned was: \u201cThat the language in said plea: \u2018That it was then and there the law of said state that the force and effect of said contract was and is to deprive this plaintiff, the said Oliver H. Jenness; of all right of action against this defendant in respect of the matters and things alleged in the declaration in this case,\u2019 is a conclusion of law.\u201d The demurrer specified only two defects, and the record did not show that any other defects were relied upon below.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b128-9\"><em>E.

Y.) 75.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b129-9\">Watson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aba\">The demurrer is special, assigning two causes: First, \u201cThat the language in said plea: \u2018And the defendant avers that on September 24th, 1906, for a long time previous thereto, ever since and now, it was and is the law of said State of South Dakota that a husband and his wife may legally contract with each other in the manner set forth in said contract\u2019 is a conclusion of law.\u201d The second assignment, like the first, points to the allegation of the effect of the law of that State, and is with the same degree of particularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">Tt is said that since the law of another state is regarded and treated in pleading as a matter of fact to be alleged and proved like any other fact, the conclusion of the pleader respecting it is one of fact and not \u201ca conclusion of law\u201d as stated in the assignments, and it being a matter of form the demurrant should be held strictly to the objection made. But without considering whether the defect is one of form merely, we think the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>demurrant\u2019s characterization is not an erroneous one. When the law of a sister state is properly set forth in the pleading as a fact, then a question of law arises thereon as to the legal effect. Here without setting forth the law, the pleader makes an averment of his conclusion of the legal effect, which is a conclusion of law. <em>Kinnier </em>v. <em>Kinnier, </em>45 N. Y. 535. See also <em>McLeod </em>v. <em>The Conn. &amp; Pass. R. R. R. Co., </em>58. Vt. 727, 6 Atl. 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">It is a rule of pleading established beyond question that so much of the law of another state, or foreign country, as is material to the case must be set forth by the party complaining or defending under it, that the court may judge of its effect. Since the second plea is not a compliance with this rule it is insufficient. <em>Herring </em>v. <em>Selding, 2 </em>Aik. 12; <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Hibbard, </em>26 Vt. 698; <em>McLeod </em>v. <em>The Conn. &amp; Pass. R. R. R. Co., </em>cited above.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The plaintiff further contends that this plea is defective in that it professes to answer the whole declaration, whereas it does not answer the trespasses and grievances committed after the date of the alleged release. \u2022 But this question does not appear of record to have been raised or passed upon below; and since this Court sits only in error, the question is not here.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, demurrer to the second plea sustained, the second plea adjudged insufficient, and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
