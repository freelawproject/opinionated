At the same time they mutually executed under seal, a contract, or bond, whereby the party of the first part (vendor) \u201cfor the consideration hereinafter mentioned, hereby agrees to sell to the said party of the second part\u201d (the defendant), \u201cwho hereby agrees to purchase\u201d the lands here in question. \u201cThe said party of the second part hereby agrees to pay to said party of the first part, for the said premises, the sum of\u201d- \u2014 then follows the consideration, and provisions for the payment of the installments in the note which is described. The contract was always in the defendant\u2019s possession until in January, 1900, when it was burned with his dwelling, and no copy or record of it was found. The master finds that it contained provisions as follows: \u201cAnd the said party of the second part also agrees to pay all taxes and assessments which have been imposed on said premises during this current year, and all of which shall henceforth be imposed on said premises; and not to commit or suffer any waste or damage on said land, by cutting down, carrying off, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>or destroying any timber or trees, growing or being thereon, other than shall be necessary in clearing said land for cultivation, or for making necessary buildings and fences on the same, or for necessary fuel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-5\">\u201cAnd the said party of the first part does hereby agree that on payment of the purchase money and interest, and the performance of the agreements and stipulations as aforesaid, by and on the part of the said party of the second part, he will, by a good and sufficient warrantee deed, convey or cause to be conveyed to the party of the second part, his heirs or assigns, the aforesaid hereditaments and premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-6\">\u201cAnd it is hereby agreed, that if the said party of the second part shall fail in the performance of any of the aforesaid agreements or stipulations on his part to be performed then it shall be lawful for the said party of the first part, at any time after such default, if he sees fit, to declare this contract forfeited and vacated, and to re-enter upon and take possession of said premises, and all buildings and improvements thereon, and to sell and dispose of the same to any person or persons whomsoever ; and the said party of the first part shall and may retain all sums of money paid by the said party of the second part, or any subsequent purchaser, as and for liquidated damages for such failure. \u2019 \u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-7\">On the making of this contract the defendant immediately went into the actual possession of the land under it, and from that time hitherto has been in possession thereof and occupied it as his home.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-8\">The note was not paid according to its terms, but payments have been made thereon as follows: Before October 5, 1889, the defendant performed labor for the vendor and let him have a harness, total in value $38.50, which amount was agreed upon on that date and indorsed on the note by the consent of both parties; a payment of $18, by way of work in haying by defendant\u2019s son, in 1890; in 1891, a payment of $18.50, by similar work of defendant\u2019s son; in March, 1895, a payment in money, $50, by the Averill Lumber Co. at defendant\u2019s direction; and in the fall of \u00cd895, a payment of $30, by way of work by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-9\">On September 5, 1896, the vendor gave a warranty deed to the orator Warren E. Drew, of lots 100 and 101, of which lots <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>the \u201cCole land\u201d was a part, together with other lots of land, \u201cexcept * # * 100 acres sold to Cole.\u201d The 100 acres there excepted is the \u201cCole land,\u201d and the Cole referred to is the defendant. On the same day Drew quitclaimed back to the vendor lots 100 and 101, with other land. April 12, 1898, the vendor quitclaimed to Drew an undivided half interest in \u2018 \u2018 100 acres on which said Harriman had given Damon Cole a land contract.\u201d February 15, 1900, the vendor conveyed eight lots, including lots 100 and 101, to Drew, \u201cexcepting * * *, and subject to any right Cole * * * may have by land bond.\u201d On the 5th day of March, 1900, Drew and wife quitclaimed to the other orator, Thomas H. Van Dyke, an undivided one-half of the same eight lots, with the same exception and subject to the same right of the defendant \u201cby land contract.\u201d Again on October 24, 1905, just before the bringing of the suit in ejectment hereinafter mentioned, the vendor executed a quitclaim deed to Drew of the same eight lots, with the same exception and subject to the same rights in the defendant. This deed states that it is given in confirmation of the former deed given by the vendor to Drew on the 15th day of February, 1900, \u201cand to cure a defect in title existing at that time, to wit: an undischarged mortgage from the vendor to Gilbert Harriman dated November 28, 1881, * # *, said mortgage having been subsequently discharged on the 10th day of March, 1900.\u201d On the same 24th day of October, 1905, Drew quitclaimed to Van Dyke one undivided half of the same eight lots, with the same exception and subject to the same right in the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-5\">At the time of the defendant\u2019s purchase the soft wood timber had nearly all been cut off the land, the stumpage then being worth from seventy-five cents to one dollar a thousand feet, while hard wood stumpage was worth but very little. No land had then been cleared. The defendant fixed up a vacated lumbermen\u2019s shanty thereon to live in, later building a dwelling house and barn. The house was burned in January, 1900, and in 1901, he built a new house. This house and the barn above mentioned are now on the place. The defendant has cleared some twenty-five acres of land and cuts on it annually from sixteen to twenty tons of hay. The soft wood trees on the place in the time of the defendant\u2019s occupancy have grown rapidly in size and value, which fact was .well known to all of the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>to this suit. At the present time the greatest value of the place is in its timber, there being some 300,000 to 350,000 feet, of soft wood worth from six to eight dollars a thousand feet, stumpage, and 50,000 feet of hard wood worth from two to three dollars a thousand feet, stumpage. The present value of the place is from $2,500 to $3,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-5\">Since 1885 and prior to November 1, 1905, the defendant from year to year cut in all from 140,000 to 150,000 feet of soft wood lumber from the place. But there was no evidence that he cut any prior to 1887, except some for the buildings. The master reports that it did not appear when between 1885 and 1905 timber was cut by the defendant, nor did it appear how much was cut during that period for necessary buildings, fuel, and fencing; although it did appear that some of the timber used for building the two houses and the barn was cut on the place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-6\">From the fall of 1885 to March 5, 1900, Gilbert Harriman was the agent of the vendor to collect and receive payments on the note against the defendant who was so informed and acted accordingly. About 1888 the vendor moved some miles away from the \u201cCole land,\u201d leaving Gilbert in charge \u201cto see that no waste was committed,\u201d etc. It is found that Gilbert, as such agent, knew or ought to have known of the cutting of timber from year to year up to 1900, and that the orators from the time they or either of them had any title to that land knew or ought to have known of it; that in fact Gilbert did know of it, for as early as 1894 or 1895 he told the vendor that the defendant was trespassing and committing waste. Yet neither Gilbert, the vendor, nor the orators ever made any remonstrance tp the defendant against it in any way before the latter brought their suit in ejectment. When the orators took their deeds of the land in question they both knew that the defendant was in the occupancy thereof; that after the house was burned in January, 1900, they knew or ought to have known that the defendant was rebuilding in 1901, yet they made no objection and gave defendant no notice of their ownership nor of the claims they now make.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-7\">It is further found that neither the vendor, nor either of the orators, ever demanded payment of the sum due on the land contract; that the vendor never demanded possession of the land for any non-compliance with the conditions of the contract; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>that neither the vendor nor the orators ever entered upon or attempted to take possession of the land for any alleged failure of the defendant to fulfil the contract up to the bringing of the suit in ejectment; that the defendant always recognized the validity of the note as a claim on the land, but at the time he took his contract and ever after when clearing up the land and cultivating it, erecting the various buildings thereon, and when cutting down the timber and selling it, he supposed he had a good title to the fee and was never notified nor knew that anyone claimed otherwise till the bringing of that suit. Other than whatever effect the bringing of that action may have had, no notice was ever given to the defendant by the vendor or by the orators of any rescission of the contract, nor of fixing a certain or reasonable time within which the defendant would be required to perform to save a rescission.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-5\">The suit in ejectment was brought about November 1, 1905, was duly entered in Essex County court, and is still pending. January 5, 1906, the orators having learned that the defendant was then engaged in cutting timber on the disputed land, brought their bill in this case. Defendant made answer and filed a cross bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-6\">Other material facts appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b404-7\"><em>Amey &amp; Sunt, </em>and <em>E. W. Smith </em>for the orators.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-8\">The orators\u2019 motion to strike out defendant\u2019s cross bill should have been granted. It should not introduce any distinct matter. It is auxiliary to the original suit,, and a graft and dependency upon it. If its purpose be different from this, it is not a cross bill, though it may have a connection with the same general subject. <em>Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Goodyear, </em>9 Wall. (U.

The determination of this question requires an examination of the original bill with reference to subject-matter and relief sought, and a relative similar examination of the cross bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The orators brought their action of ejectment to recover the possession of the land in question and damages. The declaration alleged that on the 12th day of April, 1898, the orators were seised and possessed of the land in their own right in fee and so continued until the 13th day of April, 1898, when the defendant, without law or right, and contrary to the will of the orators, thereinto entered and ejected, etc., the orators therefrom, and ever since has kept and still keeps them out of said premises, etc. In their bill the orators allege the bringing of the suit at law, recite the declaration, and allege the facts set forth therein to be true; that they are the sole owners of the land in question; that from the day of the bringing of that suit the defendant has been and still is despoiling,- wasting, and irreparably damaging said land by cutting down and removing therefrom valuable timber, and that he intends to continue so to .do unless restrained by injunction; and praying for an injunction restraining the defendant from further cutting down and removing or selling timber on or from said land during the pendency of the action at law and until final judgment therein, and for general relief. A temporary injunction was obtained according to the prayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The defendant made answer alleging and relying upon his purchase of the land and his bond or contract executed in connection therewith, and his thenceforth continuous possession of the property under the contract to the present time. The answer further alleges the part payment of the consideration in money by the defendant, at the time of the purchase, the giving of his note for the balance, and the making of payments on the note from time to time; the condition of the contract, among other things, that on payment of the note by the defendant the vendor would execute and deliver to him a good and valid warranty deed to convey to him a good and valid title to the land in fee simple; that he has made valuable improvements on the land by way of clearing and making a portion of it arable, erecting buildings, etc.; that he always has been and now is ready and willing to pay the amount due and owing on said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>note and accept such a deed of the land; that the vendor subsequently quit-claimed all his right, title, and interest in said lands to the orators subject to the-rights of the defendant under his contract, and indorsed and delivered to them the said note, which conveyance and note the orators took with full knowledge of the land contract from the vendor to the defendant and of the latter\u2019s rights thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The cross bill contains substantially the same allegations as the answer, and piraying for specific performance of the contract, that the orators be enjoined from further prosecuting their action at law, and for general relief. The contract impliedly shows that finder it the defendant was immediately to take and thereafter have possession of the property, and the master finds that he did so take possession and thus continued to have it openly, notoriously, exclusively, and undisturbedly, up to the time of the bringing of the suit at law, subject to such liabilities as the facts reported imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">In making out a case under their bill the orators are obliged to show title derived from Florien Harriman subsequent to his contract with.the defendant, and subject to the latter\u2019s rights under it. It devolves upon them to show not only a non-performance of the contract by the defendant, but also a declaration of forfeiture by the party having such optional right. Indeed, the basis of the orators\u2019 claimed right to relief is that all rights of the defendant under the contract had been forfeited and consequently that any further cutting of timber by him would be a commission of waste and an irreparable damage-to the land; and upon their prayer he was temporarily enjoined from \u201cfurther cutting down, removing or selling any timber or lumber on or from the land and premises described, \u2019 \u2019 regardless of the purpose of cutting, or the use to be made of the timber or lumber when cut. No question is made but that the case is properly in equity for the purpose of an injunction to stay waste, and any relief agreeable to the ease made by the bill, though not within the special prayer, may be had under the prayer for general relief. The Court having jurisdiction of the case for one purpose it will be retained for a final disposition of the whole matter. <em>Hastings </em>v. <em>Perry, 20 </em>Vt. 272; <em>Whipple </em>v. <em>Fair Haven, </em>63 Vt. 221, 21 Atl. 533. Thus it appears that the real basis of the orators\u2019 case is a claimed forfeiture of the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>tract under which, if iu force, the defendant has rights paramount to those of the orators on the case made by their bill. The defendant by his answer in effect denies a forfeiture in equity, and by cross bill prays that the contract be performed, and that further prosecution of the action of ejectment be perpetually enjoined. The cross bill is a proceeding to procure a complete determination of a matter already in litigation, and the new facts introduced by it are such, and only such, as are necessary to have before the court in the decision of the questions raised in the original suit, to enable it to do full and complete justice to all the parties before it in respect to the cause of action on which the orators rest their right to aid or relief. Consequently in overruling the motion there was no error. <em>Rutland </em>v. <em>Paige, </em>24 Vt. 181; <em>Krueger </em>v. <em>Ferry, </em>41 N. J. Eq. 432, 5 Atl. 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">It is urged that time is of the essence of the contract, and that by its terms the defendant\u2019s acts in breach of covenant changed the- legal relation of the parties, permitting the vendor, and his assigns, to take possession, sell the property with all improvements, and retain all sums of money paid, as liquidated damages for failure to perform. And that even though it be thought that the contract does not expressly make time essential, yet here the subject-matter \u2014 principally growing timber the value of which has materially increased \u2014 is such that time will be considered material and the defendant will not be allowed to lie by until the change in his favor and then ask for, specific performance. Assuming but not deciding that time is of the essence, the effect of the contract is not such that non-performance <em>ipso facto </em>works a forfeiture. A forfeiture was made optional with the vendor, and if he did not see fit to declare it, the contract by virtue of its own provisions continued in full force.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">It is further urged that the vendor, by his conveyance to Drew, in effect elected to rescind his contract with the defendant. But this is not so, since as before seen in each instance the conveyance to Drew was expressly made subject to the defendant\u2019s rights under the contract, and the note was transferred to the orators in connection therewith. Instead of these conveyances indicating a rescission, the vendor thereby recognized the contract and note as subsisting obligations. The same recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>nition was made by Drew in Ms conveyances to Van Dyke; and as grantees neither of them conld take greater rights than were possessed by his grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Not only does the record show that no declaration of forfeiture in fact or effect was ever made prior to instituting proceedings at law to eject the defendant in November, 1905, and then only as the effect of that action, but in addition thereto it is found that a payment of fifty dollars in cash was made on the note by the defendant and accepted by the vendor in March, 1895, \u2014 between two and three years after the last installment was due, \u2014 and that a further payment of thirty dollars, by way of work by the defendant for the vendor, was made in the fall of the same year. The receiving of these payments manifested not only the vendor\u2019s assent to previous delays, but also his understanding that the contract was still ,in full force. Again the conveyances by the vendor to Drew and by the latter of one undivided half to Van Dyke, subject to the rights of the defendant under his contract, were severally in 1898, in 1900, and finally as late as October 24, 1905. In <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Daniel, </em>4 Hare, 420, the covenants and agreements were such that in case the plaintiff failed to perform, \u201cthen, and in any such case, it should be lawful for the defendants, or for any of them, by writing to rescind the agreement,\u201d etc. It was held that each breach on the part of the plaintiff in non-payment of money was a new breach of the agreement,; and that, time being of the essence of the contract, such breach gave defendants a right to rescind the contract; but that right should have been asserted the moment the breach occurred. That the defendants were not at liberty to treat the agreement as still subsisting, and to take the benefit of it at the expense -of the plaintiff, if they meant to insist that it was at an end.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">In <em>Gaughen </em>v. <em>Kerr, </em>99 Iowa, 214, 68 N. W. 694, the action was for specific performance of a contract for the sale of land. The vendee executed his several promissory notes for the agreed price, payable at different times in a period of nearly three years; and in addition thereto the vendee assumed the payment of the taxes on the land for the previous year and the subsequent taxes. The contract provided that in ease the vendee should fail M strict literal performance thereof, the vendor \u201cshall have the right to declare this agreement null and void,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>etc. Later when one of the notes was more than six months overdue and unpaid, and the taxes for two years were long since due, the vendors, not having exercised their right to declare a forfeiture, assigned the notes and contract, and conveyed the land to one of the defendants in that case, after which the assignee, claiming the right of strict forfeiture, entered a cancellation on the contract. It was held that such an option must be exercised by election at the time of default, to be of any effect. The court saying that a different rule would leave the matter entirely' at the mercy of the seller; that if the land should appreciate in value, it would be within his power at any time to declare a forfeiture, take possession, and reap the benefits of the enhanced value; while if there should be a depreciation, he could insist on the enforcement of the contract; that such a construction would not be upheld unless the clear import of the contract required it; that it was a reasonable construction and more in harmony with equity and good conscience, to hold that the parties intended, not only that prompt payment should be made, but also that the right to forfeit, to be available, should be exercised promptly. To the same effect are <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Delaplaine, 5 </em>Wis. 206, 68 Am. Dec. 57; <em>Fargusson </em>v. <em>Talcott, </em>7 N. Dak. 183, 73 N. W. 207; <em>Pier </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>(S. Dak.) 86 N. W. 642; <em>Fulcher &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Daniel &amp; Son, </em>80 Ga. 74, 4 S. E. 259. In <em>Battell </em>v. <em>Matot, 58 Vt. </em>271, 5 Atl. 479, it is said: \u201cThe essentiality of time is matter of intention, and may be waived by the party entitled to insist upon it, and is waived by conduct on his part that shows he could not consistently have intended to insist upon it, or that he intended to treat the contract as still subsisting notwithstanding the delay. And when the essentiality of time has been waived, it cannot be revived again without notice to the party in default, fixing a certain and reasonable time within which he is required to perform, in which ease the time thus allotted becomes essential, and if the party neglects to perform within it, a court of equity will not aid him to enforce the contract, but will leave him to whatever legal remedy he may have. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">It is unnecessary to decide how far, if at all, the rule requiring prompt exercise of the optional right of forfeiture is affected by the provision of the contract that it shall be lawful \u201cat any time after\u201d default; nor is it necessary to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>whether, as a matter of law, there was a waiver of forfeiture by the vendor or by the orators; for facts are found from which the court below could legitimately infer such a waiver in fact by the vendor as long as he had the legal title, and by the orators thereafter, if there were any new acts of default by the defendant, until the bringing of their action of ejectment, and to sustain the decree this Court will presume that such inference was there made. This is conclusive that the orators cannot now base any right of forfeiture on the defendant\u2019s failure to pay at the original times appointed, nor afterwards, since no notice was ever given him by the vendor nor by the orators subsequently fixing a certain and reasonable time within which payment must be made. It is also conclusive against them regarding all acts of the defendant in committing prohibitive waste before the proceedings at law. For such acts once acquiesced in or waived cannot afterwards afford- a ground for terminating the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The question then is whether the findings of the master show such subsequent cutting of timber as constitutes waste for which the optional right of forfeiture is given. The contract contemplates that the defendant might necessarily cut down and carry off growing timber in clearing land for cultivation, and by its terms such cutting does not constitute waste or damage thereunder. It does not appear that the cutting referred to in' this paragraph was not lawfully done under that provision of the contract; and the orators, seeking to avail themselves of -the optional privilege, must be held strictly within the limits of the authority giving the right. The result is that on the facts found the orators are not entitled to relief under the original bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Should the defendant be granted relief under the cross bill ? That he has shown himself ready, desirous, and eager to perform by making full payment since the waiver of time as an essential part of the contract, there can be no question in view of the facts found that the defendant has always been ready to pay the amount due on the note and, as late as 1896, told the vendor that if he would meet defendant and ascertain the amount, the latter would pay it, he not then knowing that the legal title had been conveyed to the orators; and that after the service of the original bill, but before either the answer or cross bill was filed, the defendant\u2019s solicitor and one E. M. Bartlett went to the office of the orators\u2019 solicitor and informed him that they were ready <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>to pay the amount due and asked to see the note. The orators\u2019 solicitor did not then have the note and so did not show it. The master finds that the defendant\u2019s solicitor and Bartlett were then ready, and are now, to pay the sum due. Exception was taken because Bartlett was allowed to testify that he was then ready to make such payment, it being argued that the orators were under no obligation to accept payment of him, a stranger. It appears that Bartlett testified concerning that interview and for aught before us he may have stated that he and the solicitor were sent there by .the defendant to pay the note and so informed the orators\u2019 solicitor. We cannot say the testimony was improperly received.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">It is said, however, that no formal tender was ever made by the defendant, and that this was necessary. But in bringing their action of ejectment the orators at least attempted to rescind the contract, and thereafter in bringing their bill under oath and procuring the injunction, they in effect asserted that the contract had been terminated. In these circumstances a formal tender would have been useless, for which reason if for no other it was not required in order to support an action for specific performance. <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Daniel, </em>4 Hare, 420; <em>Ockey </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>41 N. J. Eq. 350, 7 Atl. 495; <em>Bauman </em>v. <em>Pinckney, </em>118 N. Y. 604, 23 N. E. 916. Nor does it make any difference in this respect that the relief is sought by cross bill. <em>Fargusson </em>v. <em>Talcott, </em>cited above.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Assuming that in seeking specific performance it devolves on the defendant to show that he has done or offered to do, or is ready and willing to do, all the essential and material acts required of him by the contract, except so far as they are shown to have been waived, will the fact that the defendant has not justified the cutting of timber after the action of ejectment was brought, prevent such relief? It is argued by the orators, though not set up as a defence in their answer to the cross bill (the necessity of which we'do not consider), that this unjustified act precludes him from obtaining a decree in his favor. Yet this does not necessarily follow. By the contract the defendant has the equitable title to the land and the rightful possession thereof. The orators have the legal title, but the extent of their interest in equity is as security for the payment of the amount due on the note, such contracts haviDg always been regarded in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>equity as analogous to equitable mortgages. The right of forfeiture for breach of covenants against waste was only in aid of the security. If the orators are paid the amount due on the note with the costs allowed them, they will receive full compensation and have no reason to complain of that cutting of timber even though it constituted waste. On the other hand, in addition to sundry payments, the defendant has made valuable and permanent improvements, intending to occupy the premises, as he has, for farming purposes and as a home. The cutting of timber after notice to him by way of the action of ejectment that the orators intended to insist upon their legal rights under the contract in case of future breaches, \u2014 treating the bringing of that suit as such an unequivocal act as unmistakably showed that intention, although there may be some doubt whether the orators could rescind the contract without first returning or tendering the unpaid note to the defendant, \u2014 was in no just sense an impairment of the security and the orators were not injured thereby. Indeed, that this act was comparatively of very little consequence to the orators is manifest from the facts that the stump-age value of the timber so cut, 9,962 feet, was only $69.73, that the amount due from the defendant to the orators as of October 2, 1906, was $699.93, that there is still on the land some 300,000 to 350,000 feet of soft wood timber and 50,000 feet of hard wood, and that the place is worth from $2,500 to $3,000. In these circumstances specific performance-should be decreed, for thereby the orators will receive justice by way of full compensation, while a denial of such relief would leave the defendant without any adequate remedy on his contract, and result in great hardship and injustice to him. <em>Hager </em>v. <em>Buck, </em>44 Vt. 285, 5 Am. Rep. 368; Pom. Con. see. 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-3\">It is said that the defendant's delay in asking has been unreasonable, and hence such relief should not be granted. Yet the case stands with the essentiality of time waived; and since the defendant took and has retained the uninterrupted possession of the premises under the implied terms of his contract, ever by his acts showing a fixed, marked intention to carry the contract into execution, without any declaration or act by the vendor, or by the orators before instituting their ejectment suit, other than in recognition of a continuance of the contract in force, equity will not allow the lapse of time to prejudice his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>remedial right. Pom. Con. sec. 404; <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Travis, </em>9 Johns. 450; <em>Bruce </em>v. <em>Tilson, </em>25 N. Y. 194; <em>Ely </em>v. <em>McKay, </em>12 Allen, 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">It is further urged that since the orators are not parties to the contract they should not be compelled to perform; that the contract is personal with the vendor, otherwise there is no force in the last part of the provision therein that he will \u201cconvey or cause to be conveyed,\u201d etc. It is a sufficient answer to this position to say that whatever the force of this provision may be as against the vendor, it does not affect the equitable rights of the defendant against the orators. They took their deeds of the property with full knowledge of the defendant\u2019s contract and subject to his rights under it. In these circumstances they stand in equity with reference to the contract as did the vendor, and will be compelled to perform by a conveyance of the land in the same manner and to the same extent as he would have been liable to do, had he retained the legal title. <em>Wilkins </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>80 Vt. 48, 66 Atl. 893, 11 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1183. Nor is it necessary to the granting of such a decree that the vendor be a party to the suit, for he has no interest in 'the land and no relief is sought against him. <em>Bridgman </em>v. <em>St. Johnsbury &amp; Lake Champlain R. R. Co., </em>58 Vt. 198, 2 Atl. 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Exception was taken to the master\u2019s report wherein he states that there was no proof that the defendant knew the vendor had sold to orator Drew, or that the orators or either of them had any interest in the \u201cCole land\u201d until a little time before the ejectment suit was begun, on the ground that the orators\u2019 deeds admitted in evidence showed that they were of record. But this position is without force, since the record of these deeds was not constructive notice to the defendant, he being the \"equitable owner and in possession under a prior contract to which the deeds were made subject. <em>Leach </em>v. <em>Beatties, </em>33 Vt. 195; <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>71 Vt. 424, 45 Atl. 1042, 76 Am.

It appears from the petition that the orators seek, if a rehearing be granted, to present the constitutional question of the impairment of the obligation of contracts, claiming that the decision of this Court impairs.the obligation of the land contract involved, in that the Court, it is claimed, failed to give force and effect particularly to the words therein, \u201cat any time after such default,\u201d etc. It further appears from the petition,\"as the fact is, that this constitutional question was not raised before this Court when the hearing was had \u2014 that the orators now seek to raise it for the first time. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Franklin County Savings Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>74 Vt. 246, a motion was made, after a decision had been rendered in this Court, for a rehearing on the ground, as here, that the moving party desired to present a question in argument not before presented. It was held that a rehearing would not be granted to give an opportunity to raise and present a new question, and the motion was overruled, but no further opinion was written. That ease was prior to the enactment of the statute under which the present petition is brought, yet the holding is equally applicable when a rehearing is sought under this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\">\n<em>Rehearing refused, petition dismissed, and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
