No one was in form made defendant, although the city and town respectively accepted service of the bill, and have appeared by their solicitor. Yet these corporations are not the same as the inhabitants thereof and do not bear the same relation to the will. The <em>cestuis que trust </em>have the equitable and ultimate interest to be affected by a decree upon the question presented by the bill. Consequently they are necessary parties. Story Eq. PI.
