The defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-5\">The plaintiff is the surviving mother of Homer A. Mc-Duffee, and the administratrix of his estate. He left neither father, nor wife, nor issue. The declaration consisted of counts seeking to recover, for the benefit of said estate, the damages sustained by the intestate on account of his alleged injuries from the date of the accident to his decease; and other counts seeking to recover for plaintiff\u2019s own benefit, as next of kin, the damages sustained by her because of the intestate\u2019s death. Yer-diet for the plaintiff for $3,500, \u2014 $500 for the benefit of said estate, and $3,000 for the plaintiff, as next of kin. It appeared that from about March 1, 1903, till October 10, 1903, the intestate was employed as freight brakeman on \u201cthe railroad,\u201d and that he was born June 8, 1882. It appeared that at a point north of the railroad station at Newport, Yermont, on the east side of the main line railroad track and ten or twelve feet therefrom, stood a water tank, with spout thereto attached. Plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that on Saturday, October 10, 1903, about 12:10 P. M. the intestate looking southerly, was riding on the top of a freight ear moving northerly by said.station at the speed of about two or three miles an hour; that when passing said water tank the back of his head came in contact with said water spout throwing him \u201cforward\u201d upon the roof of the car, his cap falling to the ground; that he arose, descended from the car, picked up his cap, remounted the car, and continued his duties as freight brakeman that afternoon on a train running from Newport to Lyndonville, where he resided; but that on that afternoon, on the trip to Lyndonville, he told a trainman that he \u201cfelt rotten,\u201d his \u201chead ached,\u201d and that on his return home that afternoon he complained to plaintiff of \u201cfeeling bad,\u201d of \u201cpain in his side,\u201d \u201chis side felt queer, funny, funny feeling in his side,\u201d and showed her \u201ca lump\u201d on the back of his head; that he then looked pale, ate little supper,, bathed his head with witch hazel, and after supper changed his clothes, went out and did not return till 10 o\u2019clock that even<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>ing; that he arose about 3:30 o\u2019clock Sunday morning, ate his. breakfast, and made his run that day from Lyndonville to Newport and return, performing all his duties as freight brakeman, and returning to Lyndonville about 3 o\u2019clock in the afternoon; that .after his return that afternoon he complained to plaintiff of having pain in his side, ate a light supper, went out about 6 o \u2019clock, returned about 8:30 that evening and went to bed,asking plaintiff to call him at 4:20 the next morning to go out on a stock train as freight brakeman, which she did, and he came down stairs Monday morning with a lamp, staggered to a chair saying that he was sick, and wanted to vomit, whereupon a physician was called, who saw him about 5 o\u2019clock that morning; that the intestate was sick to his stomach and had pain in his left side from the time he came down stairs Monday morning till he died about 3 o\u2019clock that afternoon. Plaintiff\u2019s evidence further tended to show that at the time of the accident freight cars projected about two feet outside each rail of the track; that the intestate was then standing erect on the top of one of the cars of the train and just a little away from the center board toward the side nearest the water tank, signalling the train and facing south when he passed the tank; that said car was a Grand Trunk car and about a foot higher than an ordinary ear; that the outer end of the water spout, when not in use, hung over the east rail of the main line of the Boston &amp; Maine railroad. It appeared that the water tank and water spout were visible and could have been plainly seen by the intestate for a considerable distance, if he had looked in that direction. The exceptions stated that,1 \u2018 No evidence was offered tending to show that the injury to Mr. McDuffee\u2019s head was in itself of a serious character or in any way caused or contributed to his death.\u201d \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that a fall such as deceased received at Newport might possibly produce a rupture of the spleen, but that such a result was not a probable nor a natural result; and the doctors produced by the plaintiff all testified that they should not expect a rupture of the spleen from such an accident. And some of plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended further to show that a person having a ruptured spleen would not be able to work after the accident producing the rupture.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that an autopsy was performed on the intestate\u2019s body in the afternoon of the day following his death; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>that there was a little abrasion of one of his knees; that there was a severe contusion on the back of his head; that his spleen was ruptured near its apex; that the intestate died from hemorrhage of the spleen caused by a rupture thereof; that the rupture was caused by some external violence in the splenic region, which is back of the lower ribs on the left side; that a rupture of the spleen is rare, but sometimes occurs from slight causes; that the water tank and spout were in perfect condition and repair at the time of the accident; that there is a running board along the center of the top of freight cars, about two feet wide, for the convenience o_f employees having occasion to pass over the top of such ears. Defendant claimed that there was no evidence in the case tending to show that it owned or operated the tank and water spout in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-4\">Subject to defendant\u2019s exception and the objection that \u201cthere is no evidence that such an accident occurred to this young man,\u201d Dr. Allen, produced by plaintiff, was allowed to testify as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-5\">\u201cQ. Doctor, assuming that a young man of twenty received a sufficient injury to make a slight rupture of the pulp of the spleen, but not sufficient at the time to rupture the outer covering, what would be the indication of that rupture? A. I should expect it might have very little at the time, might not show, ever show any great disturbance, probably would not be very severe in effect.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-6\">Defendant introduced no evidence, but rested at the close of plaintiff\u2019s ease, and then moved that a verdict be directed in its favor for that: First. There is no evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant. Second. There is no evidence that the deceased was in the exercise of due care. Third. That the evidence shows that deceased was guilty of contributory negligence. Fourth. That the danger, if any, from the water spout was open and visible and was a risk incident to the employment. Fifth. That the danger, if any, from the water spout was a risk assumed by the deceased. Sixth. There is no evidence in the case that will support a finding that death resulted from the alleged accident at the water spout. Seventh. There is no evidence that the death .resulted from the alleged accident at the water spout. Eighth. If deceased was injured by the water spout it was the fault of a co-employee in leaving the spout <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>lower than it should be when not in use. Ninth. Because there is no evidence that the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad constructed, owned, or operated the water tank, or water spout referred to in this case at the time of the injury to the deceased. Tenth. There is no evidence that the deceased was in the discharge of any duty as an employee of the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad at the time he was injured. Eleventh. That on all the evidence in the case the plaintiff is not entitled to recover. This motion was overruled, to which defendant excepted, and thereupon moved that plaintiff be compelled to elect on which set of counts she. would stand, whether on the counts declaring for pain, suffering, and damage to the intestate, or on the counts declaring for damages to plaintiff, as next of kin, resulting from the intestate\u2019s death. That motion was also overruled, to which defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-3\">Defendant requested the Court to instruct the jury as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-4\">1. The defendant had a right to locate its water tank conveniently near its track even if such location involved some risk to its employees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-5\">2. Unless the evidence satisfied you by a fair balance of proof that the water tank and spout were so placed as to be unreasonably dangerous to the employees and that some arrangement, which was free from all risk to the employees was feasible and proper for the convenient and practical operation of the road, then the defendant was guilty of no negligence and your verdict should be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-6\">3. It appears that there was a running board in the center on the top of the car Mr. McDuffee was on at the time of the alleged accident, placed there for the safety and convenience of employees required to be upon the top of the car. If you find from all the testimony that a person on the running board of the car would be safe and in no danger of being hit by the spout when on the running board, the defendant has furnished a reasonably safe place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-7\">4. It appears that the running boards are placed upon the cars for the safety and convenience of the employees required to be on the tops of the cars and that a man on the running board of the car could not be hit by this water spout when it was \u201cway up.\u201d In this regard the defendant has performed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>its full duty in furnishing a reasonably safe place for the deceased to work.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-3\">5. The burden is upon the plaintiff to show that the deceased was in the discharge of some duty required of him by the defendant at the time of the alleged accident at Newport, and you cannot assume that he was, without evidence showing that fact.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-4\">6. There is no evidence showing that at the time of the alleged accident he was in the discharge of any duty required of him by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-5\">7. There is no evidence showing that Mr. McDuffee was ever employed by the defendant or was in the defendant\u2019s employ at the time of the alleged accident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-6\">8. If this spout could readily be seen by the deceased if he had looked and if he could by looking have seen the danger of being hit by the spout, he assumed the risk if any, and if he was injured by the spout, there can be no recovery and your verdict should be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-7\">9. The defendant has the right to place near its tracks all such structures as are necessary for the convenient and expeditious transaction of its business, and the deceased assumed the risk of all structures so placed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-8\">10. There is no presumption that the water tank was improperly placed or constructed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-9\">11. The occurrence of the accident is no evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-10\">12. You are not justified in finding that the tank and water spout were improperly or negligently located by the defendant without evidence of that fact.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-11\">13. The happening of the alleged accident to deceased is no evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant in the erection or maintenance of the tank and spout as and where it was located and maintained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-12\">14. If the danger from this spout, if any, was one which Mr. McDuffee could have' seen if he had looked and have avoided by the exercise of due care, then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover and your verdict should be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-13\">15. If the negligence of the deceased contributed in any degree to the accident, the plaintiff cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>16. The burden is upon the plaintiff to establish by a fair balance of proof that the deceased was in the exercise of due care at the time of the accident. If the evidence fails to establish this fact your verdict should be for the defendant. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-3\">17. The 'burden is on the plaintiff to establish by a fair balance of the evidence that the deceased was guilty of no negligence in any way contributing to the accident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-4\">18. If you find of all the testimony that if the deceased .had looked and had used his senses diligently just prior to the accident and by the exercise of ordinary care for his personal safety, could have avoided being hit by the water spout, then he was not in the exercise of due care and was guilty of contributory negligence which will bar a recovery and your verdict should be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-6\">19. If you find that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, then the measure of that recovery for the benefit of Mrs. Mc-Duffee as next of kin, if she is next of kin, is the pecuniary loss which she sustains between the time of his death and the time that he would become twenty-one years of age.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-7\">20. This action is brought by Mrs. McDuffee, the mother of the deceased, as administratrix, to recover damages to her as next of kin resulting from the death of Mr. McDuffee. Within the meaning of Yermont Statutes, Sections 2451 and 2452, the mother is not the next of bin and no recovery can be had for her benefit as next of kin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-8\">21. You will give no damages for the loss of aid or assistance subsequent to the time that Mr. McDuffee would have been twenty-one years of age.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-9\">22. You will allow nothing on account of Mrs. McDuffee\u2019s wounded feelings occasioned by the suffering or death of her son.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-10\">23. You will allow nothing for Mrs. McDuffee\u2019s loss of the society and companionship of her son.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-11\">24. Plaintiff cannot recover any damages on account of Mr. McDuffee\u2019s death unless the evidence establishes that his death was due to the alleged accident at Newport.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-12\">25.

To entitle plaintiff to recover for the death of Mr. McDuffee, the testimony must show that the alleged accident was the proximate cause of his death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-4\">27. Plaintiff cannot recover for the death of Mr. McDuffee unless the testimony establishes that his death was the natural and probable result of the alleged accident at Newport.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-5\">28. Unless you find that Mr. McDuffee\u2019s death was the natural and probable result of the alleged accident at Newport your verdict should be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-6\">29.

The defendant claims that there is nothing in the case to show that the deceased was in its employment at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>the time of the accident complained of. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel have ' not referred us to any testimony which in terms connects the deceased with the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad. The evidence tends to show that the accident occurred while he was acting as a brakeman on a moving freight train in the Newport yard while in a run from Lyndonville North, and the plaintiff testified that he was working for the railroad. We leave it for you to say whether it appears from the testimony and the circumstances disclosed by the testimony that the deceased was in the employ of the defendant Company at the time of the accident. Unless you can find from the evidence that he was in the defendant\u2019s employment the plaintiff cannot recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-3\">\u201cIt was the duty of tlie defendant to exercise ordinary care for the safety of the deceased. * * * * The general rule as applied here required the defendant to place and keep the structures along its line used in operating the road, including the water spouts, at a reasonably safe distance from the track, but no more than the use of ordinary care was required. And it was not bound to make the situation absolutely safe.

You have had upon this subject the testimony of five medical men, one of whom was the attending physician, and three of whom were present at the autopsy. There is also evidence tending to show how McDuffee felt from the time he got the fall until the violent attack experienced Monday morning, and what he did by way of work and otherwise in the meantime. The theory of the plaintiff is that the pulp of the spleen was ruptured at the time of the fall, and that this resulted in a rupture of the covering of the spleen on Monday morning, and that death was caused by the hemorrhage that followed. But in view of certain statements of the physician as to the nature of such an injury and the results that would ordinarily be expected to follow, the defendant argues from the length of time that elapsed and the work that was done between the fall and the collapse of Monday morning, that the injury could not have been caused by the fall, but must have been sustained at a later time. It is for you to say from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>consideration of all the evidence whether it fairly appears that the fall upon the ear was the cause of McDuffee\u2019s death.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-3\">The Court also instructed the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-4\">\u201cBut when the employer has done his full duty in this respect there will exist dangers to the employee not obviated by the care required by the employer, and these dangers the employee is held to <em>assume </em>as risks ordinarily incident to his employment, and for injuries resulting from these he cannot recover. \u2019 \u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-5\">\u201cBut she can recover nothing beyond the probable pecuniary benefit she would have received from her son if he had not died at this time.

This ground is divided into several subdivisions denoted by the capital letters of the alphabet, beginning with \u201cA\u201d and ending with \u201cF\u201d inclusive. Under division \u201cA\u201d the- question arises, whether there was any -evidence in the case tending to prove that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was in the service of the defendant at the time of the accident. If there was any such evidence, it is to be found on pages 7 to 36 of the exceptions inclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">From an examination of that evidence we are convinced that there was testimony that some person or corporation operated the water tank and spout in question to supply water for engines running through Lyndonville to Newport upon a line of railroad operated by such person or corporation, which ran past a station at Newport, along the east side thereof, having tracks and a bridge known as the \u201cBoston &amp; Maine tracks\u201d and the \u201cBoston &amp; Maine bridge\u201d; that on the opposite side of those tracks from the station, and near to them, was the water spout from which the plaintiff claims that the intestate received a fatal injury from which he afterwards died, and that at the time of his injury he was the servant of the person operating that spout.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">There was no positive testimony in the case, which in terms stated that the defendant was the person or corporation operating the road or employing the intestate; but such person or corporation is mentioned' by the attorneys of both parties, as well as by their witnesses, all the way through the trial, as <em>\u201cthe </em>railroad\u201d or as <em>\u201cthe </em>railroad Co.,\u201d and not as <em>a </em>railroad or <em>a </em>railroad Co. The natural meaning of the expression used would indicate that they were referring to some railroad company then under consideration or discussion, and not generally to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>railroad company. The only railroad company then under discussion was the defendant. This being so, the jury had a right to understand that when the witnesses and parties spoke of <em>\u201cThe </em>railroad company\u201d they meant the defendant. The evidence therefore, had a tendency to prove that the defendant operated the water spout in question and that McDuffee was its employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\">This holding disposes of defendant\u2019s 9th, 10th and 11th grounds stated in its motion for a verdict and its 5th, 6th, 7th and 33rd requests to charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Under division \u201cB,\u201d the question is raised whether there was any evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant. The evidence upon this point tended to show that the water spout when raised to its highest position, was so near the ear that it would have hit a man of ordinary height, if he stood upon the top of it, a foot or more to one side of the running or center board, and that a man on top of the car signaling a train was forced to dodge the spout in order to avoid being hit by it. If such a dangerous structure could have been reasonably avoided it was the duty of the defendant to have done so, and to have placed this water spout at a reasonably safe distance from the track, so as not to endanger its servants who worked on its trains. <em>Morrisette </em>v. <em>C. P. R., </em>74 Vt. 232, 52 Atl. 520; <em>Choctaw O. &amp; </em>G. <em>R. R. </em>v. <em>McDade, </em>191 U. S. 68; <em>U. Pac. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>61 U. S. 451; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>St. Paul </em>(Minn.) 41 Am. &amp; Eng. R. R. Cases 293; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>The R. R. Co. </em>(Iowa) 5 Am. &amp; Eng. R. R. Cases 620, and <em>Chicago &amp; I. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>91 Ill. 298. The foregoing cases rest upon the well established principle, that it is the duty of the master to furnish a reasonably safe place in which the servant is to perform his duties. The defendant, however, contends that there is no evidence tending to show but that the tank and spout were placed at a reasonably safe distance from the railroad track, in that the plaintiff has failed to produce any evidence tending to show that it could have been maintained at a safer distance at that place and have been reasonably useful for the purpose for which it was constructed. Assuming, but not deciding, that it was necessary for the plaintiff to show that the tank and spout could have been constructed and maintained in a safer manner at that place, the fact that the case discloses evidence showing the construction, general surroundings and location of the spout, made it neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>sary and proper for the court below to submit it to the jury for them to say from all that evidence, whether it was negligence on the part of the defendant to maintain it where and as it was at the time of the injury. That was the legitimate and proper evidence from which that fact was to be determined, and \u2022the defendant\u2019s argument upon this point is not supported by the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">Under this division the defendant discusses its requests, numbers 1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13. No useful purpose can be \u00a1served in disposing of these requests separately or with any great particularity. It is enough to say, that we think they were complied with so far as they were justified by the evidence and required by the issues legitimately raised in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Under division \u201cC\u201d the question is raised whether the risk was assumed by MeDuffee. If it was one of the ordinary risks incident to his employment, it was assumed when he entered \u25a0the service of the defendant; and if it was an extraordinary one .and which he had had an opportunity to ascertain and had in fact ascertained and comprehended its dangerous character, and continued in the defendant\u2019s service after ascertaining that fact, he also assumed that risk; but we think that risk was not an ordinary one which he assumed upon entering the defendant\u2019s service. It can well be said of this danger as it was .said of a similar structure, in the case of <em>Choctaw O. &amp; G. R. R. </em>v. <em>McDade, </em>191 U. S. 68. \u201cIts maintenance under the circumstances was negligence upon the part of the railroad company.\u201d Existing as it did through the wrong of the defendant, it was \u25a0an extraordinary risk and the intestate did not assume it unless he knew and comprehended the danger, or in the eircum\u25a0stances of the case will be taken to have known and compreliended it. <em>Dunbar </em>v. <em>C. V. R. Co., </em>79 Vt. 474, 65 Atl. 528; <em>Shattuck, Admr. </em>v. <em>C. V. R. Co., </em>79 Vt. 469, 65 Atl. 529. The burden of proving that MeDuffee did not know and comprehend the danger, rested upon the plaintiff, and unless there was evidence in the cas\u00e9 tending to prove that fact, the verdict \u25a0should have been directed; <em>Dunbar </em>V. <em>G. V. R. Go., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">We think there was evidence tending to prove that fact. MeDuffee had never been over this road north of Lyndonville to Newport but twice before the accident, and there was no \u25a0evidence in the case that he had ever before passed this tank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>and water spont which was so near that it was dangerous, and yet so far away that the danger was not obvious without measurement or careful inspection. It was in its nature a trap. <em>Morrisette </em>v. <em>C. P. R. Co., </em>74 Vt. 232. The defendant lays much stress upon the fact that the spout was open and plain to be seen for quite a long distance before reaching it; but this is not the controlling fact. While the tank and spout could be plainly seen, the danger could not, and herein lay the mischief. Its apparent safety lulled the servant into fancied security, while the danger could be discovered only too late to be avoided. McDuffee\u2019s business was such that it did not require him to measure or inspect the spout and ascertain its distance from the top of a car, and therefore the natural inference wopld be that he did not do so. These facts, therefore, would be evidence tending to prove that he knew nothing of its danger; and if he had gone past it on his two previous trips, having passed it safely on those trips, he had no occasion to measure or inspect it, but had the right to rely on the presumption that the defendant had performed its duty and had provided a safe place for him in which to perform his services.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\">Under this division the defendant\u2019s attorneys 'discuss the 8th request. We think that .request was fully complied with so far as it stated the law upon that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Under division \u201cD\u201d the question is raised whether McDuffee was guilty of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The ground upon which the defendant claims that MbDuffee was guilty of contributory negligence is, that he was not looking in the direction in which the oars were moving at the time of his injury, and because he stood at one side of the running or center board on the top of his car. There were no facts or circumstances in the case from which it could be said that, as matter of law, McDuffee was required to look in the direction in which the car was moving to discover dangers such as this was. While the evidence in the case tends to show that the running or center board is placed upon the ear for the convenience of the brakeman, it does not show that it is there as a limitation of the place to which the brakeman is confined in the performance of his duties which, call him to the top of the car; but on the contrary, it tends to show that some of his duties call him outside of that limit, especially in signaling trains, as ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>pears in the testimony of one witness, at least, who was forced to dodge this spout in passing it when signaling the train to avoid being struck by it. The motion for a verdict upon this ground was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">Bequests 3, 4, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, which were based upon the same question as that raised in division \u201cD,\u201d were complied with by the court below as far as the facts in the case and the law warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Under division \u201cE\u201d the defendant claims that there can be no recovery, because the accident was the result of the neglect of a fellow servant who last used the spout. This position is not well taken, for the evidence does not support it. The plaintiff relies wholly upon the neglect of the defendant in maintaining the tank and spout as they were maintained, and her evidence tends to show that the injury was the result of their negligent maintenance and not in their use. No question of fellow servant was raised in the case, and no error was cpmmitted by the court below in refusing to direct a verdict upon this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Under division \u201cF\u201d the question is raised whether there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that the death of McDuffee was the result of the alleged accident. Upon this point the defendant has brought to the attention of the Court a large part of the evidence given by the medical experts and asks the Court to weigh the same, and, if in their judgment it is found to be insufficient to support a finding that death resulted from the alleged injury, to direct a verdict for the defendant on that ground. The rule, that, if there is evidence supporting the claim of the plaintiff, the Court will not direct a verdict for the defendant, is so firmly established in this State by repeated decisions, that the citation of authorities is unnecessary. In this case there was evidence tending to prove that death resulted from the alleged injury. It shows that on the afternoon of the accident and not long after it occurred, McDuffee complained to the plaintiff of a severe pain in his side, and said \u201chis side felt queer, funny, funny feeling in his side.\u201d On his return trip to Lyndonville the afternoon of the accident and not long after it, McDuffee said to a fellow trainman, that he \u201cfelt rotten.\u201d The medical witnesses, who were found by the Court to be qualified as experts, testified in sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>stance that, in their opinion, the injury probably caused the death of McDuffee, and Dr. Allen in answer 'to the hypothetical question testified: \u201cAssuming those facts, he received the injury when he fell upon the car.\u201d The injury referred to in Dr. Allen\u2019s answer above was the injury which caused the death of McDuffee.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\">From this testimony of the experts, in connection with the evidence upon which they base their opinion, it cannot be successfully maintained that there was no evidence tending to prove that McDuffee\u2019s death resulted from the alleged injury received at the water spout.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">The charge of the Court fairly complied with the defendant\u2019s requests 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28v so far as they stated the law, and no error is found upon this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The second ground of error assigned by the defendant is based upon the Court\u2019s refusal to charge as requested in its thirty-four separate requests. We have already considered and disposed of all of them, except requests 30, 31 and 32, in our treatment of the defendant\u2019s first ground of error. Request 30 related to an alleged variance in counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10, in that in those counts it was alleged that the deceased was walking when he received the injury, while the evidence was that he was standing still when he received it. The defendant\u2019s counsel argue that the court should have charged in this respect as requested, because the variance was material; that it was material because, if McDuffee was doing nothing and was standing still, he had greater reason to be looking out for danger than he would have had if he was engaged in any duty requiring his attention to be given to other matters. A full answer to this argument is, that the evidence does not warrant the assumption that he was doing nothing but standing still, for the witness, Belle Villeneuve, testified, that McDuffee wias signaling the train at the time of the injury; besides he was not required to exercise diligence to discover dangers which were the result of the defendant\u2019s negligence. The .variance claimed by the defendant, at most, was only an immaterial difference and therefore not a variance; for a variance means ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>terial difference. <em>State </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>1 Aik. 226; <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>12 Vt. 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">Bequests 31 and 32 related to a variance in counts 7 and 8, and as the defendant has not pointed out in what respect such alleged variance is material, and as we are unable to discover any materiality in such alleged variance, we cannot assume that it was error for the court below to refuse to instruct the jury as requested. What the Court said in <em>Dano </em>v. <em>Sessions, </em>65 Vt. 79, 26 Atl. 585, may well be said here: \u201cThe exceptions must show that the particular variance relied'upon was pointed out to, and passed upon by the county court. To the same effect is <em>Morey </em>v. <em>King, </em>49 Vt. 304, and <em>Holdridge </em>v. <em>Holdridge\u2019s Est., </em>53 Vt. 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The third ground of error assigned is based upon the charge of the Court, and is divided into several subdivisions denoted by the capital letters of the alphabet, beginning with \u201cA\u201d and ending with \u201cI\u201d inclusive. We deem it unnecessary to enter into a discussion of the various refinements called to our attention in these numerous exceptions to the charge of the court below, as we think the court below correctly and fully stated the law as applied to the facts of this case, and that in this respect there was no error, nor was there any error in the court\u2019s refusal to require the plaintiff to elect upon which count she would rely, for she was entitled to recover upon both. <em>Ranney, Admr. </em>v. <em>St. J. &amp; L. C. R. Co., </em>64 Vt. 277, 24 Atl. 1053.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">The fourth ground of error alleged relates to the admission and exclusion of evidence. Several exceptions were taken to the admission and exclusion of evidence during the trial, but as the defendant discusses in its brief only one exception, we direct our attention only to that one. That exception related to a hypothetical question put to Dr. Allen. The exception was based upon the assumption that there was no evidence laying a foundation for such a question. In the earlier part of our opinion we have pointed out that there was such evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>showing that McDuffee did receive such injury at Newport as the question assumes, and therefore there was no error in overruling the objection and admitting the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">The fifth alleged ground of error was to the argument of counsel for the plaintiff. In opening he referred to what the defendant might and could have proved, by evidence peculiarly in its possession, to which counsel for the defendant objected. The court cautioned him about the advisability of following that line of argument, and after a little discussion concerning the propriety of such an argument, he said: \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t thought it was a legitimate line of argument I wouldn\u2019t press it, but I feel strongly that it is.\u2019\u2019 The court thereupon permitted him to proceed and subject to the defendant\u2019s exception, he said: \u201cWhat do you say, does any presumption arise to them in regard to that, gentlemen, \u2014 that is all I want to say. Here is the defendant, here is the plaintiff, \u2014 what do you say if he had been up there at a previous time by that water spout or where he could have seen that water spout and its dangers to a man on top of a car, doesn\u2019t it lie within their power to prove it?\u201d The argument was clearly improper. The defendant had introduced no evidence in the case, but had rested when the plaintiff rested, and went to the jury on the case made by the plaintiff, as it had a right to do. When it did so, no-adverse presumption arose because of its omission to introduce any evidence on the trial. It is only when a party has introduced evidence upon an issue raised in the case by his own evidence, that a presumption arises against him for a failure to produce evidence peculiarly within his knowledge and possession. If, then, the argument was harmful, the judgment should be reversed. The argument was in substance, that McDuffee did not know of this danger, because he had never been past the spout in question, and as evidence of that face was peculiarly within the knowledge and possession of the defendant, and as it had not shown the contrary, their omission to do so was evidence that the intestate had not been there, and therefore did not know that this danger existed. The burden was upon the plaintiff to show that her intestate did not know of the existence of the danger. <em>Dunbar </em>v. <em>C. V. R. Co., supra. </em>Counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>attempted to establish this important fact by arguing a matter not in the case, but which would strike the mind of an ordinary jury as being a strong piece of evidence tending to show that the intestate did not on any former occasion go past this spout and, so, did not know of the danger. For aught we know, the jury may have found upon this argument alone that the intestate did not know of this danger. We think it was harmful, and for that reason the judgment below ought to be reversed. As this holding sends the case back for a new trial,'we do not consider the other exceptions to counsel\u2019s argument, believing that what we have already said will be sufficient caution to counsel in this case to restrain them from exceeding the legitimate bounds of temperate argument in their treatment of the case at a future trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-3\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
