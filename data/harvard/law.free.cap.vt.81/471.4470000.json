Both counts are demurred to generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">There are many cases in the books which hold that necessity, and an inability to control movements inaugurated in the proper exercise of a strict right, will justify entries upon land and interferences with personal property that would otherwise have been trespasses. A reference to a few of these will be sufficient to illustrate the doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">In <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Fandrye, </em>Poph. 161, trespass was brought for chasing sheep, and the defendant pleaded that the sheep were trespassing upon his land, and that he with a little dog chased them out, and that as soon as the sheep were off his land he called in the dog. It was argued that, although the defendant might lawfully drive the sheep from his own ground with a dog, he had' no right to pursue them into the next ground. But the court considered that the defendant might drive the sheep from his land with a dog, and that the nature of a dog is such that he cannot be withdrawn in an instant, and that as the defendant had done his best to recall the dog trespass would not lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">In trespass of cattle taken in A, defendant pleaded that he was seized of C, and found the cattle there damage feasant, and chased them toward the pound, and that they escaped from him and went into A, and he presently retook them; and this was held a good plea. 21 Bdw.

If one have a way over the land, of another for his beasts to pass, and the beasts, being properly driven, feed the grass by morsels in passing, or run out of the way and are promptly pursued and brought back, trespass will not lie.

Rep. 500, the de- | fendant went upon the plaintiff\u2019s beach for the purpose of J saving and restoring to the lawful owner a boat which had been [ driven ashore and was in danger of being carried off by -the sea; | and it was held no trespass. See also <em>Dunwich </em>v. <em>Sterry, </em>1 B. &amp; Ad. 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">This doctrine of necessity applies with special force to the preservation of human life. One assaulted and in peril of his life may run through the close of another to escape from his assailant. 37 Hen. VII, pl. 26. One may sacrifice the personal \\ property of another to save his life or the lives of his fellows. * In <em>Mouse\u2019s Case, </em>12 Co. 63, the defendant was sued <em>for </em>taking and carrying away the plaintiff\u2019s casket and its contents. It appeared that the ferryman of Gravesend took forty-seven passengers into his barge to pass to London, among whom were the plaintiff and defendant; and. the barge being upon the water a great tempest happened, and a strong wind, so that the barge and all the passengers were in danger of being lost if certain ponderous things were not cast out, and the defendant thereupon cast out the plaintiff\u2019s casket. It was resolved that in case of necessity, to save the lives of the passengers, it was lawful for the defendant, being a passenger, to east the plaintiff\u2019s casket out of the barge; that if the ferryman surcharge the barge the owner shall have his remedy upon' the surcharge against the ferryman,' but that if there be no surcharge, and the danger accrue only by the act of God, as by tempest, without fault of the ferryman, every one ought to bear his loss, to safeguard the life of a man.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">It is clear that an entry upon the land of another may be <em>J </em>justified by necessity, and that the declaration before us dis- A closes a necessity for mooring the sloop. But the defendant \u00a1 <em>I </em>questions the sufficiency of the counts because they do not / negative the existence of natural objects to which the plaintiff ! <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>could have moored with equal safety. The allegations are, in substance, that the stress of a sudden and violent tempest compelled the plaintiff to moor to defendant\u2019s dock to save his sloop and the people in it. The averment of necessity is complete, for it covers not only the necessity of mooring, but the necessity of mooring to the dock; and the details of the situation which created this necessity, whatever the legal requirements regarding them, are matters of proof and need not be alleged. It is certain that the rule suggested cannot be held applicable irrespective of circumstance, and the question must be, left for adjudication upon proceedings had with reference to the evidence or the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The defendant insists that the counts are defective in that they fail to show that the servant, in easting off the rope, was acting within the scope of his employment. It is said that the allegation that the island and dock were in charge of the servant does not imply authority to do an unlawful act; and that the allegations as a whole fairly indicate that the servant unmoored the sloop for a wrongful purpose of his own, and not by virtue of any general authority or special instruction received from the defendant. But we think the counts are sufficient in this respect. The allegation is that the defendant did this by his servant. The words \u201cwilfully and designedly\u201d in one count, and \u201cnegligently, carelessly and wrongfully\u201d in the other, are not applied to the servant, but to the defendant acting through the servant. The necessary implication is that the servant was acting within the scope of his employment.13 Ency. Pl. &amp; Pr. 922; <em>Voegeli </em>v. <em>Pickel Marble etc. Co., </em>49 Mo.
