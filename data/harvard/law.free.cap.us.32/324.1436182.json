William L. Howard and Francois Varion, libellants.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b332-4\">A libel was filed in the district court of the United States for the eastern district of Louisiana, against the steamboat Planter, by H. and V., citizens of New Orleans, for the recovery of a sum of money alleged to be due to them, as shipwrights, for work done and materials found in the repairs of the Planter. The libel asserts that, by the admiralty law and the laws of the state of Louisiana, they have a lien and privilege upon the boat, her tackle, &amp;c. for the payment of the sums due for the repairs and materials, and prays admiralty process against the boat, &amp;c. The answer of the owners of the Planter avers that they are citizens of Louisiana, residing in New Orleans 5,that the libellants are also citizens, and that the court have no jurisdiction of the cause. Held, that this was a case of admiralty jurisdiction.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b332-5\">By the civil code of Louisiana, workmen employed in the construction or repairs of ships or boats enjoy the privilege of a lien on such ships or boats, without being bound to reduce their contracts to writing, whatever may be their amount; but this privilege ceases if they have allowed the ship or boat to depart without exercising their rights. The state law, therefore, gives a lien in this case.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b332-6\">In the case of the General Smith, 4 Wheat. 438, S. C. 4 Peters\u2019s Condensed Reports, it is decided that the jurisdiction of the admiralty in cases where the repairs are upon a domestic vessel, depend upon the local law of the state. Where the repairs have been made or necessaries furnished to a foreign ship, or to a ship in the ports of a state to which she does not belong, the general maritime law gives a lien on ships as security ; and the party may maintain a suit in the admiralty to enforce his right. But, as to repairs or necessaries in the port or state to which the ships belong, the case is governed altogether by the local law of the state; as no lien is implied unless it is recognized by that law. But if the local law gives the lien, it may be enforced in the admiralty.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b332-7\">The services in this case were performed in the port of New Orleans, and whether this was within the jurisdiction of the admiralty or noli depends on the fact whether the tide in the Mississippi ebbs and flows as high up the river as the port of New Orleans. The court considered themselves authorized judicially to notice the .situation of New Orl\u00e9ans, for the purpose of determining whether the tide ebbs and flows as high up the river aa that place; and being satisfied that although the current of the Mississippi at New Orleans may be so strong as not to be turned backwards by the tide, yet the effect of the tide upon the current is sp great.as occasions a regular rise and fall of the water; New Orleans may be pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>perly said to be within the ebb and flow of the tide, and the jurisdiction ofthe admiralty prevails there.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b333-4\">In order to the decision whether the admiralty jurisdiction attaches to such services as'those performed by the libellants, the material consideration is, whether the service was essentially a maritime service, and to be performed substantially on the Sea or tide water. It is no objection to the jurisdiction of the admiralty in the case, that the steamboat Planter was to be employed in navigating waters beyond the ebb and flow.of the tide. In the case of the steamboat Jefferson, it was said by this court that there is no doubt the jurisdiction exists, although the commencement or termination of the voyage may happen to be at some place beyond the reach of the tide.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b333-5\">Some of the older authorities seem to give countenance to the doctrine that an express contract operates as a waiver of the lien: but it is. settled at the present day, that an express contract for a stipulated sum is not of itself a waiver of a lien; but that, to produce that effect, the contract must contain some stipulations inconsistent with the continuance of such lien, or from which a waiver may fairly be inferred.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-6\">APPEAL from the district court of the United States for the eastern district of Louisiana.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-7\">In the district court a libel was filed on the 10th December 1830, by Howard and .Varion, shipwrights, , residing in New Orleans, against the'steamboat Planter, claiming the sum of two thousand one hundred and ninety-three dollars and thirty-five cents, being the balance asserted to be due to them for the price of work, labour, materials furnished and repairs made on the said boat, under- contracts of 13th September and 19th October 1830; and alleging that, by the admiralty law and the law of the state of Louisiana, they had a lien on the said boat for the payment of the same; and that she was about leaving the port of New Orleans, and praying process, &amp;c. The account for the work, materials, &amp;c. was annexed to the libel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-8\">The owners of the steamboat Planter filed a claim and plea setting forth that they were all citizens of Louisiana, all resided in the. city of New.

The claimants, in their first answer, deny the. jurisdiction of the court, on the ground that all the parties were citizens of the same state, to wit, of Louisiana; that objection, however, was not insisted upon at the trial, and is not sustainable on the admiralty side of this court. In their.supplemental answer, they deny generally the allegations of the libellants, and pray for the dismissal of the libel and damages. The whole account of the libellants against the owners amounts to three thousand six hundred and ninety-three dollars and thirty-five cents, including the amount of the written contracts entered into between the parties; of this sum they acknowledge the payment of one thousand five hundred dollars, leaving, as they allege, a balance of two thousand one hundred and ninety-three dollars and thirty-five cents due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>them. By the first contract, made on the 11th September 1830 (the boat being then in the water), the libellants agreed, for the sum of one thousand one hundred and fifty dollars, to make certain repairs on that part of the boat which was above water, <em>from the wheel heme to the bow; </em>and it. was further stipulated, that if they made any other repairs, by replacing unsound timbers in any other part of the boat above water, not then discovered, they were t\u00f3 be paid separately for so much. After commencing the work, it was perceived that the boat required repairs under the water as well as above, and in conseq\u00fcence of that discovery, the claimants, through captain Jarreau, master of the boat and one of the owners, agreed to pay the libellants four hundred and seventy-five dollars for hauling out the boat, and for launching her when, she should be repaired; and as the quantity of work to be done was uncertain, i.t was stipulated that an account of it should be kept, and if approved of by captain Jarreau, under whose inspection the work was to be done, the claimants bound themselves to pay the amount thus to be ascertained: this latter contract was made, on the 19 th October last. After the boat was <em>hauled </em>out, it appears the work under both contracts was carried on simultaneously. On a first view of the account current exhibited in this case, it would seem, from the dates, that at least a part of the work to be done under the'first contract Was again charged, but the subsequent testimony taken in this case shows that these charges were made on account of the extra repairs provided for under the first contract; and it further appears that all the charges made aft\u00e9r the 19.th of October, have no relation to the first agreement, but all relate to the work contemplated by the second contract. From the complexion of the testimony taken by the complainants, their real defence seems to be that the prices' of the work charged are greater than they should be, that it was not executed in a proper manner, and that the libellants have forfeited a considerable sum of money in consequence of not delivering the boat within the time stipulated in the contract. As to the two first objections, the evidence is conclusive in favour of the libellants; captain Jarreau, himself, upon being shown the account, did not object to it; on the contrary, expressed himself satisfied with the work, and said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>he was \u201c not surprised at- it, because' there was a great deal more work done than he had any idea of;\u201d with respect to the non-delivery of the boat at the time agreed upon, the fault chiefly attaches to captain Jarreau,.who, in several instances, retarded the work by opposing repairs which were proposed by the libellants, but which turned out to be indispensable, and were afterwards ordered by him to be made ; besides, he promised them indemnity against their obligation to pay twenty-five dollars a day for every day they were in default in delivering the boat, and gave as the reason, that they had to do more work than was at first anticipated. The charge of four hundred and seventy-five dollars, is for the specific service of hauling out and launching the boat, and must be allowed as such. On the whole, the evidence and exhibits in the case fully sustain the demand of the libellants; it is therefore ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the claimants pay to them the said sum of one thousand one hundred and ninety-three dollars and thirty-five cents, and costs of suit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-4\">From this decree the owners of the Planter appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b336-5\">The case was argued for the appellants by Mr Morton.

And this rule is ap-. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>plicable to all courts of inferior jurisdiction (Stanyon v. Davis, 6 Mod. 224; the Lord Coningsby\u2019s case, 9 Mod. 95); and has been adopted by the appellate court, from the earliest periods of judicial, history, for the purpose of restraining'inferior tribunals within their appropriate spheres of action, and preventing the possibility of their passing those bounds, even by the assent of parties below, to the erroneous exercise of power.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-4\">To sustain the jurisdiction of the court, below, it must appear affirmatively, either that the Planter was a \u201c foreign vessel,\u201d or, being a domestic vesse\u2019, that the lien or privilege created by the laws of Louisiana, constituted her a proper subject for the action of a court of admiralty. The first is not contended for on the part of the libellants; and to maintain the second, it must be shown affirmatively, that the Plapter \u201c was engaged in a maritime employment,\u201d being a navigation \u201c super altum mare,\u201d or \u201c substantially upon waters.within ebb and flow of the tide;\u201d constituting a case of admiralty jurisdiction, as recognized by the law, admiralty and maritime, as it has existed for ages,\u201d which alone, the admiralty courts of the United States act under, and have, authority to administer to the cases as they arise.

Admiralty jurisdiction is not then to be inferred, because a vessel is the subject, and a state law has created a lien, however positively these facts may be alleged upon a record, and remain uncontroverted: a converse doctrine would have sustained the jurisdiction in the case of the Jefferson, before cited; and would equally establish an admiralty jurisdiction, waere state laws had created liens, whether upon tideless rivers or upon the waters of the lakes: in all of which cases, it may be observed, that the vice-admiralty colonial courts would have exercised jurisdiction by. virtue of their peculiar commissions; but not as-cases of admiralty jurisdiction, which they never were, and t\u00f3 constitute them such . would not be within the power of congress: though to a certain extent, a jurisdiction over them might be conferred upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>the district courts, under the power \u201c to regulate, commerce among the states,\u201d as is intimated in the case of the Jefferson.'

It is submitted with some confidence, that this state of facts is but a fair inference from the whole record of the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-7\">It is by no means conceded that New Orleans is within the ebb and flow of the tide; on the contrary; that the court will notice the notorious and historical fact that it is beyond the ebb and flow of the tide ; that the Mississippi river is not an arm of the sea, nor an inlet from the ocean, but an inland river, whose current assumes but one course or flux to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>ocean, and is uninfluenced by, its tides.

A navigable river is also considered as an arm of the sea; but there is an important distinction between the legal and popular import of the term \u201cnavigable,\u201d as applied to rivers; and no part of the law is more <em>cl </em>;arly settled, than that to determine, 'whether or not a river, is navigable, a regard must be had to the \u201c ebbing and flowing of the tide.\u201d For those streams of water which are of public us\u00e9 for inland navigation above the line to which the tide ordinarily flows, are strictly \u201cnot navigable,\u201d though they- are public highways, for the purpose of transportation; although the water is^fresh at full tide, yet the river is still an arm of the sea if it \u201cflows and reflows;\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-5\">This has never been controverted in England, arid is well settled in this country.

The rise and fall of the river is' caused exclusively by the rainy and dry season in the interior; at low water the flow to the sea is scarcely perceptible.\u201d From the surveyor general of Louisiana.

The second contract states that the boat is to be delivered \u201c ready to receive a cargo.\u201d The testimony shows her to have been \u201c launched and partly laden.\u201d The return of the riiarshal shows her redelivery to claimants.

Darby\u2019s Louisiana, 95, 197. Stoddard\u2019s Louisiana, 165, 186</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-5\">The record then affords evidence that the Planter, having be\u00e9n redelivered to the claimants, and laden with cargo, was employed, not in \u201c maritime service,\u201d nor in trading \u201c to Mobile, Pensacola, or intermediate places,\u201d but in navigating between .New Orleans, Bayou Sarah, Red river, and Alexandria, presenting a case of \u201cinterior trade,\u201d wherein the inception, intermediate progress and termination of the voyage were wholly beyond admiralty jurisdiction. On the part of the libellants, it is assumed that New Orleans is within tide water, and a&gt; doctrine thereupon is applied drawn from the case of the Jefferson, 10 Wheat. 428, that admiralty jurisdiction is sustainable when the \u201c <em>inception\u201d of </em>the contract, &amp;c. is thus circumstanced. But that case we suppose to establish a converse doctrine. . The \u201cinception,\u201d &amp;c. being there noticed by the court as not answering to the idea of a navigation \u201c substantially\u201d beyond tide waters, so as to oust admiralty jurisdiction, and consequently not sufficient to confer jurisdiction, were alone relied upon as substantially \u201c a maritime, employment.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-6\">It is not perceived in what.manner the inferenees adverse to the jurisdiction below become negatived, or the defective libel aided through the evidence of a public act making.New Orleans a port of entry. .Could an analogous law for Shipping port in Kentucky, have varied the views taken by the court of that case <em>1 </em>The general collection law of March 1799, sec. 4, creates various ports of entry and delivery upon. Lake Champlain, Ontario, and Lake Erie; and supposing a case similar to the present to be now bef\u00f3re the court from the northern district of New York, the force of these laws is not realized, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>invoked to aid the court in determining admiralty and maritime jurisdiction upon those waters. \u201cCases in admiralty do not arise under the constitution and-laws of the United States.\u201d Amer. Ins. v. Canter, 1 Peters, 545.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-4\">The pleadings on the part of She claimants are hot only sufficient to sustain all the exceptions now taken, but to warrant the inference, that they were taken below and overruled. They plead to the jurisdiction: first, on the ground that alt the owners are residents, &amp;c., which having been overruled, subsequently a supplemental answer and plea were filed, denying generally all the allegations contained in the libel. Neither the reasons for disallowing the objections to the jurisdiction, if offered, under both of these-pleadings, nor the objections themselves, appear; the court below, alone noticing that part of the evidence, upon which, \u201cin <em>its judgment\u201d </em>the real, defence of the claimants rested.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-5\">Under the first point then, it is believed that the court will either dismiss the case as not showing jurisdiction upon the face of the proceedings, or remand the same, for the purpose of settling the facts upon which the jurisdiction must rest, if it is to be sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-6\">The second point made on the part of the appellants is-\u2014 that the libellants had waived any privilege or lien upon the boat, under the l'aws of Louisiana, and, therefore, proceedings \u201cin rem\u201d were improper.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-7\">In other words, that the inference is fairly deducible from the case, that it was within the contemplation of the parties, that their contracts should not create a right to \u201cprovisional seizure,\u201d under articles 284 and 289. of the Code of Practice.of 1830, p. 104, and article 2748 of the Civil Code.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-8\">It is observed on the part of libellants, that, in this case, extraordinary diligence was used, to enforce a right which, would have been lost, had the vessel been permitted to depart without its exercise ; and the inference would seem to be suggested, that probably such a state of things wrs within , the contemplation of libellants, when entering into the agreements. It is certainly true, that article 2748, referred to, declares the privilege to cease, if the boat is allowed to depart without exercising the right of seizure. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>But this effect takes place only, if the contract should not have been reduced to writing; and if the. amount should exceed five hundred dollars, and the contract be <em>reduced to writing, </em>the privilege may be unlimited. Civil Code, article 2743, 2747. The \u201c curia philippica,\u201d \u201c quoad\u201d liens or privileges on vessels, is supposed to have been abrogated by articles 3521, 2746 and 2748 of the Louisiana civil code; although referred to as yet subsisting, in a note to Abbott, on Shipping, p. 116, ed. of 1829.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-5\">The reducing the contract to writing, may then be fairly, taken as expressing the intention of the parties, that the right to a provisional seizure should.be wholly suspended, but the right preserved until the return of the vessel, and to be exercised only in the event of a failure of personal responsibility on the part of claimants, to which, by the terms of the contract of 19th October, the libellants alone think proper to look. That full reliance must have been placed in-the immediate return of the Planter to New Orleans, is apparent, from the fact of her ownership and commercial employment there, as well as by the evidence upon the record, showing New Orleans to have been the inception and t\u00e9rmini, after her voyage upon the rivers throughout the interior of the country. And as conclusively affirming this view of the intention of the libellants, is the further fact evidenced by the contract of the 19th October, of extending a <em>credit </em>of two hundred.and seventy-five dollars, forming a portion of the aggregate sum, to one month after the Planter should have been launched; set afloat and delivered, ready to receive a cargo \u2014 an evident suspension of the right to provisional seizure, until after the Planter must have left the jurisdiction of the court, showing clearly that such an understanding existed between the parties as justifies an application of the principle in the note to Raitt v. Mitchell, 4 Campbell, 150, and which is conceded to be entirely compatible with the laws of Louisiana.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b342-6\">The construction placed upon the contract of 19th October by the libellants, limits it to <em>\u201c </em>thirty days after the vessel should be. set afloatbut it is presumed this limitation will not be sanctioned, and when the whole contract is brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>into notice and.its parts viewed in connexion, that construction contended for by the appellants, must be affirmed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-4\">Under the second point., then it is admitted, that superadding to other corroborating circumstances, the extension of credit for a portion of the aggregate amount involved, to a period after the right to provisional, seizure could have been exercised, brings the case within the doctrine of Raitt v. Mitchell, 4 Campb. N. P. 150.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-5\">The third point relied upon by the appellants is, that the decree rendered, is erroneous. In. support of this position Mr Morton went into a particular examination of the evidence. This part of the argument is stated and examined in the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-6\">The decree rendered is further erroneous, in that it directs four hundred and seventy-five dollars, charged in the account of libellants for drawing the boat out of the water, to be paid to them; of which sum, two hundred and seventy-five dollars, by the express terms of the contract of 19th October, were not demandable until \u201c one month after the libellants had delivered th\u00e9 Planter afloat, and ready to receive a cargo.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-7\">[Here the counsel went into a particular examination of the evidence.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-8\">The regulation of the subject of \u201c liens or privileges,\u201d and provisional seizure, by the laws of Louisiana, will be found mainly to have in view the internal trading navigation of the country, from New Orleans. Art. 284 of the Code of Practice of 1800, which is a oomihent upon Art. 2748 of the Civil Code, has alone reference to \u201c water craft within the state,\u201d and Art. 289 of the same, after dealing much in detail upon \u201c lien and provisional seizure of ships, vessels or water craft, navigating within th\u00e9 state,\u201d'in \u00e1 separate section, and as ah exception to the general purview and scope of the legislation, further provides that \u201csuch seizure may be made \u2018even\u2019 of ships or vessels trading out of the state,\u2019.\u2019 and their laws appear to have had in view, among other subjects, the intricate matters of dispute, involved with*the peculiar internal steamboat navigation iron New Orleans, by affording various aids and facilities, susceptible of being adapted to most of the difficulties that would arise, and of which aids their courts have express, jpower <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>to avail themselves. Thus from Art. 441 to 461 of the Code of Practice of 1830, are recognized, \u201c experts,\u201d persons versed in the knowledge either of a science, an art, or a profession, selected in order to give their opinion, on some point or queer tion, on which the decision of a cause depends.\u201d Also, \u201c auditors\u201d of accounts, \u201cjudicial\u201d arbitrators, &amp;c. &amp;c. whose detailed services are therein fully enumerated; but none of whom, it is supposed, could be required to act by the district court of the United States, however essential to the elucidation of a cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-4\">From the decisions of the inferior tribunals, invested with cognizance of these cases, the right of appeal, and a speedy final determination of the appellate court is carefully provided for by art. 570 to 603 of the Code of Practice for Louisiana of 1830,</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-5\">In conclusion, it is submitted that, if the inference be not decidedly adverse to the jurisdiction below, upon the face of the proceedings, yet important facts identified with that jurisdiction, do appear of so doubtful and unsettled a character as to render it proper to remand the case for a satisfactory establishment of those facts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-6\">That, although it should be considered, that proceedings below \u201c in rem\u201d were proper, yet material errors having been obviously incorporated with the decree, renders its enforcement impossible, and makes it now essential for the ends of justice, that the whole subject be remanded for that full re-investigation, through which .those ende can alone be attained,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b344-7\">Mr Livingston, for the appellees, stated:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-8\">The main objection to the decree in this case is, that the district court of Louisiana, as a court of admiralty,, had no jurisdiction of the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-9\">The libellants contend for the jurisdiction on the privilege granted ,by general maritime law; and on the express lien given by the laws of the state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-10\">1. The general maritime law. Cases are abundant to show: that shipwrights have a privilege on the ship for repairs and a right to libel her to enforce it. Roll\u2019s Ab, 533; 1 Peters\u2019s Admiralty Reports, 227, 233.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>2. The laws of the state give the privilege without reducing the agreement to writing, as Is required in other cases. Louisiana Civ. Cod. art. 2748.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-5\">It is argued that a state law cannot give jurisdiction to a court of the United States. In one sense this is true: a state law cannot extend such jurisdiction, but they may create a right which can only be enforced by such a court. For in* stance, by the general admiralty law, a master of a ship cannot sue in the admiralty for his wages by a libel on, the ship, be*, cause, by the maritime law, he has .no lien on the vessel. But suppose a state law to give such lien for all contracts made with the owners in the state, the maritime court of the United States, it is apprehended, would take cognizance of the case; and enforce the law. This, it is acknowledged, would not be done unless the.cage made by the state is a maritime contract la this such an one <em>% . </em>In the case of Jefferson, 10 Wheat tibe mariners could not sue in the district court, because the service, in its inception, progress and termination, was above the ebb and flow of the sea; the inference then is plain, that if the contract and service had, either in the beginning, end, or any intermediate point, been within the ebb and flow-of the sea, the decision would have been different. In th\u00e9 present case the contract was made, the work begun arid completed in a seaport, where there is a regular flux and reflux whenever the river is in its ordinary star\u00bb.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-6\">Should it be objected that it does not appear that the steamboat in question was intended, after her repair, to navigate within the ebb arid flow, the answer is, first, that the presumption must be that she was intended to navigate to and from the place where her owners resided and where she was repairedthat, at any rate, the inception of her first voyage must be from the seaport where she was. Whether to go on the coasting trade by sea to Mobile, Pensacola, or the intermediate places, or to ply between the sea and the port, is at least as probable as that she Was for the interior trade. Nor was it necessary for the libellants to state this. In a libel for repairs of a vessel, it is sufficient to describe it by the name given to vessels of that class, as ship, schooner, &amp;c. without averring that the repairs were intended to enable her to prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>cute a sea voyage; yet vessels of all descriptions \u00absometimes navigate waters,above 'the flux and reflux'of the sea. So, in the present case, it was sufficient to call the vessel, on which the repairs were done, a steamboat; for steamboats are as frequently, and perhaps more so, employed on tide-water, as above it. If the exception were material, it ought to have been made by the answer; but here'the objection in the answer is merely to the person of the libellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-4\">If it should be objected that the fact of New Orleans being within the ebb and flow of the sea is not in evidence, the answer is, that there are notorious facts with which courts are-supposed to be conversant, and of which they will take notice without further proof. Thus, in the case of La Vengeance, 3 Dall. 297, 1. Peters\u2019s Cond. Rep. 132, the court takes official notice of the situation of Sandy Hook; and in the cas\u00e9 from 20 Johnson, cited by the defendant, they assume, in like manner, that Salmon river is a fresh water river, and that it has no flux and reflux. In the case before the court, there is moreover the (yidence of a public act, making New Orleans a port of entry-and delivery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-5\">The second error assigned in the printed^ statement is, that the libellants had, waived any privilege or lien on the steamboat by the laws of Louisiana. If this were made out, it would not affect the right of the libellants under the law maritime. But it is not perceived that there is any,evidence of such waiver. Th\u00e9 article which gives the privilege declares that-it shall be lost if the party suffer the vessel to depart without exercising the right; and this is. the only condition. But in this case extraordinary diligence was used, and the libel calls for the immediate interposition of the court to prevent the departure. . The vessel crossed the river from the ship-yard on the 8th \u00f3f D\u00e9cember, the libel was filed on the 10th, and the seizure made on the 11th of the same month.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-6\">That an express contract for a specific sum is not a waiver of the privilege is proved, by the case cited by the defendant from 4th Camp. 150. Such a rule could only have been made by using the word <em>credit </em>in a sense in which it was not employed. The workman may be said to perform his labour on the credit of the owner, when he takes his promise for a certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>gum to be paid in cash on the finishing of the work; and in this, sense the rule applies, and was considered an implied waiver of the 'privilege. In the case before the court there are two different contracts, both written. By the. first, for certain specified repairs, the owners agree, \u201cin the name of . the boat,\u201d ,to pay in cash one thousand one hundred and fifty dollars; by the second, it being found it would be necessary . to haul up the boat, .four hundred and seventy-five dollars were agreed to be paid for that service, two hundred in cash, and two hundred and seventy-five in thirty days after the boat should he set afloat; and it is further agreed that the libellants should caulk and repair the boat so that she shall not leak, to be paid for as soon as the account shall be approved. Here, it will be observed, that no term of time was- given for any part except the two hundred and seventy-five dollars/or hauling up. the- boat; this was to-be paid thirty days after the boat was <em>set afloat. </em>When that happened does not appear. She came \u00f3vej to the town side of the river on the 8th of December, but-when she was launched was not said. Part of the ope thousand five hupdred dollars paid may then be reasonably imputed to this balance of two hundred and seventy-five dollars, because the debt for the extra repairs was not due until they were finished,, and it- appiears they were not. finished until the suit was brought. Where then there are two debts, one already payable, the other not, a sum paid without designation, shall be imputed to that which is due, Civil Code, article 2162. Therefore, this part of the debt, on .which credit was given being extinguished, no question can arise as to the lien for the* balance. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-4\">There remain now only the objections to the earn allowed. On this point the court is referred to the full and conclusive testimony offered by the libellants, that all the materials and workmen they furnished were necessary \u2014 that they were actually furnished \u2014 that they are not overcharged \u2014 -that the work was carried bn under the inspection bf the Captain, and was acknowledged to have been executed t\u00f3 his satisfaction.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b347-5\">Mr Justice Thompson</author>\n<p id=\"ASf_\">delivered the-opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj6Y\">This case comes up from the district court of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>States for the eastern district of Louisiana. The proceedings in the court below were in rem against the steamboat Planter, to recover compensation for repairs made upon the boat.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The libel states that Howard and Varion, shipwrights, residing in the city of New Orleans, had found materials and performed certain work on the steamboat Planter, for which the said steamboat and her owners were justly indebted to them in the sum of two thousand orte hundred and ninety-three dollars and thirty-five cents; and alleges that by the admiralty law, and the laws of the state of Louisiana, they have a .lien and privilege upon the boat, her taclde, apparel and furniture for the payment of the same; and prays admiralty process against the boat, atid that the usual monition may issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The appellants afterwards appeared in court and filed their claim and plea, alleging that they are citizens of Louisiana, and residing in the city of New Orleans, and that they are the sole and lawful owners of the steamboat Planter; and alleging further, that the libellants are also citizens of the same state, and that the court had no jurisdiction of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">The plea to the jurisdiction of the court was overruled, and a supplemental and amended claim and answer filed, denying all and singular the facts set forth in the libel; and by consent of parties an order of court was entered; that the testimony of the witnesses for the respective parties be taken before the clerk of. the court, and read in evidence upon the trial, subject to all legal exceptions; and upon the hearing of the cause the. court decreed that the claimants should pay to the libellants two thousand one hundred and ninety-three dollars and thirty-five cents, and costs of suit. An appeal to this court was prayed and allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Upon the argument here, the following points have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">1. It does not appear upon the proceedings, that the court, below had jurisdiction of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">2. That the. libellants had Waived any privilege or lien upon the steamboat under the law of Louisiana, and therefore proceedings in rem were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">3. If the court had jurisdiction, the decree is erroneous on the merits.'</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>The want of jurisdiction in the district court is not put on the ground set dp in the plea in. the court below, that all the parties were citizens of the same state. This has been very properly abandoned here, as entirely inapplicable to admiralty proceedings in the district court. But it is said that it does not appear upon the face of the proceedings, that the- cause of action properly belonged to admiralty jurisdiction. There can be no doubt that it must appear from the proceedings, that the court had jurisdiction of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The proceeding is in rexn against .a steamboat, for materials found and work performed in repairing the vessel in the port of New Orleans, as is alleged in the libel, under a contract entered into between the parties for that purpose. It is therefore a maritime contract; and if the service was. to be performed in a place within the jurisdiction of the admiralty, and the lien given by the Ipcal law of the state of Louisiana, it will bring the case within tt\u00edfe jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">By the Civil Code of Louisiana, article 2748, workmen employed in the construction \u00f3r r\u00e9pair of ships and boats enjoy the privilege established by the code, without being bound, to reduce their contracts to 'writing, whatever may be their amount; but this privilege ceases if they have allowed the ship or boat to depart without exercising their right. The state law, therefore, gives a lien in cases like the present.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">In the case of the General Smith, 4 Wheat. 438, it is decided, that the jurisdiction of the admiralty in such cases, where the repairs are upon a domestic vessel, depends upon the local law of the state. Where the repairs have been made, or necessaries furnished to a foreign ship, or to a ship in the ports of a state to which she does not belong, the general maritime law gives a lien on the ship as security,, and the party may maintain a suit in the admiralty to enforce his right. But as to repairs or necessaries in the port or state to which the ship belongs, the case is governed altogether by the local law of the state, \u00e1nd no lien is implied unless it is recognized by that law. . But if the local law gives' the lien, it may be enforced in the admiralty.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">it is said, however, that the place where these services were performed, was not: within the jurisdiction of the admiralty. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>The services in this case were, performed in the port of New Orleans, and whether this was within the jurisdiction of the court or not, will depend upon the fact, whether the tide in the Mississippi ebbs and flows as high up the river as New Orleans.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">This is a question of fact, and it is notimdesetvingof notice, that although there was a plea to the jurisdiction of the court interposed, the objection was not set up. Had it been put in issue,. the evidence would probably have removed all doubt upon that question; not having been set up, it affords an inference that the objection could not have been sustained by proof.</p>\n<p id=\"AN2\">But we think we are authorized judicially to notice the situation of New. Orleans, for the purpose of determining whether the tide ebbs and flows as high * up the riv\u00e9r as that place. In the case of the Apollon, 9 Wheat. 374, it is said by this court, that it has b\u00e9en very justly observed at the bar, that the court is bound to take notice of public facts and geographical positions: and in. the case of the steamboat Thomas Jefferson, the libel claimed wages earned on a voyage from Shipping port in the state of Kentucky, up the river Missouri, and back again to the port of departure. And the court say, that the voyage, not only iri its commencement and termination, but in all its intermediate progress, was several hundred miles above the ebb and flow of the tide, and, therefore, in no just sense can the wages be considered as earned in a maritime employment. It is fairly to be inferred, that the court judicially noticed the fact, that the tide did. not ebb and flow within the range of voyage upon which the services were rendered, as there is no intimation of any evidence before the court to establish the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">It cannot certainly be laid down as a universal,' or even as a general proposition, that the court can judicially notice matters of. fact. Yet it cannot be doubted that there are many facts, particularly with respect to geographical positions, of such public notoriety, and the knowledge of which is to be derived from other sources than parol proof; which the court may judicially notice. Thus in the case of the United States v. La Vengeance, 3 Dall. 297, 1 Peters\u2019s Cond. Rep. 132, the court judicially noticed the geographical position of Sandy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Hook. And it mhy certainly take notice judicially of like notorious facts, as that the bay of New York, f\u00f3r instance, is within the ebb and flow of the tide.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The appellants\u2019 counsel has referred the court to Stoddard\u2019s Louisiana, 164, for the purpose of showing that the tide does got ebb and flow at New Orleans; but we. think it affords a contrary conclusion.. The author Says, \u201cthe tides have little effect upon the water at:New Orleans; they sometimes cause it to swell, but never to slacken its current.\u201d No distinction has eves' been attempted in settling the line between the admiralty and common law jurisdiction, growing out of the greater or less influence of the tide. So far as that admiralty jurisdiction depends upon locality, it is bounded by the ebb and flow of the tide; and if the influence of the tide is at all felt, it must determine the question. No other certain and fixed rule can be adopted: and hi determining this, we must look at the ordinary state of the water, uninfluenced by any.extraordinary freshets.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The authority of Mr Stoddard goes to show that the tides have some effect upon the water at New Orleans; they cause it to swell, but not so much as to slacken the current. In the case of Rex v. Smith and others, 2 Doug. 441, it became a question whether the sea could properly be said to flow above London bridge. It was contended that the tide beyond that limit was occasioned by the pressure and accumulation backwards of the river water. Lord Mansfield said, a distinction between the case of the tide occasioned by the flux of seawater or by the pressure backwards of the fresh water of a river, seemed entirely new.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">We think that although the current in the Mississippi, at New Orleans, may be so strong as not to be turned,backwards by the tide; yet if the effect of the tide upon the current is so great as to occasion a regular rise and fail of the water, it may properly be said to be within the ebb and flow of the tide.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">It has been argued on the part of the appellant, that the evidence shows that this steamboat was to be employed in navigating waters beyond the ebb and flow of the tide, and therefore not employed in the maritime service. In the case of the steamboat Jefferson, the court said, there is no doubt the juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>diction exists, although the commencement or termination of the voyage may .happen to be at some place beyond, the reach of the tide. The material consideration is, whether the service is essentially a maritime service, and to be performed substantially on the sea or on tide water. All the service in the caise now before the court was at New Orleans; and the first voyage, at all events, was to commence from'that port The objectiop, therefore, to the jurisdiction of the. court cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><em>2. </em>The second exception is founded on a supposed waiver of any privilege or lien, and that the appellees trusted alone to the personal responsibility of the owners of the steamboats</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">To determine this question, it becomes necessary to look at the contracts, .under which the repairs were made..</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The first bears date bn the 11th of September 1830, by which certain specified repairs were to be made, for which the appellants stipulated to pay one thousand five hundred dollars. No time is fixed for the payment. The repairs contemplated by this. contract were such only as could be made without hauling up the boat. In the progress of the work, however, it was discovered that more repairs were necessary than had b\u00e9en supposed, and which could not be made without hauling up the boat. And on the 19 th of October 1830, another contract was entered into, by which the owners agreed to pay four hundred and seventy-five dollars for hauling up the boat, two hundred dollars of which was to be paid in cash, and the balance in one month after the boat shall be launched and set afloat. The boat was then to be repaired under the instruction of Captain Jarreau, the work to be paid for when the account shall be approved by Captain Jarreau. The boat to be repaired and delivered afloat by the 30th of November, ready to receive a cargo; the appellees were to allow twenty-five dollars a day for each day <em>they retarded </em>the delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">An express contract having been entered into between the parties under which these repairs were made is no waiver of the lien, unless such contract contains stipulations inconsistent with the lien, and from which it may fairly be inferred that a waiver was intended, and the personal responsibility of the party only relied upon. Express contracts are generally made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>for freight and seamen\u2019s wages,- but this.has never b'een.supposed to operate as a waiyer of a lien on the v\u00e9ssel- for the same. There are certainly some of the older authorities which would seem to give countenance to-the doctrine that an express contract operated as a waiver of-, the Hen; but whatever, -may have been, the old vide on the subject, it is settled at the present day, that an-express contract, for a specific, sum'is not of itself a waiver of the lien,.but that to produce -that effect, the contract must contain -some, stipulations .-inconsistent with the - continuance of-such lien, or.from-which a waiyer may fairly be inferred.- Hutton v. Bragg, 2 Marshall, '339.;. 4 Camp. -145,'and the cases cited in note. - ' . .</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Applying these rul\u00e9s to the case before us, we can -discpver nothing (except as to' two. hundred and seventy-five' dollars, the balance for hauling-out the boat,- which will be noticed hereafter), inconsistent with the right of a lien, or. indicating any intention to waive it. In the first contract no time is fixed .for the payment of the one thousand five hundred dollars; it became payable, therefore, as soon as the work was completed. And the repairs under the sepond contract were tq.be paid for as soon as the account was approved by Captain Jarreau. There is nothing, therefore, from which it can be inferred-that any.time of credit.was .to be -allowed:. The- balance of-two hundred and-seventy-five dollars, for hauling out the steamboat, stands upon a footing a little different. That was to be paid in one month after the boat was launched and set afloat. A credit was here given;- and a credit too beyond the time when, in. all probability,- the boat would have left the port of New Orleans; for it can hardly be supposed that -it would have taken thirty, days to load her. And by the Civil Code of Louisiana, Art. 2748, the privilege ceases' if the ship or-boat is allowed to depart without exercising, the right:</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">As to this sum, therefore, the decree is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">3. The principal ground of complaint under the third point made at the bar is, that the appellants have been made to pay twice for some part of the work. That .is, that part of the work which was to be done under the first Contract, and for which thev were to pay one thousand five hundred dollars, has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>..been charged under the second contract; There is certainly some confusion growing but of the manner in which this work w as' carried on under the different contracts. The work which was to be performed under the first, was not completed when tire second was entered into, and both being carried on at the same time, might very easily occasion some mistake. And in addition to .this, there was, under the first contract, some extra work to be done and paid for over and above the stipulated sum of one thousand five hundred dollars, which rendered it still more difficult to keep the accounts for materials and labour under the different contracts, separate and distinct. The evidence was taken in writing out of court, and no opportunity afforded for explanation upon these points. The district judge, feeling the difficulties .growing out of these circumstances, ordered Wilson, one of the witnesses whose deposition had been taken and read in evidence, to appear, and answer in open court. He was the lerk of the appellees, who-had kept an account of the timber used and work performed; arid on his examination he' swore that all the charges and items for work done, in the account-qf the libellants, were over and above the work done under the, first; contract for one thousand five hundred, dollars. That, the libellants had hands at Work at the repairs under the contract and the extra work at the same time; That there is not a day\u2019s work nor \u00e1 foot of plank charged in the account which was to-be done under the first contract. This testimony leaves no reasonable doubt of the correctness of the account. By the second contract,'payment was to be made when the account vyas-approved by. Captain Jarreau no formal approval appears to have been made. But hewas a part owner,-arid'superintended the repairs; and one of the Witnesses .says'he' was present when the account was presented to Captahl .Tarr\u00e9au, who. said he was not surprised at-it, because there was .a great deal.; more work than he had any idea of and that he did noi think at first that she required so much.
