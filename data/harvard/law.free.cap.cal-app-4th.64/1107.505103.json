The People, however, urge us to accept the trial court\u2019s rationale the evidence was admitted for the nonhearsay purpose of \u201cshowing [Officer Mundy\u2019s] good faith or the reasonableness of his conduct.\u201d In support of this argument, the People cite <em>People </em>v. <em>King </em>(1956) 140 Cal.App.2d 1, 4-5 [294 P.2d 972] which upheld the introduction of statements made to an officer by a confidential informant on the ground the statements were admitted for the nonhearsay purpose of establishing \u201creasonable cause to justify an arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-14\">The problem with the People\u2019s argument is that even if the witness\u2019s statement to Officer Mundy was offered for a nonhearsay purpose it still had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>to be <em>relevant </em>to be admissible. As the court explained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Reyes </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 53, 67-68 [132 Cal.Rptr. 848], . . the principle set forth in <em>King </em>is not applicable [if] the legality of defendant\u2019s arrest was not in issue.\u201d In the present case, as in <em>Reyes, </em>the jury was not asked to determine whether the police had probable cause to arrest Lucero. Therefore, the witness\u2019s statement to Mundy about the suspect stepping on the counter was simply irrelevant for the nonhearsay purpose offered because it had no tendency in reason to prove any disputed issue of fact in the action. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 210; <em>Reyes, supra, </em>62 Cal.App.3d at p. 68.)</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The trial court\u2019s error in admitting this evidence, however, was harmless. In overruling Lucero\u2019s objection, the court explained the evidence was not being admitted for the truth of the matter asserted but \u201csimply ... to explain the subsequent conduct of the officer and for that limited purpose it may be received.\u201d Furthermore, there was other evidence linking Lucero to the Quality Burgers robbery. When driven to the trailer park immediately after the robbery, Rufo Casterjon told police he was 80 percent sure Lucero was the robber. When Lucero and Maldonado were first taken into custody, Officer Spencer heard Lucero trying to pass a fabricated story to Maldonado. The robber wore a dark-colored hat and displayed a gun. A dark-colored hat and gun were found in Lucero\u2019s Cadillac when he was arrested. The robber took approximately $158 from Quality Burgers. Maldonado had $144 on her at the time of her arrest and Spencer found approximately $14 of liquor in the car. Lucero\u2019s arrival at the trailer park neatly fit the amount of time it would take to drive there from Quality Burgers with a short stop to buy beer and wine. Viewed in this light, the shoe print evidence was not the critical evidence linking Lucero to the robberies, as Lucero claims. Indeed, the prosecutor did not even mention the shoe print evidence in his initial closing argument and only referred to it briefly in rebuttal to Lucero\u2019s closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">B. <em>Officer Spencer\u2019s Lay Opinion the Sole of Lucero\u2019s Shoe Appeared the Same as the Shoe Print on the Counter Was Admissible.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">Again over Lucero\u2019s objection, Officer Spencer was allowed to testify he compared the soles of the shoes Lucero was wearing when he was arrested with the shoe print on the counter at Quality Burgers and, in his opinion, they appeared to be the same. Spencer pointed out to the jury the characteristics of the shoes and the shoe print which led him to this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">Evidence Code section 800 provides: \u201cIf a witness is not testifying as an expert, his testimony in the form of an opinion is limited to such an opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>as is permitted by law, including but not limited to an opinion that is: flO (a) Rationally based on the perception of the witness; and flQ (b) Helpful to a clear understanding of his testimony.\u201d It is undisputed Officer Spencer is not an expert in shoe print comparison.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">No reported California case has addressed the question whether a layperson can testify to an opinion based on comparison of a shoe and a shoe print. It appears however the courts in other states which have considered this question have all held such testimony is admissible. (E.g., <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State </em>(1996) 323 Ark. 529 [915 S.W.2d 284, 295]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jeter </em>(La.Ct.App. 1992) 609 So.2d 1019, 1022-1023; <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1990) 120 N.J. 263 [576 A.2d 834, 850-851]; <em>Halbig </em>v. <em>State </em>(Ind: 1988) 525 N.E.2d 288, 291.) Furthermore, even if the testimony should have been excluded, the error was harmless for the reasons explained above.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">II.-IV.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">Lillie, P.
