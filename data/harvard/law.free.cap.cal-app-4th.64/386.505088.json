Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 470) and possession of a completed check with the intent to defraud. (\u00a7 475a.) He was also found to have served four prior prison terms (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)) and to have previously been convicted of four serious felonies. (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(d).) In the published portion of the opinion, we discuss whether the trial judge had a duty to impose or strike an additional prior prison term enhancement. We affirm in part and reverse in part with directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">A. <em>Prior Prison Term Enhancement Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">The Attorney General argues that the trial court erred in failing to impose a one-year prior prison term enhancement pursuant to section 667.5, subdivision (b), with respect to the defendant\u2019s prior prison term in People v. Bradley (Super. Ct. L.A. County, No. A588238). At the time of sentencing the trial court orally imposed three of the four prior prison term enhancements found to be true by the jury. However, the trial judge never indicated her disposition as to the prior prison term served beginning in 1981 in People v. Bradley (Super. Ct. L.A. County, No. A588238.)</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">As will be noted, we conclude in the published portion of this opinion: To neither strike nor impose a prior prison term enhancement is a legally unauthorized sentence; the power to strike a prior prison term enhancement pursuant to section 1385, subdivision (a) survived the adoption of sections 667, subdivisions (b) through (i) and 1170.12; effective January 1, 1998, there is no longer the authority to strike a prior prison term pursuant to former section 1170.1, subdivision (h); and remand is appropriate for the trial court to exercise discretion pursuant to section 1385, subdivision (a) as to the prior prison term resulting from No. A588238.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">1. <em>The Unauthorized Sentence Issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">The trial court had a duty to impose sentence in accord with the law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cattaneo </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1577, 1588-1589 [266 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>710]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Floyd P. </em>(1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 608, 612 [244 Cal.Rptr. 269]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Himmelsbach) </em>(1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 524, 537 [230 Cal.Rptr. 890], disapproved on another point in <em>People </em>v. <em>Norrell </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 1, 7, fn. 3 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 429, 913 P.2d 458]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Santana </em>(1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 185, 191-192 [227 Cal.Rptr. 51].) The failure to impose or strike an enhancement is a legally unauthorized sentence subject to correction for the first time on appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Irvin </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 180, 190 [281 Cal.Rptr. 195]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Mustafaa </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1311 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 172].) No doubt, section 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancements are subject to the exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion to strike pursuant to section 1385, subdivision (a). <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 206, 209-210 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 174, 841 P.2d 159] [\u201c. . . the power to dismiss an \u2018action\u2019 under section 1385 includes the power to dismiss or strike an enhancement\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Santana, supra, </em>182 Cal.App.3d at pp. 190-191, fn. 6; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sutton </em>(1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 438, 445-446 [209 Cal.Rptr. 536], disapproved on another point in <em>People </em>v. <em>Equarte </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 456, 465, fn. 12 [229 Cal.Rptr. 116, 722 P.2d 890].) If a trial judge exercises the power to strike pursuant to section 1385, subdivision (a), the reasons for the exercise of discretion must be set forth in writing in the minutes. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Romero) (1996) 13 Cal.4th 497, 531-532 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 789, 917 P.2d 628]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Orin </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 937, 945 [120 Cal.Rptr. 65, 533 P.2d 193].)  Further, at the time defendant was sentenced, on February 25, 1997, the trial court had the power to strike the prior prison term enhancements pursuant to former section 1170.1, subdivision (h). (Repealed by Stats. 1997, ch. 750, \u00a7 3.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n                   However, in order to strike an enhancement, former section 1170.1, subdivision (h) required that mitigating circumstances be set forth on the record. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jordan </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 308, 318 [228 Cal.Rptr. 197, 721 P.2d 79]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Alexander </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 602, 605 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 450].)</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In the present case, the trial judge never struck the prior prison term enhancement arising from case No. A588238 either pursuant to section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>1385, subdivision (a) or former section 1170.1, subdivision (h). As to section 1385, subdivision (a), the minutes contain no statement of reasons as to why judicial leniency would be in the interests of justice. Hence, the absence of any statement in the minutes means no section 1385, subdivision (a) order striking the prior prison term enhancements was issued. Citing its prior decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Orin, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d at page 944, the Supreme Court in <em>Romero </em>held: \u201c <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201c[I]f the reasons are not set forth in the minutes, the order dismissing may not be considered a dismissal under section 1385.\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Romero), supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 532.) Moreover, the trial court never orally stated it was dismissing or striking the prior prison term enhancements in People v. Bradley (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 1988, No. A712091) and People v. Bradley (Super. Ct. Amador County, 1989, No. 15995). No dismissal under section 1385, subdivision (a) occurred in this case as to the prior prison term enhancement resulting from No. A588238. Further, no order striking the prior prison term enhancement pursuant to former section 1170.1, subdivision (h) occurred either. Not only did the trial court never purport to do so, but there was no on-the-record statement of mitigating circumstances as required by former section 1170.1, subdivision (h). Hence, the refusal to sentence was legally unauthorized <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dotson </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 547, 554, fn. 6 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 423, 941 P.2d 56]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 331, 354 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 627, 885 P.2d 1040]) and depending on the circumstances, the Attorney General is correct insofar as it is contended that limited resentencing may be in order concerning the prior prison term enhancement resulting from No. A588238. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Irvin, supra, </em>230 Cal.App.3d at p. 193 [remand to permit trial judge to strike or impose a prior prison term enhancement]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cattaneo, supra, </em>217 Cal.App.3d at p. 1589 [remand to permit trial judge to strike or impose drug enhancement pursuant to Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11370.4].)</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">2. <em>The Power to Strike Pursuant to Section 1385, Subdivision (a)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The Attorney General argues that the trial judge must impose sentence as to the remaining prior prison term enhancement pursuant to section 667.5, subdivision (b). We agree with defendant that the trial court may, on remand, determine whether to strike the remaining prior prison term enhancement arising from No. A588238 pursuant to section 1385, subdivision (a). Defendant stands convicted of a single count of forgery<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the trial court has declined to impose a section 667.5, subdivision (b) enhancement. The Attorney General argues that since enhancements must run consecutively pursuant to sections 667, subdivision (e)(2), and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2) we may not remand to allow the trial judge to exercise her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>discretion to strike the remaining prior prison term enhancement arising from No. A588238.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The Attorney General\u2019s argument is as follows. Section 667, subdivision (e)(2) states in pertinent part: \u201c(e) For purposes of subdivisions (b) to (i), inclusive, and in addition to any other enhancement or punishment provisions which may apply, the following shall apply where a defendant has a prior felony conviction: HO ... HQ (2)(A) If a defendant has two or more prior felony convictions as defined in subdivision (d) that have been pled and proved, the term for the current felony conviction shall be an indeterminate term of life imprisonment with a minimum term of the indeterminate sentence calculated as the greater of: HO \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 HD (\u00fc) Imprisonment in the state prison for 25 years. HQ ... HO (B) The indeterminate term described in subparagraph (A) shall be served consecutive to any other term of imprisonment for which a consecutive term may be imposed by law.\u201d The same language appears in section 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The Attorney General argues that the foregoing language has been interpreted in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hendrix </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 508, 515 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 431, 941 P.2d 64], as follows when the Supreme Court was discussing the scope of consecutive sentencing duties in cases involving recidivists with two or more prior serious felony convictions: \u201cWe conclude the phrase \u2018[a]ny other term\u2019 in subdivision (e)(2)(B) refers back to the language of subdivision (e), which provides that the three-strike punishment is \u2018in addition to any other enhancement or punishment provisions which may apply.\u2019 Thus, when subdivision (e)(2)(B) states, \u2018The indeterminate term described in subparagraph (A) shall be served consecutive to any other term of imprisonment for which a consecutive term may be imposed by law,\u2019 it merely provides that the indeterminate term must be imposed consecutive to any other term, such as a term of enhancement. It is not referring to the term for a different current felony conviction.\u201d (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Newsome </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 902, 913 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 438].) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Dotson, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at pages 554-555, while discussing section 667, subdivision (a) five-year enhancements, the Supreme Court held: \u201cWe begin with the language of the statute. Subdivision (c) provides that the indeterminate life term must be imposed \u2018in addition to any other enhancements or punishment provisions which may apply.\u2019 This language clearly prescribes that terms of enhancement, including the five-year enhancement under section 667(a), be imposed in addition to the indeterminate term. \u2018It is difficult to interpret the language of the statute in any other manner.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ramirez </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 559, 568 . . . ; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Nelson </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 131, 136 . . . [second strike; \u2018Section 667 thus requires the doubling of the base term when there is a prior serious felony, and since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>such sentence is to be \u201cin addition to any other enhancement,\u201d also requires the addition of five years for any section 667, subdivision (a)(1) enhancement.\u2019]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cartwright </em>(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1123, 1138-1139 . . . [third strike, option (ii); \u2018. . . Legislature intended a defendant\u2019s sentence under the three strikes law should include a doubled term or life term, as appropriate under section 667, subdivision (e), plus an enhancement under section 667, subdivision (a) for each prior serious felony conviction.\u2019].) fl[| In addition, subdivision (c)(2)(B) provides in part that \u2018[t]he indeterminate term described in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) of this subdivision shall be served consecutive to any other term of imprisonment for which a consecutive term may be imposed by law.\u2019 We have recently construed the language \u2018any other term\u2019 in section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(B) (which is virtually identical to subdivision (c)(2)(B)), to refer to a term other than the sentence for the current offense, such as a term of enhancement or other punishment provision. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hendrix[, supra,] </em>16 Cal. 4th [at p.] 515 . . . .)\u201d (Accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Newsome, supra, </em>57 Cal.App.4th at p. 914.) Hence, the Attorney General concludes that section 667, subdivision (e)(2) as interpreted in <em>Hendrix </em>and <em>Dotson </em>requires consecutive sentencing for all enhancements and, as a result, the power to strike under section 1385, subdivision (a) has been abrogated when the defendant has been twice previously convicted of a serious felony. We disagree insofar as section 667.5, subdivision (b) prior prison term enhancements are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">To begin with, there is no evidence the Legislature in enacting section 667, subdivisions (b) through (i) or the voters in adopting Proposition 184, which promulgated section 1170.12, intended to abrogate the power to strike a prior prison term pursuant to section 1385, subdivision (a). In <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Romero), supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at page 518, the Supreme Court held: \u201c[T]he judicial power to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence by striking a sentencing allegation in furtherance of justice is statutory. Because the power is statutory, the Legislature may eliminate it. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 210-211; <em>People </em>v. <em>Valencia </em>[(1989)] 207 Cal.App.3d [1042,] 1045 [225 Cal.Rptr. 180].) To do so, the Legislature need not expressly refer to section 1385. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at p. 211.) This does not mean, however, that any statute defining the punishment for a crime can be read as implicitly eliminating the court\u2019s power to impose a lesser punishment by dismissing, or by striking sentencing allegations, under section 1385. This is because the statutory power to dismiss in furtherance of justice has always coexisted with statutes defining punishment and must be reconciled with the latter. (See Stats. 1850, ch. 119, \u00a7 629, p. 323.) For this reason, we will not interpret a statute as eliminating courts\u2019 power under section 1385 \u2018absent a clear legislative direction to the contrary.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at p. 210; see also <em>People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number><em>Rodriguez </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 1005, 1019 . . . [section 1385 is inapplicable in the face of a \u2018more specific proscription on the court\u2019s power\u2019]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fritz </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 227, 230 . . . [requiring \u2018clear language eliminating a trial court\u2019s section 1385 authority whenever such elimination is intended\u2019]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 470, 482 . . . [\u2018Section 1385 permits dismissals in the interest of justice in any situation where the Legislature has not clearly evidenced a contrary intent.\u2019].)\u201d  Under the authority of <em>Romero, </em>sections 667, subdivision (e)(2) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2) may not be construed to abrogate the section 1385, subdivision (a) discretion to strike a prior prison term enhancement in the absence of clear language indicating such was intended by the Legislature or the voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">There is no evidence the Legislature intended to abrogate the power to strike a section 667.5 enhancement pursuant to section 1385, subdivision (a). This is demonstrated in material part by the <em>Romero </em>decision itself which held that the Legislature did not intend to abrogate the power to dismiss section 667 prior serious felony convictions. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Alvarez) </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 968, 974 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 93, 928 P.2d 1171]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Romero), supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at pp. 518-530.) There is likewise no evidence the Legislature intended to abrogate the power to strike pursuant to section 1385, subdivision (a), a section 667.5, subdivision (b) prior prison term enhancement either. Nothing in the statutory language indicates such nor does the legislative history of section 667, subdivisions (b) through (i).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude a trial judge retains the section 1385, subdivision (a) power to strike a section 667.5, subdivision (b) prior prison term enhancement. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 656, 669 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 776] [\u201cThere is nothing in the \u2018Three Strikes\u2019 law or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>any other called to our attention that prohibits a trial court from striking this enhancement, so long as it does so pursuant to section 1170.1, subdivision</p>\n<p id=\"Aj\">Further, neither <em>Hendrix </em>nor <em>Dotson </em>purports to discuss a trial judge\u2019s power to strike a section 667.5, subdivision (b) prior prison term enhancement pursuant to section 1385, subdivision (a). <em>Hendrix </em>involved consecutive sentencing for crimes committed by a recidivist on a single occasion. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hendrix, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at pp. 510-511, 515.) The issue in <em>Dotson </em>involved a legally unauthorized sentence, the failure of a trial judge to impose a nonstrikeable enhancement, one pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a). <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dotson, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at pp. 554-555.) The Supreme Court has repeatedly reminded this state\u2019s lawyers and judges that its opinions are not authority for propositions not considered in its decisions. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Scheid </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 1, 17 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 348, 939 P.2d 748]; <em>Amwest Surety Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 1243, 1268 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 12, 906 P.2d 1112]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Banks </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 926, 945 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 524, 863 P.2d 769]; <em>Ginns </em>v. <em>Savage </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 520, 524, fn. 2 [39 Cal.Rptr. 377, 393 P.2d 689].) The present case involves a strikeable section 667.5, subdivision (b) prior prison term enhancements and neither <em>Hendrix </em>nor <em>Dotson </em>discusses that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">3. <em>The Effect of the Repeal of Section 1170.1, Subdivision (h)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The question of whether on remand defendant is entitled to have the trial judge also exercise discretion pursuant to former section 1170.1, subdivision (h) is a much closer and more difficult issue than the issue concerning section 1385, subdivision (a). As noted previously, former section 1170.1, subdivision (h) has been repealed. <em>(Ante, </em>at p. 391.) There are two issues raised by this state of affairs. The first issue is whether on remand the repeal may be applied to defendant, whose criminal conduct and sentencing preceded that legislative decision. This raises questions of the retroactive application of the law as limited by section 3. The second question is whether denying defendant on remand the benefit of former section 1170.1, subdivision (h) when his criminal conduct occurred prior to the repeal of that statutory provision constitutes an unconstitutional ex post facto application of the law. (U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 3; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 9.) Neither the statutory nor constitutional answers to these questions favor defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The first issue is one of statutory construction. Section 3 provides with respect to the Penal Code: \u201cNot Retroactive. [^] No part of it is retroactive, unless expressly so declared.\u201d As a general rule, criminal statutes are therefore applied prospectively only, in the absence of a legislative intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>the contrary. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Teron </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 103, 116-117 [151 Cal.Rptr. 633, 588 P.2d 773], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Chadd </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 739, 750, fn. 7 [170 Cal.Rptr. 798, 621 P.2d 837]; <em>Sekt </em>v. <em>Justice\u2019s Court </em>(1945) 26 Cal.2d 297, 299-310 [159 P.2d 17, 167 A.L.R. 833]; 1 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (2d ed. 1988) Introduction to Crimes, \u00a737, p. 46.) The argument that favors defendant is that the abrogation of former section 1170.1, subdivision (h) cannot be retroactively applied to him because he committed his criminal conduct prior to January 1, 1998, the effective date of the repeal. However, former section 1170.1, subdivision (h) was a remedial statute designed to allow a trial court to ameliorate the effects of a potentially excessive sentence by striking certain enhancements in the face of mitigating circumstances. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at p. 211; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jordan, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 314.) The repeal of a statute which provides a remedy to a party is fully prospective and applies to pending actions. <em>(Tapia </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 282, 288-291 [279 Cal.Rptr. 592, 807 P.2d 434] [voter-approved statutes changing criminal trial and discovery procedures apply to future conduct in a trial court even though criminal conduct occurred prior to adoption of Proposition 115]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Acosta </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 411, 416-420 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 675] [repeal of the right to raise issues in an appellate court concerning presentence credits applied to an appeal arising after the effective date of section 1237.1].)  The Supreme Court has noted specifically in the context of the repeal of a statute which affects appellate remedies in <em>Southern Service Co., Ltd. </em>v. <em>Los Angeles </em>(1940) 15 Cal.2d 1, 12 [97 P.2d 963] as follows: \u201c \u2018The unconditional repeal of a special remedial statute without a saving clause stops all pending actions where the repeal finds them. If final relief has not been granted before the repeal goes into effect it cannot be granted afterwards, even if a judgment has been entered and the cause is pending on appeal. <em>The reviewing court must dispose of the case under the law in force when its decision is </em>rendered\u201d (Italics added; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Acosta, supra, </em>48 Cal.App.4th at p. 419; <em>Beckman </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 481, 489 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 60]; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Farr </em>(1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 1021, 1024 [183 Cal.Rptr. 606]; <em>Department of Social Welfare </em>v. <em>Wingo </em>(1946) 77 Cal.App.2d 316, 320 [175 P.2d 262]; Gov. Code, \u00a7 9606.)  As a result, section 3 does not require us to remand the present case to permit the trial judge to exercise her discretion pursuant to a repealed statute, former section 1170.1, subdivision (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The next question in terms of what may occur on remand is whether ex post facto principles prohibit denying defendant the opportunity to reduce his sentence pursuant to former section 1170.1, subdivision (h). (7) The California Supreme Court has held that ex post facto principles apply to a statute which does the following: \u201cIn <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Youngblood </em>(1990) 497 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>37 ... , the court endorsed the view of its earlier decisions establishing that the ex post facto clause prohibits three categories of legislative acts: any provision \u2018 \u201c[1] which punishes as a crime an act previously committed, which was innocent when done; [2] which makes more burdensome the punishment for a crime, after its commission^] or [3] which deprives one charged with crime of any defense available according to law at the time when the act was committed <em>(Id. </em>at p. 42 . . . , quoting <em>Beazell </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1925) 269 U.S. 167, 169 ... ; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>McVickers </em>[(1992)] 4 Cal.4th [81,] 84 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 850, 840 P.2d 955].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Snook </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 1210, 1220-1221 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 615, 947 P.2d 808].) The California Supreme Court has noted that the scope of the ex post facto clauses has been simplified in terms of punishment by <em>Beazell </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1925) 269 U.S. 167, 169-170 [46 S.Ct. 68-69, 70 L.Ed. 216] and <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Youngblood </em>(1990) 497 U.S. 37, 43 [110 S.Ct. 2715, 2719-2720, 111 L.Ed.2d 30], in the following manner: \u201cBut <em>Collins </em>explained that the third prong of Beazell\u2019s formulation is \u2018linked to the prohibition on alterations in \u201cthe legal definition of the offense\u201d or \u201cthe nature or amount of the punishment imposed for its commission.\u201d \u2019 <em>([Collins </em>v. <em>Youngblood, supra,] </em>497 U.S. at p. 50 ... , quoting Beazell.) Hence <em>Collins </em>was able to simplify <em>Beazell, </em>and summarized: \u2018Legislatures may not retroactively alter the definition of crimes or increase the punishment for criminal acts.\u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 43 . . . .)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Helms </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 608, 614 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 620, 936 P.2d 1230].) In <em>Snook, </em>the California Supreme Court identified the purpose of the ex post facto protection as follows: \u201cOur conclusion is fully consistent with one of the primary purposes of the ex post facto clause: to prevent unforeseeable punishment. \u2018Critical to relief under the Ex Post Facto Clause is not an individual\u2019s right to less punishment, but the lack of fair notice and governmental restraint when the legislature increases punishment beyond what was prescribed when the crime was consummated.\u2019 <em>(Weaver </em>v. <em>Graham </em>(1981) 450 U.S. 24, 30 . . . .)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Snook, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 1221.)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The only potentially applicable aspect of ex post facto protection in the present case is that which relates to an increase in punishment. The repeal of former section 1170.1, subdivision (h) did not increase the punishment for a prior prison term pursuant to section 667.5, subdivision (b)\u2014it was one year in the state penitentiary before January 1, 1998, the effective date of Senate Bill No. 721, and it is the same today. Post<em>-Tapia </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at pages 292-297 decisions are in accord with our analysis. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Helms, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at pp. 612-617 [requirement of sections 667, subdivision (e)(2)(B) and 1170.12, subdivision (c)(2) that a sentence be served consecutively to a prior offense for which probation was granted not an \u201cincrease in punishment\u201d for ex post facto purposes]; <em>People </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>v. <em>McVickers </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 81, 84-90 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 850, 840 P.2d 955] [retroactive requirement that sex offender undergo testing for acquired immune deficiency disease not an ex post facto violation]; <em>Tapia </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>53 Cal.3d at pp. 299-300 [no ex post facto violation when wide ranging provisions of Proposition 115 retroactively applied]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fioretti </em>(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 1209, 1213 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 367] [change in registration requirements for sex offenders in section 290.1 may apply to a defendant who committed his underlying criminal offense prior to effective date of new legal duties applicable to registrants]; <em>In re Arafiles </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1467, 1481-1488 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 492] [grant of power in article V, section 8 of the California Constitution to the Governor to review parole decisions may be applied to a defendant who committed his homicide prior to the adoption of the constitutional amendment].)</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Further, our decision in this regard is consistent with the United States Supreme Court holding in <em>California Dept. of Corrections </em>v. <em>Morales </em>(1995) 514 U.S. 499, 502-507 [115 S.Ct. 1597, 1599-1602, 131 L.Ed.2d 588], In <em>Morales, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that a California statute amending board of prison terms procedures to decrease the frequency of parole suitability hearings under certain circumstances did not violate the federal ex post facto clause as applied to a prisoner who was convicted prior to the amendment. The United States Court held: \u201cThe amendment creates only the most speculative and attenuated possibility of producing the prohibited effect of increasing the measure of punishment for covered crimes, and such conjectural effects are insufficient under any threshold we might establish under the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause. See <em>Dobbert </em>[v. <em>Florida </em>(1977) 432 U.S. 282, 294 [97 S.Ct. 2290, 2298-2299, 53 L.Ed.2d 344]] (refusing to accept \u2018speculation\u2019 that the effective punishment under a new statutory scheme would be \u2018more onerous\u2019 than under the old one).\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 509-510 [115 S.Ct. at p. 1603], fn. omitted.) The same is true here. The California Supreme Court has held that there is virtually no difference between orders granting judicial leniency pursuant to section 1385, subdivision (a) and former section 1170.1, subdivision (h). In <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th at page 212, when confronted with the question of the differences between a dismissal pursuant to section 1385, subdivision (a) and an order striking an enhancement in compliance with former section 1170.1, subdivision (h), the California Supreme Court held after a lengthy analysis of the two provisions in the context of firearm use findings: \u201cDefendant suggests that the \u2018furtherance of justice\u2019 standard is broader than the \u2018circumstances in mitigation\u2019 standard, and would include consideration of matters extrinsic to the offense and the offender, such as protection of the public interest. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Orin </em>[,supra,] 13 Cal.3d [at p.] 944 . . . .) Although the public interest may well favor <em>enhancing </em>a defendant\u2019s sentence by reason of his firearm use, it would be quite rare when the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>interest, but not \u2018circumstances in mitigation,\u2019 would justify <em>striking </em>such an enhancement. (Such cases seemingly would be limited to situations wherein the [People] seek to strike an enhancement to enable them to rely on the defendant\u2019s gun use as an aggravating sentencing factor.) In most cases, if the public interest favors such relief, that fact readily could be deemed a \u2018circumstance in mitigation of the additional punishment.\u2019 (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Marsh </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 134, 145, fn. 8 . . . [noting for purposes of remand that striking enhancements may be justified under section 1385 by number of \u2018mitigating circumstances\u2019 in case].) RQ In short, we believe that, at least in the context of striking firearm use enhancements, the two standards are essentially identical.\u201d (4 Cal.4th at p. 212, italics in original; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Luckett </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1218 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 37].) The same is true in this case in terms of the prior prison term enhancement. There is no constitutionally relevant detriment to defendant, given the similarity in the application of the two provisions of law which permit judicial leniency in the face of the interests of justice or the presence of mitigating circumstances. More critically, it is speculative to suggest otherwise, particularly given the fact that defendant has a lengthy record of violent criminal conduct. On remand, the trial judge is to either impose the prior prison term enhancement or strike it pursuant to section 1385, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> No action may be taken pursuant to the repealed provisions of section-1170.1, subdivision (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">4.-7.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">B.-H.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">III.

This uncodified provision of Senate Bill No. 721 is consistent with legislative committee reports prepared in connection with Senate Bill No. 721 which indicated that the section 1385, subdivision (a) power to strike was retained notwithstanding the repeal of section 1170.1, subdivision (h).
