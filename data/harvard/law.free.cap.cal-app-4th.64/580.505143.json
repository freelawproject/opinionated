J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQi\">The appeals in these consolidated cases present the question of what remedy is available to the Director of the Department of Health Services (Department) when the personal representative of a decedent\u2019s estate falsely represents to the probate court that the decedent did not receive Medi-Cal benefits and notice to the Department is not required, thereby depriving the Department of its opportunity to file a claim against the estate. The Department contends it is entitled to recover from the personal representative or the surety that posted the bond guaranteeing her faithful performance of her duties to the estate, as her perpetration of extrinsic fraud upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>the court constituted a failure to faithfully discharge her duties. The surety maintains the Department is limited to a statutorily provided remedy of recovery from the distributees of the estate. The two trial courts below reached conflicting results. In Estate of Starkweather, Superior Court of Alameda County, 1997, No. 2452661 (A078754), the Alameda County trial court granted the Department\u2019s petition to set aside the final accounting and distribution of the estate and surcharge the personal representative, and the surety appeals. In Belsh\u00e9 v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., Superior Court of Contra Costa County, 1997, No. C96-03500 (A078996), the Contra Costa County trial court dismissed the Department\u2019s action to enforce its claim and recover on the personal representative\u2019s bond, and the Department appealed. We conclude the Alameda court\u2019s decision was correct, affirm that judgment and reverse the judgment of the Contra Costa court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Statement of the Case and Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">In 1994, Darlene Phillips was appointed the personal representative of the estate of Louella Starkweather in a probate proceeding in Alameda County. Phillips caused to be filed a qualifying bond in the amount of $160,000, with United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Company (Fidelity) as surety, guaranteeing her faithful execution of her duties as administrator of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">On April 6, 1995, Phillips filed her first and final account and report of administrator and petition for settlement, allowance of fees and distribution. Phillips stated, among other things, that the decedent had not received Medi-Cal and, therefore, notice to the Department under Probate Code section 9202 was not required. The total value of the estate, as received by Phillips from the decedent\u2019s conservator, was reported to be $145,528.21. On May 12, 1995, the court entered its order settling the final account, ordering that the estate (then consisting of approximately $116,300 cash) be distributed in equal shares to Phillips and her brother, the decedent\u2019s grandchildren.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">On September 12, 1996, the Department filed in the Contra Costa Superior Court a first amended complaint to enforce a Medi-Cal creditor\u2019s claim and recover on the probate guaranty bond. The complaint alleged the Department was entitled under Welfare and Institutions Code section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>14009.5 to reimbursement for Medi-Cal benefits received by certain decedents; the personal representative or estate attorney was required by Probate Code sections 9201 and 9202 to provide notice of the decedent\u2019s death to the Department if the personal representative knew or had reason to believe the decedent had received Medi-Cal benefits; Louella Starkweather received Medi-Cal benefits of $137,997.48 between approximately May 2, 1974, and April 30, 1992; Phillips was appointed personal representative and caused to be filed a $160,000 bond; Phillips knew or had reason to know Louella Starkweather had received Medi-Cal benefits but did not give the Department notice of the decedent\u2019s death, resulting in the Department\u2019s failure to file a claim in the probate proceeding and receive payment as required by law; the estate had been distributed, with Phillips receiving one-half the value of approximately $145,528.21; and the Department was entitled to repayment from Phillips and Fidelity, as surety, of $137,997.48, plus interest, based on Phillips\u2019s failure to faithfully execute the duties of her office and was entitled to repayment from Phillips as a distributee of an amount equal to her distribution, plus interest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Fidelity filed a demurrer, arguing the Department\u2019s sole remedy was a claim against the distributees of the estate under Probate Code section 9203. The demurrer was sustained with leave to amend, and on January 31, 1997, the Department filed its second amended complaint. This complaint added allegations that Phillips had fraudulently and falsely represented to the probate court that the decedent had not received Medi-Cal benefits and notice to the Department was not required, in order to keep the Department in ignorance of the proceedings and deceive the court into distributing the estate to Phillips and her brother without notice to the Department. The Department sought repayment from Phillips and Fidelity of $137,997.48 based on Phillips\u2019s failure to faithfully execute her duties as personal representative, and repayment from Phillips, as distributee of the estate, of her share of the distribution plus interest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Fidelity again demurred, urging the Department was limited to a claim against the distributees even with allegations of fraud by the personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>representative.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, agreeing with Fidelity that \u201cProbate Code section 9205 does not sanction recovery by the Department of Health Services against Darlene Phillips as administrator of the decedent\u2019s estate on the ground of fraud. Rather plaintiffs, remedy is limited to recovery from the distributees pursuant to Probate Code section 9203(b).\u201d The court\u2019s order of dismissal was filed on May 12, 1997. The Department filed a timely notice of appeal on June 26, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Meanwhile, in October 1996. the Department had filed in Alameda County Superior Court a petition to surcharge the personal representative and vacate the order of final account and distribution. As in the Contra Costa County action, the petition alleged the Department\u2019s entitlement to reimbursement under Welfare and Institutions Code section 14009.5; the requirement of notice to the Department imposed by Probate Code sections 9201 and 9202; and the receipt by Louella Starkweather of Medi-Cal benefits of $137,997.48 between approximately May 2, 1974, and March 1992. The petition alleged Phillips knew or had reason to know Louella Starkweather had received Medi-Cal benefits, yet informed the probate court notice to the Department was not required because the decedent had not received such benefits;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Phillips never gave notice of the decedent\u2019s death to the Department during the administration of the estate and had she done so, the Department would have filed a claim for $137,997.48, which Phillips would have paid pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 14009.5 or the Department would have been able to enforce through an independent action against Phillips before the final accounting and order of distribution; the May 1995 order distributing the estate was obtained by Phillips\u2019s false representation that the decedent had not received Medi-Cal benefits; that because it was not given notice, the Department was unaware of the probate proceeding and therefore unable to participate in it; and Phillips remained subject to the jurisdiction of the court and surcharge for her failure to carry out her statutory duties as administrator because she had not been discharged from her position as personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The Department also filed the declaration of its collection representative, Keith Parsley. According to this declaration, the Department was notified by the Public Guardian of Alameda County, in a letter dated December 8, 1994, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>that Louella Starkweather had died. This letter indicated the probate or \u201ccase reference\u201d number was H-18608-9. On March 8, 1995, Parsley filed a creditor\u2019s claim for $137,997.48 in Alameda County Superior Court No. H-18608-9. Parsley subsequently learned\u2014after the estate had been distributed^\u2014that H-18608-9 was the number of the conservatorship proceeding rather than the probate proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Fidelity opposed the Department\u2019s petition, arguing Probate Code section 9203 limited the Department\u2019s remedy to making a claim against the distributees of the estate, to the exclusion of equitable remedies for extrinsic fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">On April 18, 1997, the Alameda County trial court filed its judgment setting aside the final accounting and distribution and surcharging the personal representative. The court found Phillips knew at the time of her appointment as personal representative that the decedent had received care and treatment reimbursed by the Medi-Cal program; the Department had a valid claim against the state for $137,997.48; Phillips did not notify the Department of the decedent\u2019s death but willfully represented in the petition for first and final account and request for final distribution that the decedent had not received Medi-Cal benefits, with the intent to mislead the court into approving the final account and ordering a distribution without requiring Phillips to discharge the Department\u2019s claim; and that Phillips had not been discharged as personal representative, having not filed the receipts of distribution as ordered by the court. The court concluded Phillips breached her fiduciary duty towards the estate and was under an obligation to recover for the estate the corpus of the estate in the amount of $137,997.48 to discharge the valid claim of the Department, and therefore it surcharged Phillips in this amount for her failure to faithfully carry out her duties. The court set aside the order of final distribution and awarded the Department $137,997.48 against Phillips in her capacity as personal representative of the estate. Fidelity filed a timely notice of appeal on May 27, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Welfare and Institutions Code section 14009.5 provides, in pertinent part: \u201c(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the department shall claim against the estate of the decedent, or against any recipient of the property of that decedent by distribution or survival in an amount equal to the payments for the health care services received or the value of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>property received by any recipient from the decedent by distribution or survival, whichever is less.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Chapter 5 of part 4 of the Probate Code, \u201cClaims by Public Entities,\u201d consists of sections 9200 through 9205. Probate Code section 9201 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) Notwithstanding any other statute, if a claim of a public entity arises under a law, act, or code listed in subdivision (b): [f] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [1D (2) The claim is barred only after written notice or request to the public entity and expiration of the period provided in the applicable section. If no written notice or request is made, the claim is enforceable by the remedies, and is barred at the time, otherwise provided in the law, act or code.\u201d Subdivision (b) of this statute lists 12 laws, including the Medi-Cal Act, and specifies the \u201capplicable section\u201d for the Medi-Cal Act as section 9202 of the Probate Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Section 9202 of the Probate Code provides: \u201cNot later than 90 days after the date letters are first issued to a general personal representative, the general personal representative or estate attorney shall give the Director of Health Services notice of the decedent\u2019s death in the manner provided in Section 215 if the general personal representative knows or has reason to believe that the decedent received health care under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 14000) or Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 14200) of Part 3 of Division 9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, or was the surviving spouse of a person who received that health care. The director has four months after notice is given in which to file a claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Probate Code section 9203 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) Failure of a person to give the written notice or request required by this chapter does not affect the validity of any proceeding under this code concerning the administration of the decedent\u2019s estate. [IQ (b) <em>If property in the estate is distributed before expiration of the time allowed a public entity to file a claim, the public entity has a claim against the distributees to the full extent of the public entity\u2019s claim, or each distributee\u2019s share of the distributed property, whichever is less. </em>The public entity\u2019s claim against distributees includes interest at a rate equal to that specified in Section 19269 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, from the date of distribution or the date of filing the claim by the public entity, whichever is later, plus other accruing costs as in the case of enforcement of a money judgment.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Fidelity takes the position that the italicized language in Probate Code section 9203, subdivision (b), provides the exclusive remedy available to the Department in a situation where it has not been given notice as required by Probate Code section 9202, even when the failure to give notice amounts to extrinsic fraud. Its position is relatively straightforward. Probate Code section 9203, subdivision (b), expressly posits the circumstance of a failure to give notice and establishes a remedy.  Where a statute creates a new right and provides a remedy, that remedy is exclusive. <em>(Faria </em>v. <em>San Jacinto Unified School Dist. </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1939, 1947 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 72]; <em>Palo Alto-Menlo Park Yellow Cab Co. </em>v. <em>Santa Clara County Transit Dist. </em>(1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 121, 131 [135 Cal.Rptr. 192];)  Statutory provisions imposing liability on the personal representative for bad faith failure to give notice to other types of creditors, coupled with the absence of such provisions for creditors in the Department\u2019s position, indicate the Legislature did not intend to allow the Department resort to an action against the personal representative in a case such as this. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 9053.)  Finally, the Department is not entitled to assert a claim based on the doctrine of extrinsic fraud because of the existence of the statutory remedy, equitable relief being unavailable where there is an adequate remedy at law. <em>(Martin </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 688, 696 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 303].)</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The Department, by contrast, maintains the statutory scheme does not preclude an action against the personal representative for fraud; the statutory remedy against the distributees is inadequate, as Phillips has declared bankruptcy; and it is entitled to recover from Fidelity on' the bond guaranteeing the discharge of duties Phillips breached by her fraud. Although we are unpersuaded by several of the Department\u2019s specific arguments, we will conclude the Department\u2019s remedy on the facts of this case is not limited to that specified in Probate Code section 9203, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">With respect to the statutory scheme, the Department argues that where a chapter 5 public entity is not provided notice, it is specifically authorized to rely upon generally available remedies\u2014such as an action for extrinsic fraud\u2014by Probate Code section 9201, subdivision (a)(2). The Department misreads this statute. As quoted above, Probate Code section 9201, subdivision (a)(2), provides that if the claim of a public entity \u201carises under a law, act or code\u201d listed in subdivision (b), the claim is barred \u201conly after written notice or request to the public entity and expiration of the period provided in the applicable section.\u201d The statute then states, \u201cIf no written notice or request is made, the claim is enforceable by the remedies, and is barred at the time, <em>otherwise provided in the law, act, or code.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Contrary to the Department\u2019s interpretation, by the plain language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>statute the other remedies authorized by Probate Code section 9201, subdivision (a)(2), are not <em>any </em>remedies, but only such remedies as may exist \u201cin the law, act or code\u201d mating the public entity subject to section 9201. In the present case, the relevant law is the Medi-Cal Act, Welfare and Institutions Code section 14000 et seq. The Department does not suggest any provision of the Medi-Cal Act authorizes an action for extrinsic fraud in failing to give notice under Probate Code sections 9201 and 9202. The language of section 9201, subdivision (a)(2), does not suggest all remedies available under the common law are applicable in case of a failure to give notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The Department attempts to bolster its interpretation by reference to Probate Code section 9205, the last provision in chapter 5. Probate Code section 9205 provides: \u201cThis chapter does not apply to liability for the restitution of amounts illegally acquired through the means of a fraudulent, false, or incorrect representation, or a forged or unauthorized endorsement.\u201d According to the Department, it is in the present case seeking \u201crestitution\u201d of the proceeds of the estate wrongfully obtained by Phillips \u201cthrough the means of a fraudulent, false, or incorrect representation.\u201d The Department views Probate Code section 9205 as exempting its action from any provision of chapter 5 that might be read to preclude such actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Fidelity urges Probate Code section 9205 deals not with fraud in the course of a probate proceeding, such as involved here, but with fraud in obtaining or providing benefits. For example, Welfare and Institutions Code section 14014 provides that a person who receives health care for which he or she was not eligible on the basis of false declarations, or who makes false representations on behalf of another person who is not eligible, is liable for repayment and guilty of a misdemeanor or felony (depending on the amount paid). Welfare and Institutions Code section 10980 establishes criminal penalties, including incarceration and fines, for conduct such as willfully and knowingly, with intent to deceive, mating false representations or material omissions, in attempting to obtain welfare benefits, using a false or fictitious identity in applying for benefits, and obtaining benefits by means of false representations or other fraudulent devices.  When a person is convicted of welfare fraud, the government is a \u201cvictim\u201d entitled to restitution. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Crow </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 952, 957 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 864 P.2d 80]; Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (k).)</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Fidelity\u2019s interpretation is the more tenable. The phrase \u201crestitution of amounts illegally acquired\u201d in Probate Code section 9205 suggests reference to restitution under statutes such as those just described. Probate Code section 9200 provides that \u201c[e]xcept as provided in this chapter, a claim by a public entity shall be filed within the time otherwise provided in this part\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>and claims not so filed are barred. Probate Code section 9201, as we have discussed, establishes that claims of a public entity arising under 12 enumerated laws, acts or codes are barred only after written notice or request to the public entity and expiration of the period provided in the applicable section. A review of each of the laws and \u201capplicable section[s]\u201d listed in Probate Code section 9201 reveals that each involves a public entity\u2019s claim for deficiencies arising during the lifetime of a decedent,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for contributions, penalties and interest based on wages paid by a deceased \u201cemploying unit\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or for repayment of costs associated with care of the decedent during his or her lifetime.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, under Probate Code sections 9200 and 9201, only specific types of claims by enumerated public entities are subject to the provisions of chapter 5. Probate Code section 9205 simply clarifies that the provisions of chapter 5 do <em>not </em>apply to claims by these public entities for amounts fraudulently obtained by the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">The Department also contends the remedy stated in subdivision (b) of Probate Code section 9203 applies only if notice <em>is </em>given to the public entity but the estate is distributed before the public entity files its claim. Clearly, Probate Code section 9203, subdivision (b), applies in this situation. We see no basis, however, for finding the statute applies <em>only </em>in cases where notice has been given. Under the statutes at issue, a claim by the Department is not barred unless the Department has been given written notice. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 9201, subd. (a)(2).) When a personal representative fails to give notice, therefore, the time for the Department to file its claim does not expire. It follows that an estate distributed without notice having been given to the Department has necessarily been distributed \u201cbefore expiration of the time allowed a public entity to file a claim.\u201d (Prob. Code, \u00a7 9203, subd. (b).) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Consequently, Probate Code section 9203, subdivision (b), generally prescribes the remedy for the Department in the event an estate is distributed without notice to the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Despite our rejection of the above arguments by the Department, however, we cannot agree with Fidelity that Probate Code section 9203, subdivision (b), provides the <em>exclusive </em>remedy for the Department even in the case of <em>fraudulent </em>failure to give notice. This subject is not expressly addressed in chapter 5. A similar subject <em>is </em>addressed in chapter 2, which deals with notice to creditors not subject to chapter 5. Subdivision (b) of Probate Code section 9053, in chapter 2, provides that the personal representative is not liable to any person for the failure to give notice <em>unless </em>the creditor establishes the failure was in bad faith, neither the creditor nor the creditor\u2019s attorney had actual knowledge of the administration of the estate before expiration of the time for filing a claim, payment would have been made on the claim if it had been properly filed, and the creditor sought an order determining the personal representative\u2019s liability within 16 months after letters were first issued to the personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Fidelity takes the express provision of a remedy against the personal representative in case of a bad faith failure to give notice in chapter 2 to indicate the absence of a similar provision in chapter 5 means the Legislature did not intend such a remedy to be available to the public entities addressed there. The original versions of what are now Probate Code sections 9053 and 9203 were enacted at different times, the former in 1987 (Stats. 1987, ch. 923, \u00a7 93, pp. 3014-3017) and the latter in 1981 (Stats. 1981, ch. 102, \u00a7 74, p. 730 [then Prob. Code, \u00a7 700.1]). Probate Code section 700.1, the predecessor to Probate Code section 9203, was enacted as part of legislation dealing with fiscal matters related to Medi-Cal and various other programs. As originally enacted, the statute included provisions requiring notice to the Department of the death of a Medi-Cal recipient, setting forth the time for the Department to file a claim, allowing for a claim against heirs if an estate has already been distributed and stating the Department would be entitled to interest and accrued costs. (Stats. 1981, ch. 102, \u00a7 74, p. 730.) Subsequent amendments to the statute have dealt with procedural aspects of the required notice and the Department\u2019s entitlement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> No mention appears in the legislative history of the issue of fraud in failing to give notice. The language of the statute, throughout its history, suggests simply that (as applied to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Department) it was intended to establish the mechanics for collection of amounts to which the Department is entitled under Welfare and Institutions Code section 14009.5, enacted as part of the same legislation that originally enacted Probate Code section 700.1 (Stats. 1981, ch. 102, \u00a7 101, p. 738), not that it was meant to foreclose remedies against a personal representative who committed fraud. We see no reason to assume the Legislature consciously chose not to afford the chapter 5 governmental entities a means of redress against the fraud of a personal representative; it is far more likely the issue was simply not considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">In general, the Probate Code is clear in allowing for liability of the personal representative in case of fraud. Probate Code section 8480, subdivision (b), explains that the bond a personal representative is required to give as a condition of appointment \u201cshall be for the benefit of interested persons and shall be conditioned on the personal representative\u2019s faithful execution of the duties of the office according to law.\u201d Probate Code section 8488, subdivision (a), provides: \u201cIn case of a breach of a condition of the bond, an action may be brought against the sureties on the bond for the use and benefit of the decedent\u2019s estate or of any person interested in the estate.\u201d Probate Code section 7250, subdivision (a), provides that the personal representative and sureties are released from liability when a judgment or order in the administration of the estate becomes final, but subdivision (c) of this section states that the section does not apply \u201cwhere the judgment or order is obtained by fraud or conspiracy or by misrepresentation contained in the petition or account or in the judgment as to any material fact.\u201d With respect to management of the estate, Probate Code section 9603 provides that \u201c[t]he provisions of Sections 9601 and 9602 for liability of a personal representative for breach of a fiduciary duty do not prevent resort to any other remedy against the personal representative under the statutory or common law.\u201d We can imagine no reason why the Legislature would wish to preclude the governmental entities asserting claims under chapter 5 from recovering against a personal representative who breached her statutory duties by fraudulently failing to give notice and obtaining distribution of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>estate and the surety who guaranteed her faithful performance of her duties. Certainly nothing in chapter 5 expressly immunizes a personal representative from liability for fraudulently failing to give notice to the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">We recognize the rule, relied on by Fidelity, that \u201c[w]here a new right is created by statute, the party aggrieved by its violation is confined to the statutory remedy if one is provided [citation]; otherwise any appropriate common law remedy may be resorted to. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Palo Alto-Menlo Park Yellow Cab Co. </em>v. <em>Santa Clara County Transit Dist., supra, </em>65 Cal.App.3d 121, 131; <em>Faria </em>v. <em>San Jacinto Unified School Dist., supra, </em>50 Cal.App.4th 1939, 1947.)  As previously noted, the Department\u2019s right to recoup payments made under the Medi-C\u00e1l program from a decedent\u2019s estate (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 14009.5) and the remedy of a claim against the distributees (Prob. Code, \u00a7 9203, subd. (b)), were enacted as part of the same legislation. (Stats. 1981, ch. 102, \u00a7 101, p. 738, \u00a7 74, p. 730.) As to the remedy for a negligent or other failure to give notice that would not amount to extrinsic fraud, we have no doubt Probate Code section 9203, subdivision (b), provides the exclusive remedy. As explained above, however, this statute simply does not address the problem of <em>fraudulent </em>failure to give notice. Accordingly, it is the latter part of the <em>Palo Alto </em>rule that applies here: \u201c[Otherwise, any appropriate common law remedy may be resorted to.\u201d (65 Cal.App.3d at p. 131.)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The Department\u2019s claims for relief in these two cases are based on the proposition that Phillips\u2019s conduct amounted to extrinsic fraud. (6) \u201c \u2018[E]xtrinsic fraud is a broad concept that \u201ctend[s] to encompass almost any set of extrinsic circumstances which deprive a party of a fair adversary hearing.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] The clearest examples of extrinsic fraud are cases in which the aggrieved party is kept in ignorance of the proceeding or is in some other way induced not to appear. [Citation.] In both situations the party is \u2018fraudulently prevented from presenting his claim or defense.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Estate of Sanders </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 607, 614-615 [221 Cal.Rptr. 432, 710 P.2d 232].) \u201cExtrinsic fraud is present where, as here, a decree is procured from the probate court by conduct which prevents those having an interest in the estate from appearing and asserting their rights. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(State of California </em>v. <em>Broderson </em>(1967) 247 Cal.App.2d 797, 804 [56 Cal.Rptr. 58].)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">The cases relied upon by the Department, while not concerning the claim of a governmental entity such as in the present cases, illustrate the point. In <em>State of California </em>v. <em>Broderson, supra, </em>247 Cal.App.2d 797, the decedent, whose estate consisted of former community property of the decendent and her predeceased husband, died without heirs. The husband\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>heirs represented to the probate court that they were entitled to all of the estate although they knew they were in fact entitled only to a one-half interest in the estate, the other half-interest belonging to the state by escheat. No notice was given to the state and the estate was distributed. The heirs\u2019 conduct was determined to constitute extrinsic fraud and the state prevailed in its equitable action to set aside the probate decree. In <em>Alexandrou </em>v. <em>Alexander </em>(1974) 37 Cal.App.3d 306 [112 Cal.Rptr. 307], the administrator represented to the court that he was the sole heir of the decedent when in fact he was a stepson not entitled to any of the estate under the laws of intestate succession. After the estate was distributed and the surety exonerated, suits were filed by parties claiming to be heirs, seeking imposition of a trust on the property distributed to the administrator. Rather than imposing a trust, the trial court entered judgments against the administrator and surety. These judgments were upheld on appeal. <em>Estate of Sanders, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d 607, held that a court exercising equitable jurisdiction may set aside orders of the probate court in case of fraud. In that case, the decedent\u2019s conservator had committed extrinsic fraud in inducing the decendent to change her will to leave the bulk of her estate to him instead of to her son and in obtaining distribution of the estate under the new will. The Supreme Court reversed the trial court\u2019s order denying the son\u2019s heirs\u2019 motion to set aside the orders admitting the will to probate and ordering final distribution of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">The trial court in Estate of Starkweather (A078754) found that Phillips willfully represented to the court a fact she knew to be false\u2014that the decedent had not received Medi-Cal benefits\u2014with the intent to mislead the court into ordering a final distribution of the estate without requiring Phillips to give notice to the Department and discharge the Department\u2019s valid claim. The court concluded this conduct constituted a breach of Phillips\u2019s fiduciary duty to the estate. These findings and conclusion are not challenged in either of the present appeals. As in <em>Broderson, Alexandrou </em>and <em>Sanders, </em>Phillips\u2019s conduct here kept the Department in ignorance of the proceedings and enabled her to obtain distribution of the estate to her and her brother in derogation of the legitimate claim of the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Fidelity, as we have said, attempts to avoid the application of these cases by reliance on the rule that equitable relief is unavailable where there is an adequate remedy at law. <em>(Martin </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>51 Cal.App.4th 688, 696.) According to Fidelity, unlike the situations in <em>Broderson, Alexandrou </em>and <em>Sanders, </em>where there was no remedy available at law, here Probate Code section 9203 prescribes the remedy, a claim against the distributees. The Department urges, in contrast, that the statutory remedy is inadequate in the present case because Phillips has filed for bankruptcy and listed assets insufficient to pay \u201cany significant portion\u201d of her share of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>estate.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although the Department has offered no authority in support of her position on this point (and Fidelity has not even addressed the issue of adequacy\u2014as opposed to existence\u2014of the statutory remedy), we are aware of case law indicating insolvency of a party may be a factor in concluding a legal remedy to be inadequate. <em>(Hicks </em>v. <em>Clayton </em>(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 251, 264-265 [136 Cal.Rptr. 512].) Additionally, we have determined the statutory remedy does not necessarily apply to a case of fraudulent failure to give notice. We conclude that Phillips\u2019s conduct subjected her and Fidelity to liability based on her breach of her duties as personal representative and under the doctrine of extrinsic fraud. As the Department stresses, any other resolution of this issue in this case would enable personal representatives (and their sureties) to commit fraud such as occurred here with impunity. We share the Department\u2019s view that it (as the other governmental entities affected by chapter 5 of the Probate Code) should be able to rely upon the integrity of the probate system in presenting their claims against estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">We are also unpersuaded by Fidelity\u2019s argument that the remedy of setting aside the final order of distribution is precluded by Probate Code section 9203, subdivision (a). This statute reads: \u201cFailure of a person to give the written notice or request required by this chapter does not affect the validity of any proceeding under this code concerning the administration of the decedent\u2019s estate.\u201d As explained above, Probate Code section 9203 appears to have been enacted in order to specify the means by which a governmental entity such as the Department may collect sums to which it is statutorily entitled. Subdivision (a), consistent with subdivision (b), makes clear that in the ordinary case a final order of distribution will not be disturbed when the estate has been distributed before the expiration of the time for the Department\u2019s claim and the Department will be limited to recovery from the distributees. As with subdivision (b), however, subdivision (a) of Probate Code section 9203 reflects no legislative determination to so limit the Department\u2019s remedy where the Department has been prevented from filing its claim before distribution of the estate by the fraud of the personal representative. We construe subdivision (a), like subdivision (b), as applying to the ordinary case of inadvertent or negligent failure to give notice but not to a failure to give notice that amounts to extrinsic fraud.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>The judgment in Estate of Starkweather (A078754) is affirmed. The judgment in Belsh\u00e9 v. Fidelity (A078996) is reversed. Costs to the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Raerle, J., and Lambden, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-9\">The parties do not address the question why these actions proceeded independently in different trial courts. The probate proceeding for the administration of the decedent\u2019s estate was conducted in Alameda County, the county of the decedent\u2019s residence at the time of her death, and the Department\u2019s petition to set aside the final accounting and distribution was filed in this case. The Department\u2019s complaint against the personal representative and surety was filed in Contra Costa County, alleged in the complaint to be the residence of the personal representative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b470-6\">In addition to Phillips and Fidelity, the complaint named as a defendant the estate\u2019s attorney, Michael Jacobowitz. The Department alleged Jacobowitz knew or had reason to know the decedent had received Medi-Cal benefits and did not provide notice to the Department of her death, and sought to recover $137,997.48 from Jacobowitz because of this failure to provide notice. Jacobowitz apparently successfully demurred to the complaint and the Department has not appealed the dismissal of the complaint as to him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The second amended complaint also added as a defendant a surety that had issued a $20,000 bond for Phillips\u2019s brother, as distributee, to allow him to receive a preliminary distribution of $20,000. The Department sought to recover $20,000 from this surety because Phillips\u2019s brother\u2019s share of the estate had not been proportionately reduced to pay the Department\u2019s claim. According to the Department\u2019s brief on appeal in No. A078996, this surety settled with the Department and has been dismissed from the action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b471-7\">The Department\u2019s brief on appeal in No. A078996 states (without reference to the record) that Phillips answered the second amended complaint but later declared bankruptcy, and that the action against her has been stayed pending resolution of the bankruptcy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Attached as an exhibit to the Department\u2019s petition was a letter to Phillips from the administrator of Care West-Park Central Nursing Center stating that although the decedent was not on Medi-Cal at the time of her death, she was on Medi-Cal from 1988 through April 1, 1992.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b473-8\">Section 14009.5, subdivision (b) of the statute lists circumstances in which the Department may not make the claim described in subdivision (a), including during the lifetime of a surviving spouse and where there is a surviving child who is under age 21, blind or permanently and totally disabled.

The provisions requiring notice to the Department and establishing the time in which the Department\u2019s claim had to be filed were contained in Probate Code section 9202.
