Euphrat died as a result of injuries received in the accident, so that any cause of action against him abated with his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">The very question here presented, involving the same insurance policy and growing out of the same accident, has recently been decided by the District Court of Appeal. <em>(Severns </em>v. <em>California Highway Indemnity Exch., </em>100 Cal. App. 384 [280 Pac. 213].)</p>\n<p id=\"b834-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>In that case it was held that the insurance policy carried by Euphrat was simply an undertaking to pay any final judgment which the injured person might obtain against the assured, and that the obtaining of such final judgment constituted a condition precedent to any action which the injured person might have against the insurance carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">We are in entire accord with this conclusion and the by which it was reached. It would serve no useful purpose to repeat in this opinion what was said by the Court of Appeal in the Sevcrns case.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">On the authority and reasoning found in <em>Sevens </em>v. <em>Highway Indemnity Exch., supra, </em>the judgment from is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
