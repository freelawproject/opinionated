Joseph Whaley, at the time of his death, and requires' the said council to account for so much of the same as it has sold and transferredand the case was remanded to the Circuit Court to be referred to the referee <em>\u201c </em>for the purpose of allowing the city council to offer evidence of their right to the stock which, on the death of Joseph Whaley, stood in his name, or to show how he may have been divested of his title thereto; the respondents to be at liberty to offer testimony in rebuttal.\u201d And by an order of the Circuit Court of the 28th of February, 1877, the cause was referred back to me, as special referee, to take the testimony which might be offered under the provisions of the order of the Supreme Court. ' By the original order of reference, filed on the 12th of September, 1874, I was appointed special referee to inquire and report upon the facts, with leave to report any special matter. Under the order of the Circuit of the 28th of February, 1877, I have held numerous references, and have taken the testimony offered by the city council, defendant, and the testimony offered by the plaintiffs in rebuttal, as provided for by the said order.

That in the report of the referee it plainly appears that in reporting, as he professes to do, conclusions of facts, such conclusions involve and depend on conclusions of law which are not in \u25a0any order submitted to the referee; which he could not undertake to decide, and concerning which it would be necessary for him to have the instructions of the court upon the questions of law which were involved in and necessary for the ascertainment of conclusions of fact.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-10\">2. That the report of the referee, if it shall be considered properly filed as to the conclusions of facts therein set forth, is insufficient, because it does not report the conclusions of fact upon the testimony offered by the city council; that the testimony of the city council was positive in its character to show the right of the city council until the testimony so offered was impeached; that as no counter testimony did impeach it, and as nevertheless such testimony was discredited, it was necessary and proper for the referee to state the grounds upon which the positive testimony of the city council .was, by the referee, discredited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-11\">3. That in coming to a conclusion of facts, the referee has relied upon testimony which is wholly inferential, disregarding \u2022that which was positive and sustained the validity of the transfers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>without stating for what reason he declined to give weight to testimony which was positive and uncontradicted; and relied upon that which was merely inferential.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-5\">4. That the witnesses, Mrs. Rachel L. Whaley, Mrs. Bessie W. Seabrook and Mrs. Biordan, the last two the granddaughters of Joseph Whaley, and the parties who, if the transfer of the city stock, so far as Joseph Whaley was concerned, was not complete, were entitled to share in the same, but who testified against their own interest and to. the declarations of Joseph Whaley, as having exercised absolute disposition of said stock, have been, in the findings of the referee, wholly discredited, without witnesses or circumstances to impeach their testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-6\">5. That the referee, in coming to his conclusions of facts, disregarded the testimony of William Whaley, to the effect that Joseph Whaley kept the city stock himself, giving him the stock from time' to time; the stock so given to William Whaley, according to the testimony of the other witnesses in the case, plainly appearing as absolutely parted with by the said Joseph Whaley, and so given to the said William Whaley for the purposes considered necessary by the said William Whaley.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-7\">6. That the referee did not report as a conclusion of fact, that the testimony offered in the case plainly proved such control of the city stock, given by Joseph Whaley to William Whaley, as would prevent the said Joseph Whaley, were he living, from asserting title to the same against a purchaser for value <em>bona fide, </em>and without notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-8\">7. That the claim of the plaintiffs to the stock depends upon the right of Joseph Whaley to the stock; and where a purchaser for value <em>bona fide, </em>and without notice, would prevail against Joseph Whaley were h\u00e9 alive, the same will prevail against all claiming to be his creditors, and whose rights are such as Joseph Whaley had. That the referee should have reported, as a conclusion of fact, that the city council being purchasers for value <em>bona fide </em>and without notice, the plaintiffs had no claim to the stock which Joseph Whaley was estopped from setting up against the city council.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-9\">8. That- the referee should have reported, as a conclusion of fact, that the handwriting of Joseph Whaley, on all the notes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>and bonds held by parties claiming an interest in the stock in question in this case, and which was in evidence, <em>was the same as that which appeared on the city stock ; </em>and such was the testimony of E.

That the referee erred in denying to the city council the right of reply to the testimony of John E. Phillips; and also in denying to the city council the right of reply generally to the testimony of the plaintiff in rebuttal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-6\">10. That the endorsement of the name of the owner of stock in blank, or to a designated person, on a certificate of city stock, is in fact the absolute disposition of the stock by the person whose name is so endorsed; and as such cannot be impeached in the hands of a holder <em>bona fide </em>and without notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-7\">11. That the referee should have reported that the city council proved their right to the stock claimed by them by transfers of the same,'the said city council being purchasers <em>bona fide </em>for value and without notice; and that the title of Joseph Whaley in and over the said stock, had ceased so far as purchasers <em>bona fide </em>for value and without notice had been extinguished by his endorsement in blank and otherwise on said stock, leaving the same in possession of William Whaley, to be dealt with as he, William Whaley, chose, and without notice on the part of Joseph Whaley of any restriction upon the use of the endorsement of his name; and that evidence being uncontradicted that the said Joseph Whaley did, during his lifetime, deliver the said stock to William Whaley.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-8\">12. That the referee erred in not reporting that the city stock scrip No. 7 was in the possession of the People\u2019s National Bank during the lifetime of Joseph Whaley, and at the time of his death, with an absolute transfer and assignment thereof to H. G. Loper, cashier of the People\u2019s National <em>Bank; </em>and that it was sold by the said bank to the city council, the city council being the purchaser <em>bona fide </em>for value and without notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-9\">13. That the referee erred in not reporting that the city stock scrip No. 12, was in the possession of the People\u2019s National Bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>during the lifetime of Joseph Whaley, and at the time of bis . death, with an absolute transfer and assignment thereof to H. G. Loper, cashier of the People\u2019s National Bank; and that it was sold by the said bank to the city council, the city council being the purchasers thereof <em>bona fide </em>and without notice; and that the handwriting of the said Joseph Whaley, as it appears on the said scrip, was genuine, and the <em>same </em>as appears on all the notes and bonds introduced in evidence in this case, as valid claims against the estate of Joseph Whaley, and to pay which it is claimed that the title of city council, as purchaser, should be set aside, and the parties holding such claims be held entitled to the said stock against the city council.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-5\">14. That in regard to scrips Nos. 382 and 384, the referee should have reported, as the only conclusion of fact, that the transfer thereof was made to the city council, a purchaser thereof <em>bona fide </em>for value and without notice, under an assignment and transfer thereof in blank by the said Joseph Whaley at some time in his life, when the said Joseph Whaley parted with the possession of said scrips; and that the handwriting of the said Joseph Whaley, as it appears on the said scrips, was genuine, and the <em>same </em>.as upon all the notes and bonds introduced in evidence in this case as valid claims against the estate of Joseph Whaley and to pay which it is claimed that the title of the city council as purchaser should be set aside, and the parties holding such claims be held entitled to the said stock against the city council.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-6\">15. That the referee should have reported as a conclusion of fact in regard to scrips Nos. 383, 386, 387, 393, 394, 395 and 396, that said scrips were transferred and assigned by Joseph Whaley, in his lifetime; that the said city council became purchaser thereof <em>bona fide </em>for value and Avithout notice; that the transfers thereof were made on the books of the city treasury, by parties claiming and holding under transfer and assignment of the said Joseph Whaley, in his lifetime; and that the handwriting of the said Joseph Whaley, as it appears on all of the said scrips, was genuine, and the <em>same </em>as it appears on all the notes and bonds introduced in evidence in this case, as valid claims against the estate of Joseph Whaley, and to pay which it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>claimed that tbe title of tbe city council as purchaser, should be set aside, and the parties holding such claims be held entitled to the said stock against the city council.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-5\">16. That the city council excepts to all that part of the report of the referee, in which he has gone into the account and narration of the history of each of the several scrips now held by the city council, and that such account and narration is not correct, and that the same in nowise can be introduced to affect the title of the city council to the scrips held by it, nor admissible in a proceeding to which the parties to be affected by it, and through whom title comes to the city council are not before the court nor parties in the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-6\">Julian Mitchell,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-7\">A.

The city council of Charleston will, for the present, be considered as the defendant principally interested in the relief asked in the complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-15\">A large portion of this stock was purchased by the city council for the commissioners of the sinking fund, and other portions of the stock have been transferred on the books of the city treasury to other persons. The plaintiffs ask that the city stock purchased by the city council - and transferred to the commissioners of the sinking fund, and the city stock also on the books of the city treasury transferred to other parties purchasing the same, be accounted for as part of the estate of Joseph Whaley.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Joseph Whaley died on the 26th day of January, 1872, leaving a will unrevoked, and appointed therein an executrix and two executors; of these, his son, William Whaley, named in the will as executor, only qualified. The complaint in this case has been substituted for another, filed in the name of the People\u2019s Bank, to which the city council was not a party. An order made in that case allowed this complaint to be filed in place of that, and another order directed all the claims proved in the case of the People\u2019s Bank to be transferred to this case of Fraser &amp; Dill, and be considered as proved in this.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-5\">Under an order of reference in this case, the case was referred to G. W. Dingle, Esq., who proceeded to hold his reference in the same, and made his report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-6\">This report was confirmed, and an appeal taken to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, for the reasons set forth in the opinion, sent the case to the Circuit Court with directions, according to which, under the order of the. Circuit Court, the reference was opened, testimony taken, and a report made to this court, to which exceptions have been filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-7\">According to the opinion of the Supreme Court, the real issue as to the stock was the right of ownership in it at the death of the testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-8\">That the plaintiffs\u2019 right to the relief asked was through the right of the testator to it at the time of his death, and its liability as his property to respond to the demands which they hold against him as creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-9\">The case was then remanded for the purpose of allowing said city council to offer evidence of their right to the stock, which, on the death of Joseph Whaley, stood in his name, or to show how he may have been divested of his title thereto, the respondents to be at liberty to offer testimony in rebuttal. The Circuit Court, in its order of reference, was guided by the directions of the Supreme Court as to the scope of the reference, and the parties appeared before the referee, the defendant, the city council, to offer evidence of its right to the stock, or to show how the title of Joseph Whaley was divested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-10\">The title set up by the city council was that of a purchaser for value <em>bona fide, </em>and without notice. The property of Joseph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Whaley in the stock was claimed to have been divested by his blank endorsement on the scrip before his death, and his parting with the scrip so endorsed to third persons, to whom the transfer was made after the death of Joseph Whaley, these persons producing to the city treasurer the certificates of stock purporting to have the endorsement thereon of Joseph Whaley, and surrendered to the city treasurer, by whom new certificates were given, and from these persons the city council purchased the stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-5\">This is the history of the greater portion of the stock purchased by the city council. Other stock, purchased by other parties and \u2022transferred to them, different perhaps in some respects from this, but in the view now to be taken of the case it is not necessary particularly to distinguish it from that held by the city council \u2022at this part of the decree. In the argument of the case two propositions were discussed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-6\">1st. Supposing the endorsement of Joseph Whaley to be in his own handwriting, what is the legal nature and effect of that endorsement ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-7\">2d. Is the endorsement in the proper handwriting of Joseph Whaley ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-8\">The second of these propositions is a question of fact. To this \u25a0question quite a number witnesses were examined before the referee, and their testimony filed with the report. A number of the proven or admitted signatures of Joseph Whaley were also put in evidence, and these, together with the disputed signatures \u25a0upon the scrip, were photographed and pasted together upon large sheets of paper and submitted to me at the hearing. After a careful review of all the testimony, my mind is forced to the \u2022conclusion that the findings of the referee are correct, and the \u2022exceptions thereto are overruled, and the report confirmed and ordered to stand as the findings of the court upon matters of fact.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-9\">It is useless to discuss the effect of an endorsement not made by Joseph Whaley. Of course Joseph Whaley was not divested of his title to scrip by endorsements not made by himself or by his authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-10\">This disposes of the question of the validity of the transfer by the city council of all the city stock which stood on the books of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>the city treasurer in the name of Joseph Whaley at the time of' his death, except scrip No. 7, for $23,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-4\">In relation to this scrip, the facts found are as follows: <em>\u201c </em>I find that the above-mentioned certificate No. 7, for $23,000, with the name of Joseph Whaley endorsed thereon, was in the possession of H. G. Loper, cashier of the People\u2019s National Bank, prior to the death of Joseph Whaley, and was, by virtue of a transfer written over the name of Joseph Whaley, transferred to him in the books of the city treasurer, after the death of Joseph Whaley.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-5\">\u201c I find that the signature of Joseph Whaley, endorsed on this-certificate, transferring the same to H. G. Loper, cashier, is the handwriting of Joseph Whaley. This certificate, then, was in the possession of Loper before the death of Joseph Whaley, endorsed by Joseph Whaley, and transferred on the books of the city treasurer to Loper after the death of Joseph Whaley.\u201d It appears, in the report of the referee, that there was issued to Loper, by the city council, scrip No. 51 in lieu of scrip No. 7. This stock was pledged to secure a call loan to the People\u2019s National Bank,, on the 11th of January, 1872.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-6\">The call loan was marked paid on the 12th of April, 1872. Scrip 51 was bought by the city on the 23d of May, 1872. How the call loan was paid does not appear. There is nothing in the testimony to show that this stock was ever in the possession of Joseph Whaley in his lifetime, or of his personal representative after his death, after it was pledged to the People\u2019s National-Bank on the 11th of January, 1872. Then Loper, the cashier, holding this scrip on the 11th of January, 1872, the scrip endorsed in blank by Joseph Whaley, and nothing appearing to impeach the transaction through which he held, must be regarded as the lawful holder, coupled with an interest, and had the right to do with it all that was necessary to effectuate the purpose of his so holding, and as it appears that the certificate representing this stock was sold by him, he is entitled to the presumption that it was so sold by him to effectuate the purpose of the pledge. <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Ely, </em>9 <em>How. TJ. S. </em>600.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-7\">Up to the time of the sale, Joseph Whaley in his lifetime, or his personal representative after his death, had the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>redeem; but by the sale in pursuance of the agreement to pledge, the right to redeem was barred and the purchaser took a good title. The purchase related to the time of the pledge, and effectually divested Joseph Whaley of all title to the stock. Whether Loper held a power of attorney coupled with an interest, and therefore had the right to cause this stock to be transferred after the death of Joseph Whaley, and thus acquire the legal title, or whether he held a mere naked power\" which was determined by the death of Joseph Whaley, are questions that need not be decided in this decree in the view now taken of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-5\">It is admitted in the argument that a delivery of the scrip with a power of attorney to transfer endorsed, passes the equitable but not the legal title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-6\">According to the face of these certificates of stock, they can be transferred only upon the books of the treasury upon the appearance of the owner of the stock in person, or by attorney, and the surrender of the certificate. ' This is manifestly a regulation designed for the security of the bank itself, and of third persons taking transfers of the stock without notice of any prior equitable title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-7\">The general construction which has been put upon other charters of their banks containing similar provisions as to the transfer of their stock, is that the provisions are designed solely for the safety and security of the bank itself and of purchasers without notice, and that as between vendor and vendee a transfer not in conformity to such provisions is good to pass the equitable title and divest the vendor of all interest in the stock. See <em>Blaeh </em>v. <em>Zaohria, </em>3 <em>How. U. S., </em>513, and numerous authorities there collected. If any creditor had attached the stock without notice, perhaps the property would not have passed to Loper as against the attaching creditor, but there is nothing of that kind in this case. Whether Loper could effectually cause the stock now under consideration to be transferred, and thus acquire the legal title, under the view now taken, is of no consequence to the plaintiff in this action, as Joseph Whaley was as completely divested of the title to the stock by conveying the equitable title, as he could have been by transferring the legal title, so far as the plaintiffs in this action are concerned, and the fact that this stock was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>transferred after the death of Joseph Whaley, can restore no rights to his estate that had been parted with in his lifetime. In the argument at the hearing the testimony to the effect that the signatures of Joseph Whaley upon the notes held by plaintiff and other creditors were in the same handwriting as the disputed signatures upon the city scrip, was pressed upon my attention, and it was suggested that if the disputed signatures upon the scrip were not genuine, then the signatures upon said notes were not genuine, and the holders thereof had not the right to sustain the relation of plaintiffs to this action. It was said, upon the other hand that for argument sake, admitting that the signatures of Joseph Whaley upon the notes were not genuine, there were other creditors of Joseph Whaley in whose behalf this complaint would be sustained. It was further said in this behalf that the notes referred to were in judgment, and had been therefore passed upon by a court of competent jurisdiction and could not be collaterally impeached, and could only be assailed in a direct proceeding instituted for that purpose. The issue thus raised is not ripe for decision in this decree, but may again arise in the subsequent progress of the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-5\">As matters of law, I find that Joseph Whaley was divested of the stock represented by scrip No. 7, by endorsing the same to H. G. Loper, cashier, and the subsequent sale of the stock by Loper, in pursuance of his contract with Joseph Whaley.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-6\">I find that Joseph Whaley was not divested of the stock represented by certificates numbers 12, 382, 383, 384, 386, 387, 393, 394, 395 and 396, by any endorsement of the name of Joseph Whaley thereon, as such endorsement is not the handwriting of Joseph Whaley, or made by his authority, and that the said stock is still a part of the estate of Joseph Whaley.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-7\">It is therefore adjudged and decreed that the city stock which stood in the name of Joseph Whaley at the time of his death, except that represented by certificate No. 7, belonged to the estate of the said Joseph Whaley/and is subject to the payment of his debts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-8\">It is ordered that the said city council do cancel, or cause to be canceled, the certificates of stock transferred to the general sinking fund, and which has been adjudged to belong to the estate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Joseph Whaley, that is to say, certificates numbers 382,384, 386, 387, 393, 395, 396, and do issue new certificates therefor in the name of the receiver, hereafter to be appointed in this cause, and that the said council do account with and pay over to the said receiver all dividends or interest thereon which have become due thereon since the death of the said Joseph Whaley.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b519-5\">3.

But there was the same want of proof of the genuineness of the signature of Joseph Whaley on the notes of the plaintiffs and others; and if the endorsements of the certificates of stock were invalid, the endorsements ,pf the notes and the name of Joseph Whaley, signed to the bond, were equally so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-6\"><em>Third. </em>Because his Honor Judge Wallace erred in holding that the issue as to the validity of the endorsements of the notes was not ripe for decision: that such issue was ripe for decision, and such decision should have been made dismissing the bill so far as the holders of such notes were before the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-7\"><em>Fourth. </em>Because while in the three preceding exceptions, the endorsements of the certificates of stock and of notes have been presented as equally affected by the proof of handwriting: nevertheless, <em>in </em>regal\u2019d to the certificates of stock, there was <em>competent </em>and positive testimony sustaining the validity of the endorsements of the stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-8\"><em>Fifth. </em>Because his Honor Judge Wallace erred in deciding that in this case it was proper to appoint a receiver; that if exceptions were taken to one of the executors, there was before the court, in the person of W. James Whaley, Esq., an executor of Joseph Whaley, who had, subsequent to the transactions set forth in the pleadings, qualified as such executor, and against whom no charge of improper conduct could be made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b520-9\"><em>Sixth. </em>Because if it were so that a receiver would be appointed upon the proof before the court his Honor Judge Wallace, failing'to decide the question of the invalidity of the endorsements of the notes, should have ordered the receiver not to recognize the endorsements of the notes as constituting valid claims against the estate of Joseph Whaley, until so established by the judgment of a court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>The following is a summary of the leading argument on each side, upon the law points involved:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-4\"><em>Mr. Julian Mitohell, </em>for city council.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-5\">The most striking fact in this whole case, and upon which the testimony is unanimous, is that, leaving out the Lathers bond and scrip No. 7, the signatures on the claims and debts of the estate held by the creditors are in the same handwriting as the signatures on all the city stock save No. 7.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-6\">We therefore say they are estopped from denying the validity of their debts, and consequently are bound by their own testimony that the scrip signatures are the same as on their debts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-7\">It is said that estoppel is an odious doctrine, but in this case, if the view of the creditors that the signatures on the scrip are not genuine, then the doctrine of estoppel becomes one of the most just, equitable and righteous doctrines a court of equity has ever been called on to enforce. Are they, then, estopped ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-8\">1. They claim by virtue of debts of Joseph Whaley to make Joseph Whaley\u2019s estate liable; a denial of the genuineness of tho endorsements creating their claims is a denial of the liability of the estate, and ends their case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-9\">2. They claim that the endorsements are genuine; have sworn to them in order to get their judgments, and each one, in his-affidavit of proof of claim, has alleged the validity of the endorsements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-10\">3. They have introduced them as such, <em>i. e., </em>genuine notes,, waiving the ruling of the referee; no one of them objected to their introduction; no one objected to the witnesses testifying to them. The examination of the whole book of testimony does-not show a single objection made by any of the parties in the cause to the genuineness of their claims; in fact, such a thing could not have been\u2019 done, because, by so doing, they would have been out of court. But it is said that Gibbon\u2019s note, Scott\u2019s bond, Davie\u2019s note and verdict of <em>Gadsden </em>v. <em>Whaley, </em>save the complaint. This cannot be so\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-11\"><em>First. </em>Because the parties holding these claims, being parties in the cause, raised no objection to the validity or genuineness of the signatures on the notes when presented in evidence-; nor did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>any one of them impeach them, and, therefore, they are, by the familiar principle of evidence, bound by their omission to object.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-5\"><em>Secondly. </em>Because the Gibbon note, the Scott bond and Davie\u2019s note were all given at or about the very dates when the other notes were given, and the presumption is very strong that they bear the same signature.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-6\"><em>Thirdly. </em>The <em>Gadsden </em>v. <em>Whaley </em>claim on their verdict has not yet reached the point of judgment upon which the court \u25a0could base a decree in this case, and the court would hold those whose notes have been proved in the cause, as bound by their position as to the genuineness of the signatures thereon, and without remedy against the city council.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-7\">The law, as laid down to sustain the above doctrine, is as follows: <em>Bigelow on Estoppel </em>20, 25, 584, 617, 618; <em>Greenl. on Eh., </em>\u00a7 535; 5 <em>Man. &amp; G. </em>131-192; 16 <em>Q. B. </em>229-237; 5 <em>Hill </em>1S3; 8 <em>Rich. </em>117; 16 <em>Q. B. </em>198; <em>Stephens\u2019 Eh. </em>52; 8 <em>Faige </em>41; 30 <em>N. Y. </em>519-541; 18 <em>N. Y. </em>382; 3 <em>Hill </em>215.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"160\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-8\"><em>All </em>the creditors* therefore, in this case are estopped from \u25a0denying the signatures on the notes and claims to be genuine, and <em>their own testimony </em>says it is the same signature on the scrip. How, then, can they recover ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"161\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-9\">While on this point I deem it best to discuss the fourth ground, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-10\">If all of the above grounds were to fail, then this stock is only liable, as the property of Joseph Whaley, for <em>his debts, </em>and if it appears, at any stage of the cause, that any party fails to have a valid debt, he will not be entitled to any portion of the stock or \u2022any remedy against the city council. <em>Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims </em>712, 728, 734, 736; 15 <em>Mass. </em>204.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"163\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-11\">But the plaintiffs insist that the city council cannot now question the signatures to the notes and obligations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-12\">This proposition of theirs rests on two grounds :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"165\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-13\">1. That in those claims which were reduced to judgment, the judgment is conclusive as against every one, and cannot be questioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-14\">But the city council was no party to the proceedings. How can it then be bound by any judgment obtained therein ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"167\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-15\">The rule is unquestioned that a third person can always attack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>or impeach a' judgment to which he was not a party or privy when such judgment is the ground of any claim against him. <em>Freem. on Judg., </em>\u00a7 334; 4 <em>Cush. </em>31; 1 <em>Hill </em>302; <em>8 8. C. </em>262.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"168\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-5\">2. The second ground is, that all these claims having been proved in this clise without any exception to their proof within the time allowed by the rule of court, they cannot now be questioned or assailed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"169\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-6\">But it is not possible for a Court of Chancery to use these claims as a shield to protect the fraud involved in the other cases. See the powers of the equitable jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery in C. J. Moses\u2019 decree, <em>Sp. Fq. Jur.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"170\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-7\">II. The estate became divested of its title by the absolute transfer of the stock by the testator in his lifetime, of which there is no doubt as to scrip No. 7. Or by the hypothecation of the stock by virtue of a power of attorney executed during his life, and coupled with an interest, and therefore irrevocable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"171\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-8\">The law as to the irrevocability 'of such powers coupled with an interest is as follows : 2 <em>Liv. on Ag. </em>308 ; 48 <em>How. </em>427; 13 <em>K Y. </em>599; 7 <em>Wall. </em>415; 11 <em>Wall. </em>369; <em>Sch. on Per.

(</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"173\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-10\">1. The last ground we will notice is the first as laid down in the beginning of the argument. The city council is a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser for value without notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"174\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-11\">The endorsements on the back of all the scrips are not powers of attorney, but absolute transfers. By the scrip itself, and the ordinances of the city, they are made payable to the party or his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>assigns. All the requirements of the ordinance as to the transfer of title have been complied with. The title is actually transferred by virtue of the endorsement, and there is nothing to be clone as between vendor and vendee \u2014 it is not a power, for there is nothing to be executed. The mere fact of th'e transfer in the books of the city is for the benefit of the corporation, as a safeguard to them. The authorities all hold it is an assignment and not a power.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"175\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-4\">These scrips are also negotiable instruments, and by an examination of the authorities here given, it will be seen the Supreme Court has so held.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"176\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-5\">Bonds of municipal corporations are commercial instruments. 2 <em>Otto </em>642; 4 <em>Otto </em>287; 11 <em>Wall. </em>377. Important on the point that these securities savor of a negotiable character. 13 <em>N. Y. </em>599. The case most directly in point is 19 <em>Wall. </em>477.

It relates to the transfer of the legal title and not of any equitable interest subordinate to that title; as between vendor and vendee, a transfer not in conformity to such provisions passes the equitable title and divests the vendor of his interest. 2 <em>Cow. </em>777, 778; 11 <em>Wend. </em>628; 10 <em>Mass. </em>476; 8 <em>Piale. </em>90; 3 <em>How.

In answer to this we say that in chancery cases this court has the undoubted right to review the testimony, and reverse, modify or confirm the conclusions of the court below in like manner as the old Court of Appeals in Chancery could have done. 6 <em>8.

From so much of the decree of his 'Honor Judge Wallace as holds that Joseph Whaley was divested of the city stock represented by scrip No. 7, by endorsing the same to H. G. Loper, cashier, and the subsequent sale of the stock by Loper, in pursuance of his contract with Joseph Whaley.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"183\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-7\">The city council, unable to show a power of sale under the will, or an order of the Court of Probate authorizing the sale at which they purchased, have undertaken to show that H. G. Loper from whom they bought, held the same with a blank endorsement and power of attorney from Joseph Whaley, coupled with an interest. But how have they succeeded in doing this ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"184\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-8\">We think his Honor has assumed the very point in issue. Did Joseph Whaley endorse the stock to H. G. Loper, cashier? Did Loper have any contract with Joseph Whaley? There is no evidence that Joseph Whaley had any transaction whatsoever with Loper, nor has it even been suggested in evidence that there was any such. Whatever contract there was, was between Loper and William Whaley. But first, let us inquire was this scrip No. 7 a negotiable instrument which would pass by mere endorsement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"185\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-9\">\n<em>a. Was this certificate of stock a negotiable instrument \u00b6</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"186\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-10\">This stock is the creature of statute, and is governed by the provisions of the statute which authorized its issue. Its very form is prescribed by ordinance, and on its face it is announced that it is \u201c recorded in and transferable <em>only at the office of the dty treasurer, by appearance in person or by attorney, </em>according to the rules and forms instituted for that purpose.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"187\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-11\">His Honor the Circuit judge seems to assume in his opinion that there was not only a blank endorsement, but also a power of attorney from Joseph Whaley to transfer, and it is just here that this case differs from most, if not from all of the cases relied upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>by the city. There was in each of those cases not only an endorsement, but a power of attorney accompanying it. See 6 <em>Rich. Eq. </em>334: 37 <em>Eng. L. &amp; Eq. </em>195: 11 <em>Barb. </em>385; 21 <em>How. </em>397; 22 <em>IVend. </em>359.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"188\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-4\">A case very similar to this has recently been discussed and decided in the Court of Appeals in New York. This case is <em>Merchants\u2019 Bank of Canada </em>v. <em>Livingston et al., </em>found in <em>The Reporter </em>for August, 1878, p. 178.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"189\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-5\">In our case, the city council has never claimed that the People\u2019s Bank, or Loper, had dealt with William Whaley or the agent of Joseph Whaley. Their answer rests their defence upon the authority and agency of Loper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"190\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-6\">Judge Wallace cites 3 <em>How. </em>513, which undoubtedly sustains his position, but with this qualification, that Judge Story, in that case, was speaking of the legal title, and refers to the case, 2 <em>Wheat. </em>393, in which he also delivered the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"191\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-7\">\n<em>b. The city council must stand upon the issues made in the pleadings.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"192\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-8\">It is clear that the transaction we are examining was not, as the city council allege, with Joseph Whaley, but with William Whaley, that the loan <em>\u201c </em>was made to William Whaley,\u201d and the stock taken as \u201c collateral security for money borrowed by Mr. William Whaley.\u201d The defence'which the city set up in its answer is a <em>legal </em>one. It claims the legal title to the stock by reason of the transfer made by Joseph Whaley to <em>Loper. </em>The defence it has endeavored to establish by evidence is an <em>equitable </em>title under a blank endorsement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"193\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-9\">The well-established rule is that a defendant 'must not only answer definitely, but that he can avail himself of no other defence, not even if on the trial another defence is developed by the evidence. 12 <em>N. Y. </em>579. The same has been recognized and enforced by this court. 4 <em>8. C. </em>52. See, too, 1 <em>Russ. &amp; M. </em>527.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"194\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-10\">But the city has not established the equitable title it would now set up:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"195\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-11\">The city_council cannot put itself in the position of a stranger who is an innocent purchaser. The city knew, or at least is charged in law with the fullest knowledge, in regard to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>stock. The city is charged with the knowledge of the facts from its own hooks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"196\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-5\">c. <em>The defence of the city is in violation of the statute of frauds. \u25a0(Rev. Stat. </em>480.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"197\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-6\">The facts proved show that the estate of Joseph Whaley is \u25a0charged for the debt of William Whaley. This cannot be done unless upon an agreement in writing, or some note or memorandum thereof, signed by Joseph Whaley, undertaking to answer for the debt of William Whaley.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"198\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-7\">\n<em>d. The debt for which the stock was pledged was paid, and the stock redeemed more than a month before the city purchased it.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"199\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-8\">2. We proceed to consider the question based by the complainants\u2019 second ground of appeal, to wit, that the Circuit judge erred in directing the receiver to institute such proceedings as he may be advised are proper and. necessary to try the validity of any claims against the estate of Joseph Whaley.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"200\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-9\">It will be convenient to consider, in this connection, the question raised in its appeal by the city, to wit, that there was no sufficient proof before the c'ourt that the complainants were the creditors of Joseph Whaley.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"201\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-10\">It is clear, 1. That no evidence has been introduced calculated \u25a0even to cast suspicion upon the judgments held by Mary F. Davie, George E. Gibbon, R. K. Scott and Richard Lathers, or en the verdict recovered by Mrs. Gadsden, or the account proved by Mr. Ravenel, for advances made to Joseph Whaley in his lifetime.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"202\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-11\">Conceding, therefore, that all the other claims presented are spurious, these parties have offered sufficient proof before the court that they are creditors of Joseph Whaley, and, as such, entitled to maintain this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"203\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-12\">2. That the validity of none of the claims proved has, at any stage of these proceedings, been questioned, either by the executors of Joseph Whaley or by his legatees, or by his creditors, or by any other party entitled to raise that issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"204\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-13\">In support of the exceptions we are now considering, we submit the following propositions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"205\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-14\">1. That the proper functions of a receiver, in a case like this, to which the executors are parties defendant, and the creditors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>have been called in and have proved their claims, are simply <em>to </em>receive the funds paid into court and distribute them under the order of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"206\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-5\">2. That this court has not the power to invest the receiver with such power and subject him to such obligations; that persons interested in the estate of Joseph Whaley, and not parties to these proceedings, will be bound by a judgment against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"207\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-6\">3. That it was competent, at the proper stage of these proceedings, for the executors of Joseph Whaley, or for any creditor, to-object to any or all of the claims proved against his estate and not already in judgment. No such objection was raised by these parties, or any of them, at any stage of the proceedings. It was only raised on the Circuit indirectly in the argument of the counsel for the city, and is now only raised on appeal by the city, which had and has no right to raise it in any form or at any time, the city not being a creditor of Joseph Whaley, but simply a wrongdoer in unlawful possession of his property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"208\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-7\">4. It is now too late for any of the parties to these proceedings to object to the validity of any of the claims reported as proved and established in the case. The referee\u2019s report was filed on the day of , 1875. Many objections were taken, but no objection was made to any of these claims. The report of the referee was confirmed by an order of court, made on the 28th of June, 1875, and the referee was directed to inquire and report in what order and rank the debts of Joseph Whaley, reported by him as proved and established in this cause, are to be paid. This decree was objected to on other grounds, but no .objection was made on this ground. The only question which any of the parties to this case can now be permitted to agitate, is as to the order in which these claims are to be paid. On all other questions they are concluded. 1 <em>Rich. Eq. </em>24; <em>7 8. C. </em>131.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"209\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-8\">5. If the legatees of Joseph Whaley, or other parties not now before the court have any equities, they must assert them in their own names in the mode prescribed by law and by the established practice of this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"210\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-9\">Even the creditors of a party defrauded have no right \u2014 though the fraud have the effect to diminish his means of paying them\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>to set aside the fraud. \u201cIt is for the debtor,\u201d says the court in <em>Pettus </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>4 <em>Pich.

As to the claims resting on judgment, we insist that the court cannot, in <em>this case, </em>pass upon the genuineness of the endorsements upon which judgment was obtained, because that question is concluded by the judgments rendered, and such judgments cannot be impeached collaterally, but can be set aside only on some direct proceeding before the court in which they were rendered. 4 <em>Otto </em>352; <em>Pail.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Apk\">Both parties appeal. The first, second and third grounds of appeal on the part of the city council are upon points which had either been already decided at the former trial, and not appealed from, or do not properly arise in the present case \u2014 at least at this stage of the proceeding. The fifth ground of appeal raises an objection to the appointment of a receiver. That point had been decided by the former judgment in this case and assented to by all parties, and is not a proper subject of appeal. The sixth ground is wholly without foundation. It will be time to appeal after something to appeal from has arisen. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>There is no evidence that the receiver has recognized any of the notes referred to, or that their validity will be recognized except upon proper legal evidence.' To set aside what has already been fixed by judgment and not appealed from, or by consent of the parties, can only be done upon proceedings for which the. Circuit judge, in this case, made ample provision. The fourth ground of appeal is upon the finding of facts by the Circuit judge. This court is unable to perceive either a lack of evidence to warrant such finding, or such preponderance of evidence on the other side as would justify a.reversal of the finding. The court is impressed with the force of the proposition that the hypothecation of such securities by the legal owner, or by another person with the previous consent or subsequent acquiescence of the legal owner, without endorsement or power of attorney, may constitute, by delivery, an equitable assignment, and act as an estoppel against the legal owner and creditors claiming through him. The question was not made in the court below, or, at least, has not received adjudication, and there is no appeal upon that ground. But, apart from that, the evidence does not give foundation of fact sufficient for the proposition of law to rest upon. There is no evidence to show that any of the parties to the transaction, or the officers of the city government by whom the transfers were made, were ever aware of or misled or induced by any expression of knowledge or acquiescence on the part of the testator. On the contrary, the evidence is conclusive that reliance was placed solely upon what was taken to be the signature of the testator, and there is no evidence of any negligence on his part which could be charged with contributing to the mistake on their part. In the eye of the law it is the same as if there had been no signature on the certificates of stock. The absence of signature was notice of lack of authority, and put the parties on their guard. The case would be different if the legal owner had been asked and had expressed his assent. There is no evidence that the testator knew of any of the transactions out of which these questions arise. Of course this does not refer to certificate No. 7, which is not now being considered. It is true that there is testimony of some general expressions made by him, but there is no link to connect them with the special transactions which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>are before the court. He could not have acquiesced in the transfers of the legal title to the stock, for the transfers were made after his death; that, therefore, cannot be in question. The question is as to the hypothecation, and the essential fact is that the certificates, being in the possession of another person, were hypothecated or sold by him without authority in Writing, but with the knowledge and consent or subsequent acquiescence, with or without previous knowledge, on the part of the legal owner. Did such fact exist, or is there any evidence to give it color ? The evidence upon which it rests is parol testiihony, given by members of the family and intimate friend's of the testator. They testify as to language used by the testator in conversation with them severally or together at different times, but not in the transaction of business. The drift of all this testimony is, that the testator had himself assigned the certificates by proper en- \u25a0 dorsement in writing, or, as it is said by one of the witnesses, \u201c signed away the last of his city stocks.\u201d This directly contradicts the fact on which the whole argument rests, viz., that although he had not \u201csigned away\u201d the certificates, he nevertheless had delivered them, and consented to, or afterwards acquiesced in, uses to which they were to' be or had been applied without authority of law. The truth is that these witnesses, testified to prove, by corroborative statements of the deceased, that the signature on the certificates Avas in his handwriting. They did not, nor did they mean to, say that he acquiesced, or made any expression of acquiescence, in assignments which \u25a0 he had not made. Besides, there is no evidence that any of these certificates were pledged prior to July, 1871, just six months prior to testator\u2019s death, but nearly all, certainly, Avere pledged Avithin that time, and some within a very short time before his death. The brevity of time, together with the great age of the testator, speak strongly against the probability of his having become acquainted with the facts as they have been developed by the trial, and there is no evidence that any of the parties to any of these transactions communicated to him that a certificate or certificates had been pledged. Such being the circumstances, some of the statements on which stress is laid are dated by the witnesses as having been made about eighteen months prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>the death of the testator, and twelve months prior to the time when the first of the transactions on which these statements are brought by the appellant to bear have been found to have actually occurred. With these remarks, made to prevent any impression that this court has decided upon the legal point made in the argument, but which is not involved in the case, the appeal on behalf of the city of Charleston must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The plaintiffs appeal from so much of the judgment as relates to scrip No. 7 of the city stock, and from so much as gives to the receiver leave t\u00ae \" institute such proceedings as he may be advised may be proper and necessary to try the validity of any claims against the estate of Joseph Whaley, and defend such proceedings as may be instituted against him.\u201d The prayer of the appellants\u2019 complaint asks that a receiver may be appointed to take possession of the property and its proceeds, and administer the same in the place and stead of the executor. The previous judgment in the case had granted the prayer and appointed a receiver clothed with power to administer in the place and stead of the executor, and no appeal was taken. The court had thus taken possession of the property, and is bound to see to its proper administration. The right to prosecute and defend the legal rights of an estate is absolutely essential. It could rest in no one more properly than in the officer of the court appointed to act in the place and stead of the executor. The judgment goes no further than that, and furnishes no ground for appeal. The leave to \u201c try the validity of claims \u201d by the institution of proper proceedings 'is, indeed, purely directory. If, when proceedings 'have been instituted, they are erroneous in any respect, objection can then be taken and judgment can be had. As the case now stands, the court sees nothing in this point that requires consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The other matter of appeal is the judgment that, \"as matter of law, * * * Joseph Whaley was divested of the stock represented by scrip 7, by endorsing the same to H. G. Loper, cashier, and the subsequent sale of the stock by Loper in pursuance of his contract with Joseph Whaley.\u201d Whatever may be the room to argue, generally, that power of attorney is revoked by the death of the donor, it does not affect the conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>\u2022arrived at in this case. If the stock had not been transferred and sold, and the bank were now to bring an action upon the facts as found, the executor would be ordered to make the transfer. If nothing has been which the court would not have ordered to be done, it is not the disposition of the court of equity'to have it all undone because of immaterial informalities. The creditors have no rights which Joseph Whaley would not have had. \u201cA \u2022creditor is not a purchaser, and cannot assert any right.that could not have been enforced by the debtor. Hence an assignment' which is valid as between the parties will also be good against \u2022creditors. <em>Westoby </em>v. <em>Day, </em>2 <em>Ellis &amp; Bl. </em>605. And it has been held to follow that the delivery of a certificate of stock to a purchaser, attended with a power of attorney to transfer, will confer .a right that cannot be impeached or set aside by a subsequent execution or attachment against the vendor.\u201d <em>Ryall </em>v. <em>Rowles, Lead. Cas. in Eq. Part II., Vol. II., (4th ed.) </em>1661; <em>Id., p. </em>90; <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>2 <em>Rich. Eq. </em>179; <em>Moss </em>v. <em>Bratton, </em>5 <em>Rich. .Eq. </em>1. The rights of a creditor are subordinate to equitable as well as legal rights against the debtor. <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Campbell, supra. </em>The testator had signed the scrip in blank, and delivered it. It makes no difference whether the sale or pledge was made in person by the legal owner or by a party to whom he delivers it with a blank power. The pledge in this case seems to have been made by the party to whom delivery had been made by the original or legal owner. There is no difference between a sale and a pledge on the point now in question. There is no question about the right to redeem; no objection to the price for which the stock was sold, and no fraud charged. The sole question is that propounded in the order remanding the case, viz., Had the testator been divested of his title, and was the right of ownership in another at the time of testator\u2019s death? If he had been divested of his title, that is an end of the matter so far as these appellants are concerned, and that is all that is before the court for consideration. The bank came honestly into possession of the endorsed certificate in the ordinary course.of business, \u201cand is entitled to hold it against him who passed it, or enabled another to pass it to him.\u201d <em>State Bank </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>11 <em>Rich. Eq. </em>344. There is no real difference between that case of the <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Cox </em>and this case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>The power of attorney in each instance was blank. The fact that in <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Cox </em>there was a form of a power, and in this case nothing, is a distinction without a difference. Each was lacking until something was written by the holder over the signature of the endorser, so that in legal effect they are the same. The death of Joseph Whaley makes no difference. The executor-of Madame Szeniere would have had no more power than she possessed. &lt; All the authorities agree, though some go much further, that the delivery of the certificate of stock, endorsed with a blank power, and for value, is an equitable assignment which binds the legal owner, and that it arises from a power coupled with an interest which is irrevocable during the lifetime, and is <em>not </em>revoked by the death of the legal owner. The case of' <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Bousmamer, </em>8 <em>Wheat. </em>174, was decided upon the ground that the power was <em>not </em>coupled with an interest, and therefore did not amount to an equitable assignment. The delivery of the certificate of stock constitutes an equitable assignment, for the reason that the certificate is the muniment or evidence of title, and its delivery is symbolical delivery of the stock. <em>Angel\u00ed &amp; Ames on Corp., </em>\u00a7 564. The right of the bank against the creditors of' the testator is the same for purposes of defence as it would have been against him in his lifetime, and the city council is entitled, as against the claims of these creditors, to any defence which the bank might have. The creditors have no interest in the stock which Joseph Whaley had not when he died. Joseph Whaley unquestionably had assigned the certificates, and that constituted an equitable assignment of the stock. The bank could have compelled the city to transfer the stock. The city has only done what the court would have ordered to be done, and has in nowise damaged the creditors, and is not amenable to them for its conduct in the matter. With regard to the regulations on the subject of transfer, it is unnecessaiy to add anything to the conclusions stated by the Circuit judge and those reached by the court in <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Cox, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">This case involves only the question as to the rights of the creditors. The moment the equitable assignment has been ascertained their rights are concluded. The legal owner would have been estopped, and they have no rights which he had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>at the time of his death, or when, in his lifetime, liens were fixed upon the specific property. An equitable assignment is good between the parties; and, all having notice, the formal transfer in the mode prescribed by the charter or the regulations is binding on all parties. <em>Sabin </em>v. <em>Bank of </em>Woodstock, 21 <em>Vt. </em>353, cited in 2 <em>Lead. Cas. in Eq. </em>1665. The case of <em>Merchants\u2019 Bank of Canada </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>recently decided in the New York Court of Appeals, and relied on by the appellants, is not in conflict with the principles in <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Cox, supra, </em>or in <em>McNeill </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>46 <em>N. Y. </em>325. If the attorney in that case had acted upon his power, as the real owner, the stock would have been <em>bound; </em>but he, in fact, claimed <em>not </em>to be the owner of the stock, and failed to show authority to borrow money on it for the real owner. There is no evidence that William Whaley gave notice to the bank that he was not the real owner of the stock, and the blank endorsement is direct evidence that he is the real owner by virtue of an equitable assignment. Besides, <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Cox, supra, </em>is conclusive on the point, and we feel no disposition to question its authority. The language of the Circuit judge that <em>\u201c </em>Joseph Whaley was divested * * * by endorsing the same [the scrip] to H. G. Loper,\u201d Ac., refers not to the actual transaction, but to the legal effect of the endorsement. When the transfer is made by virtue of a blank power, it must be treated in law as an assignment from the one who was the legal owner to the person who becomes the legal owner by transfer on the books of the corporation. There is, therefore, no material discrepancy between the facts and the conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">It is contended by the appellants that the city council is confined to the issues made in the pleadings, and that the defence now relied on is not alleged in the answer. There is nothing in the objection. The issue on which the second trial was had, with the consent of all parties, was framed by the order of this, court remanding the case for trial upon the point stated. In the answer, however, there is a denial of Section 9 of the complaint, which constitutes a general denial of the title to the stock, and under this the defence could have' been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Other exceptions taken were not pressed in the argument, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>it seems unnecessary to state further the reasons upon which the rulings of the Circuit judge are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The judgment is affirmed.
