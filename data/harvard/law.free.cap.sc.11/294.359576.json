Renwick was entitled only to a life estate in the property willed to her; that the plaintiffs, her sons and only children, were entitled to an absolute estate in remainder therein; that no part of the share of the said Rosannah P. had ever been delivered to her in her lifetime, or to the plaintiffs since her death; that there was due the' plaintiffs the sum of $4527.96, with interest from January 31st, 1850, as appeared from returns of the said administrators of John Rogers, and that the administrators had wasted the assets of the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-14\">And the complaint prayed judgment for the sum of $4527.96, with interest from January 31st, 1850, for an account for costs and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-15\">The defendants answered, denied that the plaintiffs had such an estate as they claimed, and insisted that the said Rosannah <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>took an estate in fee simple absolute under the will. They also insisted that the estate of Hosannah went into the possession of her husband, and that his marital rights attached thereto. And they further claimed the protection of the statute of limitations, because the cause of action did not accrue to either of the plaintiffs within four years before the commencement of their action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-5\">The clauses of the will construed by the court are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-6\">3. I give, devise and bequeath' to my daughter, Eosannah P.

I reserve a life estate in all my other property, and at my death I wish my other negroes fairly appraised and given off to my children in families, as they can best agree among themselves ; if not, sold and divided as above stated; the rest and residue of my other property to be sold and divided in four equal parts among my aforesaid children, and if any of my daughters should die without leaving children, their property hereby given to be divided in four equal parts, one part to be retained by their husbands, and the other three parts to come back to my other children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-8\">Hi H* H* sfc H&lt; H*</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-9\">By the fourth clause of the will, the only land of which testator died seized was directed to be sold; and counsel agreed that it was thereby converted into personalty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-10\">The Circuit judge decided that John R. Eenwick was barred by the statute of limitations; that James E. Eenwick was not so barred; that, under the will, Eosannah P. Eenwick took a life estate, with remainder in fee to her sons, the plaintiffs ; that the marital rights of W. W. Eenwick did not attach to her share. And the decree referred it to the clerk to take an account in conformity with such rulings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-11\">Erom this decree John E. Eenwick appealed, upon the ground that he is not barred by the statute. And all the defendants ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>pealed, upon the grounds that the statute of limitations barred James E. Renwick; that the said Rosannah P. took an absolute, indefeasible estate under the will; and that the marital rights of her husband, the said <em>W. ~W. </em>Renwick, attached to her share.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b312-5\"><em>Mr. J. F. J. Caldwell, </em>for plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-6\">An administrator or other fiduciary, and the sureties on his bond, cannot claim the benefit of the statute of limitations against the <em>eestuis que trust. Ang. on Lim., </em>\u00a7 166, <em>et seq.; </em>2 Desaws. 54; 4 <em>Strob. Eq. </em>207. The only qualification allowed of this rule is where some act is done by the fiduciary purporting to be a termination or disavowal of the trust. 4 <em>Rich. Eq. </em>60 ; 4 <em>Strob. Eq. </em>189; <em>Bail. Eq. </em>195; 1 <em>Strob. Eq. </em>79; 2 <em>Strob. </em>Eq. 334; 3 <em>Strob. Eq. </em>39; 3 <em>Rich. L. </em>438; 14 <em>Rich. Eq. </em>176. But this case is like none of these. He states the balance due, but does not profess to have paid them. If the statute did bar, it would only bar an accounting, not a demand of balance admitted to be on hand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-7\">II. The second question is whether Rosannah P. Renwick took a life estate under John Rogers\u2019 will, the remainder being in his sons, the plaintiffs, or whether she took an absolute estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-8\">It is indisputable \u2014 since <em>Bampley </em>v. <em>Blower, 3 Ath. </em>396 ; <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Archer, Bail. Eq. </em>535; <em>Nix </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>5 <em>Rich. L. </em>423 \u2014 &gt; that a devise or bequest to one and his or her children or issue, with a limitation over, in case of the death of the first taker without having issue, operates to create a purchase, and not an inheritance, on the part of such children or issue, and thereby creates a life estate in the first taker and an estate in remainder in the children, after the death of the first taker. On the other hand, it is conceded that a bare bequest or devise to one, with a limitation over in case of that one dying without issue, will create a fee simple in the first taker, subject only to the condition of children being born to him or her, and that upon the happening of that event, the estate of the first taker becomes absolute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-9\">The question here is, which of such two provisions did John Rogers really make ? If the fifth clause of the will is taken by itself, it is not unreasonable to say that the later provision is intended. If the will is taken as a whole, it is submitted that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>former ease is provided; for, by combining the third and the fifth clauses, we make devises and bequests to Rosannah Renwick and her children, and if she should die without leaving children,, then over to her husband and her brothers and sisters, in equal shares. It is conceded that a simple conveyance or devise, without further description, confers an estate in fee simple absolute; that dubious provisions of a will shall be construed in favor of the heir-at-law; and that an absolute and certain gift of property shall not be thwarted by mere conjecture as to the grantor\u2019s intention. But the paramount rules in the construction of wills-are, that the intention of the testator, unless in direct contravention of the established principles, shall be consulted and carried out; and that the whole will shall be construed together.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-5\">The following authorities declare the necessity of reading the whole will together, in order to arrive at the intention of the testator, and also to show that it is the intention of the testator that is to govern the case. 2 <em>Ves., Jr., </em>329; 10 <em>Bao. Ab. </em>533; 2 <em>Paige </em>122; <em>Bail. Eq. </em>517 ; 10 <em>Bao.

And where words of description of an estate devised are postponed to the end of a clause, it has been held that they might apply to a devise in an earlier portion of it, although gifts are separately made to the devisee. 5 <em>East </em>87; 10 <em>Bioh.

If her estate had been absolute, plaintiffs would still be-entitled to two-thirds of it, for W. W. Renwick never reduced his wife\u2019s share into possession. The facts show that he did not. <em>Spann </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>1 <em>Hill Ch. </em>326, does not apply, for in that case both husband and wife administered.

But words which, as to lands, would create a fee conditional, as to personalty give an absolute estate. 6 <em>Term R. </em>307; 4 <em>Rich. Eq. </em>378.

These positions are conceded, but it is contended in reply that <em>she, </em>where it last occurs in Section 3, means <em>she and her Children; </em>and that the third and fifth clauses must be construed together, and then governed by principle of <em>Read </em>v. <em>Snell </em>and <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Archer.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-15\"><em>a. </em>The case in first <em>JDesaus. </em>355, relied on, is. a good illustration of true rule as to first point: it must be a <em>\u201c </em>palpable mistake.\u201d But see 4 <em>McC. </em>418; 6 <em>Mwnf. </em>114; 1 <em>Breo. </em>414; 1 <em>Jarman on Wills </em>432; <em>Id. </em>745, <em>Rule </em>19.,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number><em>b. </em>The mistake on the second point arises from looking for his actual intent, whereas we can only ascertain his legal intent. <em>O\u2019Hara on Wills, oh.

What are these certain rules ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-10\">Rule 3, in <em>Sm. on B. &amp; P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AK3\">This action is by the personal representatives of a devisee under the will of John Rogers, for an account against the administrators of W. W. Renwiek and C. S. Beard, who took out letters of administration <em>oum testamento annexo </em>on the estate of the testator, John Rogers, the executor named in his will having renounced the executorship, and against the administrator of James Rogers.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The first question to be considered is whether the demand is barred by the statute of limitations. The Circuit decree holds that the plaintiff, James E. Renwiek, is hot barred, but that the plaintiff, J. R. Renwiek, was so barred. The plaintiff, J. R., excepts to this decision, and the defendants to that holding that \u25a0J. E. is not barred. The question is whether there was such a termination of the office and duty of the administrators that the plaintiffs were bound to bring action within the time limited by the statute after such termination. The only evidence of such a fact is the circumstance that an account was. presented to the Ordinary, intended, no doubt, as a full and final account, to which is appended the following note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">\u201c Court or ORDINARY, 18th August, 1851.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">\u201cPersonally appeared before me W. W. Renwiek, administrator of John Renwiek, with the will annexed, who proves \u2022their return by his own oath, but produces no vouchers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-10\">\u201c B. JOHNSTON, O. U. D.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">It does not appear that the plaintiffs were cited to an accounting, or that they had notice of the filing of the account, nor that the administrators <em>cum testamento annexo </em>ever filed their vouchers, -or that the Ordinary passed upon the accounts or made any decree in the matter. It is clear that this was not a final discharge \u25a0of the duties incident to administration. It was part of the duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>of the administrators to account for the estate of their testator that came to their hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Filing an account is not in itself a compliance with the whole of this duty. It is at most furnishing the basis of the accounting, the object of the accounting being to verify or falsify its statements. To make that accounting final, it was necessary that the parties entitled to question the account filed should have an opportunity afforded them, by proper notice, to exercise that right, and that final action should be taken on the account by the Ordinary. This was not done; .and the administrators <em>cum testamento annexo, </em>as represented by their administrators, must be considered as not having discharged themselves of the duty of accounting. Under this view, the statute of limitations cannot be regarded as having barred either of the plaintiffs, and the decree is, in that respect, erroneous. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The authorities bearing on the conclusions just presented will now be considered. <em>Riddle </em>v. <em>Riddle, </em>5 <em>Rich. Eq. </em>32. In this case, one of the questions was as to the commencement of the statute to run upon an administrator\u2019s accounting. Chancellor Dunkin says : <em>\u201c </em>If an <em>ex parte </em>return to the Ordinary, in which an executor or administrator strikes a balance against the estate, should be regarded as a discharge of his trust, from which the-statute would run, as against a bill to account, it would be an alarming disclosure, as well to creditors as to legatees and distributees of the deceased.\u201d It was held that the trust continuing, the statute was not a bar. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>1 <em>Hill </em>Ch. 25. In this case it was held that even a decree of the Ordinary, taken <em>ex parte, </em>was not binding on the parties as an estoppel; that, to make it binding as an estoppel, it should appear that there was a proceeding either upon citation or the voluntary submission of the parties sought to be bound thereby. The result of this decision is to hold that the duty of accounting was not fully performed, even where there had been an actual accounting, and a decree based upon it, as affecting parties entitled to notice of such accounting, and who had not received such notice, or expressly waived their rights. That duty being still obligatory, administration was still existing, and the statute did. not rim. <em>Long </em>v. <em>Cason, </em>4 <em>Rich. Eq. </em>60. In this case the authority of <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Alexander </em>was recognized, but the question of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>statute of limitations then raised depended on the fact that the guardian had been removed and a new guardian appointed, so that the statute commenced to run in favor of the guardian removed, and against the new guardian at the time of removal. It was held that this was such a termination of the trust that the statute bad then commenced to run. <em>Crosby </em>v. Crosby, 1 <em>S. C. </em>337. The decision in this case is entirely consistent with the foregoing, although the question of the statute of limitations went off on the ground that the administrator, being also guardian of the infant plaintiff, he could not take advantage of the statute, when, in his character of guardian, he was chargeable with whatever delay had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The currency of-the statute does not necessarily depend upon the fact of a full and final discharge of the duty of the administration. It commences to 'run when it appears that the administration has done some act, brought to the notice of the parties affected by it, equivalent to an abandonment of such office, although such act may be in itself wrongful. But the case before us presents no such state of things. The only question \u2022 raised is whether the office and duty of the administrator ceased by a full discharge of all its duties at a certain time, and that question has already been disposed of.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The next question is, what estate did Bosannah P. Benwiek take under the will of John Bogers ? The question, as presented to us, assumes that the entire distributable estate is to be regarded as personalty, and the will will be considered in its bearing on personal property alone. The third paragraph of the will is a gift of personalty and realty to Bosannah P. Benwiek <em>\u201c </em>and her children.\u201d She had no child born alive prior to the death of the testator. The bequest imports an immediate gift to children, and as there was no child to take as purchaser at the death of the testator, children born after that event could only take by descent, as issue. Hence, as it regards realty, the devise imported a fee conditional. As it regards personalty, the condition attached to the fee, viz*, that the estate should descend to the issue of the first taker, <em>per formara doni, </em>was impossible, as the law did not permit such a descent in the case of personalty, and as the condition was a condition subsequent, following the ordinary rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>as to conditions subsequent,'the fee, unburdened of tbe condition, remained absolute. This would give Rosannah P. an absolute estate in the personalty. The foundation of the conclusion just stated is in the first resolution in Wild\u2019s case. 6 <em>Colce\u2019s R. 17. </em>The doctrine has been uniformly applied in this state. It will only be necessary to cite <em>Shearman </em>v. <em>Angel, Bail. Eq. </em>351, and <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Archer, Id. </em>535, with the observation that the exposition of the doctrine of the last-named case that appears in <em>Hay </em>v. <em>Hay, </em>4 <em>Rich. Eq. </em>384, is essential to a correct understanding of the true result of that case. Under the third paragraph standing alone there is no limitation over on the failure of issue, and. therefore no mode of referring to the intricacies that are found in the cases growing out of the different views that have been taken of the effect of a limitation over both, upon the character of the first estate and the sense of the terms by which it is created. But it is contended that the- last portion of the third paragraph be read as follows: \u201c And at that time/\u2019 meaning the death of the testator, \u201cshe and her children are to receive an equal part,\u201d &amp;c. The proposition is that the words \u201cand her children\u201d should be interpolated after the word \u201cshe\u201d as the words stand in the will, so as to read in the manner just recited. It is obvious that such an interpolation would not help the sense of that paragraph. The testator must be regarded as using these words immediately prior to his death, and as at that time there was no child of Rosannah <em>in esse, </em>and as he must be regarded as intending an immediate devise at his death to children, such disposition could not take effect except by taking children to mean issue, who could take by descent. It will not be necessary to follow the elaborate argument of counsel upon the grounds for correcting the expressions of a will by the underlying intent gathered from other parts of the will. But it will not be amiss to remark that much of the uncertainty that exists as to the application of the various authorities on the subject arises from overlooking the fact that the rules of interpreting technical words, used in a will, have been applied to phrases and connected expressions as importing some known mode of disposition. Technical words, even when employed in a will, are to be taken in the technical sense as their primary sense, and such sense must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>be corrected, if at all, by finding the testator\u2019s glossary or controlling intention in the context. Certain forms of expression employed by testators have been placed upon the same ground as technical words in this respect, and in their primary sense, considered as formula, must be taken to have the meaning imputed to them by the adjudicated cases, and the correction of the apparent sense must be reached under the rules applicable to technical words already referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">It is also contended that certain words employed in the fifth paragraph of the will are to be read as qualifying the gift in the third paragraph, by limiting over the estate there given upon the condition of Rosannah dying without leaving children. The portion of the fifth paragraph in question reads as follows:. \u201cThe rest and residue of my other property to be sold and divided in four equal parts among my aforesaid children; and if any of my daughters should die without leaving children, their property, hereby given to be divided into four equal parts,\u201d etc. The will thus disposes of these parts. In the first place this purports to be a residuary clause, and the words \u201c hereby given \u201d must be regarded, in the first instance, as referring to that property which is directly disposed of under the residuary clause. That property is characterized by the word \u201c other,\u201d which, when used in a residuary clause, naturally excludes all property the subject of prior express devises in the preceding parts of the will. Grammatical considerations must be of undoubted actual force to undo this <em>sense; </em>if at best they are conjectural, the primary sense of the terms remains. It will not be necessary to consider how the clause may be affected by its grammatical relation to its immediate antecedent as a conclusive argument, for allowing \u201c other \u201d to have its ordinary force is found in the character of the express dispositions. If the devises that precede the residuary clause are carefully examined, it will be found that they leave undisposed of an undivided one-fourth part of the entire estate, real and personal, after deducting specific devises and bequests, and to this undisposed-of interest the residuary clause must be regarded as \u25a0intended to be applied. This construction finds a necessary office for such a residuary clause as this purports on its face to be, and thus affords the highest ground for the construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>already represented. It must bes concluded that the limitation over contained in the fifth paragraph is inapplicable to the bequest-contained in the third paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The remaining question arises upon the facts that the husband of Eosannah P. administered with the will annexed on the estate-of the testator and converted the estate into cash, and that during his administration and during the life of his wife, he wasted the assets of the estate, and finally that he survived his wife. This fact of wasting the assets is set up in the seventh cause of the complaint, and its force is not destroyed by anything that is presented in the case. The plaintiffs can only claim as the distributees of their mother, as it regards the property of which she took an absolute estate, as already determined. Claiming through their mother, they can only claim what she could have claimed had she survived her husband. She could not have claimed compensation out of her husband\u2019s estate at large on the ground that he had wasted assets appertaining, to her personal estate,, which he had the right to reduce to possession. <em>Spann </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>1 <em>Hill Ch. </em>326; <em>Wardlaw </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>2 <em>Hill Ch. </em>644. The cases in this state all hold that the right of a distributee, as against the administrator upon whom the title to the personalty devolves by law, is a mere chose in action, until perfected through the act of the administrator. <em>Spann </em>v. <em>Stewart, supra; Sturgineger </em>v. <em>Hannah, 2 N. &amp; McC. 147. </em>The same rule is applied to a legatee and the executor, the legatee having a mere chose in action until assent to the legacy by the executor. <em>Cannon </em>v. <em>Ulmer, Bail. Eq. </em>204. As such, there must be a reduction to possession under the marital rights before such chose passes out of the estate of the wife. Where the husband, as administrator or executor, gets possession of the estate out of which his wife is entitled, as distributee or legatee, there is no reduction to possession as long as that estate remains specifically in the hands of such executor or administrator, or in some form in which it can be identified as appertaining to the decedent\u2019s estate, and neither the payment of debts, nor assent, distribution or partition has been made. But no case holds that after the decedent\u2019s estate has gone out of the possession of the executor, either the wife or her representatives can hold the estate of her deceased husband <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>amenable to make good\" her interest in assets wasted, while the \u00a1authority of the cases already cited for the purpose is directly to \u00a1the contrary. It would be manifestly inconsistent to allege at \u2022the same time that the husband had not reduced her choses to possession, and that he had appropriated and wasted them.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">It is clear that the plaintiffs are not entitled to an account for \u2022any portion of the estate derived from their mother, through the third paragraph .of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The decree mugt be reversed and the cause remanded to the 'Circuit Court for proceedings conformable herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Decree reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b323-8\">McIver and Haskell, A.
