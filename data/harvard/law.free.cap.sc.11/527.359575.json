The defendant, A. G. Rice, claims that he is entitled to be first paid out of the proceeds of sale of Greenfield and White-house plantations the sum of $6500, with interest from the 29th of June 1871, on the ground that the plaintiffs hold the mortgages as trustees for the payment of the note held by him; the transfer of the note to him by Pringle &amp; Son, carrying with it the equitable assignment of so much of the account due by the Pringles to Pringle &amp; Son, secured by the bonds of indemnity. The whole theory of the claim is based on the supposition that Pringle &amp; Son were the sureties of the Pringle family (the makers of the note,) and that the defendant, Rice, is entitled to any securities which the surety might hold, upon the failure of the principal to pay the debt. The note was given either in payment of so much of the account as stood against the makers on the books of Pringle <em>&amp; </em>Son, or to enable Pringle <em>&amp; </em>Son to raise money. If for the payment of the account, then so much as it represented was extinguished; and if extinguished, there could have been not only no equitable assignment, but no legal assignment of the same. As matters of law, I find that if the note was given as representing any portion of the accounts due by the Pringles to Pringle &amp; Son, it was in payment of the same, made so by the subsequent transfer to the defendant, A. G. Rice; for by this act they put the note out of their possession and beyond their control, and thereby extinguished that portion of the account which it represented. Although the receiving of a note is not payment, unless received as such, yet if the creditor place the note beyond his power and control, so that it cannot be delivered up to be canceled, the note is payment and the original cause of action is extinguished. <em>Townsend &amp; Arnold </em>v. <em>Stevenson &amp; Walker, </em>4 <em>Rich. </em>59. And the same rule was made in the case of <em>Christian </em>v. <em>Johnson, Adm\u2019r., 2 Bail. </em>575. So, then, if the note represented any portion of the account then due, the parting with it by Pringle &amp; Son operated as a payment. But if the note was given to James R. Pringle for the purpose of raising money, and not with reference to the account, it was an independent transaction, and in no way connected with the bonds of indemnity now held by the plaintiffs; and if not connected, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>then there can be no equity by which the defendant, Rice, can maintain his claim that the bonds are held by the plaintiffs as trustees for him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-5\">The conditions and covenants of the bonds are too plain to leave any doubt on this point, for they were solely to save harmless Pringle &amp; Son for any moneys which they might advance to the obligors on their individual accounts, or on account of their planting operations, under neither of which could the note be placed \u2014 if an independent transaction between them \u2014 and certainly Adger &amp; Co., the assignees, who took these bonds at a valuation obtained from the books of account of Pringle <em>&amp; </em>Son (which were made the standard of value by the obligators), the equity (if any) of the defendant, Rice, cannot prevail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-6\">Besides this, the bonds of indemnity were not given to Pringle &amp; Son as sureties, but as principals, and they dealt with them as such when they transferred them to Adger <em>&amp; </em>Co. for the sum of $30,000, since ascertained, by a sale of the property, to be three \u25a0 times their value. And, in purchasing the bonds and mortgages, Adger &amp; Co. ascertained the sums due thereunder by referring to the accounts of the obligors, in all respects complying with the contract between the parties as contained in the said bonds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-7\">The claim of the defendant, Rice, must therefore be disallowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-8\">The defendants, J. M. Eason &amp; Bro., Smith &amp; Valk, Boll-man Bros., and Edwin Bates &amp; Co., make similar claims. These claims stand on even more untenable grounds than that of the defendant, Rice, for the debts were contracted after the assignment of the bonds and mortgages to Adger &amp; Co., and after the securities had been exhausted by Pringle &amp; Son, and until paid, and they were not a charge by Pringle <em>&amp; </em>Son against'the obligors of the bonds. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>40 <em>Barb. </em>325.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-9\">These claims are therefore not allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-10\">II. On behalf of the defendants, Mrs. Mary A. Lide, B. N. Lide and Mrs. Anna J. Gadsden, it is claimed, that holding debts against the ancestor of the obligors of the bonds (his heirs) they have a statutory lien, which should be satisfied before the bonds of indemnity given by the heirs, and secured by the property descended, are paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-11\">I have been unable to find any authority for the position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>taken by these defendants. On the contrary, the statute expressly provides that when the lands are <em>bona fide </em>aliened, set over or transferred by the heir before action brought against him, the descended lands shall not be liable to an execution issued or a judgment obtained against him on account of a debt due by his ancestor, but that the heir shall be liable to the extent of the value of the lands so aliened. This, then, is entirely inconsistent with the idea that the creditor of the ancestor has a lien, statutory or otherwise, upon his lands in or out of the possession of the heir. The creditor can, in a proper suit brought against the heir in possession, or against the executor or administrator, if the heir be out of possession, subject the real estate of the ancestor to the payment of his debt; but beyond this the law gives him no power or lien over or on the lands of his deceased debtor, and if the heir alien, before such suit is brought, the creditor can recover, not from the purchaser, but only from the heir, the value of the lands so aliened. In this case the heirs of John Julius Izard Pringle, <em>bona fide, </em>and for a valuable consideration, mortgaged the lands descended, and this brings us to an issue made, and upon the determination of which the claims of Mrs. Mary A. Lide, B. N. Lide and Mrs. Anna J. Gadsden depend, to wit: Is a mortgage by the heir, before suit brought against him, such an alienation of his ancestors\u2019 real estate as would prevent the same being taken on execution, on a judgment recovered against the heir in possession, upon a debt due by his ancestor ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b551-4\">Upon the death of John Julius Izard Pringle, the fee to his real estate passed into his heirs-at-law, his widow, two sons and daughter, and they certainly had the right (until suit brought by a creditor of his) to deal with it as their own. If they had conveyed the property absolutely, for a valuable consideration and <em>bona fide, </em>to Pringle &amp; Son, there could have been no question between the defendants, Mrs. Lide, B. N. Lide and Mrs. Gadsden, and the purchasers. But by the mortgages, though the lands were not absolutely conveyed, the heirs did sell, alien and make over to Pringle <em>&amp; </em>Son certain estate in the lands, which they could not again recover except upon the compliance with certain conditions. For this Pringle &amp; Son have given a valu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>able consideration, and, so far as that consideration extends, stand on the same footing as if they had absolutely purchased the land. Mortgagees are purchasers <em>pro tanto, </em>and as such are entitled as against the creditors of the ancestor and his legatees. <em>Haynsworth </em>v. <em>Bisehojf, </em>6 <em>Rich.

These bonds were destroyed by fire after the death of the obligor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-11\">The referee finds, as matters of fact, that for these bonds other bonds were executed by all the heirs of the original obligor, and that these new bonds were in substitution of the original bonds, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>and were not accepted by the holders in payment of the original bonds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-5\">I concur with the referee in this finding. It follows that the Gadsden and Lide bonds are a charge upon the estate of J. J. I. Pringle. See <em>Drake, Clerk, </em>v. <em>Mitehell, </em>3 <em>East </em>251; <em>MeDu/re </em>v. <em>Askew, </em>5 <em>Rich.

Are the Gadsden and Lide bonds postponed, in the order of payment, to this bond and mortgage ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-7\">James E. Pringle himself testifies that he knew of the existence of the bonds, both before and after the substitution of the new bonds. He certainly, therefore, cannot bring himself within the rule that protects an innocent purchaser for valuable consideration without notice. Nor is his assignee on a better footing. James E. Pringle says, \u201c I transferred them [the bond and mortgage] to Adger <em>&amp; </em>Co. because I owed them money, and because they had endorsed for me.\u201d Adger &amp; Co., therefore, did not take the bond and mortgage for cash paid to Pringle, but to cover an antecedent indebtedness of Pringle to them, and took them, therefore, with the same rights under them that Pringle had, and no more.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-8\">I therefore find, as matter of law, that the Gadsden and Lide bonds are not postponed to the bonds and mortgages to James E.

Eice, is the holder of a promissory note, made by the same persons who executed the above-mentioned bond and mortgage to James E. Pringle &amp; Son. This note was made payable to James E. Pringle, endorsed by him to James E. Pringle <em>&amp; </em>Son, and endorsed by them to A. G. Eice, on the 13th of April, 1871, as a collateral.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-10\">At the time this note was made, the makers were lawfully indebted to James E. Pringle &amp; Son for advances. To secure payment for these advances, the bond and mortgage above referred to had been executed on the 31st of March, 1870. The note was given to enable James E. Pringle &amp; Son \u201cto raise money and lighten the account \u201d of the makers. There was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>other consideration for the note. The note therefore represented the account <em>pro tanto, </em>and, while in the hands of James P. Pringle &amp; Son, was protected by the bond and mortgage, as he had his remedy either upon the account or note, as he might \u25a0elect. When he endorsed the note to Rice, the account <em>pro tanto, </em>in a sense, was extinguished; that is, James R. Pringle &amp; Son no longer had any remedy upon that part of the account represented by the note endorsed to Rice, simply because they had transferred to Rice a remedy to collect an amount of money represented both by the account and note, and as the debtors could be compelled to pay it only once, it would be a fraud upon Rice to allow Pringle to collect the account and leave the note in Rice\u2019s hands, valueless. It cannot be said that the account, to the amount of the note, was finally and forever extinguished in the sense of having been paid, for if Pringle <em>&amp; </em>Son had paid the note to Rice, and resumed possession and ownership of it, their remedies upon the account would have instantly revived.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-4\">The account, therefore, was not extinguished in the sense of being paid, by the transfer of the note to <em>Rice; </em>and as the note represented a part of the debt secured by the bond and mortgage, the note is still protected by the bond and mortgage, after its endorsement. to Rice, and in his hands. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Eaves, </em>10 <em>Rich.

So if the .books mislead an assignee, it is the fault of Pringle &amp; Son, and the assignee takes the bond and mortgage subject to what the books ought to show, and this is more especially so when he takes these securities to cover an antecedent debt and of the assignor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>The debt of the Pringles to James E.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEB\">The first question which we propose to consider is, whether the objection raised by the appellant, A. G. Eice, to the making of Mrs. Lide and Miss Gadsden parties, can be sustained. This objection, it is to be observed, was not raised by any pleading, but was for the first time, taken in the argument before the referee. It is based upon the ground that the action was brought simply for foreclosure of the several mortgages mentioned in the complaint, and that to such an action these persons, whose only claim is that of creditors of the ancestor of the mortgagors, could not be made parties. We do not consider, however, that this position can be sustained, for the reason upon which it rests is not, in our judgment, well founded. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>We do not regard the action as brought simply for the foreclosure of the mortgages. The agreement entered into by the several parties, through their attorneys, prior to the commencement of the action, the terms of which were substantially set forth in the complaint, together with the demand for relief, show very clearly that such was not the sole purpose of the action. It is very obvious that the numerous creditors of the Pringles saw that in any attempt to enforce their demands, whether against the ancestor or the heirs, many conflicting claims were likely to arise, which it would be necessary to have determined, and with a view to avoid multiplicity of suits and heavy expenses, they entered into the agreement above referred to. In pursuance of this agreement we find that the complaint states the claims of the various creditors, and prays judgment not merely for a foreclosure of the several mortgages, as in a case brought simply for that purpose, but also that the proceeds of the sales of the mortgaged property, after satisfying the costs and taxes, be applied \u201c to the payment of the amounts of principal and interest due on the bonds and mortgages held by the plaintiffs, <em>and the claims of the parties defendants, according to their relative priorities, and so far as the same may be established before this honorable court.\u201d </em>Accordingly an order was granted, by consent of the attorneys of the several parties, for the sale of the mortgaged premises, in which it was provided that the proceeds of the sale, after paying costs and expenses, should be turned over to the referee, \u201c to be distributed by him under the further orders of this court.\u201d This order also provided that until such sale should be effected the property should be placed in 'the hands of certain designated persons, to be planted and managed by them, and, after paying the expenses of such operations and the advances made for cultivating crops, &amp;c., that the net proceeds be held \u201csubject to the orders of this court, and to be distributed among the several parties hereto, as their several rights may appear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">While, therefore, one of the purposes of the action was to obtain judgment of foreclosure and sale, another was to have the various conflicting claims of the creditors adjudicated in this one action; and while these questions were in process of adjudication, the property, which was represented to be deteriorating in value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>and yielding no returns, was sold by the consent of all parties, and the proceeds representing such property was retained in the hands of the court, to be distributed or applied in accordance with the judgment of the court as to the relative priorities of the several claimants. The action may, therefore, be regarded as more in the nature of a creditor\u2019s bill, though not strictly such, rather than as an ordinary action to foreclose a mortgage of real estate, and so regarded all the grounds upon which it is contended that Mrs. Lide and Miss Gadsden were not proper parties, are clearly untenable. We think, therefore, that the objection raised by the appellant, Rice, even were it originally maintainable, comes too late, for we do not regard it as a question of jurisdiction, but rather as a question of pleading and practice, and, as such, consent of parties operates as a waiver of objections, which, otherwise, might be unanswerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">But, as the counsel for the appellant, Rice, contended so earnestly against the idea that the agreement, above referred to, should be regarded as a consent on his part to the making of improper parties, we will not rest our decision upon the effect of such agreement. We are satisfied that, even in the absence of any such agreement, Mrs. Lide and Miss Gadsden were <em>proper, </em>though not <em>necessary </em>parties to the action. There can be no doubt that all prior, as well as subsequent encumbrancers, while not <em>necessary </em>are <em>proper </em>parties to an action for the foreclosure of a mortgage of real estate, and in order that the land may produce its full value at the sale sought by such action for foreclosure, it is desirable that such encumbrancers should be made parties, for, if the prior encumbrancers are not made parties, the purchaser takes his title subject to the lien of such <em>encumbrancers; </em>and if the subsequent encumbrancers are not made parties, the purchaser buys subject to the right of such encumbrancers to redeem by paying off the antecedent encumbrances. Now, while a bond creditor of an ancestor cannot be said to have a lien, in the proper sense of that term, upon land in the hands of the heirs, inherited from the ancestor, yet he does have the right, by proper proceedings, to subject such land to the payment of his debt, and this right is called, in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Wightman, </em>2 <em>Hill </em>583, \u201c a constructive lienin <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Ghappell, </em>6 <em>S. C. </em>155-6, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>\u201ca charge;\u201d and in <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Huggins, </em>6 <em>8. C. </em>362, \u201can encumbrance.\u201d The same principle, therefore, upon which it has been held that a prior encumbrancer is a proper party to an action for the foreclosure of a mortgage of real estate, would seem to justify the making of a bond creditor of an ancestor a party to an action for the foreclosure of a mortgage on real estate descended, executed by the heir, the object in both cases being the same \u2014 to free the land from any lien or \u201c charge,\u201d or \u201c constructive lien,\u201d or \u201c encumbrance,\u201d so that the purchaser, obtaining a perfectly clear title, may be induced to bid the full value of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">It is true that it has been held, in the case of <em>Corning </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>6 <em>N. Y. </em>85, \u201cthat a person who claims <em>title </em>to the mortgaged premises, paramount to that of the mortgagor, cannot be made a party to an action to foreclose the mortgage in order that the validity of such title may be tried in such action.\u201d But whether this decision rested upon the idea which at one time prevailed, that even under the code it would be improper to unite in one action an application for legal relief with one for equitable relief, which, however, has Since been repudiated, (see comments on <em>Reuben </em>v. <em>Joel, </em>13 <em>N. Y. </em>488; in the subsequent case of <em>New York Ice Company </em>v. <em>Northwest Insurance Company </em>359, and <em>Pomeroy on Remedies </em>95, \u00a7 76,) it is necessary for us now to inquire, as the persons who are objected to here as improper parties do not claim <em>title </em>to the mortgaged premises adverse to that of the mortgagor, but only claim a right to subject such premises to the payment of their debt, by reason of the fact that it has descended to the mortgagor, subject to a charge for such debt. In other words, they only claim as prior encumbrancers, as it were, by virtue of their constructive lien, as it has been.called. We think, therefore, that, aside from any agreement among the parties, Mrs. Lide and Miss Gadsden were proper parties to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The fact that the plaintiffs, after the commencement of the action, announced at one of the references that they \u201c withdrew their claim as against Mrs. Mary A. Lide, B. N. Lide and Miss Anna J. Gadsden,\u201d cannot, in our opinion, have the effect contended for, of dismissing complaint as to these parties. This announcement was, doubtless, designed as nothing more than an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>admission of the validity of the claims of Mrs. Lide and Miss Gadsden, and a declaration that they declined further to contest them, and it can have no other effect, so far as the question we are considering is concerned. What the effect may be, if, as is contended, they are trustees for Rice, so far as their duties and liabilities to their <em>cestui que trust </em>are concerned, we are not now called upon to consider. The plaintiffs certainly could not, of their own motion, at that stage of the case, probably after the land had been sold, dismiss the complaint as to these parties, and thereby imperil, if not defeat, their right to go either upon the land or the proceeds of the sale for the satisfaction of their debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The rule in equity is that it is within the discretion of the court to refuse a plaintiff permission to dismiss his bill- if the dismissal would- work a prejudice to the other parties; and whenever, in the progress of a cause, a defendant entitles himself to a decree, either against the plaintiff or a c\u00f3-defendant, and the dismissal of the bill would subject him to the expense and trouble of bringing a new suit and making his proofs anew, such dismissal will not be permitted. <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>1 <em>Rich. Eq. </em>292; <em>Ancker </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>3 <em>Strob. Eq. </em>210.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">We propose next to inquire whether the bonds held by Mrs. Lide and Miss Gadsden are mere renewals of the original bonds of the ancestor, or whether such original bonds have been paid or extinguished by the taking of the bonds of the heirs. This, in our judgment, is mainly a question of fact. The rule of law is well established that where a creditor takes an obligation of inferior or equal rank, it does not extinguish, <em>ipso facto, </em>the prior obligation, as that only is payment which is intended and accepted as payment. Hence, when a creditor takes a new bond, <em>&lt;c </em>in substitution or renewal \u201d of a bond previously held by him, which has been lost or destroyed, the original debt or obligation is not extinguished unless it is made to appear that the creditor accepted such new bond in payment, and the burden of proof is upon him who asserts the fact that the new bond was taken in payment. This doctrine is so fully supported by the authorities in this state that it is only necessary to refer to a few of the cases: <em>Kelsey </em>v. <em>Roseborough, </em>3 <em>Rich. </em>244; <em>Fraser </em>v. <em>Hext, </em>2 <em>Strob. Eq. </em>258. These cases are entirely consistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>subsequent cases of <em>McLure </em>v. <em>Askew, </em>5 <em>Rich. Eq. </em>102, ancf <em>Kirkland </em>v. <em>Cureton, </em>4 <em>S. C. </em>122, for, though the substituted securities were, in both of the last-named cases, held to have operated as a satisfaction or extinguishment of the original debts, yet in both of them the decision was placed distinctly upon the ground that <em>the evidence showed that the papers substituted were accepted in payment of the original debts. </em>So that so far from weakening, they strengthen the authority of the preceding cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The question of fact having been decided by the referee, and his decision having been confirmed by the Circuit judge, theiidecision must be regarded by us as conclusive, unless it is without any testimony to sustain it, or is manifestly against the weight of the evidence, neither of which is the case in the present instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The Lide and Gadsden bonds must, therefore, be regarded as representing the debts of the ancestor, and, as was decided in the recent case of <em>Simons </em>v. <em>Bryce, </em>10 <em>S. C. </em>354, are entitled to priority of payment out of the funds now in the hands of the court arising from the sales of the Whitehouse and Greenfield plantations. As it appears, from the report of the referee, that these funds will not be sufficient to pay these bonds in full, it is scarcely necessary to consider the questions raised between the plaintiffs and the defendant, Rice, as they are not now of any practical importance. We may say, however, that we are disposed to agree with the Circuit judge in the view which he has-taken of these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b562-9\">Willaed, C.
