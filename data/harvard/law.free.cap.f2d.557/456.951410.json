Petitioner contends that it is appropriate, if this Court remands the case to the trial court to provide that that issue is no longer to be tried and that the new trial shall be limited to the valuation question dealt with in our opinion. We conclude that this is an appropriate request and on remand the issue of possible transfer of the patent in May of 1959 shall be taken as settled in favor of the taxpayer and shall not again be submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-21\">The petition for rehearing is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
