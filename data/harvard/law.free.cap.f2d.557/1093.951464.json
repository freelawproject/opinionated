On April 26,1976, a border patrol agent stopped Arrasmith at the permanent immigration checkpoint near Falfurrias, Texas. The agent smelled marijuana, searched Arrasmith\u2019s car, and seized the evidence. The district court denied Arrasmith\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-10\">On appeal Arrasmith does not claim the search was illegal. At permanent checkpoints agents may make stops without probable cause or reasonable suspicion, <em>United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 U.S. 543, 96 S.Ct. 3074, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116 (1976), but they must have probable cause in order to search, <em>United States v. Oritz, </em>422 U.S. 891, 95 S.Ct. 2585, 45 L.Ed.2d 623 (1975).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus the agent was entitled to stop Arrasmith at the permanent checkpoint. The odor of marijuana provided probable cause, authorizing the search. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Diaz, </em>541 F.2d 1165 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. McCrary, </em>543 F.2d 554 (5th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-13\">Arrasmith\u2019s sole contention draws upon the following exchange during defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the border patrol agent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1158-14\">Q: What does marijuana smell like?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1158-15\">A: Marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1158-16\">[Defense counsel]: Your honor, I don\u2019t think that answer is responsive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1158-17\">THE COURT: It is responsive. It smells like marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1158-18\">[Defense counsel]: Marijuana smells like marijuana?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1158-19\">THE COURT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1158-20\">A district court possesses broad discretion concerning whether to allow a witness to testify in terms of his \u201copinion\u201d that something smells like marijuana or whether, alternatively, to require the witness to testify to more basic \u201cfacts\u201d describing the odor more minutely. The district court\u2019s decision here was not unreasonable. Describing odors is a task that can severely test the abilities of even the most accomplished wordsmith. Defense counsel remained free, moreover, to pose additional questions requiring the witness to describe the smell in greater detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-21\">Arrasmith contends, however, that in practical effect the district court took judicial notice that marijuana smells like marijuana. We disagree and find nothing improper in the district court\u2019s action. We agree that the district court, as the trier of facts on a suppression motion, must conscientiously resolve factual questions on the basis of the evidence presented. But triers of fact are also free to employ their com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1095\">*1095</page-number>mon sense and to take into account the lessons of common, ordinary experience. The district court did not take improper judicial notice by recognizing that odors are difficult of precise description and by accepting the agent\u2019s testimony that marijuana smelled like marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-5\">Arrasmith\u2019s real objection, of course, is not to the tautological notion that marijuana smells like marijuana; whatever else marijuana does or does not smell like, it certainly smells like itself. But the statement that \u201cmarijuana smells like marijuana\u201d may also convey the meaning that the odor of marijuana is distinctive and easily recognized. To the extent that the district judge may have accepted that meaning, however, he had an ample evidentiary basis for doing so, for the agent had so testified. Litigation could not go forward if we were to adopt the general principle that a fact-finder who accepts testimony as true thereby takes improper judicial notice of its truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-6\">Whether the agent smelled marijuana was a factual question relevant to the probable cause issue. In resolving that factual question, the district court relied upon the testimony of an experienced border patrol agent who said he had smelled marijuana many times. The court neither limited Arrasmith\u2019s cross-examination of the agent nor prevented him from introducing any relevant evidence. The district court conscientiously found the facts on the basis of the evidence and did not take into account impermissible considerations. The court\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous. The conviction is</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1158-11\">. Agents need not have probable cause or reasonable suspicion in order to search at the border or its functional equivalent. <em>See Almeida-Sanchez v.
