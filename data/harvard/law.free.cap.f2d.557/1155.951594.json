B. Clark, a former employee of appellee West Chemical Products, brought this action against West under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq. </em>The district judge found that Clark filed the requisite notice of intention to bring the action with the Secretary of Labor one day after the running of the statutory notice period, and granted West summary judgment dismissing the suit. We vacate the summary judgment and remand for a determination of the proper date from which the notice period should be calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-15\">Clark was informed on May 9, 1975 that his employment with West was terminated as of that day. He refused to return his sales materials to West until he received an \u201cofficial letter of termination.\u201d Clark\u2019s office was notified of his termination on May 9, and instructed that no further business mail was to be forwarded to Clark. Afterward Clark continued to receive orders from customers, which he forwarded to West. He continued receiving commissions until May 23. Clark asserts that these commissions were partly based upon orders received after May 9. West disagreed, arguing that Clark\u2019s pay between May 9 and 23 was computed as a commission on sales in Clark\u2019s area by his replacement. West avers that Clark \u201cengaged in no selling or other activity for West during this period.\u201d The district judge found that Clark continued to sell for West during May and that he was remunerated for those sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-16\">On November 5 Clark mailed notice of intention to sue West under the Act to the Atlanta office of the Secretary of Labor. The notice was received on November 6,181 days after May 9. The district judge found that Clark\u2019s discharge was effective May 9 and held that \u201cfiling\u201d as required by the Act is not effective until the required document is received by the Secretary. On this basis he granted West\u2019s motion for summary judgment, from which Clark now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-17\">On appeal Clark asserts that the district judge\u2019s finding that May 9 was the date from which the 180-day filing period should be calculated was a finding on a disputed issue of fact and therefore unsuitable for summary judgment. Clark points out that the 180-day period should run from the date \u201cthe alleged unlawful practice occurred,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Clark argues that the last unlawful act alleged occurred when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>West notified him in writing on May 27 of his termination, thus removing \u201cambiguity as to the finality of the discharge.\u201d <em>Moses v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., </em>8 Cir., 1975, 525 F.2d 92, 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-4\">We have held that the 180-day filing period of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d) is jurisdictional. <em>Edwards v. Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem. Sales, Inc., </em>5 Cir., 1975, 515 F.2d 1195, 1199. In the, present case, however, the date of the last unlawful act, from which to calculate the 180-day period, is in dispute. A summary judgment should not be granted if there is a genuine issue as to any material fact. The burden is on the moving party, West, to show that there is \u201cnot the slightest doubt as to the facts and that only the legal conclusion remains to be resolved.\u201d <em>Insurance Co. of North America v. Bosworth Const. </em>Co.,5 Cir., 1972, 469 F.2d 1266, 1268; <em>see Moses v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., supra. </em>Accordingly, we vacate the summary judgment and remand for a determination of the date of the \u201calleged unlawful act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-5\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1220-13\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d) provides in pertinent part: No civil action may be commenced by any individual under this section until the individual has given the Secretary not less than sixty days\u2019 notice of an intent to file such action.
