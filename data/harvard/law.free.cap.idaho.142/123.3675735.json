We affirm the district court and hold that the Department cannot apply its occupancy adjustment factor to reduce Hillcrest\u2019s reimbursement for property costs for fiscal year 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-17\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b160-18\">Hillcrest is a free-standing skilled care nursing facility as defined in I.C. \u00a7 56-101(9)(a). Hillcrest provides long-term nursing care to patients and participates in the Medicaid reimbursement program. Freestanding facilities, like Hillcrest, are entitled to reimbursement for their costs incurred while providing care to Medicaid recipients, receiving a fixed payment for each day a Medicaid patient resides at the facility. This dispute centers on Hillcrest\u2019s reimbursement for property costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-20\">Hillcrest requested reimbursement for property costs from the Department for its fiscal year 2001 operations. Applying an occupancy adjustment factor from IDAPA Rule 16.03.10.123 (Rule 123), the Department reduced Hillcrest\u2019s reimbursement for property tax and property insurance by $5,048. Hill-crest requested an administrative hearing to challenge the Department\u2019s reduction of reimbursement. The hearing officer issued a preliminary order reversing the Department\u2019s decision. The Department then filed a petition for review with the Department Director who reversed the hearing officer\u2019s decision and entered a final agency order, concluding Hillcrest\u2019s reimbursement for property tax and property insurance was subject to the occupancy adjustment factor. Hillcrest appealed to the district court, which reversed the Department Director\u2019s order. The district court found that Rule 123 was ambiguous and construed it against the Department. The Department appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-21\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-22\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b160-23\">\u201cOn appeal, we will review an agency\u2019s decision independent of the district court\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>McCoy v. State, Dep\u2019t of Health and Welfare, </em>127 Idaho 792, 793, 907 P.2d 110, 111 (1995). Under the Idaho Administrative Procedure Act, an agency\u2019s decision must be affirmed unless the agency\u2019s findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are: (a) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; (b) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency; (e) made upon unlawful procedure; (d) not supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole; or (e) arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-24\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-25\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b160-26\">A. Application of Occupancy Adjustment Factor</p>\n<p id=\"b160-27\">Title 56, Chapter 1 of the Idaho Code governs reimbursement of nursing care f\u00e1cil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>ities. In addition to the statutes, the Department has been given statutory authority to adopt rules necessary to carry out the reimbursement of nursing care facilities. <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 56-135, 56-202(b) and 56-1005(8). Pursuant to that authority, the Department has promulgated \u201cRules Governing Medicaid Provider Reimbursement in Idaho.\u201d <em>See </em>IDAPA 16.03.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Hillcrest is entitled to reimbursement for property costs. I.C. \u00a7 56-108; IDAPA Rule 16.03.10.060 (1997). Rule 123 provides for an occupancy adjustment factor, which reduces reimbursement for fixed costs when a facility\u2019s average occupancy is less than eighty percent (80%). Rule 123 also explicitly provides that there will be no reductions to payments for property costs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">In order to equitably allocate fixed costs to the Medicaid patients in cases where a facility is not maintaining reasonable occupancy levels, an adjustment will be made. <em>No occupancy adjustment will be made against property reimbursement paid in lieu of property costs. ...</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">IDAPA 16.03.10.123 (1985) (emphasis added). Property costs are clearly defined by statute and that term \u201cmeans the total of allowable interest expense, plus depreciation, property insurance, real estate taxes, amortization and allowable lease/rental expenses....\u201d I.C. \u00a7 56-101(23). Therefore, according to the agency\u2019s own rule, the adjustment factor will not be applied against property costs, which include property taxes and insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">The Department argues that property reimbursement equates to property rental value, and therefore \u201cproperty reimbursement paid in lieu of property costs\u201d means that only those costs that are included in the property rental rate are prohibited from being adjusted. Referencing other agency rules, the Department asserts that property tax and property insurance are not included in the property rental rate and can therefore be adjusted. This is not what Rule 123 states nor is there any statutory authority that would provide that limitation. \u201cThis Court will not enforce a regulation that is, in effect, a rewriting of the statute.\u201d <em>Moses v. Idaho State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>118 Idaho 676, 680, 799 P.2d 964, 968 (1990); <em>See also Roberts v. Transp. Dep\u2019t, </em>121 Idaho 727, 731-32, 827 P.2d 1178, 1182-83 (stating \u201cwhere, as here, the legislature enacts a statute requiring that an administrative agency carry out specific functions ... that agency cannot validly subvert the legislation by promulgating contradictory rules.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">Moreover, in 2004, Rule 123 was amended and now specifically applies the occupancy adjustment to all costs other than those incorporated into property rental value: \u201cNo occupancy adjustment will be made against the costs that are used to calculate the property rental rate; however adjustment will be made against all other property costs.\u201d IDAPA 16.03.10.123 (2004). The new rule contains the language the Department is arguing should have applied before it was amended, indicating that the former version of Rule 123 did not so provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">\u201cIf a statute is clear on its face, it is unnecessary to engage the tools of statutory construction.\u201d <em>State v. Barnes, </em>124 Idaho 379, 380, 859 P.2d 1387, 1388 (1993). Administrative rules are subject to the same principles of statutory construction as statutes. <em>Mason v. Donnelly Club, </em>135 Idaho 581, 21 P.3d 903 (2001). The plain language of the 2001 version of Rule 123 is unambiguous. The phrase \u201cproperty reimbursement in lieu of property costs\u201d simply provides that reimbursement of property costs shall be made in accordance with I.C. \u00a7 56-108. We affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that the Department had no authority to apply the occupancy adjustment factor to Hillerest\u2019s reimbursement for property taxes and insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-13\">B. Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b161-14\">Hillcrest requests attorney\u2019s fees on appeal under I.C. \u00a7 12-117. Subsection one of that provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-15\">Unless otherwise provided by statute, in any administrative or civil judicial proceeding involving as adverse parties a state agency ... the court shall award the prevailing party reasonable attorney\u2019s fees ... if the court finds that the party against whom the judgment is rendered acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Because the Department\u2019s arguments were not without a reasonable basis in fact or law, Hillcrest\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees on appeal is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The Department erred in applying the occupancy adjustment factor to Hillcrest\u2019s property taxes and property insurance. This Court affirms the decision of the district court that the Department cannot apply its occupancy adjustment factor to reduce Hill-crest\u2019s reimbursement for property costs. We award costs on appeal to Hillcrest.</p>\n<judges id=\"b162-7\">Chief Justice SCHROEDER and Justices EISMANN, BURDICK and JONES concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
