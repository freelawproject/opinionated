Desilet, unemployment compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-24\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b688-25\">Desilet was employed by Glass Doctor to work as a glazier. Prior to hiring, Desilet was required to pass a pre-employment drug test, which he did successfully. Approximately a year later, Desilet was again asked to take a drug test. Desilet advised his supervisor that he would not be able to pass the test. His supervisor agreed not to administer the test at that time, but took away Desilet\u2019s company driving privileges. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>also asked Desilet to tell him when he was \u201cclean\u201d so the company could administer another random drug test. Several months later, Desilet advised his supervisor that he was clean and could pass a drug test. Glass Doctor waited about six months before requesting the test again, at which time Desilet tested positive for marijuana. As a result of failing the drug test, Glass Doctor discharged Desilet.</p>\n<p id=\"AiFC\">Desilet filed a claim for unemployment insurance benefits through the Idaho Department of Labor and received an eligibility determination finding he was discharged for misconduct in connection with employment and was therefore not eligible for benefits. Desilet filed a timely appeal to the Department of Labor. The appeals examiner reversed the eligibility determination, concluding the employer\u2019s standards and expectations were not adequately communicated to Desilet and he was therefore terminated without good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Glass Doctor appealed the matter to the Industrial Commission, which conducted a de novo review of the record in the case. The Industrial Commission adopted all of the appeals examiner\u2019s findings and added one additional finding. Based on these findings, however, the Commission determined that Glass Doctor clearly communicated its expectation that Desilet pass random drug tests and reversed the decision of the appeals examiner, concluding Desilet was not entitled to benefits. Desilet filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Although the Supreme Court will set aside an Industrial Commission\u2019s order if it is not supported by the record, this Court will not overrule the Commission\u2019s findings solely on the ground that it might have reached a different conclusion. <em>Folks v. Moscow Sch. Dist. 281, </em>129 Idaho 838, 933 P.2d 642 (1997). When the Supreme Court reviews an Industrial Commission decision in an unemployment compensation matter, it exercises free review over questions of law, but reviews questions of fact only to determine whether substantial and competent evidence supports the Commission\u2019s findings; substantial and competent evidence is relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept to support a conclusion. <em>Oxley v. Medicine Rock, </em>139 Idaho 476, 80 P.3d 1077 (2003). Whether an employee\u2019s behavior constitutes misconduct in connection with employment, so as to disqualify the employee from receiving compensation benefits, is a factual determination that will be upheld unless not supported by substantial and competent evidence. <em>Harris v. Elec. Wholesale, </em>141 Idaho 1, 105 P.3d 267 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b689-12\">On appeal, this Court will address whether the Industrial Commission erred in concluding Desilet\u2019s discharge was for misconduct in connection with his employment and in denying him unemployment benefits. We also briefly address Desilet\u2019s argument that an employer\u2019s failure to comply with the Idaho Private Employer Alcohol and Drug-Free Workplace Act should result in an employee\u2019s automatic entitlement to benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-13\">\n<em>1. Discharge for Misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b689-14\">When an employer discharges an employee, the worker is entitled to unemployment benefits if \u201cunemployment is not due to the fact that he left his employment voluntarily without good cause connected with his employment, or that he was discharged for misconduct in connection with his employment.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 72-1366(5). \u201cMisconduct is defined as a willful, intentional disregard of the employer\u2019s interests; a deliberate violation of the employer\u2019s rules; or a disregard of the standards of behavior which the employer has a right to expect of its employees.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>141 Idaho at 3, 105 P.3d at 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-15\">The Commission found that Desilet\u2019s conduct disregarded the standard of behavior Glass Doctor had a right to expect. For misconduct in standard-of-behavior cases, this Court applies a two-prong test: (1) whether claimant\u2019s conduct fell below the standard of behavior expected by the em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>ployer; and (2) whether the employer\u2019s expectations were objectively reasonable in the particular case. <em>Welch v. Cowles Publ\u2019g Co., </em>127 Idaho 361, 364, 900 P.2d 1372, 1375 (1995). With regard to the first prong, it was Glass Doctor\u2019s expectation that employees would take and pass periodic random drug tests. Clearly, in failing the drug test, Desilet\u2019s conduct fell below the standard of behavior Glass Doctor ejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Analyzing the second prong, an \u201cemployer\u2019s expectations are ordinarily reasonable only where they have been communicated to the employee.\u201d <em>Folks, </em>129 Idaho at 838, 933 P.2d at 647. \u201cThe question of whether an employer\u2019s expectations are objectively reasonable in a particular case is generally a question of fact, and the Commission\u2019s determination in this regard will not be disturbed on appeal if it is supported by substantial and competent evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>141 Idaho at 4, 105 P.3d at 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Here, the Commission found Glass Doctor clearly communicated its expectation that its employees pass random drug tests and, moreover, that a reasonable person would understand that if an employer was willing to go through the trouble and expense of drug testing, failing a drug test could lead to termination. Desilet, on the other hand, claims he was unaware that failing a drug test could result in his discharge and further, Glass Doctor did not clearly communicate its expectation that employees cannot use drugs during <em>non-working </em>hours. Desilet also argues smoking marijuana <em>outside of work </em>does not constitute work-related misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">There is no question that Desilet clearly understood the importance of passing the drug test as part of his employment. Passing a pre-employment drug test was part of the initial hiring process by Glass Doctor. After declining to take the first after-hire drug test, Desilet\u2019s supervisor revoked his company driving privileges. In addition, Desilet admitted his supervisor informed him that he would be given another drug test in the future. Desilet was aware that Glass Doctor expected him to pass the drug tests and the serious consequences that could result if he failed. Moreover, drug tests do not distinguish between drug use during working and non-working hours. In order for an employee to pass a drug test, the employee cannot use drugs, regardless of the time of day. Therefore, this Court is not persuaded by Desilet\u2019s argument that Glass Doctor did not communicate its expectation that employees would not use drugs outside of work, as this is part and parcel of the expectation that its employees pass drug tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">Finally, in response to Desilet\u2019s argument that using drugs during non-working hours is not sufficiently work related, this Court has held that off-duty conduct can be considered work-related when it is \u201cso closely connected with the business interests of the employer as to warrant disqualification for unemployment benefits.\u201d <em>Beaty v. City of Idaho Falls, </em>110 Idaho 891, 892, 719 P.2d 1151, 1152 (1986). The Commission concluded Glass Doctor\u2019s \u201cinterest in keeping its employees who work with glass and drive company vehicles not only unimpaired, but free from illegal drugs is the type of closely connected legitimate business interest the Court contemplated in <em>Beaty. </em>...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">We uphold the Commission\u2019s finding that Desilet was discharged for misconduct in connection with his employment and, therefore, is not entitled to unemployment benefits. There is substantial and competent evidence to support the Commission\u2019s finding that requiring the drug test was objectively reasonable and was adequately conveyed to the employee and therefore, Desilet\u2019s conduct disregarded the standard of behavior Glass Doctor had the right to expect.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">\n<em>2. Idaho Private Employer Alcohol and Drug-Free Workplace Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b690-11\">Desilet argues that because Glass Doctor did not comply with the Idaho Private Employer Alcohol and Drug-Free Workplace Act, I.C. \u00a7 72-1701, et seq. (the Act), he is automatically entitled to benefits. The Act establishes drug and alcohol 'testing guidelines. Compliance with the Act, however, is voluntary and if complied'with, provides the benefit that an employee who is discharged for failing a drug test, will be deemed to have committed misconduct under the employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>ment as defined in I.C. \u00a7 72-1366. If an employer does not comply, this simply means the employer does not get the benefit of the presumption, but it does not automatically entitle an employee to benefits. Rather, the employer may still establish misconduct in connection with employment under I.C. \u00a7 72-1366(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">We affirm the Industrial Commission\u2019s decision denying Desilet unemployment benefits. We award costs on appeal to Respondents.</p>\n<judges id=\"b691-8\">Chief Justice SCHROEDER and Justices EISMANN, BURDICK and JONES concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
