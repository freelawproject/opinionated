The Rolls claim the district court erroneously failed to take judicial notice that Canyon County\u2019s designated herd districts contain lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and erroneously concluded that their property lies within a <em>valid </em>herd district.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-20\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b154-21\">The Marchbanks own and reside on a farm in Canyon County, Idaho, where they cultivate wheat and various other crops. The Rolls own and reside on property adjacent to the Marchbanks\u2019 property. They keep numerous horses. The properties are surrounded by fields and separated by a fence.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-22\">On April 8, 2002, the Marchbanks filed a claim against the Rolls in small claims court for $4,000, alleging that the Rolls\u2019 horses were trespassing onto their property causing property damage and a loss of income. The Rolls denied each of the Marchbanks\u2019 allegations and filed a separate claim against the Marchbanks in small claims court for $4,000, alleging failure to maintain fences, trespass of dogs and child, harassment, and miscellaneous other allegations concerning irrigation practices. The Marchbanks denied the Rolls\u2019 allegations as being \u201cfiled in retaliation\u201d and amended their claim to include a request for an injunction against future trespass by the Rolls\u2019 horses.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-23\">The small claims court cases were consolidated and removed to a magistrate court as a consequence of the claim for injunctive relief. The Marchbanks filed an amended complaint alleging that the Rolls \u201cknowingly and intentionally permitted and continue to permit their [horses] to trespass\u201d and requesting attorney fees. At the commencement of the trial the Rolls stipulated that the land where the alleged trespass of their horses had occurred was within a herd district \u201c[s]o that won\u2019t be necessary for proof.\u201d The magis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>trate court found the Rolls \u201cknowingly allowed\u201d their horses to trespass frequently onto the Marchbanks\u2019 property, damaging the Marchbanks\u2019 wheat field and eating the Marchbanks\u2019 hay. The magistrate court awarded the Marchbanks $3,143.57 in damages consisting of $3,063.57 for reduced crop yield and $80.00 for twenty bales of hay. The magistrate court also ordered a permanent injunction directing the Rolls to immediately maintain their fences and keep their horses on their property. The magistrate court dismissed the Rolls\u2019 claim against the Marchbanks as frivolous, without basis, and filed in retaliation. The magistrate court awarded the Marchbanks costs and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">The Rolls appealed to the district court which affirmed the magistrate court\u2019s decisions and awarded the Marchbanks attorney fees. The Rolls appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">Upon an appeal from the magistrate\u2019s division of the district court, not involving a trial de novo, the district court shall review the case on the record and determine the appeal as an appellate court in the same manner and upon the same standards of review as an appeal from the district court to the Supreme Court under the statutes and law of this state, and the appellate rules of the Supreme Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Al3\">I.R.C.P. 83(u)(1) (2004).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-8\">When reviewing the decision of a district court acting in its appellate capacity over the magistrate division, <em>this Court reviews the magistrate court\u2019s decision independently of, but with due regard for, the district court\u2019s intermediate appellate decision. </em>This Court will uphold the magistrate court\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by substantial, competent evidence in the record. With respect to conclusions of law, this Court exercises free review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-9\"><em>State v. Doe, </em>140 Idaho 271, 273, 92 P.3d 521, 523 (2004) (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted). Substantial evidence is \u2018\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept to support a conclusion; it is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clear Springs Foods, Inc. v. Clear Lakes Trout Co., </em>136 Idaho 761, 764, 40 P.3d 119, 122 (2002) (quoting <em>Evans v. Hara\u2019s, Inc., </em>123 Idaho 473, 478, 849 P.2d 934, 939 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">THE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ERR IN REFUSING TO TAKE JUDICIAL NOTICE THAT THERE ARE BLM LANDS IN CANYON COUNTY AND THIS COURT WILL NOT DO SO</p>\n<p id=\"b155-13\">The Rolls asked the district court and now ask this Court to take judicial notice that Canyon County contains BLM lands. The significance of the request is that if this Court takes such judicial notice, the Rolls argue that Canyon County\u2019s herd district ordinance, which includes all property in Canyon County, is invalid under <em>Miller v. Miller, </em>113 Idaho 415, 745 P.2d 294 (1987). Consequently, the Rolls maintain that they are not hable for the trespass and damage of their horses onto the Marchbanks\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-14\">Appellate courts will not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Green v. Young, </em>102 Idaho 735, 639 P.2d 433 (1981); <em>Vaughan v. Atkinson, </em>369 U.S. 527, 82 S.Ct. 997, 8 L.Ed.2d 88 (1962). Where issues were not presented to the trial court by pleadings or evidence touching on particular questions, such questions are not properly before this Court for determination upon review. <em>Miller v. Miller, </em>88 Idaho 57, 396 P.2d 476 (1964). Parties are held to the theory upon which the case was tried in lower court. <em>Frasier v. Carter, </em>92 Idaho 79, 437 P.2d 32 (1968); <em>Christensen v. Stuchlik, </em>91 Idaho 504, 427 P.2d 278 (1967); <em>Cantlin v. Carter, </em>88 Idaho 179, 397 P.2d 761 (1964); <em>Robinson v. Spicer, </em>86 Idaho 138, 383 P.2d 844 (1963); <em>Cox v. Cox, </em>84 Idaho 513, 373 P.2d 929 (1962); <em>Smith v. Shinn, </em>82 Idaho 141, 350 P.2d 348 (1960); <em>Wormward v. Taylor, </em>70 Idaho 450, 221 P.2d 686 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-15\">At the commencement of the trial proceedings, Rolls\u2019 counsel stated: \u201cAnd I have indicated to Mr. Whitney that we will not ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>tion that this land is in a herd district. We will so stipulate. So that won\u2019t be necessary for proof.\u201d Using counsel\u2019s stipulation as a basis for proceedings, the magistrate court held a three-day trial, during which time, Rolls\u2019 counsel did not raise the issue as to whether the herd district was valid. Later, on appeal before the district court, and now before this Court, the Rolls raise the issue as to whether Canyon County\u2019s herd district is valid, asserting that \u201c[t]he law in Idaho is clear that no herd district is valid if it encompasses BLM land that has grazing lands attached.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">The district court found that \u201cthe evidence clearly established that the [Rolls\u2019] property is located entirely within a long-established herd district in Canyon County, Idaho, (per the stipulation of [Rolls\u2019] counsel)\u201d and that the Rolls \u201chave sought to raise issues for the first time concerning the validity of the herd district, when in fact they stipulated to its existence and applicability at the trial court level.\u201d The district court\u2019s analysis was correct. The same reasoning applies to this Court\u2019s review.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S FINDINGS OF FACT ARE SUPPORTED BY THE RECORD</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Evidence presented at trial supports the findings of fact made by the magistrate court. Consequently, that record supports the entry of the judgment both for money damages and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">THE DISTRICT COURT AND THE MAGISTRATE COURT PROPERLY AWARDED ATTORNEY FEES AND THIS COURT AWARDS ATTORNEY FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">The magistrate court found the Rolls\u2019 claim against the Marchbanks to be frivolous and filed in retaliation. These findings are supported by the record and form the basis for an award of attorney fees. The district court concluded that the Rolls\u2019 claims on appeal were entirely without merit, and that their appeal was brought frivolously, unreasonably, and without foundation as the Rolls did \u201clittle more than ask this Court to second-guess the findings of fact issued by the trial court\u201d and \u201craise issues for the first time concerning the validity of the herd district.\u201d That conclusion is supported by the record. Nothing has changed on appeal before this Court. The Rolls do nothing more than invite this Court to take judicial notice contrary to a stipulation at trial which removed the issue from consideration. Neither the magistrate court nor the district court abused its discretion in awarding attorney fees. The appeal to this Court is unreasonable and without foundation. Attorney fees are awarded on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b156-14\">The judgment entered in the magistrate court is affirmed. The order of the district court affirming the magistrate court\u2019s decision and awarding attorney fees is affirmed. Costs and attorney fees on appeal to this Court are awarded to the Marchbanks.</p>\n<judges id=\"b156-15\">Justices TROUT, EISMANN, BURDICK and JONES concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
