We hold that there is substantial and competent evidence to affirm the magistrate judge\u2019s decision to terminate Doe\u2019s parental rights on the grounds of neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-29\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-30\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b434-31\">Doe is the unwed biological father of Baby Doe who was born on February 28, 2003. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Four days after the infant was born, Baby Doe\u2019s mother relinquished custody and control of Baby Doe to the CASI Foundation (CASI). The mother subsequently voluntarily agreed to the termination of her parental rights. The day after Baby Doe was placed in the care of CASI, Doe filed a Petition to Establish Paternity, Custody, and Support and registered notice of commencement of his paternity action with the vital statistics unit of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. Thereafter, CASI filed a Verified Petition for Termination of Doe\u2019s parental rights, which was ultimately amended several times by CASI. CASI filed its final amended petition on July 3, 2003. The petition sought termination on the following grounds: (1) abandonment pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 16-2005(a) and I.C. \u00a7 16-2005(h)(4), (2) neglect pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 16-2005(b), (3) inability to discharge parental responsibilities pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 16-2005(d), (4) best interest of the parent and child pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 16-2005(e) and (5) incarceration with no possibility of parole pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 lG^OOSfhXS).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">During this time, Doe received a paternity order establishing that he was the father. The order also included a provision allowing Doe to visit with Baby Doe under the supervision of the CASI foundation, which he did on several occasions. Ultimately, the visits ended when Doe was incarcerated in May of 2003 in two felony cases involving possession of controlled substances. His earliest possible release date was May of 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">CASI\u2019s petition to terminate Doe\u2019s parental rights was heard in September of 2003. The magistrate judge terminated Doe\u2019s parental rights on grounds of neglect, but found that CASI failed to offer clear and convincing evidence as to the other grounds for termination. The magistrate based his neglect finding on Doe\u2019s chronic drug addiction and the fact that he encouraged Baby Doe\u2019s mother to take drugs while she was pregnant with Baby Doe. Doe appealed the finding of neglect to the district court and CASI cross-appealed, arguing the magistrate judge erred in finding that Doe had not abandoned his child pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 16-2005(h)(4). Ruling from the bench, the district court affirmed both the finding of neglect and that Doe did not abandon Baby Doe pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 16-2005(h)(4). This appeal and cross-appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-13\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b435-14\">When reviewing a decision rendered by the district court in its appellate capacity, this Court considers the record before the magistrate court independently of the district court\u2019s determination, giving due regard to the district court\u2019s analysis. <em>Roe Family Servs. v. Doe, </em>139 Idaho 930, 934, 88 P.3d 749, 753 (2004). \u201cIn an action to terminate parental rights, \u201cwhere a clear and convincing standard has been noted explicitly and applied by the trial court, an appellate court will not disturb the trial court\u2019s findings unless they are not supported by substantial and competent evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 934, 88 P.3d at 753. \u201cFindings are competent, so long as they are supported by substantial, albeit possibly, conflicting, evidence.\u201d <em>Roberts v. Roberts, </em>138 Idaho 401, 405, 64 P.3d 327, 331 (2003). Only clearly eiToneous findings are overturned, which means a reasonable person would not have relied on them in concluding as the fact finder did. <em>Opportunity, L.L.C. v. Ossewarde, </em>136 Idaho 602, 605, 38 P.3d 1258, 1261 (2002). \u201c[T]his Court will indulge all reasonable inferences in support of the trial court\u2019s judgment when reviewing an order that parental rights be terminated.\u201d <em>Doe I v. Doe, </em>138 Idaho 893, 900, 71 P.3d 1040, 1047 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-16\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b435-17\">A. Termination of Parental Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b435-18\">Neglect is a ground for parental termination and was defined by the statute in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>effect at the time of the proceeding as \u201ca situation in which the child lacks parental care necessary for his health, morals and well-being.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 16-2005(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The question of neglect is one of fact. <em>Thompson v. Thompson, </em>110 Idaho 93, 94, 714 P.2d 62, 63 (Ct.App.1986). Doe asserts the magistrate judge\u2019s finding of neglect is not supported by substantial and competent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Doe argues that his past substance abuse and life style are not indicative of a lack of concern for the health and well-being of his daughter. He claims that the birth of his child has \u201cchanged his life\u201d and that he will now be able to extricate himself from his long-standing drug addiction and become a law-abiding citizen. Without having the opportunity to parent Baby Doe, he argues that a court cannot conclude that he has <em>already neglected </em>his daughter and the mere possibility of future neglect is not a sufficient ground to terminate his parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">In his detailed findings, the magistrate judge found that Doe displayed poor parenting skills during his visits with Baby Doe; has not contributed any support to Baby Doe; has been unemployed since 1999; has been in and out of prison since 1988, committing new offenses after he was aware that Baby Doe\u2019s mother was pregnant with his child; and has been incarcerated throughout most of the child\u2019s life. The magistrate judge found that Doe is a chronic methamphetamine addict and has been throughout his young adult and adult life. The magistrate judge relied on the expert testimony of Dr. Mack Stephenson that, in light of Doe\u2019s repeated failures to deal with his chronic drug addiction and his pattern of long-term drug abuse, it is exceedingly unlikely that Doe will stop abusing drugs irrespective of his vow to change his life. Finally, the magistrate judge placed great weight on the evidence that Doe endangered his unborn child by encouraging Baby Doe\u2019s mother to use drugs with Doe up to one month before his daughter\u2019s birth, stating that these actions \u201cshowed no regard whatsoever for the health and well-being of his unborn daughter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">In <em>In Interest of Castro, </em>this Court affirmed the termination of a father\u2019s parental rights on grounds of neglect because he did not prevent his wife from harming their child stating that, \u201cat the very least he acquiesced in the physical abuse of his daughter and failed to take any preventative measures to assure the child\u2019s future protection.\u201d 102 Idaho 218, 222, 628 P.2d 1052, 1056 (1981). Here, Doe not only acquiesced in Baby Doe\u2019s mother taking drugs, but actively encouraged her to do so. This case provides stronger support for the termination of the father\u2019s rights than <em>In Interest of Castro </em>where the father\u2019s rights were terminated because he did not \u201cprevent\u201d harm to the child. Here, Doe actively instigated the harmful conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">Doe also alleges the trial court erred in relying on the testimony from the CASI representatives and that the record did not contain clear and convincing evidence to support the finding that he was not bonding with his daughter and only showed rudimentary parenting skills. Doe has demonstrated no error in the magistrate judge\u2019s reliance on testimony presented by CASI, nor has he shown that the findings about his parenting skills with his daughter are not supported by substantial competent evidence. Doe also challenges the magistrate judge\u2019s reliance on the testimony of Baby Doe\u2019s mother (claiming she is unreliable because she is a self-proclaimed drug user) and on the testimony of Dr. Stephenson because he never interviewed Doe and was inexperienced in the area of termination of parental rights. This Court has taken these arguments into consideration and finds them unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">All of the evidence discussed above, provides a substantial and competent basis for the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Doe has failed to provide the parental care necessary for Baby Doe\u2019s health, morals and well-being, and that it is in Baby Doe\u2019s best interests for Doe\u2019s rights to be terminated. We affirm the trial court\u2019s decision terminating Doe\u2019s rights. Because we affirm the finding of neglect, it is unnecessary to consider whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Doe abandoned Baby Doe pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 16-2005(a) and (h)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">B. Attorney Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">On appeal, CASI seeks attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-117, I.C. \u00a7 12-121, I.R.C.P. 41 and I.R.C.P. 54(e)(1). CASI argues that this appeal simply invites the appellate court to second-guess the trial court and that attorney\u2019s fees on appeal are appropriate if the appeal has been brought frivolously, unreasonably, or without foundation. Because of the significant parental interest involved in this case, this Court finds that the appeal was not brought frivolously or unreasonably and therefore CASI\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees on appeal is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">This Court affirms the magistrate judge\u2019s decision to terminate Doe\u2019s parental rights on the grounds of neglect. We award costs on appeal to CASI.</p>\n<judges id=\"b437-8\">Chief Justice SCHROEDER and Justices EISMANN, BURDICK and JONES concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b435-8\">. Prior to CASI filing its final amended petition, on July 1, 2003, I.C. \u00a7 16-2005(d) was amended, removing the mental deficiency requirement from the statute. Despite the change in law, it appears from the trial transcript that the parties and the magistrate judge continued to apply the version of I.C. \u00a7 16-2005(d) prior to the July 1, 2003, amendment, which was in effect at the time the child was bom and the initial petition was filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b436-6\">. On July 1, 2005, I.C. \u00a7 16-2005(b) was amended so that it no longer provides a definition of neglect.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
