Appellant Steven Kolar was employed by an engineering firm and working on the respondents\u2019 road construction project when he was run over by a dump truck driven by an employee of one of the respondents. Mr. Kolar sued and the district court entered summary judgment in the respondents\u2019 favor, ruling the respondents were his so-called statutory employers and thus immune from suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">The United States Forest Service owns Howell Canyon Road, which leads from Albion, Idaho, to, among other places, the Pomerelle Mountain Resort in southern Idaho. In the 1960s the Forest Service entered into an agreement with respondents Cassia County, Albion Highway District, and Burley Highway District, whereby those local agencies would maintain Howell Canyon Road and the Forest Service would provide the funds. The respondents are parties to a 1991 agreement among themselves relating to the maintenance of the road. According to this agreement, Burley Highway District agreed to provide the personnel, equipment, and management necessary to maintain the road. Cassia County and Albion Highway District would provide the funds for maintaining the road. They all agreed to be jointly and severally hable for damage to persons or property occurring in the course of maintenance of the road. By the late 1990s the road began to deteriorate and so the respondents commenced a project to improve it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 2000 Burley Highway District contracted with JUB Engineers, Inc., an engineering firm, to provide engineering services on this project. It does not appear that representatives from either Cassia County or Albion Highway district were signatories to the Burley Highway District-JUB Engineers agreement. Mr. Kolar was employed as an \u201cengineering tech\u201d with JUB Engineers.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-19\">In 2001, Mr. Kolar was on the construction site working for his firm when he was run over by a dump truck driven by one Scott Hitt, a Burley Highway District employee. Mr. Kolar suffered severe injuries and received worker\u2019s compensation benefits from the firm for which he worked. After complying with the Idaho Tort Claims Act, Mr. Kolar sued the respondents for negligence in 2003. The respondents moved for summary judgment, contending that they were Mr. Kolar\u2019s statutory employers under I.C. \u00a7 72-223 and hence immune from suit under the exclusivity-of-remedies provisions in I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 72-209 and 72-211. The district court agreed and entered summary judgment in their favor. The court neglected, though, to address Mr. Kolar\u2019s argument that \u00a7 72-223 violated his rights to equal protection and due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, so Mr. Kolar filed a motion to reconsider. After a hearing, the court issued another written decision, ruling \u00a7 72-223 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause and affirmed its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>prior decision. For reasons unknown to us, it did not discuss the due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">We have before us two principal issues. First, we must decide whether the district court had jurisdiction to determine whether the respondents were Mr. Kolar\u2019s statutory employers. Second, we consider whether the respondents were Mr. Kolar\u2019s statutory employers or whether they were third parties amenable to suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Before discussing these questions, however, an issue in Cassia County\u2019s response brief should be discussed and disposed of. Cassia County contends it owed no duty to Mr. Kolar. This issue was never raised in the district court, either in writing or at either of the two. hearings on the motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court did not rule on the matter. In other words, this appeal is the first time the argument has appeared. We have on many occasions said we will not entertain issues or theories not raised in the court below. <em>Kirkman v. Stoker, </em>134 Idaho 541, 544, 6 P.3d 397, 400 (2000). We see no reason to start doing so now.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">We note also the standard by which we review this case. Mr. Kolar\u2019s claims were disposed of on a motion for summary judgment. Summary judgment is proper only if the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Idaho R. Civ. P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">Mr. Kolar argues first that the district court lacked jurisdiction to determine whether the respondents were his statutory employers. For this theory he cites I.C. \u00a7 72-707, which provides: \u201cAll questions arising under this law, if not settled by agreement or stipulation of the interested parties with the approval of the [Industrial Commission, except as otherwise herein provided, shall be determined by the [Cjommission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">The statutory grant of exclusive jurisdiction to the Industrial Commission for \u201call questions arising under\u201d the worker\u2019s compensation scheme does not include a grant of exclusive jurisdiction to interpret and apply the statutory employer provision insofar as those tasks are necessary to determine whether, in an ordinary common-law negligence suit, a defendant is the plaintiffs statutory employer. <em>See Dominguez v. Evergreen Resources, Inc., </em>142 Idaho 7, 121 P.3d 938 (2005) (courts have jurisdiction to determine whether exception to I.C. \u00a7 72-209(3) applies; courts have jurisdiction over tort suits outside the worker\u2019s compensation scheme). This is nothing new \u2014 as the respondents point out, we have previously implicitly endorsed such exercise of jurisdiction by the district court for such questions. For example, in Robison <em>v. Bateman-Hall, Inc., </em>139 Idaho 207, 76 P.3d 951 (2003), we considered the district court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 72-223 in deciding whether the defendants were the plaintiffs statutory employers. Although the district court\u2019s jurisdiction to answer the question was not raised as an issue, we expressed no concern that the district court had improperly appropriated for itself a question properly reserved for the Industrial Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-14\">The cases on which Mr. Kolar relies do not help his ease. In <em>West v. State, </em>112 Idaho 1038, 739 P.2d 337 (1987), the plaintiff sued the Industrial Commission and the State Insurance Fund alleging both entities had dealt improperly with the plaintiffs workers\u2019 compensation claim. 112 Idaho at 1039, 739 P.2d at 338. The plaintiff had moved the Commission to reopen the proceedings before she sued in district court. <em>Id. </em>The district court dismissed the plaintiffs claim and on appeal this Court suspended action in the district court suit. <em>Id. </em>Idaho Code \u00a7 72-733 strips district courts of any jurisdiction to \u201creview, vacate, set aside, reverse, revise, correct, amend, or annul any order or award of the commission, or to suspend or delay the execution or operation thereof, or to enjoin, re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>strain or interfere with the commission in performance of its duties.\u201d So, said the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-4\">It is clear that the essence of [the plaintiffs] complaint before the district court is that she was injured in an industrial accident and received an inadequate award for those injuries. Presently pending before the Commission is [the plaintiffs] motion to set aside the award and reopen the proceedings. It is likewise clear that the district courts are expressly forbidden to exercise any jurisdiction in any cause seeking in any way to interfere with the actions or jurisdiction of the Industrial Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-5\"><em>Id. </em>The question in West, whether a district court had jurisdiction to review the Industrial Commission\u2019s award, is not anything like the question in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">And neither was the question in <em>Idaho State Ins. Fund. v. Turner, </em>130 Idaho 190, 938 P.2d 1228 (1997). In that case, the State Insurance Fund sued a worker\u2019s compensation claimant to recover disability benefits paid to him. 130 Idaho at 191, 938 P.2d at 1229. The Insurance Fund contended it was subrogated to the claimant\u2019s award paid by the liable third party under \u00a7 72-223. <em>Id. </em>Idaho Code \u00a7 72-223(3) grants an injured worker\u2019s employer a right of subrogation in the employee\u2019s rights against the third party, where that employer has compensated its injured employee for acts committed by a third party. Because the Insurance Fund\u2019s right to subrogation arose under the worker\u2019s compensation scheme, the Court ruled that \u201c[w]hether [the State Insurance Fund] is entitled to subrogation pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 72-223(3) is a question arising under the worker\u2019s compensation law which is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Industrial Commission.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Even if Mr. Kolar\u2019s case were different enough to render the rule from <em>Dominguez </em>inapplicable, Mr. Kolar\u2019s theory is incompatible with the statutory scheme. The Legislature granted a common-law right of action in an injured worker against a third party. I.C. \u00a7 72-223(2). The Legislature did not bother to define \u201cthird party\u201d but it expressly provided two categories of employers that are not. <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7 72-223(1). Since status as a statutory employer is a defense to a common law negligence action, deciding whether a defendant is a third party or a statutory employer, when that defense is raised, necessarily attends the district court\u2019s task in ruling on matters in such suits. Were we to accept Mr. Kolar\u2019s theory, once the defendant raised the statutory employer defense, the question would have to be answered by the Industrial Commission. Then, assuming the Industrial Commission ruled the defendant was a third party who could be sued, the case would go back to district court. We do not believe the Legislature intended such a cumbersome process.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">And finally, Mr. Kolar has lodged constitutional challenges to the worker\u2019s compensation scheme. District courts, we have held, are the proper forum for answering these questions, not the Industrial Commission. <em>See Owsley v. Idaho Industrial Comm\u2019n, </em>141 Idaho 129, 106 P.3d 455 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">Mr. Kolar next contends the respondents were not his statutory employers. The theory goes that since his employer was an independent contractor, his employer was not a \u201ccontractor[ ] or subcontractor ]\u201d within the meaning of I.C. \u00a7 72-223. He points us to I.C. \u00a7 54-1218, which requires highway districts to have their construction plans prepared by an independent professional engineer. Mr. Kolar contends this provision forecloses any finding that a municipality can be deemed a statutory employer, since, under that statute, an engineering firm preparing plans for, and reviewing construction done by, a public entity must be \u201cdevoid of public ... affiliation.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">With the worker\u2019s compensation law, the Legislature removed \u2014 with few exceptions\u2014 all workplace injuries from \u201cprivate controversy.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 72-201. To that end, the Legislature crafted a system whereby \u201csure and certain relief\u2019 would be provided to injured workers regardless of fault. <em>Id. </em>This \u201csure and certain relief\u2019 is provided \u201cto the exclusion of every other remedy, proceeding, or compensation, except as is otherwise pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>vided\u201d in the worker\u2019s compensation scheme. <em>Id.; see also </em>I.C. \u00a7 72-209(1); I.C. \u00a7 72-211. The exception is found at I.C. \u00a7 72-223, which allows an injured worker to sue a so-called \u201cthird party\u201d who may be liable for damages stemming from the injury. I.C. \u00a7 72-223(1), (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">As noted above, I.C. \u00a7 72-223(1) identifies two categories of employers who are not third parties: (1) \u201cthose employers described in section 72-216, Idaho Code, having under them contractors or subcontractors who have in fact complied with the provisions of section 72-301, Idaho Code\u201d (which will be referred to herein as a category one employer); and (2) \u201cthe owner or lessee of premises, or other person who is virtually the proprietor or operator of the business there carried on, but who, by reason of there being an independent contractor or for any other reason, is not the direct employer of the workmen there employed\u201d (a category two employer). Thus, if the respondents meet either of these categories, they were Mr. Kolar\u2019s statutory employers and cannot be sued.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Mr. Kolar contends that the Legislature\u2019s reference to \u201ccontractors or subcontractors\u201d in \u00a7 72-223 excludes \u201cindependent contractors,\u201d which are specially defined <em>(see </em>I.C. \u00a7 72-102(16)), from statutory employer status. In other words, he contends, the respondents hired an independent contractor and thus would <em>not </em>have been liable for his compensation if JUB had not complied with \u00a7 72-301. The argument goes that unlike the other contractors on the project, respondents did not require JUB to bid for its contract; JUB was not identified as a contractor or subcontractor on any bid; and, in fact, JUB was hired to provide professional services, which, he says, cannot be deemed \u201cemployees\u201d of a client.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Mr. Kolar\u2019s theory is interesting, but it cannot take him where he wants to go. First, we have categorized independent contractors who employed the injured worker as \u201ccontractors or subcontractors\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 72-223. <em>See Spencer v. Allpress Logging, Inc., </em>134 Idaho 856, 860-61, 11 P.3d 475, 479-80 (2000). Under the facts of this case, we see no need to .characterize the respondents as something else. An \u201cemployer\u201d is \u201cany person[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] who has expressly or impliedly hired or contracted the services . of another.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 72-102(12)(a). This definition \u201cincludes contractors and subcontractors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is undisputed that the respondents contracted the services of JUB Engineers. They are therefore an \u201cemployer\u201d within the meaning of that term as it is found in \u00a7 72-223(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">The respondents are also an employer \u201cdescribed in section 72-216, Idaho Code.\u201d Idaho Code \u00a7 72-301 provides: \u201cEvery employer shall secure the payment of compensation under this law....\u201d Since the respondents were an \u201cemployer,\u201d they were required to comply with \u00a7 72-301. Idaho Code \u00a7 72-216 imposes liability on employers \u201cfor compensation to an employee of a contractor or subcontractor under him who has not complied with the provisions of section 72-301 in any case where such employer would have been liable for such compensation if such employee had been working directly for such employer.\u201d In other words, if the employee\u2019s employer (in this case JUB Engineers) has not complied with \u00a7 72-301, the person who contracted the services of the injured employee\u2019s employer (in this case the respondents) is liable for payment of compensation to the non-compliant employer\u2019s employee (Mr. Kolar).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">Respondents meet this criterion, as well. To illustrate: in <em>Venters v. Sorrento Delaware, Inc., </em>141 Idaho 245, 108 P.3d 392 (2005), the deceased worker was an employee of 3-C Trucking. 141 Idaho at 248, 108 P.3d at 395. Sorrento, a company engaged in the making of cheese, contracted with 3-C Trucking to have the trucking company come onto Sorrento\u2019s cheese-making facility, collect wastewater from the cheese-making process, and haul said wastewater to Montierth Farms, a local farming operation. <em>Id. </em>at 247, 108 P.3d at 398. Montierth Farms and 3-C had no contractual relationship. <em>Id. </em>at 245, 108 P.3d at 396. While on Montierth Farms property waiting to dump his load of waste-water, the worker was run over and killed. <em>Id. </em>at 248, 108 P.3d at 395. The worker\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>survivors sued both Sorrento and Montierth Farms. The district court granted Sorrento\u2019s motion for summary judgment, ruling the company was the worker\u2019s statutory employer. On appeal, we affirmed: \u201cAs an employer of a contractor [3-C Trucking], Sorrento would not have been permitted to avoid liability to [the worker] under the Idaho worker\u2019s compensation statutes should 3-C Trucking have failed to comply with the worker\u2019s compensation statutes.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Much like the worker in <em>Venters </em>was the statutory employee of the company with which his direct employer contracted, Mr. Kolar was the direct employee of JUB, which in turn contracted with the respondents. At the time of his unfortunate injury, Mr. Kolar was doing the work JUB had contracted to do. Indeed, all of the work JUB was obligated to do under its contract with the Burley Highway District was work required under the main contract for the project. Thus, the respondents would not have been permitted to escape liability to Mr. Kolar if JUB had not complied with \u00a7 72-301. Hence, they were employers as contemplated in I.C. \u00a7 72-216.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Mr. Kolar\u2019s argument seems to be that because the respondents had no choice but to hire an independent firm, that firm is somehow not \u201cunder\u201d them for purposes of statutory employer analysis. This theory is consistent with neither the Legislature\u2019s express purpose of \u201cpreventing] an employer from avoiding liability under the workmen\u2019s compensation statutes by sub-contracting the work to others,\u201d <em>Adam v. Titan Equip. Supply Corp., </em>93 Idaho 644, 646, 470 P.2d 409, 411 (1970), nor our interpretation of \u201ccontractors and subcontractors\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 72-223. <em>See Spencer, supra, </em>134 Idaho 856, 11 P.3d 475. Futhermore, \u00a7 72-102 defines \u201cemployer\u201d quite broadly; section 72-203 states quite clearly that the worker\u2019s compensation law \u201cshall apply to all public employment and to all private employment ... not expressly exempt by the provisions of section 72-212;\u201d sections 72-209 and 72-211 make plainly clear that the exceptions to the exclusivity provisions are quite limited; and neither sections 72-223 nor 72-212 allow for the \u201cprofessional services\u201d exception Mr. Kolar advocates. In short, there is nothing to suggest the Legislature intended to exempt entities subject to I.C. \u00a7 54-1218 from this scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">Because we conclude that the respondents were category one employers, they were immune from suit. Whether they were category two employers is accordingly rendered irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">Mr. Kolar next argues that I.C. \u00a7 72-223 violates the equal protection and due process guarantees found in the Federal and State Constitutions. <em>See </em>U.S. Const, amend. XIV; Idaho Const, art. I, \u00a7 2, art. XII, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">Mr. Kolar contends the grant of immunity to statutory employers fails the rational basis test and thus denies his guarantee of equal protection. A statute denies equal protection when (1) the classification is totally unrelated to the state\u2019s goals, and (2) there is no conceivable state of facts that will support the classification. <em>State Ins. Fund v. Van Tine, </em>132 Idaho 902, 909, 980 P.2d 566, 573 (1999). Mr. Kolar is challenging the classification of employers \u2014 a class of which he is not a member and thus for which he has no standing to advocate. <em>Venters, </em>141 Idaho at 252, 108 P.3d at 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-14\">Assuming his challenge is to an indirect, de facto statutory classification of employees (which he has not explicitly argued), Mr. Kolar\u2019s argument fails anyway. We have previously said that a rational basis exists for the grant of immunity in \u00a7 72-223, even if the statutory employer has not had to pay benefits because the direct employer has. <em>See Venters, </em>141 Idaho at 252, 108 P.3d at 399. Mr. Kolar has added nothing new to the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-15\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-16\">Mi\u2019. Kolar\u2019s due process argument is likewise unavailing. He contends that a 1996 legislative \u201cflip-flop\u201d, whereby those employers that had been third parties now were not, <em>see </em>1996 Idaho Sess. Laws ch. 191, \u00a7 1, p. 599, renders \u00a7 72-223 ambiguous, vague, in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>congruous with I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 72-216 and 54-1218, and thus fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Before addressing the merits of Mr. Kolar\u2019s due process claim, we consider the respondents\u2019 contention that Mr. Kolar did not raise the due process argument in the district court. To properly preserve an issue for appeal, the one must either receive an adverse ruling on the issue or raise it in the court below. <em>See McPheters v. Maile, </em>138 Idaho 391, 397, 64 P.3d 317, 323 (2003). The district court never ruled on the due process claim; thus the question becomes whether the issue was properly raised. This, in turn, depends upon what the meaning of the word \u201craised\u201d is. The Court recognizes a distinction between issues not formally raised and issues that \u201cnever surfaced\u201d below. <em>Manookian v. Blaine County, </em>112 Idaho 697, 700, 735 P.2d 1008, 1011 (1987). Issues not formally raised may be considered if they are tried by the express or implied consent of the parties, Idaho R. Civ. P. 15(b); issues never raised will not be considered, <em>Manookian, </em>112 Idaho at 700, 735 P.2d at 1011.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Mr. Kolar\u2019s memorandum opposing the respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment did not include equal protection or due process arguments. At the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, Mr. Kolar\u2019s counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">The next issue that I think the court needs to focus on is the constitutional issues and I did not address those in my brief. To he honest with you, I didn\u2019t even think of them until we were here today; but I know I\u2019m not barred from making that argument before the court, so we ask the court to look at the issues of due process and equal protection and, if the court deems it appropriate, to extend the briefing deadline so that we can address those issues and that the defendants in this matter have an opportunity to address those issues also so that it\u2019s a fair playing field for everyone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">At the hearing, the respondents lodged no objection to Mr. Kolar\u2019s raising of the issue at that point, but it is unclear whether the district court ever granted more time for briefing on the issue. The judge never indicated whether he would or would not grant more time for briefing this issue. In his motion for reconsideration, Mr. Kolar asked the district, court to consider the equal protection and due process issues, and he did argue them at the hearing on the motion<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (the respondents did not address them in their portion of the argument). As noted above, the district court did not discuss due process nor indicate why the due process claim was not addressed. When presented with the respondents\u2019 argument in their response briefs in this appeal\u2014that he did not properly raise the issue below\u2014Mr. Kolar\u2019s reply brief on appeal did not discuss the due process issue. In short, while the issue was raised and argued, it was not supported with any real authority. However, the district court ruled on the equal protection claim, having been presented with the same amount of argument and authority on that issue as it was provided on the due process issue. Accordingly, we will assume that the issue was raised for purposes of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">Not that it makes any difference. The vagueness and uncertainty arguments are belied by the plain language of the statute, which clearly states who is not a third party. Civil or non-criminal statutes are not unconstitutionally vague if \u201cpersons of reasonable intelligence can derive core meaning\u201d from them. <em>Olsen v. J.A. Freeman Co., </em>117 Idaho 706, 716, 791 P.2d 1285, 1295 (1990) (quoting <em>Cotton States Mut. Ins. Co. v. Anderson, </em>749 F.2d 663 (11th Cir.1984)). We have on previous occasions been able to derive core meaning from the post-1996 language of \u00a7 72-223. <em>See Venters, supra; Robison v. Bateman-Hall, supra. </em>Nothing in the facts of this case prevents us from being able to derive core meaning from the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">The other part of Mr. Kolar\u2019s argument addresses I.C. \u00a7 .54-1218. He contends the district court\u2019s ruling cannot be reconciled with that statute, I.C. \u00a7 72-223, and I.C. \u00a7 72-216 (apparently for the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>reasons they were incongruous in the statutory employer analysis), and contends this incongruity violates due process. He does not, however, explain how the asserted irreconcilability of these statutes (addressed above) violates due process, and since the statutes are not irreconcilable, this argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">Finally, Mr. Kolar goes on to argue, in the rhetorical sense, that the Legislature is not free to change its mind, implying that the 1996 legislative change violated due process. It is well-settled that the Legislature has the constitutional authority to \u201crepeal any part of the common law....\u201d <em>Olsen v. J.A. Freeman, </em>117 Idaho at 717, 791 P.2d at 1294 (quoting <em>Vogts v. Guerrette, </em>142 Colo. 527, 351 P.2d 851, 865 (1960)). Due process claims do not arise simply because certain classes of employers who were subject to suit before the 1996 amendments were not thereafter. The relevant question is whether the statute as it now exists, and as it has been applied to Mr. Kolar, violates due process. As discussed above, it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Mr. Kolar, Cassia County, and Albion Highway District seek attorney fees. In his opening brief, Mr. Kolar seeks fees under I.C. \u00a7 12-121. Burley Highway District correctly points out in its response brief that awards of attorney fees in eases pursued under the tort claims act are controlled by I.C. \u00a7 6-918A, not I.C. \u00a7 12-121. <em>Tomich v. City of Pocatello, </em>127 Idaho 394, 901 P.2d 501 (1995). Mr. Kolar did not request fees under the appropriate section and has not prevailed. Hence, Mr. Kolar is not entitled to fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">Albion Highway District seeks fees on the basis that Mr. Kolar has brought this appeal frivolously, unreasonably, and/or without foundation. We are not left with such an impression. Accordingly, Albion Highway District will not be awarded fees. Finally, Cassia County\u2019s bare request for fees, presented without any authority or argument in support, is denied. <em>See Bream v. Benscoter, </em>139 Idaho 364, 79 P.3d 723 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">The decision of the district court is affirmed.
