He argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion for judgment of acquittal because he did not use a weapon during the robbery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The victim was standing by his car in a parking lot when a car driven by Browne approached and waved him over. When the victim came near the driver's window, Browne pointed what appeared to be a double-barreled shotgun at the victim and ordered him to hand over his wallet. The victim complied and Browne drove away,\n   resulting in a police chase and Browne's arrest. When the police searched the car, they found the double-barrel of a shotgun that had been detached from the receiver, stock, and firing mechanism. Browne later admitted he robbed the victim, but claimed he had not used a real gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The State charged Browne with robbery with a weapon in violation of section 812.13(2)(b), Florida Statutes (2015). At trial, Browne moved for judgment of acquittal, arguing that the State failed to prove the object used in the robbery was a weapon as defined by section 790.001(13), Florida Statutes (2015). The State disagreed, arguing that the standard jury instruction on robbery, which defines a \"weapon\" as \"any object that could be used to cause death or inflict serious bodily harm,\" was controlling and that, because the shotgun barrel could have been used as a club, that element of the crime was satisfied. The trial court denied the motion and the jury found Browne guilty of robbery with a specific finding that he carried a weapon during the course of the robbery. Browne renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal after trial but before sentencing, and the court denied it again. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Appellate courts review de novo orders on motions for judgment of acquittal.\n   <em>\n    Pagan v.

Robbery with a weapon is a first-degree felony under section 812.13(2)(b). However, robbery with a firearm or a \"deadly weapon\" is a first-degree felony punishable by life in prison under section 812.13(2)(a). The robbery statute does not define \"weapon\" or \"deadly weapon.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v.

Consequently, Florida courts apply the definition of \"weapon\" found in section 790.001(13) to violations of the robbery statute.\n   <em>\n    Stanley v.

Section 790.001(13) defines a \"weapon\" as \"any dirk, knife, metallic knuckles, slungshot, billie, tear gas gun, chemical weapon or device,\n   <em>\n    or other deadly weapon\n   </em>\n   except a firearm or a common pocketknife, plastic knife, or blunt-bladed table knife.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added). Florida Standard Jury Instruction Criminal 15.1-the instruction applicable to robbery-defines a \"weapon\" as \"any object that could be used to cause death or inflict serious bodily harm.\" More importantly, the jury instruction defines a \"deadly weapon\" as an object \"used or threatened to be used in a way likely to produce death or great bodily harm.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11526151\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/757/1275/#p1276\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When, as here, a defendant is charged with robbery with a weapon, the state must prove either that the object was one of the enumerated weapons in section 790.001(13) or that it was a \"deadly weapon.\" When the object used is not one of the enumerated objects in the definition of\n   \"weapon\" found in section 790.001(13), we apply an objective test focusing on the nature and actual use of the object, not on the subjective belief of the victim or intent of the defendant, to determine whether it constituted a \"weapon.\"\n   <em>\n    Hamilton v.

Needless to say, the shotgun barrel used by Browne was not any of the specifically delineated weapons found in section 790.001(13). So, the issue is whether the State proved that the barrel was a deadly weapon based on how it was used. We conclude it did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"[W]hen the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous and conveys a clear and definite meaning, there is no occasion for resorting to the rules of statutory interpretation and construction; the statute must be given its plain and obvious meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    Donato v.
