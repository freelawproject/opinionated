In the second assignment of error, appellate counsel contends the Louisiana Supreme Court was without authority to craft penal provisions not authorized legislatively. As a result, the district court failed to perform its duty as sentencer and to assure that a proper and proportionate sentence was imposed at the resentencing, deferring its sentencing authority to the Parole Board and denying the Defendant due process.

Absent a legislative implementation of\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   court drew upon other enactments to establish a procedure until the legislature could act. Similarly, although the Legislature was unable to enact legislation during the 2016 Regular Session, it\n   has provided general sentencing guidelines in La.C.Cr.P. art. 894.1, which the District Court may deem relevant in accordance with La.C.Cr.P. art. 878.1(B). Other states have also legislatively implemented\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   . For example, Florida has enumerated the following factors to be considered in sentencing a juvenile to life imprisonment:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (a) The nature and circumstances of the offense committed by the defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (b) The effect of the crime on the victim's family and on the community.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (c) The defendant's age, maturity, intellectual capacity, and mental and emotional health at the time of the offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (d) The defendant's background, including his or her family, home, and community environment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (e) The effect, if any, of immaturity, impetuosity, or failure to appreciate risks and consequences on the defendant's participation in the offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (f) The extent of the defendant's participation in the offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (g) The effect, if any, of familial pressure or peer pressure on the defendant's actions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (h) The nature and extent of the defendant's prior criminal history.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (i) The effect, if any, of characteristics attributable to the defendant's youth on the defendant's judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (j) The possibility of rehabilitating the defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20921.1401\">\n    Fla.

Finally, the District Court must also be mindful of the Supreme Court's directive in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. at 2469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"to take into account how children are different, and how those differences counsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in prison.\" In making its ultimate determination regarding parole eligibility, the District Court is further directed to issue reasons indicating the factors it considered to aid in appellate review of the sentence imposed after resentencing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Appellate counsel argues the Louisiana Legislature has consistently failed to enact penalty statutes that satisfy the directives in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    567 U.S. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Counsel points out there has been no amendment to the first and second degree murder statutes. Louisiana Revised Statutes 14:30 provides for a sentence of death or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole while La.R.S. 14:30.1 mandates a life sentence without the possibility of parole, and neither statue references the age of the offender. Counsel contends that because La.R.S. 14:30 has not been amended, there is no statute under which a valid sentence for first degree murder committed by a juvenile can be imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Instead of amending the sentencing provisions of La.R.S. 14:30 and La.R.S. 14:30.1, the Louisiana Legislature enacted La.R.S. 15:574.4(E) and La.Code Crim.P. art. 878.1 in 2013, the year after the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   decision. Counsel notes that La.R.S. 15:574(E) was amended in 2017 to reduce the time a defendant is required to serve before becoming eligible for parole from thirty-five to twenty-five years. Counsel contends that the addition of parole eligibility and access to the Parole Board after twenty-five years is not the equivalent of a meaningful opportunity for release from incarceration and does not satisfy\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   . Further, counsel claims the Louisiana Supreme Court has deprived juveniles of the proportionality review mandated in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   by delegating the \"sentencing choice\" to the Parole Board. Counsel argues that\n   the Louisiana Supreme Court created substantive law when it set forth possible penalties which were not and still have not been authorized by the legislature. Additionally, the district court did not hold a sentencing hearing with full consideration of mitigating evidence. However, counsel admits the sentence imposed was within the parameters established in\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793142\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/194/606/#p607\">\n    194 So.3d 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Counsel claims the Louisiana Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   said the only issue to be resolved in a\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   hearing was whether the inmate would be granted or denied parole eligibility, which she alleges is a finding the United States Supreme Court did not make in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    567 U.S. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Therein, the Louisiana Supreme Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   One of the traditional, inherent and exclusive powers of the judiciary is the power to sentence.\n   <em>\n    State v.

After a defendant is convicted of a crime, the determination of his sentence is within the sound discretion of the trial judge.\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, the trial judge's sentencing discretion is not unbridled, as the legislative branch of government is free to decide what constitutes a crime as well as \"what punishments shall be meted out by a court after the judicial ascertainment of guilt.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Normand\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9734125\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/285/210/#p211\">\n    285 So.2d 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 211 (La.1973). Therefore, the fixing of penalties is purely a legislative function, but the trial judge has the discretion to determine the appropriate sentence within the sentencing range fixed by the legislature.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 978 (footnotes omitted). Appellate counsel then notes that La.R.S. 15:321(A) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   The enactment of statutes defining criminal offenses and the establishment of ranges of penalties for those offenses is a matter of substantive law solely within the prerogative of the legislature. The determination and imposition of sentence in particular cases is generally the function of the sentencing court, subject to appellate review and to mandatory sentences provided by law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Further, La.Const. art. 2, \u00a7 2 specifies the judicial branch is prohibited from exercising the power assigned to the legislative branch. Counsel contends that the legislature's failure to act resulted in a violation of the Defendant's due process rights. Thus, any interim rules created by the Louisiana Supreme Court are unenforceable because they were created without authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Because the district court relied on the Louisiana Supreme Court's improperly drafted rule, counsel submits the Defendant's sentence is illegal \"as still imposed pursuant to a statute ... whose penal provision has been declared unconstitutional.\" Appellate counsel claims that inasmuch as the Louisiana Supreme Court was without authority to create sentencing alternatives, the trial court was not bound by them. It had other sentencing possibilities available, including resentencing the Defendant to the maximum sentence for the responsive verdict of manslaughter or a downward departure from the life sentence\n   in accordance with\n   <em>\n    State v. Dorthey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7490196\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/623/1276/\">\n    623 So.2d 1276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La.1993). Counsel asserts the appropriate action would have been to follow the decision in\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   , the defendant had been convicted of aggravated rape, which carried a mandatory sentence of death. The Louisiana Supreme Court held that since the mandatory death penalty for first degree murder had been found unconstitutional in\n   <em>\n    Roberts v. Louisiana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177727\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/428/325/\">\n    428 U.S. 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177727\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/428/325/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 3001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177727\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/428/325/\">\n    49 L.Ed.2d 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976), the mandatory death penalty for aggravated rape was likewise unconstitutional. At the time the rape was committed, the legislature had abrogated the responsive verdict of guilty without capital punishment. Therefore, the appropriate remedy to correct the defendant's illegal sentence was to remand for resentencing to the most serious penalty for the next lesser responsive verdict, simple rape. Counsel acknowledges that an argument similar to hers was rejected by the Louisiana Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    State v.

One defendant had been sentenced to life imprisonment with an express restriction against parole eligibility.

Relators argued that the appropriate remedy in light of the\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   decision was to resentence them in accordance with the penalty provision for the next lesser and included responsive verdict of attempted aggravated rape. The\n   <em>\n    Shaffer\n   </em>\n   court recognized that\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   required neither the immediate release of relators nor a remedy that would guarantee their immediate release based on credit for time served.

The\n   <em>\n    Shaffer\n   </em>\n   court went on to reject the suggestion that the proper remedy was resentencing under a lesser and included offense and held the appropriate remedy was to delete the restrictions on parole eligibility.

The Defendant contends that fair warning has long been part of our justice system and is recognized as fundamental to our concept of constitutional liberty. Due process also guarantees that a person receive fair notice of the conduct that will subject him to punishment as well as the severity of the penalty that may be imposed.

Furthermore, in\n   <em>\n    Harper\n   </em>\n   , --- So.3d ----, the defendant argued his sentence imposed under La.R.S. 15:574.4(E) violated due process by failing to provide fair notice. The second circuit addressed the issue, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-195\">\n   The elements required for proof of second degree murder have not changed since the crime was committed in 1990, and the potential sentence for committing that crime remains life imprisonment at hard labor. The only difference now is that the court may impose the sentence with the benefit of parole eligibility, which is a less harsh sentence. Thus, Harper was not deprived of fair warning that his conduct would constitute criminal behavior or prejudiced because his potential sentence was not made more severe by application of La.

The Defendant argues that due process demands he receive a penalty fixed by the legislature. The Defendant contends that La.R.S. 15:574.4(E) is not a sentencing penalty for juveniles but contains factors the Parole Board must consider before releasing a juvenile on parole. The Defendant avers the only penalty in effect for first degree murder is mandatory life imprisonment, and that has been declared unconstitutional.

He also states the district court denied him due process when it retroactively expanded La.R.S. 15:574.4(E) to juvenile offenders such as himself. The Defendant avers the district court imposed the sentence based on the Louisiana Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793142\" index=\"283\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/194/606/#p607\">\n    194 So.3d 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which was decided decades after he committed the offenses and retroactively applied to his case.

City of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166404\" index=\"284\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/378/347/\">\n    378 U.S. 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166404\" index=\"285\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/378/347/\">\n    84 S.Ct. 1697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166404\" index=\"286\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/378/347/\">\n    12 L.Ed.2d 894\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1964), applies. In\n   <em>\n    Bouie\n   </em>\n   , the Court stated, \"If a judicial construction of a criminal statute is 'unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in issue,' it must not be given retroactive effect.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166404\" index=\"287\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/378/347/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166404\" index=\"287\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/378/347/\">\n    at 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166404\" index=\"288\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/378/347/\">\n    84 S.Ct. 1697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   For the reasons set forth in the discussion of assignments of error numbers one, two, and three and pro se assignment of error number two, this assignment of error also lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   <strong>\n    PRO SE ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER FIVE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   In his fifth pro se assignment of error, the Defendant contends the district court violated both the state and federal ex post facto clauses when it applied newly-created reformatory procedures not in existence at the time the offenses occurred instead of imposing a substantive penalty legislatively prescribed as required by the Constitution. The Defendant contends the retroactive application of La.R.S. 15:574.4(E) to him violates the ex post facto clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   The Defendant notes that Louisiana jurisprudence has consistently held that the law in effect at the time of the commission of the offense is determinative of the penalty which the convicted must suffer. The Defendant claims the district court altered the terms and conditions of a \"penalty that does not exist,\" and it made the heart of the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   decision moot regardless of what it heard and of what the Eighth Amendment required after\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"289\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    567 U.S. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, Defendant claims the district court was determined to impose a life sentence. He argues that the change in the law presents a sufficient risk of increasing his punishment. He notes that first and second degree murder still provide for a mandatory life sentence without benefits. The Defendant avers that Louisiana took the most narrow reading of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   in crafting a statute that effectively preserves the brutal life sentence for offenders under eighteen by limiting sentencing courts to solely determining whether a sentence shall be imposed with or without parole eligibility. The Defendant argues the limiting language means there has been no change in Louisiana, and the addition of the possibility of parole is meaningless in Louisiana. The Defendant declares that because he has no right to parole, Louisiana has effectively denied what\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   sought to guarantee. Further, as long as the Board of Parole has the authority to deny parole, life without parole remains a possibility regardless of the individual's situation. Also, he claims the statutory scheme in Louisiana sets arduous conditions that an inmate must achieve through programs created by the executive branch, including education, disciplinary, and other hurdles that can be characterized only as burdens on whatever relief eligibility might be. Absent compliance with the conditions, Defendant avers there is no chance of parole eligibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Calhoun\n   </em>\n   , 222 So.3d at 907, the second circuit addressed the defendant's ex post facto claim regarding resentencing at a\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   hearing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-208\">\n   The law in effect at the time of the crime determines the penalty to be suffered by the criminal.\n   <em>\n    State v.
