We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In May 2013, the Bank filed a foreclosure complaint against the Millers, alleging that the Millers defaulted on their February 1, 2007 mortgage payment and all subsequent payments. The Millers successfully moved for summary judgment, arguing that the statute of limitations barred the Bank's claim based on the default date alleged in the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 95.11(2)(c), Fla. Stat. (2013) (providing five-year statute of limitations period for foreclosure actions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The trial court erred in granting the motion for summary judgment based on the statute of limitations. The Bank's complaint was not time-barred because the Bank alleged a continuous state of default that encompassed payments within the five years preceding the filing of the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Velden v.
