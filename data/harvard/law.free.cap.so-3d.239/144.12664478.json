Gutierrez contends that his habitual violent felony offender sentences are illegal under\n   <em>\n    Heggs v.

Therefore, the 1995 sentencing guidelines, and the\n   <em>\n    Heggs\n   </em>\n   decision striking down those guidelines as unconstitutional, has no application to the non-guidelines sentences imposed on Gutierrez in the instant case.\n   <em>\n    De La Rosa v.
