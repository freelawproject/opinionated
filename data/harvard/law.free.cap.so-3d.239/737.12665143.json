State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9110341\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/850/1265/\">\n    850 So.2d 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1268 n.3 (Fla. 2003) (defining scrivener's error as written clerical error that is not \"the result of a judicial determination or error\"). The judgment erroneously cites to section 782.07, Florida Statutes (2015), for the crime of burglary of a dwelling with an assault or battery and a firearm when the correct statutory citation is section 810.02(2)(a), Florida Statutes (2015), and erroneously cites to section 810.02(2)(a) for the crime of aggravated assault with a firearm when the correct citation is section 784.021(2), Florida Statutes (2015). The judgment also erroneously lists the burglary of a dwelling with an assault or battery and a firearm conviction as a second-degree felony when it is a life felony, and it lists the aggravated assault with a firearm conviction as a life felony when it is a third-degree felony. We therefore remand for correction of the scrivener's errors. In all other respects, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   AFFIRMED; REMANDED FOR CORRECTION OF SCRIVENER'S ERRORS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   SAWAYA, BERGER and LAMBERT, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
