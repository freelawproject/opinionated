The pick-up truck that Paul Molbert was driving collided with the RTA bus. Cody Johnson, a passenger on the RTA bus, commenced this suit against multiple defendants including the RTA; Mr. Molbert; and Mr. Molbert's employer, Anesthesia Consultants of the South, LLC (\"ACS\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A jury trial was held in this matter. At the close of Ms. Johnson's evidence, the trial court granted ACS's motion for directed verdict, finding that Mr. Molbert was commuting to work and was thus outside the course and scope of his employment. From the judgment granting the directed verdict, Ms. Johnson appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The relevant facts in this case are undisputed. On the morning of November 20, 2009, at approximately 6:30 a.m., the above-described accident occurred on South Claiborne Avenue, near the intersection of Martin Luther King, Jr., Boulevard,\n   in New Orleans, Louisiana. At the time of the accident, Mr. Molbert was\n   <em>\n    en route\n   </em>\n   to work for ACS at Baptist Hospital on Napoleon Avenue. After exchanging information with the RTA bus driver, Mr. Molbert left the accident scene to report to work. He did not wait for the police to arrive to investigate the accident; however, he gave a statement to the police that night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Seeking to recover for the personal injuries she sustained as a result of the accident, Ms. Johnson commenced this suit against multiple defendants, including Mr. Molbert's employer, ACS. She averred that, at the time of the accident, Mr. Molbert was acting within the course and scope of his employment. ACS denied liability and filed a motion for summary judgment. Although ACS admitted that Mr. Molbert was one of its employees, it denied that Mr. Molbert was acting within the course and scope of his employment. It contended that, because Mr. Molbert was commuting to work, he was outside the course and scope of his employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   From the trial court's judgment denying the motion for summary judgment, ACS filed an application for supervisory writ. This court denied ACS's writ application. By a split vote, the Louisiana Supreme Court likewise denied ACS's writ application.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Transit Mgmt. of Southeast Louisiana Inc.,\n   </em>\n   13-2752 (La. 2/7/14),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7280344,7280403,7280374\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/131/870/\">\n    131 So.3d 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Before trial, ACS re-urged its motion for summary judgment. The trial court again denied the motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In May 2017, a jury trial commenced in this case. At trial, Mr. Molbert was the sole witness to testify regarding his employment with ACS and the circumstances surrounding his commute to work on the morning of the accident. He testified that, at the time of the accident, he was employed by ACS as a nurse anesthetist. He had a fixed place of employment; he worked for ACS at Baptist Hospital on Napoleon Avenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On the morning of the accident, he was scheduled to be on call starting at 7:00 a.m. One hour before he went on call (at 6:00 a.m.), he received a telephone call at home from his boss, requesting that he come into work to handle a case involving a college student who needed an appendectomy. As a result of the call, Mr. Molbert testified that he left home for work that morning about fifteen minutes earlier than usual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Before reaching work, he was involved in the above-described accident. Mr. Molbert estimated the time of the accident to be between 6:20 and 6:30 a.m. According to Mr. Molbert, he was approximately five to ten minutes from work, depending on the traffic, when the accident occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. Molbert described being on call as a routine part of his job with ACS. He explained that, when he was on call, the circumstances-how busy his department was-determined his work schedule. Tentatively, he could come into work later than usual (at 9:30 a.m.); however, if his department was very busy, he would come into work, while on call, at his usual start time (then 7:00 a.m.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. Molbert was an hourly-paid employee of ACS. His pay period, even when he was on call, did not commence until he checked in at work. At the time of the accident, he had not yet checked in at work; hence, he was not being paid. At the time of the accident, Mr. Molbert testified that he considered himself to be on personal, not work, time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Molbert owned the vehicle that he was driving at the time of the accident-a pick-up truck. ACS did not pay any portion of the purchase price of the vehicle. Mr. Molbert paid the maintenance, repairs,\n   gas, and all of the other expenses for the vehicle. ACS did not reimburse Mr. Molbert for any expenses of ownership of the vehicle or for any of his transportation or mileage expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mr. Molbert testified that he decided what route to take to work on the morning of the accident and that he took his regular route. He explained that he took the same route to work five days a week, including when he was on call. His regular job duties did not involve driving, running errands, or making deliveries for ACS. At the time of the accident, he was not making any deliveries or doing anything for ACS; he had not made any stops between leaving his home that morning and the scene of accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the close of Ms. Johnson's evidence, ACS moved for a directed verdict. In support, ACS repeated the argument it raised on its motions for summary judgment-that Mr. Molbert was commuting to work and thus outside the course and scope of his employment. Citing\n   <em>\n    Mclin v. Industrial Specialty Contractors, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 02-1539 (La. 7/2/03),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9104815\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/851/1135/\">\n    851 So.2d 1135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   as controlling, the trial court granted the motion for directed verdict. In so doing, the trial court judge orally reasoned as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    McLin\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court case cited seven criteria to consider whether or not the person was coming and going ... and that was the test that was annunciated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   One, Molbert was the only one who testified, and his testimony was uncontroverted as to his time of reporting to work, and all the factors concerning his commute to work. He was not felt [sic] on his employee's premises, according to\n   <em>\n    McLin\n   </em>\n   . He was not on a specific mission for his employer. He was going to work to report to his employer. There was no reimbursement for travel expenses and the employer did not provide transportation. There was no implied employer consent under the circumstances while driving to work or while doing work. He wasn't traveling from one work site to another. The accident was not immediately adjacent to the place of employment. And there was no travel risks going to that place of employment. And the operation of the motor vehicle was not duties performed pursuant to his employment,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   he was not performing any duties for the employer at the time he was in route to his job.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Thereafter, the trial court entered a written judgment, dated July 6, 2017, granting the directed verdict and dismissing ACS as a defendant with prejudice. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On appeal, Ms. Johnson's sole assignment of error is that the trial court legally erred in granting ACS's motion for directed verdict. In a jury trial, a party may move for directed verdict at the close of an opponent's evidence. La. C.C.P. art. 1810.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The motion for directed verdict is a procedural device available in a jury trial to promote judicial economy.\n   <em>\n    Seither v.

Unless the facts of this case are outside the ambit of the going-and-coming rule or fall within one of the exceptions to the rule, Mr. Molbert was outside the course and scope of his employment with ACS, precluding a finding of vicarious liability. On appeal, Ms. Johnson makes both of those arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   First, she contends that the going-and-coming rule is inapplicable because Mr. Molbert, like the volunteer firefighter in\n   <em>\n    Matlock v.

In\n   <em>\n    Matlock\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Hankel, a volunteer fireman, received a call at his home from his fire chief to respond to a fire. Driving his personal vehicle, Mr. Hankel rushed from his home to the scene of the fire. When he arrived at the scene, Mr. Hankel struck a pedestrian with his vehicle. The pedestrian sued, among others, the Fort Pike Volunteer Fire Department (\"FPV\") and the City of New Orleans Fire Department (\"NOFD\"), contending they both were vicariously liable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rejecting an attempt to equate Mr. Hankel's response to the fire with an ordinary commute to work, this court reasoned as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   [W]e do not believe that the response of a volunteer fireman to a fire is equivalent to an ordinary commute to work.

In\n   <em>\n    Orgeron\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court, based upon the time constraints imposed on an employee to report to a particular (non-employer premises) location to work and the emergency nature of the assignment, held that an employer's automobile accident while he was on his way to work occurred within the course and scope of his employment. While the facts of the present case are very different from those of\n   <em>\n    Orgeron\n   </em>\n   , the present case does include the elements of [i] time constraint on Mr. Hankel's travel and [ii] an emergency situation. Apparently, FPV volunteer firemen were expected to respond to fires directly from their homes (Mr. Hankel had his helmet, fire coat[,] and gloves at home) and it is the nature of the situation that they will respond immediately and expeditiously.

Neither of those elements is present here. Mr. Molbert testified that this situation \"wasn't an emergency like I had to scream over there to get, you know, lights and sirens and everything. It just was a situation where I had to get there in a relatively timely manner.\" He characterized this as an urgency-not an emergency-situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Nor were there any time constraints on Mr. Molbert's travel beyond those placed on any commuter who is required to get to work by a particular time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Guidry v.

Contrary to Ms. Johnson's suggestion that Mr. Molbert was rushing to get to work, Mr. Molbert indicated that he was engaged in his normal commute to work with the exception that he left home a few minutes earlier than usual. Ms. Johnson's reliance on the fact that Mr. Molbert declined to stay on the scene to wait for the police as evidence that he was rushing to work is misplaced; Mr. Molbert's post-accident actions are not relevant to the question of whether Mr. Molbert was in the course and scope of his employment when the accident occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   There are two additional distinctions between the facts in the\n   <em>\n    Matlock\n   </em>\n   case and the facts of this case. One is that the firefighter in\n   <em>\n    Matlock\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Hankel, was on call. Mr. Molbert was not on call either at the time of his boss' call nor at the time of the accident. The other is that, in\n   <em>\n    Matlock\n   </em>\n   , the accident occurred at, or very near, the scene of the fire. As ACS points out, the accident occurred in the one place to which Mr. Hankel was expected to travel-the scene of the fire. In contrast, Mr. Molbert was five to ten minutes from his workplace, depending upon traffic, when the accident occurred. This accident did not occur at, or near, his workplace-the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   For all these reasons, Ms. Johnson's reliance on the\n   <em>\n    Matlock\n   </em>\n   case is misplaced.

The unusual time factor is thus not met here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Regardless, even assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that the unusual time factor is met here, the special mission exception generally is found to be \"inapplicable when the only special component is the fact that the employee began work earlier or quit work later than usual.\"\n   <em>\n    Larson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 14.05[4]. Hence, for all the above reasons, we conclude that the trial court correctly found the special mission exception inapplicable here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   After reviewing the evidence, in light of the substantive law regarding vicarious liability, we find that reasonable persons could not have reached a contrary result as to Ms. Johnson's vicarious liability claim against ACS. Thus, we find no error in the trial court's grant of ACS's motion for directed verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DECREE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   For the forgoing reasons, the trial court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   BELSOME, J., DISSENTS WITH REASONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   BELSOME, J., DISSENTS WITH REASONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion.

I had a 45 minute window, typically 45 minute window to get there.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    As to his decision not to wait for the police to arrive to investigate the accident, Mr. Molbert further testified that \"[t]his was 2009, post-Katrina New Orleans, it was like to get a response time, I don't know, my guess it would have been more than an hour. And if the surgeon was there and if the crew was there, it would probably be the better part of valor to go and take care of the patient with the appendix.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    In her appellant brief, Ms. Johnson cites Mr. Molbert's subsequent testimony quoted above. This testimony, however, was taken after the directed verdict was granted. This testimony thus was not part of the evidence the trial court relied upon in making its ruling. Regardless, considering this additional testimony would not change the result.
