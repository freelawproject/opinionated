(hereinafter referred to as \"JBPL\"), and Kathy Cassidy, the national director for JBPL, seek a writ of mandamus compelling the Tallapoosa Circuit Court to vacate its order denying their motion to dismiss an action against them on the ground of improper\n   venue arising out of a forum-selection clause and to enter an order dismissing the case. We grant the petition and issue the writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   JBPL is a multilevel marketing company that sells jewelry through independent contractors who host parties offering JBPL's jewelry line for sale. Jennifer Miller lives and works in Alabama. In July 2015, Miller attended an annual convention hosted by JBPL in Rosemont, Illinois. At that time, Miller worked for a competitor of JBPL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 4, 2015, Miller and JBPL entered into a \"director agreement.\" The front of the agreement set out Miller's personal information along with the name of the JBPL person who \"sponsored\" her and the name of the JBPL manager to whom Miller would answer. The director agreement further provided, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"I hereby apply to become an Independent Contractor of [JBPL]. As an Independent Contractor of JBPL, I understand and agree to the following terms:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"16. The director agrees that this Agreement has been drafted in accordance with the laws of the state of Illinois, and that the company is a [sic] Illinois corporation. The director agrees that the company may use equitable remedies (including specific performance and injunctive relief) in addition to any other remedies available, for any actions of the director which may be deemed to be in violation of this Agreement or in violation of any of the company's programs. Any disputes arising hereunder shall be solely governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state of Illinois and personal and subject matter jurisdiction is solely vested in the courts of the state of Illinois.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The reverse side of the agreement contains a space for the name and address of the executive training manager to whom Miller's jewelry kit is to be sent. That space has one word filled in; it appears to read \"Sent.\" The reverse side of the director agreement also provides spaces for the director, i.e., Miller, to set out the upcoming home parties at which JBPL's jewelry line will be displayed to potential customers. This part of Miller's director agreement is blank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Another part of the director agreement provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"Leader Direct Appointment Approval Authorization\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"(Complete the following when Applicable.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"1.

Miller alleged that JBPL promised to employ her for a 12-month period and to pay her $4,000 a month for that period. Miller set out claims alleging account stated, open account, breach of contract, and fraud. Miller sought compensatory damages, punitive damages, and attorney fees. Miller attached a letter to her complaint. The letter, dated \"August 2015,\" provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \"Dear Jennifer,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \"Congratulations on your appointment to the Executive Position of Sales Vice President.

We look forward to working together for many years to come!\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \"/s/ Kathy Cassidy\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On August 12, 2016, JBPL and Cassidy filed a joint Rule 12(b)(3), Ala. R. Civ. P., motion to dismiss Miller's action based on improper venue. They argued that the outbound forum-selection clause in the director agreement required Miller to bring her action in Illinois. Subsequently, Miller amended her complaint to include a fraud-in-the-inducement claim. Miller admitted that the director agreement contained a forum-selection clause but argued that she would not have entered into the agreement but for the fraud perpetuated by JBPL and Cassidy. The defendants responded, arguing that, in order to void the forum-selection clause, the fraud must be directed to that particular clause and not to the contract as a whole. Following a hearing at which the parties discussed only the arguments related to the defendants' Rule 12(b)(3) motion, the trial court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   JBPL and Cassidy timely filed a petition for a writ of mandamus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \" 'Mandamus is a drastic and extraordinary writ, to be issued only where\n   there is (1) a clear legal right in the petitioner to the order sought; (2) an imperative duty upon the respondent to perform, accompanied by a refusal to do so; (3) the lack of another adequate remedy; and (4) properly invoked jurisdiction of the court.'\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Integon Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7427978\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/672/497/#p499\">\n    672 So.2d 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 499 (Ala. 1995).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Ex parte CTB, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11104072\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/782/188/#p190\">\n    782 So.2d 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 190 (Ala. 2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \"[A]n attempt to seek enforcement of the outbound forum-selection clause is properly presented in a motion to dismiss without prejudice, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(3), Ala.

Miller contends that she was a \"director\" in name only and was not to operate as an independent contractor but, instead, was hired as a sales vice president for JBPL. However, Miller acknowledges that she signed the director agreement that contains the forum-selection clause. Miller does not argue that the forum-selection clause is ambiguous. The chosen forum is the location of JBPL's headquarters, and JBPL's sole office is in Illinois as well. Cassidy travels to JBPL's headquarters to conduct business on regular basis. Miller traveled to Illinois to attend the JBPL convention. Miller does not argue that any extraordinary circumstances have arisen since the director agreement was entered into that would make Illinois a seriously inconvenient forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   We now turn to whether enforcement of the forum-selection clause would be unfair on the basis that the director agreement was affected by fraud, undue influence, or overweening bargaining power. Miller does not argue that she was subject to undue influence in the negotiation or execution of the director agreement or that JBPL or Cassidy had overweening bargaining power over her. Instead, Miller asserts that the defendants fraudulently induced her to sign the director agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   This Court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \"[T]he proper inquiry is whether the forum-selection clause is the result of fraud in the inducement in the negotiation or inclusion in the agreement of the forum-selection clause itself. If the forum-selection clause is the result of fraud in the inducement, then the fraud exception to the enforceability of the clause applies.\n   <em>\n    However, if the claim of fraud in the inducement is directed toward the entire contract, the fraud exception to enforcement of the forum-selection clause does not apply\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Leasecomm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9222508\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/879/1156/#p1158\">\n    879 So.2d at 1159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added); see also\n   <em>\n    Ex parte PT Solutions Holdings, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12366035\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/225/37/#p44\">\n    225 So.3d 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 44-45 (Ala. 2016) (explaining that the logic behind considering the validity of the forum-selection clause before analyzing the validity of the contract as a whole is to ensure that the more general claims of contractual fraud will be litigated in accordance with the contractual expectations of the parties in selecting a forum).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In the present case, Miller argues that she was fraudulently induced to sign the director agreement as a whole.
