Franklin Williams defaulted on a promissory note and deed of trust. US Bank Trust foreclosed the deed of trust and received a substitute trustee's deed. The Bank later discovered that the property description in both Williams's deed and the purchase money deed of trust contained errors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. US Bank filed for a declaratory judgment and reformation of its deed of trust to correspond with the corrected description contained in Williams's deed, and thus allow it to proceed with foreclosure. The Pearl River County Chancery Court granted summary judgment to US Bank,\n   and Williams appeals. We find no error and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. In November 2003, Dan Boone Custom Homes Inc. acquired title to a ten-acre tract in Pearl River County. On February 23, 2004, Boone deeded five acres (including a house) to Williams. The warranty deed to Williams incorrectly referenced Section 26 instead of Section 27, but the indexing instruction properly referred to Section 27. The deed also referenced Stone County rather than Pearl River County, though it was filed in the Pearl River County Chancery Clerk's land deed records. Discovering the error, Williams obtained a quitclaim deed from Boone with a corrected description. The corrected quitclaim deed was filed with a survey of the five-acre tract, done by Hattaway Engineering, as an attachment. The survey described two five-acre parcels, identified as Parcels A and B. Parcel B was conveyed to Williams. Boone retained Parcel A, which it later sold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. At the time of purchase, Williams had executed a promissory note to Ameritrust Mortgage Company for $106,000. The note was secured by a purchase money deed of trust in favor of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems Inc., nominee for Ameritrust. The deed of trust contained the same errors in the property description that were in Williams's original deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. After Parcel B was conveyed to Williams, Boone mistakenly used the legal description for the entire ten acres to convey Parcel A, creating a conflict with Williams's deed. The conflict was corrected by subsequent deeds in the chain of title of both Parcels A and B. These two deeds, along with the original corrective deed, confirm the final legal description of the Parcel B five-acre tract which had been purchased by Williams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. Ten years later, Williams defaulted on the promissory note. The erroneous deed of trust was noticed for a foreclosure sale on October 9, 2014. At that sale, US Bank made a credit bid, and a substitute trustee's deed-with the erroneous description-was executed to US Bank. When Williams failed to relinquish possession, US Bank filed suit in the Pearl River County Court. Williams defended alleging that the foreclosure was invalid because the deed of trust contained errors. With the consent of the parties, the county court dismissed the Bank's suit without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. US Bank then filed this action in the Pearl River County Chancery Court for reformation of the deed of trust to correct the property description to match that of Williams's corrected deed. As part of its motion for summary judgment, US Bank attached an affidavit from David Lopez as trustee. Based on that affidavit, the chancery court granted summary judgment to US Bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8. \"We employ a de novo standard of review of a trial court's grant or denial of summary judgment and examine all the evidentiary matters before it ....\"\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Declaratory Relief and Reformation of the Deed of Trust\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 10. US Bank sought declaratory relief under Mississippi Code Annotated section 89-1-45 (Rev. 2011), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Every mortgage given at the time of the purchase of real estate to secure the payment of the purchase money, whether such mortgage be given to the seller or to a third-party lender, shall be entitled to a preference over all judgments and other debts of the mortgagor, which preference shall extend only to the land purchased.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After Williams defaulted on the promissory note and deed of trust, US Bank bid at a public sale on what it understood to be the subject property. Williams did not oppose correction of the same errors in his deed, nor did he deny owing a balance on his debt for purchase money loaned to him by US Bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 11. The Mississippi Supreme Court, as well as this Court, has repeatedly affirmed judgments reforming a deed of trust to reflect parties' intentions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flowers v. Boolos (In re Estate of Smith)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12139970,12139519,12139394\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/204/291/\">\n    204 So.3d 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 309 (\u00b6 38) (Miss. 2016) ;\n   <em>\n    Veterans Admin. v.

Merch. &amp; Mfr. Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1309096\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/218/777/\">\n    218 Miss. 777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=67%20So.%202d%20714\">\n    67 So.2d 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 716 (1953) ;\n   <em>\n    Birchett v. Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1841782\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/160/144/\">\n    160 Miss. 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1841782\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/160/144/\">\n    133 So. 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 131 (1931) ;\n   <em>\n    Wright v. Henley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6890722\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/158/1166/#p1170\">\n    158 So.3d 1166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1170 (\u00b6 13) (Miss. Ct. App. 2014). Here, due to a scrivener's error, Williams's deed and deed of trust listed the wrong section and county. It is undisputed that Boone intended to convey a specific five acres to Williams in Pearl River County and that Williams intended to buy those five acres. This intent is evidenced by the quitclaim deed obtained by Williams from Boone carrying out that intent. Based on the clear intent of the parties, we find summary judgment was proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Election of Remedies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 12. On appeal, Williams raises election of remedies as a defense. Election of remedies is an affirmative defense and requires \"(1) existence of two or more remedies, (2) inconsistency between such remedies, and (3) a choice of one of the remedies.\"\n   <em>\n    Knight Props. Inc. v. State Bank &amp; Tr. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7020255\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/77/491/#p494\">\n    77 So.3d 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 494 (\u00b6 13) (Miss. Ct. App. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 13. Because Williams failed to raise this defense in the trial court, it is waived. Were it not waived, election of remedies does not apply. Although two or more remedies exist here (foreclosure or a judgment in total satisfaction of the debt), our supreme court has held that there is no inconsistency in a mortgagee's legal and equitable rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7020255\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/77/491/#p494\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7020255\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/77/491/#p494\">\n    at 494-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Estoppel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 14. Williams next raises the defense of equitable estoppel, a defense he also raised in chancery court. He cites no authority for his position. Our supreme\n   court \"has repeatedly held that failure to cite any authority may be treated as a procedural bar.\"\n   <em>\n    Rolison v. Fryar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12151116\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so3d/204/725/#p738\">\n    204 So.3d 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 738 (\u00b6 33) (Miss. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 15. Nevertheless, equitable estoppel does not apply here. The elements required for equitable estoppel are \"(1) belief and reliance on some representation; (2) a change of position as a result thereof; and (3) detriment or prejudice caused by the change of position.\"\n   <em>\n    Eagle Mgmt. LLC v. Parks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8474210\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/938/899/#p904\">\n    938 So.2d 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 904 (\u00b6 13) (Miss. Ct. App. 2006) (citation omitted). The record fails to show that Williams relied on any representation by US Bank. As a result, Williams cannot satisfy the remaining elements necessary for equitable estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Unclean Hands\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 16. Williams also raises the unclean hands doctrine as a defense. \"[T]he clean hands doctrine prevents a complaining party from obtaining equitable relief in court\" only if the party \"is guilty of willful misconduct in the transaction at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Scruggs v. Wyatt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7034267\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/60/758/#p772\">\n    60 So.3d 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 772 (\u00b6 34) (Miss. 2011) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bailey v. Bailey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11770450\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/724/335/#p337\">\n    724 So.2d 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 337 (\u00b6 6) (Miss. 1998) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 17. Specifically, Williams claims that US Bank \"engaged in quite egregious, fraudulent, and at times, unlawful activity in attempting to force [him] to surrender important rights ....\" He refers to a demand letter from Frank Healy of Marisol Law Group, acting on behalf of US Bank. For the first time on appeal, Williams claims that the letter directly violates the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to 1692p (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 18. It is well established that this Court will not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Fowler v. White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7019536\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/85/287/#p293\">\n    85 So.3d 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 293 (\u00b6 21) (Miss. 2012). Thus, we decline to address Williams's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Affidavits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 19. Williams finally claims that the chancellor failed to consider his own \"affidavit\" and erroneously relied on US Bank Trustee David Lopez's affidavit. We address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 20. Williams did not submit an affidavit. Rather, he attempts to categorize his unsworn response in opposition to summary judgment as an affidavit. Even so, the court stated in its motion that Williams failed to provide any evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact on either the merits of the reformation or on any potential defenses. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 21. US Bank did present an affidavit from Lopez as trustee. Lopez testified to the undisputed facts as shown in the Pearl River County Chancery Clerk's land records-that the deed of trust contained a scrivener's error in the legal description. His affidavit also referred to the Hattaway Survey, which was recorded in the land records with a curative deed obtained by Williams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 22. Williams specifically argues that the affidavit lacks personal knowledge because Lopez, who resides in Texas, was not the scrivener and was not present at the auction. He further argues that Lopez was not competent to testify. We find Williams's argument unconvincing. Not only did Lopez testify that he had personal knowledge of the facts he provided, Williams offered no evidence to contradict Lopez's sworn statements. Nor does Williams cite any authority requiring Lopez to have been the scrivener or present at the auction in order to have personal knowledge of the facts stated in his affidavit. Lopez simply testified via uncontested affidavit to matters within the purview of public record and US Bank files. Accordingly, we find the chancery court properly considered Lopez's affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 23. After review, we find that no properly presented evidence creates a genuine issue of material fact. Therefore the circuit court's grant of summary judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 24.\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   LEE, C.J., IRVING AND GRIFFIS, P.JJ., BARNES, CARLTON, WILSON, GREENLEE, WESTBROOKS AND TINDELL, JJ., CONCUR.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
