On March 26, 2015, Quality First Financial, Inc., foreclosed upon the mortgage and purchased the disputed property at a foreclosure sale. On August 19, 2015, Steven G. Humphrey, an \"authorized member\" of Humphrey Investments, LLC, executed two documents in favor of Oak Road, each entitled \"Assignment of Statutory Right of Redemption\"; Steven Humphrey executed one of those documents on his own behalf and the other on behalf of Humphrey Investments,\n   LLC (Steven Humphrey and Humphrey Investments, LLC, are hereinafter referred to collectively as \"the assignors\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 24, 2015, Quality First Financial, Inc., executed a warranty deed conveying its interest in the disputed property to Oak Road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 23, 2016, Steven Humphrey executed a quitclaim deed, individually and on behalf of Humphrey Investments, LLC, conveying their interests, \"including the right of redemption,\" in the disputed property to Asset. Two days later, Asset initiated an action in the circuit court seeking to redeem the disputed property pursuant to \u00a7 6-5-248, Ala. Code 1975, and alleging, among other things, that Oak Road had committed waste by making unnecessary permanent improvements on the disputed property and that Asset was therefore unable to ascertain the lawful charges it was required to pay to redeem the property. Thus, Asset requested, among other things, that the circuit court determine the correct amount of lawful charges that it was required to pay to redeem the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Oak Road responded to Asset's claims by submitting a motion for a summary judgment on \"two completely\n   <em>\n    independent\n   </em>\n   bas[e]s.\" (emphasis in original.) First, Oak Road asserted that, because the assignors had already assigned their statutory redemption rights to Oak Road when it acquired the disputed property in August 2015, Asset could not have acquired a statutory right to redeem the disputed property via the subsequently executed quitclaim deed referenced in its complaint. Second, Oak Road argued that, even assuming that Asset had acquired a statutory right of redemption, Oak Road was nevertheless entitled to a judgment as a matter of law because Asset had failed to tender the redemption price or, alternatively, had failed to request a statement of lawful charges before the expiration of the redemption period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Asset submitted a response to Oak Road's motion in which it asserted, among other things, that Oak Road could not rely upon the assignors' assignments of their statutory redemption rights because Oak Road had not recorded the assignments, as Asset contended was required under Alabama law. Asset also admitted that it had not tendered the redemption price or requested a statement of lawful charges but argued that it was not \"statutorily required\" to do so because there was a \"bona fide disagreement as to what are permanent improvements and the value therein.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Oak Road thereafter submitted a \"supplemental brief in support of its motion for [a] summary judgment\" in which it argued that Asset could not avail itself of the protection afforded by Alabama's recording statutes because, it asserted, those statutes protected only bona fide purchasers, Asset was merely a quitclaim grantee, and quitclaim grantees are not bona fide purchasers as a matter of law. Asset submitted a response to Oak Road's supplemental brief in which it argued that it was permitted to redeem the disputed property notwithstanding the assignors' prior assignments of their statutory rights of redemption to Oak Road because, Asset\n   contended, \"[t]he statutory right of redemption, like a license[,] can be assigned as many times as the assignor desires, unless otherwise limited, until one of the assignees exercises the right, as required by statute.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 19, 2016, the circuit court entered an order granting Oak Road's summary-judgment motion without specifying the reason for its decision. Asset filed a postjudgment motion on June 18, 2016, and the circuit court entered an order on August 9, 2016, denying Asset's postjudgment motion. Asset filed a timely notice of appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court. The appeal was transferred to this court by the supreme court, pursuant to \u00a7 12-2-7(6), Ala.

Oak Road argues that the circuit court's judgment should be affirmed, either because it had already acquired the assignors' statutory rights of redemption before they executed the quitclaim deed to Asset or because Asset did not properly assert its statutory right of redemption by failing to timely request a statement of lawful charges. Notably, Asset does not argue on appeal that the assignors' assignments of their statutory rights of redemption to Oak Road were somehow invalid; rather, it insists that the assignors' conveyance of their statutory rights of redemption via the quitclaim deed to Asset was also valid. Thus, the dispositive issue regarding Oak Road's first argument is whether the assignors' execution of the quitclaim deed effectively assigned to Asset their statutory rights to redeem the disputed property.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"When real property in Alabama is mortgaged, the legal title passes to the mortgagee and the mortgagor retains the equity of redemption, which he may convey.\n   <em>\n    First National Bank of Mobile[] v.

Evans III,\n   <em>\n    Alabama Property Rights and Remedies\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 35.5, at 642 (1994) (footnotes omitted). However, for the purposes of this case, the most remarkable change in statutory language was the addition of the second sentence, which states that an assignment merely '\n   <em>\n    will accomplish a transfer of the interests of [the transferring] party\n   </em>\n   .' (Emphasis added.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"... It is difficult to imagine why the Legislature, in writing \u00a7 6-5-248(a)(5), included the second sentence, other than to declare or emphasize that the mortgagor's assignee simply stands in the shoes of the mortgagor, at least as to the respective positions of the mortgagor and foreclosure-sale purchaser at the time of the assignment.

To construe \u00a7 6-5-248(a)(5) to mean that a mortgagor can, under Alabama law, effectively assign its statutory right of redemption to a potentially unlimited number of persons would resurrect the \"complexity\" and \"obtuseness\" in our caselaw that the legislature sought to remedy by implementing Act No. 88-441, \u00a7 2(a)(5), now codified as \u00a7 6-5-248(a)(5).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9022279\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/897/1052/\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9022279\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/897/1052/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   We therefore decline Asset's invitation to so construe \u00a7 6-5-248(a)(5) in this case, and the circuit court's summary judgment in Oak Road's favor is due to be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Because the circuit court did not specify the reason for its decision, and because the\n   circuit court's summary judgment in favor of Oak Road was properly entered based on Oak Road's assertion that Asset had not acquired a statutory right of redemption, we do not consider whether the alternative basis proffered by Oak Road would have also supported a summary judgment in its favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7577230\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/514/858/#p860\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7577230\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/514/858/#p860\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Thompson, P.J., and Pittman, Moore, and Donaldson, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    The record is not clear as to what interest, if any, Steven Humphrey had in the disputed property; however, because the parties do not contend that resolution of the issues on appeal are impacted by any disparity of interest the assignors might have had in the disputed property and because both assignors executed the relevant documents purporting to transfer their redemption rights in the disputed property, we, like the parties, will treat the assignors as if each possessed the statutory right to redeem the property.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ex parte Professional Bus.
