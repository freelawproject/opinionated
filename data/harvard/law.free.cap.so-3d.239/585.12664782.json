We affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 7, 2015, All South filed a complaint seeking permission to redeem the property, which had been purchased by Ward from the State of Alabama, which had purchased the property at a tax sale. Ward answered the complaint on December 16, 2015. On December 17, 2015, Ward filed a motion for a summary judgment. All South responded to the summary-judgment motion on January 13, 2016. Ward filed a reply to All South's response on January 16, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 29, 2016, the trial court entered a judgment granting Ward's summary-judgment motion, concluding that All South did not have a right to redeem the property. On February 28, 2016, All South filed a postjudgment motion. The trial court entered an order setting aside its summary judgment on May 23, 2016, and setting a hearing to determine the amount required for All South to redeem the property. After a hearing, the trial court entered a judgment on June 23, 2016, providing that All South could redeem the property by paying Ward $4,206.07.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 23, 2016, Ward filed his notice of appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court; that court subsequently transferred the appeal to this court, pursuant to Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 12-2-7(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The undisputed facts indicate that, after All South failed to pay the ad valorem taxes due on the property, the State of Alabama offered the property for sale on\n   May 22, 2012. After no bids were offered, the property was purchased by the State. On August 7, 2015, the State sold the property to Ward. Ward received an ad valorem tax deed; that deed was recorded on August 24, 2015. On August 28, 2015, Ward entered into a three-year lease agreement regarding the property with Brooke Holloway, and, at the time of the entry of the trial court's judgment, Holloway had been in possession of the property since that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Finality\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"Although neither party has questioned the finality of the trial court's judgment in this case, jurisdictional matters, such as the question whether an appeal is supported by a final judgment, are of such importance that this court takes notice of them ex mero motu.\"\n   <em>\n    Eubanks v.

Nevertheless, the June 23, 2016, judgment settled the justiciable controversies between the parties as to whether All South could redeem the property and for what amount, which concluded the matters litigated by the parties. The judgment is final for appellate purposes, even though the trial court did not complete what, under these circumstances, would essentially be an executory duty to enter a judgment for All South for the land upon payment of the redemption amount.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scheve v.

Although further proceedings would have to take place for the trial court to comply with the last step in \u00a7 40-10-83, those proceedings would be only for the purpose of enforcing the June 23, 2016, judgment. \"A judgment that declares the rights of the parties and settles the equities is final even though the trial court envisions further proceedings to effectuate the judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Wyers v.

There shall be no time limit for recovery of real estate by an owner of land who has retained possession. If the owner of land seeking to redeem has retained possession, character of possession need not be actual and peaceful, but may be constructive and scrambling and, where there is no real occupancy of land, constructive possession follows title of the original owner and may only be cut off by adverse possession of the tax purchaser for three years after the purchaser is entitled to possession.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \" 'Section 40-10-82[, Ala.
