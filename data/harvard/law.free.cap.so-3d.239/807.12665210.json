Both guns were released to Frank by Officer David Talley.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before Defendant's trial, the NOPD Public Integrity Bureau (Bureau) commenced an investigation into whether Talley had violated departmental rules and regulations in releasing the guns. The non-9 mm gun was released to Frank pursuant to an order purportedly signed by Judge Morris Reed; however, when shown the order by Bureau investigators, Judge Reed denied that the signature on the order was his, observing that his name was misspelled (\"Reid\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Bureau investigators also inquired into whether the 9 mm gun was released pursuant to a legitimate order signed by\n   Judge Frank Marullo,\n   <em>\n    i.e\n   </em>\n   ., whether Judge Marullo's signature on the release was genuine. Notably, Frank falsely reported the 9 mm gun stolen 10 days before the murders. In late 1998, roughly three years after Defendant and Frank's trials, a 9 mm gun with partial serial numbers, suggesting that it may have been the murder weapon, was found in possession of Frank's brother, Adam Frank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Judge Marullo cooperated with the Bureau's internal investigation of Officer Talley before Defendant's case was assigned to his docket. When initially interviewing Judge Marullo, Bureau investigator Sergeant Robert Harrison presented the release order purportedly bearing Judge Marullo's signature, at which point Judge Marullo \"viewed the document, and compared it to several other documents with his signature,\" before stating that \"he did not believe the court order in question was his signature.\" Judge Marullo explained to Sgt. Harrison that \"[s]ince the court order did not have a description of the weapon to be released, he would not have signed [it].\" From this exchange, Sgt. Harrison opined that the signature had been forged. To support his opinion, Sgt. Harrison again contacted Judge Marullo to secure a recorded statement. Because Defendant's case had been assigned to Judge Marullo, the judge \"would not make a statement ... until the case ha[d] reached its final disposition.\" As a result, the Bureau investigation of Officer Talley remained open through the duration of Defendant's trial and Frank's trial for the purpose of obtaining a statement from Judge Marullo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Judge Marullo did not disclose to the parties in Defendant's case his awareness of the Bureau's internal investigation of Officer Talley or the fact that he had been questioned by Bureau investigators about the release of the guns, even after Defendant filed (early during the course of his trial) a motion to recuse Judge Marullo on other grounds. The information that there was an investigation surfaced during co-defendant Frank's subsequent trial in connection with Officer Talley's testimony about the release of guns from the property room to Frank. When Frank's counsel raised the possibility that Judge Marullo's signature on the order authorizing the gun's release was a forgery, Judge Marullo recessed and held a recorded conference, during which Judge Marullo disclosed that there was a Bureau investigation into the circumstances of the gun's release, including as to the genuineness of his signature. Specifically, Judge Marullo stated that he did not recall signing the order, but that it would have been \"perfectly logical and correct that [he] would [have done] something like that.\" Judge Marullo stated that he had provided samples of his signature to a handwriting expert for comparison and \"they came back and told me that it wasn't my signature.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Judge Marullo also opined that it appeared there had been \"some kind of system in that property room where they were forging names to get guns out of there.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the trials of both Defendant and Frank, Sgt. Harrison contacted Judge Marullo again, at which time the judge declined to comment because the cases\n   \"would be with him for a long time because of appeals.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In response to the Bureau inquiry, Officer Talley acknowledged that he helped Frank obtain a 9 mm gun from the NOPD property room months before the murders; that he had spoken with Frank inside the NOPD gun vault days before the murders about the release of additional weapons, which would have afforded Frank the opportunity to remove another weapon from the vault without his knowledge when he left her alone in the property room; and that he had once before helped Frank obtain another gun from the property room. As to the 9 mm gun at issue, Officer Talley explained to Bureau investigators that he \"brought a court order to Judge Marullo\" to facilitate its release, and \"Judge Marullo's clerk took ... it to the Judge's chambers\" and \"returned with the order signed by [the] Judge.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When Defendant learned that Judge Marullo had been questioned during the Bureau's investigation of Officer Talley, Defendant filed a pro-se application for post-conviction relief, followed by a counseled supplement in May 2010. Defendant alleged that he was denied the right to a fair and impartial tribunal in the trial of his capital case in violation of his federal constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Because this issue was raised by Defendant, Judge Marullo was recused from presiding over the post-conviction proceedings. Thereafter, a judge from a different jurisdiction was appointed to preside over Defendant's request for post-conviction relief. In June 2013, the trial court held an evidentiary hearing at which over 20 witnesses, including Officer Talley and Judge Marullo, testified. Officer Talley again conceded having helped Frank get the 9 mm gun, but maintained he did not forge Judge Marullo's signature. Judge Marullo testified that he recalled being questioned by Bureau investigators, but denied ever signing an order to release the gun, calling it a \"phony\" signature. Judge Marullo testified that he did not recall his statement at the in-chambers conference during Frank's trial in which he indicated he had provided someone with handwriting samples. Finally, Judge Marullo denied that these events caused him to harbor any bias.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On July 23, 2015, the trial court issued a 128-page judgment with reasons in connection with Defendant's petition for post-conviction relief. The trial court rejected Defendant's claim regarding Judge Marullo, observing that this case involves \"a classic example of circumstances and appearances creating an inference unsupported by facts,\" however, it vacated Defendant's conviction and sentence on the basis of a structural defect-a juror was seated after failing to disclose his law enforcement experience. Accordingly, Defendant's request for a new trial was granted. The state filed a writ application with the appellate court, asserting that the trial court abused its discretion in making findings related to the qualifications of a juror, errors the state urged were compounded when the trial court incorrectly applied the law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In an opposition, Defendant urged that the trial court correctly found a structural defect in the seating of the juror in question. He further argued that the other claims before the trial court also had merit. Those claims included one that Defendant \"was tried before a biased tribunal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In a one-page action, Defendant's conviction was reinstated,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    State v.

Additionally, no error was found in the trial court's rejection of Defendant's remaining claims, including his due process claim based on the appearance of bias resulting from Judge Marullo presiding over the trial. This court subsequently denied writs, issuing an opinion finding that the court of appeal correctly reversed the trial court's order for a new trial and reinstated the conviction.\n   <strong>\n    State v. LaCaze\n   </strong>\n   , 16-0234 at 1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12355358\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/208/856/\">\n    208 So.3d at 858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Pertinent here is this court's review of Defendant's due process claim concerning Judge Marullo, which was based on: (1) the allegation that \"NOPD Investigated Judge Marullo as the Source of the 9mm Beretta Murder Weapon During the Pendency of these Proceedings\" and (2) \"Judge Marullo's Involvement in the [Bureau] Investigation Mandated His Recusal.\" In analyzing Defendant's claim, this court noted the presumption of impartiality in favor of a trial judge.\n   <strong>\n    LaCaze\n   </strong>\n   , 16-0234 at 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12355358\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/208/856/\">\n    208 So.3d at 864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

C.Cr.P. art. 671(A)(6) if he \"[w]ould be unable, for any other reason, to conduct a fair and impartial trial,\" this court observed that Article 671\"underscores a judge's duty to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.\"\n   <strong>\n    LaCaze\n   </strong>\n   , 16-0234 at 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12355358\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/208/856/\">\n    208 So.3d at 864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This court further found that Judge Marullo's possible connection to the release of a gun to Frank is insufficient to show that Judge Marullo \"harbored any bias, prejudice, or personal interest in the case, let alone to such an extent that it rendered him unable to conduct a fair trial.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12355358\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/208/856/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   After finding lack of proof of actual bias, this court further found that evidence related to Judge Marullo being questioned in the Bureau's internal investigation of Officer Talley was insufficient to show that Judge Marullo would be unable to conduct a fair trial for some other reason.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    LaCaze\n   </strong>\n   , 16-0234 at 10-11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12355358\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/208/856/\">\n    208 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   864 (citing La.

Defendant's argument that Judge Marullo's initial participation in the internal investigation of Officer Talley caused him to become entangled in the facts at issue in Defendant's case was rejected by this court. The means by which the murder weapon was procured,\n   <em>\n    i.e\n   </em>\n   ., whether Frank had obtained it pursuant to a genuine or \"bogus\" court order, did not pertain to any of the issues at Defendant's trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    LaCaze\n   </strong>\n   , 16-0234 at 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12355358\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/208/856/\">\n    208 So.3d at 864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, this court held that Judge Marullo's possible involvement in the administrative release of a gun did not \"have a tendency to make the existence of any fact of consequence [ ] more or less probable,\" and was thus insufficient to rebut the presumption of impartiality afforded to judges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12355358\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/208/856/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Subsequently, the United States Supreme Court in\n   <strong>\n    Rippo v.

Such a test is inconsistent with the wording of the\n   <strong>\n    Rippo\n   </strong>\n   standard and would render the \"too high to be constitutionally tolerable\" portion of the standard extraneous. Under the standard, proof of any probability of bias alone is insufficient. Notably, the jurisprudence does not indicate that proof of nondisclosure of information giving rise to any probability of bias automatically renders the probability of bias \"too high to be constitutionally tolerable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The jurisprudence reveals that an unconstitutional probability of bias exists when:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \u2022 The judge has a direct, substantial pecuniary interest in the outcome of the defendant's case,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \u2022 the judge's election campaign received exceptionally large financial donations from one of the parties,\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \u2022 the sentencing judge formerly worked as a prosecutor in another case against the defendant and the judge had earlier \"communication, correspondence, and cooperation as a prosecutor\" with the prosecutor in the other case against the defendant,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \u2022 the judge \"presiding at the contempt hearing had also served as the 'one-man grand jury' out of which the contempt charges arose,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \u2022 the judge has made a critical decision (approved of seeking the death penalty) while a former prosecutor in the pending prosecution,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \u2022 the appellate judge presided over the trial of the matter,\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   \u2022 the judge has taken bribes from other criminal defendants,\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   \u2022 the judge has both executive and judicial responsibility in the matter,\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \u2022 the judge was a defendant in prior litigation involving one of the parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   None of these risks is present in the instant case. Judge Marullo did not have a pecuniary interest in Defendant's case. He had no prosecutorial involvement with the Defendant or in this matter. He did not have an unacceptable relationship with Defendant or the prosecutors. He had no reason to fear criminal prosecution in connection with the release of the gun to Frank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Judge Marullo's communication and initial cooperation in the Bureau investigation into how the 9 mm gun was released was not adversarial or accusatory toward Defendant. Significantly, and most importantly, it was Officer Talley, not Judge Marullo, who was the subject of the Bureau's investigation. Contrary to any prior representations to the courts, there is absolutely no evidence in the record that Judge Marullo was under investigation himself for any of these events. Even if Judge Marullo, in fact, signed the order that authorized release of the 9 mm gun to Frank, Judge Marullo did nothing wrong; he was merely performing a ministerial act that he was fully authorized to perform.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The defense's theory at trial was that Defendant did not participate in the homicide, but believed that Frank had planned and committed the murders with her brother, Adam Frank, after obtaining a 9 mm gun from the police property room. In support of this theory, Defendant testified that Frank told Defendant that she expected to get a weapon from the property room. According to Defendant, state law requires Judge Marullo's recusal since he could have been called as a witness at Defendant's trial to corroborate the Defendant's testimony that Frank procured a 9 mm gun from a friend in the NOPD property room to commit the crime. However, Judge Marullo did not have personal knowledge or direct evidence of the actions of Officer Talley or Frank. Judge Marullo is not alleged to have had any direct contact with Officer Talley or Frank in connection with the release of the 9 mm gun. Judge Marullo only knows what he was told by the Bureau investigator and what was visible from the face of the order, which he believes was forged. There is no indication that Judge Marullo heard of Officer Talley's account of the gun release until Officer Talley later appeared and testified at Frank's trial. If, in fact, Judge Marullo did not sign the order, he has no direct knowledge of the release of the 9 mm gun and would not be in a position to corroborate Defendant's testimony. Even if Judge Marullo had personal knowledge of information that might be corroborative, such information is neutral in the sense that it does not aid either party. If at all helpful, it would be more corroborative of the state's \"evidence that his accomplice obtained the same type of gun that was used to kill the victims, in a case in which the state presented evidence that he and Frank had been acting in concert under the guise of her authority and, together, premeditated the murders and were equally\n   culpable.\"\n   <strong>\n    LaCaze\n   </strong>\n   , 16-0234 at 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12355358\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/208/856/\">\n    208 So.3d at 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Although it is possible that the 9 mm gun released from the property room to Frank pursuant to the order purportedly signed by Judge Marullo was used in the murders at the Kim Anh restaurant, that fact has never been definitively established.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   The fact that Frank got a 9 mm gun from the property room does not exculpate Defendant, especially in light of the abundant evidence of his guilt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   That Frank might have once possessed the 9 mm gun that was used to kill Officer Williams and the Vu siblings does not overcome the evidence that showed Defendant was the one who possessed the murder weapon when Officer Williams was shot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    LaCaze\n   </strong>\n   , 99-0584 at 2-4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11442776\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/824/1063/#p1071\">\n    824 So.2d at 1066-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, contrary to Defendant's suggestion, the facts do not indicate that Judge Marullo was trying to conceal the information in question from Defendant during Defendant's trial or that Judge Marullo thought this information would harm or help Defendant's defense.

However, the Supreme Court in\n   <strong>\n    Rippo\n   </strong>\n   did not address the merits of the defendant's\n   due process claim, nor by its ruling did it insinuate that the state court's ultimate ruling on the merits of the defendant's due process claim was incorrect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, there is nothing in the Supreme Court's remand in\n   <strong>\n    LaCaze\n   </strong>\n   that indicates the Court's belief that the circumstances in\n   <strong>\n    Rippo\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    LaCaze\n   </strong>\n   are sufficiently analogous such that the resolution of the judicial disqualification issue would be the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We reject Defendant's claims that \"the probability of actual bias\" is higher in this case than in\n   <strong>\n    Rippo\n   </strong>\n   . Since Defendant's case does not involve an investigation of the presiding judge by the district attorney's office, the investigation in this case does not involve a possible self-interest that could be considered pecuniary for the judge. The fact that the presiding trial judge in\n   <strong>\n    Rippo\n   </strong>\n   disclosed his impermissible conflict during the course of trial does not lessen the probability of bias created by the underlying investigation and related charges in\n   <strong>\n    Rippo\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   While at first blush the fact that Judge Marullo had information about what was potentially the murder weapon might cause an average observer to question him sitting in a capital trial, the circumstances of this case, when carefully examined, do not meet the standard set by the United States Supreme Court in\n   <strong>\n    Rippo\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Before the allotment of Defendant's case, Judge Marullo was questioned during an internal investigation by the NOPD of one of its officers about the authenticity of the signature that appeared on the court order that authorized the release of a 9 mm gun that may have been used in the murders of Officer Williams and the Vu siblings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Once Defendant's case was assigned to Judge Marullo, he appropriately declined any further comment until the case was resolved. Considering the psychological tendencies of the average judge, as we are required to do,\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   we do not find that the pre-allotment questioning of Judge Marullo and his failure to disclose knowledge of such investigation are the sort of rare and extreme circumstances\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   that would cause the average judge to favor one party so as to be objectively suggestive of bias or a \"probability of actual bias.\" Perhaps the average judge in Judge Marullo's position would have harbored some sensitivity about whether his signature was forged. Realistically, the average judge would be vigilant to avoid being unjustly associated with any wrongdoing\n   surrounding the release of the possible murder weapon to Frank. Although the average judge in this position may harbor these sensitivities, it does not follow that the average judge would reasonably harbor any bias for or against Defendant because of these sensitivities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   While we do not find proof of a probability of actual bias has been made by Defendant, we also do not find under the circumstances of this case that the defendant's claims have been proven to be \"too high to be constitutionally tolerable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    Federal Trade Commission v.
