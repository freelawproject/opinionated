R. Crim. P., in which he attacked his capital-murder conviction and sentence of death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2005, Sharifi was convicted of capital murder for the murders of Sarah Kay Smith Sharifi, his estranged wife, and Derrick Brown by one act or pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct. See \u00a7 13A-5-40(a)(10), Ala. Code 1975. By a vote of 10-2, the jury recommended that Sharifi be sentenced to death for his capital-murder conviction. The trial court followed the jury's recommendation and sentenced Sharifi to death. This Court affirmed Sharifi's conviction and death sentence on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Sharifi v.

The facts of Sharifi's crime are set out fully in our opinion in\n   <em>\n    Sharifi v. State\n   </em>\n   and need not be repeated here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 3, 2009, Sharifi filed the instant Rule 32 petition, raising several claims, including claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Sharifi's appellate counsel prepared the petition on Sharifi's behalf, but Sharifi submitted the petition pro se.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 29, 2009, Sharifi filed a pro se amendment to his petition, raising additional claims. In July 2009, Sharifi procured counsel to represent him in the Rule 32 proceedings, and counsel filed a motion for leave to amend the petition. The State then filed a motion requesting that the circuit court set a date for the filing of the amended petition. The circuit court did not rule on either motion, and counsel did not file an amended petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In February 2012, Sharifi procured new counsel to represent him in the proceedings, and in August 2012 that counsel moved for a 90-day enlargement of time in which to amend the petition, which the circuit court granted. Counsel filed an amendment to the petition on November 30, 2012, raising additional claims. The State filed an answer and a motion to dismiss Sharifi's petition and amendments on March 14, 2013. On December 30, 2013, counsel filed a reply to the State's response, a motion for leave to again amend the petition, and an amendment to the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In May 2014, Sharifi once again procured new counsel to represent him in the proceedings, and in September 2014 new counsel filed a motion for an evidentiary hearing. We note that between August 2012 and April 2015, while represented by counsel, Sharifi filed 11 pro se amendments to his petition, numerous pro se motions, and a pro se reply to the State's response. In August 2013, upon motion of the State, the circuit court struck Sharifi's\n   pro se filings received as of that date, with the exception of his initial petition and amendment filed in May 2009, and directed Sharifi to refrain from filing any further pro se pleadings. In December 2014, the circuit court, noting that Sharifi had ignored its August 2013 directive to not file any further pro se pleadings, issued an order directing that any pro so filings by Sharifi be forwarded to his attorney and not be included as part of the official court file. In April 2015, noting that Sharifi had continued to file pro se pleadings since December 2014, the circuit court issued a second order directing that any pro se filings by Sharifi be forwarded to his attorney and not be included as part of the official court file and striking additional pro se pleadings that Sharifi had filed between October 2014 and April 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 26, 2015, the circuit court issued an order denying Sharifi's December 30, 2013, motion for leave to amend his petition; striking all of Sharifi's pro se pleadings filed as of that date with the exception of Sharifi's original petition filed in May 2009 and his pro se amendment also filed in May 2009; and summarily dismissing Sharifi's petition and amendments. Sharifi did not file a postjudgment motion. The circuit court specifically noted in its order that it was considering only Sharifi's original May 2009 petition, the May 2009 pro se amendment, and the 2012 amendment filed by counsel. Therefore, in disposing of this appeal, we do not consider those pro se filings struck by the circuit court. As did the circuit court, we consider only Sharifi's original petition, his May 2009 amendment, and his 2012 amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"[W]hen the facts are undisputed and an appellate court is presented with pure questions of law, that court's review in a Rule 32 proceeding is de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    Ex parte White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499473\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/792/1097/#p1098\">\n    792 So.2d 1097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1098 (Ala.2001). \"However, where there are disputed facts in a postconviction proceeding and the circuit court resolves those disputed facts, '[t]he standard of review on appeal ... is whether the trial judge abused his discretion when he denied the petition.' \"\n   <em>\n    Boyd v.

However, he did not allege that his trial counsel was ineffective for not raising this particular\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim at trial. A substantive claim that the State violated\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   is different than a claim that trial counsel was ineffective for not raising a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim at trial. In its order, the circuit court found that Sharifi's substantive\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim was precluded by Rules 32.2(a)(3) and (a)(5), Ala. R. Crim. P., because it could have been, but was not, raised and addressed at trial and on appeal. In his brief on appeal, Sharifi does not dispute the circuit court's finding. Rather, Sharifi argues that because his substantive\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim was precluded, his trial counsel were ineffective for not having raised it at trial. However, because Sharifi did not raise this specific claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in his petition or amendments, this claim was not properly preserved for review and will not be considered by this Court.

As best we can discern, Sharifi argues that the circuit court was required to accept the allegations in his petition as true and to afford him relief because the State did not\n   file its answer and motion to dismiss within 30 days of the filing of his original petition. Sharifi also appears to argue that, once the State filed its allegedly untimely answer and motion to dismiss and pleaded grounds of preclusion, the circuit court was required to hold a hearing on the State's answer and motion to dismiss to allow him to present evidence and argument to disprove the preclusions asserted by the State. Sharifi maintains that because the circuit court did not hold a hearing on the State's answer and motion to dismiss, he \"was not given ample notice to formulate arguments and to present evidence to disprove the existence of any ground of preclusion.\" (Sharifi's brief, p. 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Neither of these arguments was presented to the circuit court by written objection, in Sharifi's reply to the State's answer and motion to dismiss, or in a timely postjudgment motion.
