As a result thereof, Defendant filed a \"Motion and Order to Reopen a Pending Motion to Correct an Illegal Sentence\" on May 24, 2016. The matter was set for hearing on June 21, 2016.

Absent a legislative implementation of\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   court drew upon other enactments to establish a procedure until the legislature could act. Similarly, although the Legislature was unable to enact legislation during the 2016 Regular Session, it has provided general sentencing guidelines in La.C.Cr.P. art. 894.1, which the District Court may deem relevant in accordance with La.C.Cr.P. art. 878.1(B). Other states have also legislatively implemented\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   . For example, Florida has enumerated the following factors to be considered in sentencing a juvenile to life imprisonment:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (a) The nature and circumstances of the offense committed by the defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (b) The effect of the crime on the victim's family and on the community.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (c) The defendant's age, maturity, intellectual capacity, and mental and emotional health at the time of the offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (d) The defendant's background, including his or her family, home, and community environment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (e) The effect, if any, of immaturity, impetuosity, or failure to appreciate risks and consequences on the defendant's participation in the offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (f) The extent of the defendant's participation in the offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (g) The effect, if any, of familial pressure or peer pressure on the defendant's actions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (h) The nature and extent of the defendant's prior criminal history.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (i) The effect, if any, of characteristics attributable to the defendant's youth on the defendant's judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (j) The possibility of rehabilitating the defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20921.1401\">\n    Fla.

Finally, the District Court must also be mindful of the Supreme Court's directive in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. at 2469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"to take into account how children are different, and how those differences counsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in prison.\" In making its ultimate determination regarding parole eligibility, the District Court is further directed to issue reasons indicating the factors it considered to aid in appellate review of the sentence imposed after resentencing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendant argues the Louisiana Legislature has consistently failed to enact penalty statutes that satisfy the directives in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    567 U.S. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant points out there has been no amendment to the second degree murder statute, and that statute mandates a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole without reference to age. Defendant contends that because La.R.S. 14:30.1 has not been amended, there is no statute under which a valid sentence for second degree murder can be imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Rather than amending La.R.S. 14:30.1, the Louisiana Legislature enacted La.R.S. 15:574.4(E) and La.Code Crim.P. art. 878.1 in 2013, the year after the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   decision. Louisiana Revised Statutes 15:574(E) was amended in 2017 to reduce parole eligibility time from thirty-five to twenty-five years imprisonment. However, Defendant contends that the addition of parole eligibility and access to the Parole Board after twenty-five years is not the equivalent of a meaningful opportunity for release from incarceration and does not satisfy\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   . Further, the Louisiana Supreme Court has deprived juveniles of the proportionality review mandated in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   by delegating the \"sentencing choice\" to the Parole Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendant claims the Louisiana Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793142\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/194/606/\">\n    194 So.3d 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , said the only issue to be resolved in a\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   hearing was whether the inmate would be granted or denied parole eligibility, which he alleges is a finding the United States Supreme Court did not make in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    567 U.S. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He further argues the Louisiana Supreme Court created substantive law when it set forth \"sentencing possibilities\" in\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793142\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/194/606/\">\n    194 So.3d 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which were not and have not been authorized by the legislature. Defendant alleges the legislature's power to set forth possible sentencing choices cannot be delegated even when it fails to act. Thus, Defendant argues any interim rules created by the Louisiana Supreme Court are unenforceable because they were created without authority. Defendant asserts the sentencing scheme set forth in\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   allows for disproportionate sentencing by a non-juridical entity in conflict with\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    567 U.S. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , thereby depriving him of due process.

In that case, the Louisiana Supreme Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   One of the traditional, inherent and exclusive powers of the judiciary is the power to sentence.\n   <em>\n    State v. LeCompte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9612038\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/406/1300/#p1311\">\n    406 So.2d 1300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1311 (La.1981) (on rehearing).

However, the trial judge's sentencing discretion is not unbridled, as the legislative branch of government is free to decide what constitutes a crime as well as \"what punishments shall be meted out by a court after the judicial ascertainment of guilt.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

The determination and imposition of sentence in particular cases is generally the function of the sentencing court, subject to appellate review and to mandatory sentences provided by law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Further, La.Const art. 2, \u00a7 2 specifies the judicial branch is prohibited from exercising the power assigned to the legislative branch. Defendant contends that \"Louisiana's failure to act\" resulted in a violation of his due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendant argues because no legal sentence is set out in La.R.S. 14:30.1 and the legislature has failed to act, he should have been resentenced to the next lesser included responsive verdict of manslaughter. Thus, Defendant asserts the appropriate action would have been to follow the decision in\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   , the defendant had been convicted of aggravated rape, which carried a mandatory sentence of death. The Louisiana Supreme Court held that, since the mandatory death penalty for first degree murder had been found unconstitutional in\n   <em>\n    Roberts v. Louisiana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177727\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/428/325/\">\n    428 U.S. 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177727\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/428/325/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 3001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177727\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/428/325/\">\n    49 L.Ed.2d 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976), the mandatory death penalty for aggravated rape was likewise unconstitutional. At the time the rape was committed, the legislature had abrogated the responsive verdict of guilty without capital punishment. Therefore, the appropriate remedy to correct the defendant's illegal sentence was to remand for resentencing to the most serious penalty for the next lesser responsive verdict, simple rape. Defendant acknowledges a similar argument was rejected by the Louisiana Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    State v. Shaffer\n   </em>\n   , 11-1756 (La. 11/23/11),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7027448\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/77/939/\">\n    77 So.3d 939\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

One\n   defendant had been sentenced to life imprisonment with an express restriction against parole eligibility. The two others had received life sentences without express restrictions on parole eligibility.
